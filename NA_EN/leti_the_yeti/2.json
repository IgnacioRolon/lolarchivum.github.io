Normally, this would be enough to win you the game- but no, it isn't. Because the enemy Tryndamere has been split pushing all game long and just took an inhib while you were busy fighting. Which means you can't push off of your win, because now you and your team are locked inside your base for the next 4 minutes while the inhib respawns. If you ignore it, the super creeps kill your nexus. And during that time, the enemy team has free reign of the map, which leads to more towers/inhibs dropping because you just can't stop them.

It's a strategy that either forces the enemy team to split up and send someone to defend, or the team gets objectives while turtling. In a team game, you have to use tactics and work together. You don't have to be grouped up all the time to get things done, and sometimes you have to trust one another. Using strategy and trusting one another IS part of a team game. If someone just goes off willy-nilly to split-push, then that's selfish. But if the team decides it's a good idea, then there's nothing wrong with it. \n\nA team that's behind has a lower chance of winning a teamfight than the one ahead (assuming team comp has roughly the same synergy), so it's not always wise to force one. \n\nAnd Baron buff is pretty much designed to hammer through a team turtling, so you can do it forever :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-02-13T23:46:49.641+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Personally I don't like split pushers because its not as fun.

If you don't think your team can handle it the split push is not necessarily a good idea.\n\nThe split push can be considered in several ways:\n\n1: A top laner with teleport can easily rejoin a fight which starts at the opposite side of the map. This is a big reason why we see teleport so often.\n\n2: A player with a lot of dueling potential requires at least two players to take down. If they send two players then the other lane is a 4v3, but if they don't send anyone the split pusher takes objectives.\n\nWhether split pushing is a good idea or not mostly depends on team comp and player skill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MidEvilKnight3k","date":"2015-02-14T14:45:37.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are multiple problems when trying to split push in low elo games.  The idea of split pushing (as many have said) is to have one player (like Udyr) who can 1v1 anyone on the other team split from the team and push some objectives while the rest of the team tries to not have a team fight.  For this to work the rest of the team has to give enough pressure that the opposing team can't just use the whole team to collapse on the split pusher and kill him.  But they also need to be able to disengage fights.\n\n1. Most low elo teams don't know how occupy the other team with the remaining 4 players while also avoiding a fight.  The result is either the opposing team collapses on the split pusher and kills him or there is a teamfight without the split pusher.\n\n2. Many low elo split pushers will try to split push when it is impossible for the 4 remaining players to occupy the other team and avoid a teamfight (they have poor disengage and/or the opponents have really good engage).  The result is the same as the previous reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2015-02-14T08:06:29.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nooby question,Does AR-pen apply on turrets?","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-02-14T08:22:17.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it does not","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Bang Bob","date":"2015-02-14T05:11:54.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you can't teleport in a teamfight while simultaneously saving their adc and locking down 3 people at once. {{champion:98}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"M Schumacher","date":"2015-02-13T23:08:43.277+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Scrubs hate split pushing because they don't know how to react to it and get butthurt when they lose a game while being ahead 20 kills.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-02-14T01:11:50.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^\n\nI once won a game against a team who started forcing teamfights at 10 minutes in.

If THEY make it and you pop down their objectives, you carried them. If they DON'T make it, and lose that 4v5, they're a bunch of scrubs as far as the splitpusher is concerned, much like it's a lose-lose for the enemy team, it's a lose-lose for the allied team, it's one of the worst feelings ever.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeriouslyUnnamed","date":"2016-10-31T10:50:24.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I though i would add my two cents.\n\nCan your team hold its own 4v5?
