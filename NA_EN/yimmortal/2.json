Sejuani and amumu deal more damage mid-late by far with some magic penetration, gromp and cinderhulk.  Shyvana is another example of a tanky champion that also deal a lot of damage. What you looking at is the burst Lee Sin few spell have, and assume that his overall damage output is that great. In teamfights, mid-late game, tank jungler out damage him, out CC him, his \"incredible peel\" is nothing to all the CC of above champion and most tanks (nautilus, sion, cho'gath, zac, etc). You could even go tank Vi and have more damage and CC and Peel and Shield then Lee.\n \n> Nidalee is a carry, she lacks the utility lee sin possesses.\n> Reksai lacks his.mobility and damage and has lee peeling ability.\n> Suggestimg reksai is better is silly\n\nLee Sin is also a Carry oriented jungler, at least early game. Nidalee lack direct flashy utility, but her heal and AS buff is pretty good for the adc, her traps are nice for vision control, on top of her siegeing power.\nRek'Sai already has enough mobility, more wouldnt really benefit her much. a good Rek'Sai knockup is so much easier to land then a good Lee Sin kick. Dont forget Rek'Sai also can easily travel the map to contest objectives, reinforce roams, push objectives, splitpush, escape, w/e you want from it fast travel really. Dont forget also more vision control from the tremor sense passive, which is very strong at all stage of the game. On top of that, a lot of early damage, from an auto-reset that deals AoE, true damage bite, skill shot poke and of course unborrow. Rek'Sai is more often then otherwise a better champion choice.\n\nI'm not saying Lee Sin is bad, he is still Lee Sin. He is just far from being the best jungler choice out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chessburger","date":"2015-03-25T00:50:36.158+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rek'sai is definitely better.

No.\nIs he overcentralizing? Yes.\nDoes he need a rework? Not for what people think.\n\nOh, but I do thank you for \"teaching\" me something with your superior rank.\nIt was truly enlightening.

Nothing. Zero. Nada. When is a Lee Sin invade going to happen, and likely result in a kill? On the first clear. He clears his first buff faster than you, meets you at your second, kills you, and takes it. I've had it happen to me a dozen times. I've done it myself as Lee a dozen times. Jungle tank meta changes nothing for Lee Sin, in fact, it makes his early invades that much more potent than say they normally would be against an Udyr or Yi or virtually anyone who might actually have a fair shot at fighting back. \n\nLee Sin is still relevant.
