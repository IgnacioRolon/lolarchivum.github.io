I have no idea how to play her effectively and how her mains do the things they do. It seems if i build her damage I die before I can do anything and if I tank I am only good for a mediocre knockup every few seconds and bruiser well, not really good for anything. If it wasn&#039;t for her popularity in the pro scenes I would think she is trash tier after all the nerfs. Do you have a champion you can&#039;t play well and have no idea how other people do it? People who main that champion feel free to leave tips.","replies":[]}
