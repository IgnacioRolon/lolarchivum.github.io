Therefore, I think its time to add a fifth bar to a champion&#039;s attributes in addition to attack power, defense power, ability power, and difficulty. \n\nFor instance, Kalista, Leblanc, Kassadin and Udyr would be 10, Yi would be 8, Sion 5,  Ashe and Lux 2, Malzahar 1.\n\nThoughts?\n\nedit: okay maybe I was biased about Udyr.. is 7 better?\n\nand this:\nOne way we can measure it is through a point system.\n\nFor instance,\ngap closers get 2 points\nmovespeed boots get 1 point x duration\nteleport/ abilities that lets you get past walls get 3 points\nglobal abilities get 4 points\n\nMaster yi would get 2 points for his gapcloser, 3 points becuase his q can be used to get past walls but its not reliable so -1 points and he also gets a rather long lasting ult so 4 points for that for a grand total of 8 points.\n\nThis is just one hypothetical way of measuring it.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Laraso","date":"2015-04-29T02:49:57.051+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":1,"body":"While we're at it, add a \"Disruption\" or \"Crowd Control\" attribute.\n\n{{champion:82}} : 0\n{{champion:127}} : 7\n{{champion:111}} : 11","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2015-04-29T04:46:43.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":17,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"iamthegoatofwar","date":"2015-04-29T06:49:16.481+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"no naut has one of the longest CC chains in the game (longer than leonas?)","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2015-04-29T11:55:10.492+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Naut has more CC but not an epic CC chain like Leona's.

How difficult a champion is to play is also relatively quantifiable. Does a champion need fast reflexes? Do they need to have above average positional awareness? Do they take a while to get up and running? Are their skills easy to understand or require a more advanced knowledge of the game?\n\nSomeone like Singed is a ridiculously easy champion to understand, is tanky, fast(due to being melee), and has the ability to hamper anyone chasing him, which makes him a rather easy champion to play and understand. A champions difficulty also doesn't change based on which items are buffed/nerfed, or whether the champion has skills buffed/nerfed.\n\nCompare that to Elise. She has 7 skills + a passive to understand. They become powerful when using them in combo's, rather than by itself. It's very plain that Singed is a far easier champion to play/understand than a champion like Elise.\n\nAll of those things, and more, can be used to quantify a (albeit archaic) difficulty score. You can't quantify a mobility attribute because the game is different from match to match. 1 match you may get a lot of attack speed, so Kalista becomes one of the most mobile champions in the game. Another match, you might not get as fed/farmed and only purchase flat damage items like IE, BT, LW, and hence not be as mobile as other champions.\n\nThere's also the fact that runes/masteries would change how \"mobile\" a champion is. CDR runes, movement speed runes, and ditto for masteries. Is this mobility attribute going to be calculated on a player by player, rune page by rune page, mastery page by master page, basis? That's a lot of processing power just for an attribute that people usually wont even look at in the first place. People already inherently understand champions without looking at their specific attributes. Riven is already a very mobile champion. We don't need an attribute to see that, since we can't just look at the champion using their skills to understand it.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-04-29T08:32:42.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats why it should be the amount of mobility in your kit \nnot the amount of mobility you actualy output in-game\n\njust as with dificulty the current ballance is not taken into account, but how dificult is your kit to use at its max potential","replies":[{"poster":"PubgamerAU","date":"2015-04-29T11:24:29.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you would have an unchanging attribute in game that provides no real information because items/runes/masteries can change how a champion is played in their entirety?\n\nWhat use would that serve?

The real difference is in the hard cap.  The cap on attack speed is a hard 2.5, but reaching that cap with percentage increases depends on your base attack speed and growth, whereas the cap on cooldown reduction is simply a flat 40%, easily reached with two items.\n\nAs to the idea of a mobility stat, gap closers themselves are not strictly mobility.  You could artificially adjust for them to give a champion a little boost, but they are completely useless in moving around the map or running away from someone except in very fringe cases.  A champion's mobility is how long it takes for them to get from point A to point B, using whatever means they have at their disposal.","replies":[{"poster":"PubgamerAU","date":"2015-04-29T11:21:19.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Once again: CDR plays a huge role in whether a champion goes from point A to point B in 10 seconds or 6.\n\nNow lets assume that this magical system of yours somehow calculates a champions mobility attribute on the fly as a game progresses and they buy items/level up skills.
