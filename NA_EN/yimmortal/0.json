When finally catch up, he kicks me back half a screen with his click and point no counterplay ult. By the time I catch him again all his low cooldown spells are up again and his gay homeboys are there to back him up. But hey, we can't nerf Lee Sin any further because he is balanced and  muh skillshots and muh lategame give him a meaningful weakness so it's none of my business.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-01-20T10:21:00.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why were you chasing a Lee that hard to begin with?","replies":[{"poster":"Cenobite Azaziel","date":"2015-01-20T10:36:27.112+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CynicalGiant,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dw6QQkBX,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-20T10:21:00.512+0000)\n>\n> Why were you chasing a Lee that hard to begin with?\n\nProbably to kill him, get some gold and his red back.\nLee can Q, can W, burn flash and if all fails kick you away.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raja Chachki","date":"2015-01-20T15:00:26.308+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"gay homeboys\"\nnice insult, what are you, 12?","replies":[{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2015-01-20T17:47:20.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was my favorite part.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-01-20T03:20:23.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who were you playing as?","replies":[{"poster":"Yimmortal","date":"2015-01-20T03:23:40.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UberAffe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dw6QQkBX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-20T03:20:23.788+0000)\n>\n> Who were you playing as?\n\nmy name isnt obvious enough?","replies":[{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2015-01-20T04:26:19.591+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"# buffYi2015\nobvious{{champion:64}} nerf too","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-01-20T22:02:45.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ward over the wall or Skirmisher's smite him before he jumped so you have vision, then follow him over it with Alpha Strike.
