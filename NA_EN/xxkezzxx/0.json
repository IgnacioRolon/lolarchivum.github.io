I pay attention for those notices to come up when a player I reported is suspended. After that game, I was a bit tilted, and was raging hard at my friends and decided that was enough league for the day, or else I was going to turn exceptionally toxic in chats. \r\n\r\nThat said, here is the logs of the game I was suspended for, with inbetween context added for reader&#039;s to understand the situation;\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This part was due to Kindred marking me at the start of the game.\r\nXxKezzxX: LOLKINDRED\r\nXxKezzxX: YOUTHINKSO?!\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kindred had Gromp marked, I told her to take it because I wasn&#039;t going to get it, and she was right there.\r\nXxKezzxX: Jinx, take gromp\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I was informing the other lanes Kindred was top, so they could do what they do in peace without worrying where she was. Our top laner then snapped at me that he &quot;realized that because she was standing in his lane.&quot; I made a snarky comment, sure, but nothing too toxic here.\r\nXxKezzxX: Kindred top\r\nXxKezzxX: I mean, I was telling the other 2 lanes\r\nXxKezzxX: but you&#039;re welcome :)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We won a pretty decent team fight here, self explanatory I was picking my team up given it had been an overall bad match.\r\nXxKezzxX: GJ\r\nXxKezzxX: :D\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is where I started to lose my cool, not going to lie. Our top and mid laner had been harassing me pretty much all game, even from champ select, saying &quot;F you, stupid ashe&quot; things like that. Then they started talking in, what I assumed, was Chinese, so me, trying to keep my cool a bit, playfully said &quot;ching chong, bing bong&quot; in reference to that old school meme. This was probably my most negative thing this match, but let&#039;s face it, we&#039;ve all seen worse through out the rift, and those people were never suspended. Am I going to pretend that this was okay? No, but to deserve an instant 14 day ban for this 1 game? No. A warning message upon logging into my account would have been just as effective.\r\nXxKezzxX: Kindred top side\r\nXxKezzxX: ching chong, bing bong\r\nXxKezzxX: DIS IS MURICA\r\nXxKezzxX: I mean, they&#039;re speaking chinese on NA servers, and I felt left out, so all I said was &quot;ching chong, bing bong&quot;\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- At this point our top laner was going off on me, saying I was bad, so my snarky comment of a 0-2-0 Gnar getting decimated by Garen in kills and CS. I was ashe jungle and he had lower CS than I did, that&#039;s how bad it was (although I kept up with Kindred, so Ashe jungle new meta?)\r\nXxKezzxX: I mean, you&#039;re losing to a garen as gnar xD\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is where it gets interesting. The Gnar started spamming his ping like crazy, and was constantly 350-400. So I made the comment to go back to China, as in Chinese LoL (in reference to them speaking a foreign language earlier, and I see A LOT of people in China playing on NA servers), to fix his ping. The intent was NOT meant to be racist in the slightest. Out of context, I can see how that could be taken wrong, but the person knew what I meant, as they did follow up with &quot;I am in us.&quot; This is where I started getting passive aggressive and just wanted the match to end, to the point I agreed to the surrender. I knew I was getting annoyed and just wanted to move on to another game. However, to prove my point that there was no malicious intent, I did say, at the end, &quot;If you were in the US, you wouldn&#039;t be saying &quot;I am in us&quot; you would be saying &quot;I am in the US.&quot; Like a proper murican.&quot;\r\nXxKezzxX: Go back to china\r\nXxKezzxX: Go back to chinese servers then\r\nXxKezzxX: Cause you&#039;re not in the US, you&#039;re in China\r\nXxKezzxX: If you were in the US, you wouldn&#039;t be saying &quot;I am in us&quot; you would be saying &quot;I am in the US.&quot;\r\nXxKezzxX: Like a proper murican.\r\nXxKezzxX: gg\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis game was the entirety of the reason I was banned, at least I assume that&#039;s the case because it was the only game listed in the suspension notice. So, now that we got that out of the way, I appealed to Riot support to at least look at the game, in context. This is the response I got; \r\n\r\n Hello XxKezzxX,\r\n\r\nI know that our disciplinary system is a bit confusing to wrap your head around because we don&#039;t do the best communicating that with you the players but we do our best to do so. Also it takes multiple reports and a consistent record of unsportsmanlike conduct to get penalized. Please know that we do have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to negativity and hate/speech on the fields of justice and the remarks that you made although taken out of context still cannot be overlooked. In the future i would just obstain from making remarks like that just to avoid possible future penalties, i know you were just having fun but that may not have been percieved by you&#039;re teammates on their end of the monitor.\r\n\r\nAgain i just want to state i reviewed you&#039;re prior logs and you aren&#039;t overtly negative but you do spam the chat and some people may see that as unconstructive and disruptive to the flow of the game.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to take pro-active measures to prevent yourself from escalating you&#039;re future penalties as well. We provide tools like the mute function, ping system and the new emote system we implemented recently. We don&#039;t want your future penalties to increase due to lack of knowledge and not using all the tools we provide to prevent such things from escalating.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.) Also it takes multiple reports and a consistent record of unsportsmanlike conduct to get penalized. - If this is the case, would it not show that multiple games were a cause for my suspension? Or am I missing something entirely here?\r\n\r\n2.A)&quot;....and the remarks that you made although taken out of context still cannot be overlooked.&quot; - So are you now telling me if I tell a Karthus &quot;Kill yourself&quot; in game chat, so he can cast his ult for free, this can be taken out of context, and because it cannot be overlooked, I can be suspended/banned for it, even though I was literally trying to help my teammate? Even the employee them self is admitting the auto ban system took it out of context.\r\n\r\n2.B) Again i just want to state i reviewed you&#039;re prior logs and you aren&#039;t overtly negative but you do spam the chat and some people may see that as unconstructive and disruptive to the flow of the game. - Your employee is even saying here they looked at the logs and saw nothing wrong aside from spamming the chat. So not only do we have the auto ban system taking things out of context to ban, but when the context is added, and an employee has deemed that they weren&#039;t negative, I&#039;m still receiving a suspension.\r\n\r\n3.) As a &quot;Grammar Nazi,&quot; can your staff please use proper grammar when they send an e-mail to me explaining why you won&#039;t revert the suspension, even though your e-mail is filled with contradictions? Lack of commas, &quot;abstain&quot; being misspelled, you&#039;re being used in place of your, it&#039;s rather insulting to my intelligence. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-04-11T01:08:30.777+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"It looks like the support agent actually missed out on a pretty big issue:\n\n>XxKezzxX: ching chong, bing bong\n\n^This is pretty damn racist, and Riot comes down *hard* on racism.
