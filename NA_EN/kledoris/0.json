He didn't have any money. I called him to ask him to get some money so I can buy camille. He said he might do it today. I played like 5 matches, trying to buy rp after each one. I got a 24h purchasing ban. Is there any way to get rid of it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-15T03:28:06.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Wolfess* is correct, the 24-hour timeout period is simply a security measure. You should have no further issues purchasing RP after waiting another 24 hours before your next **attempt** at making that purchase.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-12-14T06:27:13.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just be patient and wait the 24 hours, and next time make sure the funds are there before making the purchase. Making purchases on cards with no balance, especially debit cards with no overdraft protection, can get you into a big mess.","replies":[]}]}
