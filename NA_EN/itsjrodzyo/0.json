I really like kindred&#039;s mechanics and it is a really fun champion to play. However, I see a problem with the Q. I&#039;m not sure if this was intended or not, but the damage from the q does not prioritize enemy champions over minions. I would sometimes get no damage off on the enemy because 3 minions would be closer to me. Maybe it is a tradeoff for having mobility with the Q. I&#039;m not sure. I just wanted to bring this to attention in case it was not intended to be this way.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-16T05:27:01.211+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's intended that Kindred's Q does not automatically prioritize champions, we don't want to make the spell auto optimize itself each cast to that degree.  It will however prioritize the target of Kindred's last auto attack, so if there's a particular enemy you really want to hit you have the option of doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"N0rth Wind","date":"2015-09-16T06:01:42.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it intentional that their skills, as well as other factors (heals) are non-scaling or have a very small scaling?\nIs Kindred's Mark intended as their main source of damage output, and Q/W (and E as well) basically play off of that?\n\nAlso, why is the ulti so different than the rest of the kit? A large AoE antideath ulti is the last thing I'd expect on a hunter jungle marksman. It's not bad, It's just weird, and doesn't directly interact with the rest of the kit. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-16T07:36:49.981+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's intended that Kindred will be reliant on Mark of the Kindred for a significant amount of their damage, later on in the game in particular.\n\nThe ult's there in part to give a baseline contribution that's independent of how farmed Kindred is or isn't. It's also a way of allowing a squishy, short ranged sustained damage dealer to take risks without that being a completely terrible idea. On top of that it's a way to distinguish Kindred from other moderately similar characters (farm junglers and other short ranged mobile ADCs). It also doubles down on the power within a specific area concept that the W also presents.","replies":[{"poster":"N0rth Wind","date":"2015-09-16T08:12:15.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see. So Kindred will specialize in shredding (in contrast to nuking) enemies, as well as high mobility, damage and utility, but in a very specific area (since Q is most efficient inside the Wolf's hunting grounds, and as you said stacking R on top of W at the right time has obvious benefits). :D\n\n* I haven't tested them yet, but I really like the idea of having a tool which allows you to fight the enemy team even if they're ahead, as you have 4 seconds to bring them to 10%. After the ult ends, you're all at extremely low HP so you can outplay them from there, instead of having to deal with their superior stats _and _ having to outplay them.\n[_**I have to note that I also love the thematic implication** -- the Lamb delays Death for 4 seconds, but Death inevitably comes and brings utter carnage immediately afterwards. The Lamb/Wolf, life/death interaction is simply ingenious, I can ponder on it for hours._]\n* The mark + gank (or non-gank) strategy will surely give people heart attacks, the mindgames will be excruciating for both teams. <3\n* Also I like how they have a relatively tank-busty identity that's however different from that of the other tankbusters such as Fiora, Yi or Yasuo.\n\nI don't want to take advantage of your time here but it's the first time I get to speak with a Rioter directly-- so speaking of Yasuo, yesterday I created a [discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gNteWA6z-kindly-requesting-rioter-reply-does-riot-plan-to-make-any-changes-to-yasuo) about him and I would be grateful if a Rioter could put a moment of his time to read it and reply.\nIt got kind of buried under the Kindred \"wow\" and \"ew\" posts.
