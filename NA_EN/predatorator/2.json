So i&#039;d like to know how does it feel to play him when his team is actually loosing, when he doesn&#039;t have any access to his buffs? \r\n3) i&#039;m not really convinced on this one, but may it be a nice idea to build both TF and BC on him? i know you&#039;re gonna loose gold because the rage passive doesn&#039;t stack, but apart from this, it seems nice to still have the HPs, armor shred and 20% CD. \r\nSorry for my bad english, and thank You for Your attention!","replies":[{"poster":"Trebbi","date":"2015-08-18T10:53:39.577+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have only tested his initial clears on the PBE, because I live in EU so I hate playing PvP at 200 ping so sorry I cant be more of help, but here is what I think.\n\nI think that he will favor having Steraks Gage(helps your sheen to do more dmg and skarner shield scales with HP) + Trinity force because it increases his already big base AD and he uses all the stats of Trinity force pretty well. Or you could go iceborn gauntlet and black cleaver as he still has some AP scaling, but I think you dont need much mana because of the spires.\n\nhis Q is 2,5 seconds with 0,25 second reduction per auto attack, which means you will get many sheen procs without building much CDR, so perhaps attack speed runes might be good.\n\nSo I guess you might want cinderhulk, Deadmans plate and an MR item and I think your kinda sorted.","replies":[{"poster":"Predatorator","date":"2015-08-18T11:22:54.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank You =). i'm starting to like steraks on skarner, because of the above mentioned reasons, and i'll try to pair it with a TF in as many games as possible, at least when a bruiser build is possible. i used to build IBG and BC toghether in my tank build, and i'll probably do that even after the rework. same with cinderhulk, though i'm tempted to switch devourer with warrior. so my build should look like: \nBruiser: TF, warrior/devourer,mercs,deadman's,SV,steraks \nTank: IBG,cinderhulk,mercs,deadman's,Banshee's,BC \nThank You again  =)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-18T17:34:26.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> should i use AD marks, Arm Pen marks, or keep the AS marks for faster clears and faster Qs outside the shrines?\n\nI personally think AD marks give him the most, but I've also had a high Diamond Skarner main tell me that both AD and AS will be viable.\n\n> So i'd like to know how does it feel to play him when his team is actually loosing, when he doesn't have any access to his buffs?\n\nHe'll most likely fall back into tank-ish patterns in these cases, trying to stun as many people with his E and Flash R when that's an option. His damage will definitely be lower here, though.\n\n> i'm not really convinced on this one, but may it be a nice idea to build both TF and BC on him?\n\nWe've found that if you get ahead, going Black Cleaver, Sterak's, and TF actually leaves him pretty effective, though I imagine in games where you don't get off to a great start, just choosing your preference of one or two of these works just fine. One of the things that makes BC even better than before is that he procs physical damage more frequently, so he stacks the passive faster.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2015-08-18T18:12:34.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vLr3ZyF3,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-18T17:34:26.775+0000)\n>\n> I personally think AD marks give him the most, but I've also had a high Diamond Skarner main tell me that both AD and AS will be viable.\n> \n> He'll most likely fall back into tank-ish patterns in these cases, trying to stun as many people with his E and Flash R when that's an option.

It allows you to reach the break point where your Q does about as much damage as it does currently (60 base physical and magic damage at 135 AD) and from there on your Q will get stronger as you gain levels.  After that I think Dead Man's Plate would be good (it solves your kiting issue and provides quick tank stats).  The downside to this build is a late Sheen item (won't have Sheen until you begin building your 3rd item).\n\nI feel that Sheen will only work well early when you are snowballing, but I could be wrong.  He needs early AD and HP in order to have reasonable Q damage and shielding from W (which looks as though it will be a one point wonder ability now).","replies":[{"poster":"Predatorator","date":"2015-08-19T11:22:52.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank You. i'm looking at warrior in my bruiser build for skarner, since devourer seems a little bit less appealing. early on i use to build enchanted smite, sheen and mercs, because of the passive and mana, but i may try to switch it for a phage, for better sticking power, ad, and hp. however, i use to build IBG asap because having those stats early helps alot, and the TF as fifth item. i can confirm, W looks more like a 1 point wonder now =)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-08-18T12:03:32.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's my 2 cents from the time I spent testing {{champion:72}} on the PBE\n\n1) Skar Skar actually has a lot more attack speed within his crystal zones, and that's pretty much guaranteed to happen on a large part of your clear, but otherwise yeah, he's a bit lacking in that in zones not under his control. I'd definitely recommend AD marks, since he now scales super-well with AD even at the start, and they'll make more of an impact both while clearing and while ganking early on, where you won't be autoattacking enough to really validate AS marks.\n\n2) Skarner suffers a bit more than the average jungler when his team loses control of the jungle, since he needs to jump through the additional hoop of capturing a crystal to be able to be effective, but it's still possible to stealthily capture crystals and become an absolute beast when the enemy team collapses on you. Baron and Dragon control become significantly more difficult, though, and Skarner's not really the best at stealing objectives or contesting them from the losing side.\n\n3) I personally prefer {{item:3025}} over {{item:3078}}, as it offers better sticking power, CDR and defensive stats, and doesn't really waste its passives. You're going to be picking items like Sterak's Gage and {{item:3071}} on the side anyway, so you'll have more than enough overall damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Predatorator","date":"2015-08-19T11:27:17.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank You =), i'm going to use AD runes then. i'm more a fan of TF, because it makes you faster and more offensive-oriented. i'll try both the builds however. i'm a bit concerned about his \"left behind\" scenario, but yeah, can't wait to test him out =)","replies":[]}]}]}
