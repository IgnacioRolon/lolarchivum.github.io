When it comes to immobile, damage focused mages, Xerath is the one who comes in my mind. He&#039;s been my go-to midlaner for almost 2 years, and i still really enjoy him. I find him to be in a decently balanced spot, maybe a little on the strong side, especially after laning phase, where with accurate positioning and self-awareness, he can just nuke the teamfight with his powerful AoEs.\r\n\r\nSo to begin, here&#039;s my opinion on him. His spells almost define his identity as a magic sniper: \r\nhis passive rewards for getting closer to the enemy, by overcoming his high manacosts, and gives to said enemy the opportunity to engage him. However, generally it looses relevance as the laning phase ends, because then Xerath needs to stay at distance, behind the the backlines, and there&#039;s not much he can hit with his aas. Xerath is a being of pure energy, so it&#039;s fine that he has a way to self-supply. How it works looks so gated however, but it&#039;s for the sake of game balance, so overall it&#039;s ok; \r\n\r\nArcanopulse (Q) is his most distinctive spell, his &quot;bread and butter&quot;: it allows him to farm or hit then enemy champions when zoned. Reaching full range takes time and slows him down (and you can&#039;t cast other spells while charging), making positioning essential, or else enemies can reach you easily and well...you know what happens. It&#039;s also telegraphed, with a short dealy, so you can&#039;t just shoot it on top of the chmapion, and pretend it hits him. These and high mana costs usually prevent Xerath to spam Qs early on, unless he has easy access to his passive. It refunds part of its manacost if not casted, so you can choose to not cast it if enemies get away somehow. Second best-looking laser of league, beaten only by Vel&#039;Koz&#039;s, the sound and charging animation makes it look powerful as it is, fits perfectly Xerath&#039;s nature.\r\nI personally wish it could be more effective when hitting single targets, rather than multiple ones. But i think people have strong feelings for his waveclear, which has always been good; \r\n\r\nEye of Destruction (W) helps keeping the enemies at bay, helps hitting with Q, E, or R, gives vision, and feels so satisfying to hit in its center. Also a blast of energy coming from the sky and exploding on the ground fits with Xerath&#039;s nature. Works fine to me; \r\n\r\nShocking Orb (E) is Xerath&#039;s first line of protection from nearby threats, and sometimes can be used as an offensive tool. I find it to highlight alot Xerath strenghts and weaknesses, because hitting at max range rewards you with a 1.75 stun, and getting close kinda...rewards(?) the enemy with a short 0.75 stun, which suallly doesn&#039;t do much. This, the realtively high cooldown, and the fact it doesn&#039;t go through units, involves some diecsion making. Works fine to me; \r\n\r\nlast but not least, Rite of the Arcane (R). it&#039;s generally intented to be used to get fleeing targets, or when they are cc&#039;ed by your team. You basically got 3 shots, and each one grants a short burst of vision on the area hit, to be sure to followup with the other shots. Its super long range gives it so much tactical importance: you can assist your team, steal objectives, everything from half-map away. However, it locks you down for 10 seconds, and you&#039;re visible to everyone during that time. Plus, due to the shots being so well telegraphed, it can be incredibly hard to hit good players, and mobility creep enforces this at least 2x times, so no wonder it feels so awesome to drive someone into your shots, for example. \r\nHowever, to me Rite of The Arcane is what needs to be worked on again on Xerath, not because how hard it is to hit someone (i find it kind of right instead, i mean, hitting with all the three charges deals a pretty good amount of damage, ad it&#039;s even nicer that i got to work hard to make it happens), but because the appearance of the projectiles looks so underpowered, same with the impact. The first cast animation looks awesome, it&#039;s really like Xerath is freeing himself, but after that, it all looks like splash-splish-splash. And that doesn&#039;t feel like the Ultimate ability of the most powerful being of league being finally free. \r\n\r\nOverall, as i said earlier, in my opinion i think Xerath is in a pretty balanced spot, maybe a bit more on the strong side, but still has clear strenghts and weaknesses. His damage output, although a bit high, is fair for an immobile champ like him, since he can&#039;t bring much else if not putting himself at risk. But if eventual adjustments were to be done, i&#039;d look first at: \r\ncast times; \r\ncooldowns; \r\nbase stats. \r\n\r\nAaaaand i think that&#039;s it. Don&#039;t hesitate to share Your opinion if You got any, and i&#039;d like to thank You again for reading all of this. \r\nKind Regards, \r\nPredatorator","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-12T18:11:04.616+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tend to share most of the opinions you've layed out here, especially on Q, W, E.

Any hit beyond the first on the same target deals 50% damage, so at max  you will deal 350% with 6 hits, which would be ~7% less damage than his current ult at max hits. However, the chance to atleast hit 1or two would be rather high and one could decide to spreat out the ult on multiple targets. \nBut mostly, shooting 6 ults would feel more like an magic artillerie bombarding an area and the visuals would kinda match the power of each single shot.\n6 shots woud mean he has to root him self longer, so maybe compensate for that with a short speedburst upon canceling the ult, like his old W.\n\nThe other idea would be a bigger aoe woth damage fall-off towards the edges with way more powerfull sound and visuals. i'd go for ~80% of the current aoe as 'sweet spot' that deals full damage, and twice of that with the damage gradually getting reduced to 25% at the edges.
