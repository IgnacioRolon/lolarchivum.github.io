We don't really give rewards for things like this.  Sometimes, when a player needs a very small amount of RP to unlock something we may ask for some art and help them out with that.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"MrToastSmurf","date":"2017-11-17T19:31:09.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your respond ♡ Will make sure to send my art very soon!","replies":[]}]}]}
