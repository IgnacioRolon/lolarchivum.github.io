Is kat literally balanced around whether the other champ has a dash/interrupt or not?\r\n\r\nHer other spells do a reasonable amount of damage but that ult hits 3 champs and with Talon's and LB's silence gone I have made player's of both champs quit the game just this week.  Certain champs are completely powerless to deal with this.  Other champs have 2 or 3 counters.  It's just dumb.

Since she has no cc and you can just run out of range in about 1 second, that basically requires some form of combo with your team(or, more likely, just her being fed enough to only need 1 second of the dmg). Also,  she's immobile and a somewhat easy target when casting it, since she likely just used her shunpo and won't get it back until someone dies.  If you watch how they play and try and get used to when and how they're going to ult it helps, because if you throw the cc out as soon as she ults, that fight is ruined for Kat unless someone else cleans up for her to start resetting.\n\nOn the flipside, if you do have a reliable stun or escape(which are getting more and more common) and always save it for the ult, she will basically be unable to ult you under most normal circumstances, which is I think the main reason she doesn't get that much high level use.","replies":[{"poster":"Fuaztin","date":"2015-01-31T15:41:16.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't just walk out of it.

It has a range of 550; assuming for some reason you were hugging her butt even after she E'd into you, that means the SLOWEST champion (Anivia, 325 movespeed) can leave her ult in 1.69 seconds of walking. If your midlaner does not have cc, they either are going to burst Kat down when she jumps in, use their mobility to escape, or be mordekaiser and spellvamp shit. If you don't have any mobility or cc, then you are a liar or mordekaiser.","replies":[{"poster":"TTUPhoenix","date":"2015-01-31T20:21:06.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thumbs up for numero uno.\n\n{{champion:82}} \nHUEHUEHUE.\n\nDashing, flashing, or otherwise leaving the area of effect does work, but to me, the real threat comes from how well her ult synchronizes with magic penetration (Sorceror's Shoes, Void Staff, etc.).  If she's fed (which isn't that hard if the Kat knows what they're doing), her kill time is so low that even a dash might not get you out of range fast enough, especially if you don't react right away.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2015-01-31T19:14:57.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fuaztin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hucsp4Jn,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-31T15:01:03.024+0000)\n> Is kat literally balanced around whether the other champ has a dash/interrupt or not?\n\nShort answer: yes.\n\nSlightly longer answer: this is a team game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2015-01-31T16:07:24.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can just walk out of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GuilIermo","date":"2015-01-31T15:33:41.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its pretty simple.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GuilIermo","date":"2015-01-31T15:30:14.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can\n 1.
