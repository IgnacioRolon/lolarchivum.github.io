On average, I would say that i report once every 2 or 3 games a person for being unsportsmanlike when it comes to what they say in game, yet i have not seen a instant report feedback since season 8 (literally). I have made in total 8 tickets but I think no one got banned. Has riot's policy towards toxicity and negativity subtly change into an indifferent stance? If not why am I seeing no punishments","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2020-01-25T23:30:51.237+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do know that most of the time you won't receive an ifr if someone gets punished from your report\nSo, you not getting any ifrs doesn't mean that they didn't get punished, it just means that you just didn't happen to get the notification\n\nIf you honestly think nobody is getting punished in league, just go read the boards for a while","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-01-26T03:39:29.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lulu im wondering at this point do you have this reply on copy paste for these people?\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2020-01-26T13:23:01.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, i don't\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} \nYou aren't the 1st person to ask that tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BenBob4","date":"2020-01-25T23:59:05.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=9VFzooPO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2020-01-25T23:30:51.237+0000)\n>\n> You do know that most of the time you won't receive an ifr if someone gets punished from your report\n> So, you not getting any ifrs doesn't mean that they didn't get punished, it just means that you just didn't happen to get the notification\n> \n> If you honestly think nobody is getting punished in league, just go read the boards for a while\n\nYes my friend I know that but going from getting one of those a week or so to getting nothing is very suspicious","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ehhhh","date":"2020-01-26T00:03:17.735+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you never browsed the board?
