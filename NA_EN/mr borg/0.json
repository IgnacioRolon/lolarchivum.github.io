The only ones I can find are the ones before The Great Retcon. Even beyond getting rid of the Institute of War, they don&#039;t make much sense. For example the Shadow Isles and Bilgewater are on opposite ends of the continent, yet in the new lore the mist hits Bilgewater first. Also Piltover and Zaun are two separate cities. And Targon doesn't exist.","replies":[{"poster":"efflam","date":"2017-11-06T06:03:18.668+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're working on it !  (I mean, not right now...
