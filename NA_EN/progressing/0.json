Even though you transfer, the patcher won't automatically update your region on the login screen.  Did you also have to change your username after transferring?  If you've already got a ticket open, our specialists should be able to help.  Let me know the ticket number, and I'll be happy to check on the status (if it's in English).","replies":[{"poster":"progressing","date":"2017-05-02T21:48:26.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(30105146) I tried logging into all regions.. i didnt change the user name.
