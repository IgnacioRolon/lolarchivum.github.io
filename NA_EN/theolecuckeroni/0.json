I looked up the various ways to fix it such as downloading a different rads kernel, updating windows,restarting your modem and uninstalling and reinstalling league. None of these worked for me. I have gone so far as to do 2 system restores. 1 a week ago and ,when that didnt do it, one a month ago. This has also not solved my problem. I did a reset on my modem. Nope. I've scoured every bit of my computer and found nothing while doing various virus scans which have turned nothing up as well. I've gone through pages and pages of league forums with 0 'fixes' that have done nothing for me. I cannot think of anything else that could be the problem. I cannot redownload league from the website as it says i cannot connect to league.com nor can i go straight to the support team as that does the same thing. So basically im asking for a freaking way to fix this because im all out of ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-01-14T06:14:15.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nThis may be due to some DNS issues that occurred over the weekend.
