I have tried everything to get this elusive S, but I didn&#039;t get it!\r\n\r\nI mostly play {{champion:106}} , and I thought I got the max mastery level, which is level 5, but the grading system threw everything out of whack for me. Like I said, I have tried everything to get a S, but that didn&#039;t happen for me. Lots of people gets plenty of S&#039;s except me. And that made me a little... well, a lot jealous.\r\n\r\nSo, I played as {{champion:106}} in the jungle, and I did all right. One time I went 11/1/1 with him, but that&#039;s not good enough to get a S. That made me really angry. I hit a big relapse and got immensely steamed again and calling this grading system rigged. Some people say I should play him in a unconventional role to get a S. So, I went for it. I used him as support and sometimes used him in top lane, but no matter what I do, I STILL didn&#039;t get a S I so desperately wanted. Even some time ago, I got so steamed that when I die too many times, I went out of control and cursed my teammates out. I got so fed up, I exited the game by choice.\r\n\r\nAnd one person told me I should practice more, but I have about it too many times. In fact, I&#039;ve heard about it so much, I chose not to practice at all. So, I need help. I don&#039;t know what went wrong. High kill count doesn&#039;t get me a S, high CS doesn&#039;t get me a S, even those high assists and low deaths doesn&#039;t get me a S. If none of those things get me a S, what will? I&#039;m going out of my mind. Will you tell me what&#039;s the secret of getting a S? Please tell me. I will be forever grateful if you tell me how to get S&#039;s more often.","replies":[{"poster":"LordLedel","date":"2016-06-21T06:55:55.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy triforce, do tonnes of dmgs, get S","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2016-06-10T23:07:54.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/16y6KbmQ-explanation-the-formula-to-the-ranking-system\n\nIt's not fixed.
