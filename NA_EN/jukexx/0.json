Do *not* attempt to buy a CS Riven code; all codes have been disabled and they are trying to scam you. Even before they were discontinued, code selling was a huge scam, which is why it was closed.\n\nShe may return in the future, but atm she is a Limited skin with no way to be acquired. Last Worlds she was actually given away if you were able to make a perfect pick in the Worlds Pick'em (select the winner of every match). Only *one* person got it.","replies":[{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2016-02-20T06:03:40.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and even better, the person that DID get it, already owned championship riven.","replies":[{"poster":"Jukexx","date":"2016-02-21T22:15:35.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For real xD, i would literaly sell my soul to satan for it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-19T23:33:52.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Jukexx - \n\nUnfortunately, there isn't a way to obtain her at this time.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhosta","date":"2016-02-20T22:29:45.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Like you can't give it or sell it to him...
