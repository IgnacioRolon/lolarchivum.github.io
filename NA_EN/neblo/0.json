Should the Team ELO or Map Should Be Balanced?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":199,"down_votes":14,"body":"TL;DR - Win rates for games with evenly ranked players is 60% in favor of blue side, so riot&#039;s matchmaking algorithm statistically puts better players on red side to even out the win rate. I find that to be a poor solution, and would prefer to play evenly ranked players with a map disadvantage (although fixing the map or coming up with new and creative solutions would be ideal).\n\nMaybe I would have better luck on Reddit, but my focus is letting Riot know my concerns not just the player base.\n\nMy analysis consisted of 41,899 ~~52,000~~ Silver to Diamond games during the 6.9 patch. When I refer to ELO I am using the formula that LoLKing uses (I posted my code in a comment below along with a few graphs that were requested). It is a number that represents what division and tier the player is in. For example, A Gold III player will have a higher ELO than a Silver IV.\n\nMy results show that if two teams are nearly even in ELO scores then the blue team wins 60% of the games. Before the argument of, &quot;but LoLKing says red and blue&#039;s win rate is 50/50&quot; comes out let me make sure that we all are on the same page. Yes, the win rate of blue and red is 50/50, but when players are evenly ranked in ELO scores blue has a substantial advantage. The fact that the blue and red win rates are 50/50 suggests that the algorithm is artificially stacking red team with better players to keep the balance. This can be further substantiated in that my analysis shows that ~65% of the time red team is given the higher ELO team.\n\nIf you still don&#039;t understand here is a simple example: A soccer field has on goal that is much larger than the other. Obviously it is easier to score in a larger goal so one team will have an advantage. Riot&#039;s solution seems to be to put the best players on the side with the large goal hoping it will balance out the fact that they will be shooting on the smaller goal. Unfortunately this is very flawed logic.\n\nThis is flawed because you cannot prove that you are actually balancing the matches rather than just rigging them. I could get 50/50 blue/red win rates by putting 5 diamond players on one team and 5 bronze players on the other and alternate which side the diamond team is playing on. This would easily artificially create the illusion that the sides are balanced when they are not.\n\nUsing a support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm I was able to predict who was going to win a match ~64% of the time solely based on the ELO of the players and the side they were playing on.\n\nThis suggests one of two things may be going on:\n1. Riot&#039;s match making system needs major work as it doesn&#039;t work very well\n2. Riot&#039;s match making system is (perhaps unintentionally) stacking teams to give the appearance that the map is balanced.\n\nIf Blue side win&#039;s too many games does the algorithm make sure that it goes back to 50/50 by increasing the deviation of elo placed on the red team as compared to blues&#039;?\n\nI think it goes without saying that this is a broken system.... So why does Riot just not fix the map? Well I think they have tried. Rift herald, brush changes, etc. were all changes in attempting to balance the map. It is probably expensive, time consuming, and may cause community backlash (probably not as much if people realized how bad it currently is).\n\nI personally would much rather play evenly ranked teams, even if I had a disadvantage due to the map. In fact it is likely a more balanced solution as well. Like I said, I can predict who will win 64% of the time when given the ELO of each team, but evenly matched games give only a 60% accuracy of who will win. This would imply that it may be possible to gain a 4% better &#039;balance&#039; to the game by allowing the map to be unbalanced, but ensure teams are even as possible. Since it is impossible to always have perfectly even teams, you could potentially further improve balance by always putting the higher ranked team on the red side.\n\nThe statistic that makes me the most angry is that when blue side has a significant advantage in ELO, they have a 70% chance of winning. What is more upsetting is that this accounts for around ~10% of total games. That means statistically 1 out of 10 games you are heavily disadvantaged. Why was that team placed on blue if the odds were known to be that bad? Answers I don&#039;t have.\n\nWhat do y&#039;all think? Is this how Riot should be balancing the win rates? Should the map be tweaked? Should it be completely redone?\n\n*note - I remade this post because I messed up the poll and could not find a way to change it*\n\nedit - let players know that I have a graph below\nedit - tweaked the TL;DR and fixed the number of games used in analysis","replies":[{"poster":"Neblo","date":"2016-05-26T04:35:40.716+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone asked on Reddit for some graphs and about the ELO calculations so I figured I would post it here too:\n\nI have a few photos from an old data set i made a year or so ago available on hand.

I have worked with many data sets during this project and was mistaken. Still, it is a large data set.\n\nQ – Riot uses a different formula than the LoLKing score.\nA – In my opinion that doesn't matter. The ELO is a direct representation of where a player sits on the ladder. If the algorithm takes a hidden MMR into account then you could potentially play against higher division opponents despite being placed in a lower division. You don't make a high school team play college teams because they are too good for playing in high school.. so why would you do that in League? This would make it much harder to rank up… Maybe this is what contributes to the idea of 'ELO hell'?\n\nQ – Why use a complicated algorithm like SVM? Why not Logistic Regression?\nA – I tried several learning algorithms.

I have only worked with ranked games, so I am not sure.\n\n> Assuming one side is better than the other side, would you prefer to not give one side some type of advantage to compensate?\n\nWell that is what Riot is trying to do. It is difficult to tell how successful they are without more details on how matchmaking works. I personally just want it to be something other than player skill. \n\n> Assuming the advantage is in the design of the map, do you have a suggestion to balance it?\n\nI would be more in favor of more creative solutions like a small regeneration bonus, or passive gold income if they do not want to tweak the map. At least you're less likely to be playing against someone who is clearly better than you.\n\n> Can you analyze the data by lane? For example, does it just suck super hard to be on the easily gankable top side, tops usually lose on that side, and that's usually the cause?\n\nI have not analyzed ELO by lane (an interesting idea i will have to look into), but I have analyzed champion pick by lane. In fact, that is what I am currently working on.

The MMR is a factor in favor of the red side and the map layout is in favor of the blue side. I definitely don't want uneven games. You can predict the chance of winning if you have the MMR and the sides 64% of the time right? at least that 64% is alternating from blue to red side and, most importantly, is unknown to the player without extensive lookups on sites like lolking or op.gg. If you have even MMR on both sides any idiot can tell you that they only have a 40% chance of winning on red side.\n\nSince I have an interest in stats outside of the basic stuff though, I was wondering if there was a significant difference between the 60% prediction based on side and the 64% prediction based on side and ELO. Your sample is impressively large but I would like to know if that difference is significant. In addition, I would expect that estimating winrate based on sides only would be less accurate than estimating winrate based on sides and MMR. You're simply working with more information. Did you do any sort of analysis on estimating winrate based on MMR alone without any knowledge of which side the teams are on? Issue is that red side is over represented, but I think there could be some serious issues with simply removing riots balancing algorithm.\n\nFirst off, there will be some spread in matching teams evenly with MMR. Your 60% is based only when teams have even MMR but you dont take into account that removing riots balancing algorithm will _not_ make every game evenly matched from an MMR standpoint. You're just moving the normal distribution towards an even distribution. What about when you go one standard deviation out from the mean? when you have an MMR differential in FAVOR of blue side? You might be able to predict that match with 80% accuracy or higher. Riots system seems to minimize the blowout potential of blue side quite well. All I'm saying is that while Riots system seems flawed, I don't have any reason to believe that your proposed solution would be _less_ flawed.\n\nSorry for all the questions, I enjoy posts with statistics and find interpreting them to be enjoyable.

Mid also has a safer roaming path to bot on blue. The gank advantage doesn't work in reverse for bot lane because blue has at minimum double the access to wards on top of the fact that 3v2 ganks are generally riskier than 2v1 ganks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chëw","date":"2016-05-26T10:26:25.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Diggi Fetti Aiär","date":"2016-05-26T18:35:11.098+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChewBUKU,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Y3VGdqvV,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2016-05-26T10:26:25.884+0000)\n>\n> i know im not that good but im around mid silver. i&#x27;ve noticed when i play on blue side the other team is stacked and im tired of playing against plat players when im silver. i had 3 or 4 games in a row where my team was 100% silver and the enemy team had plats/golds on their teams. how is that fair? especially in ranked it&#x27;s not fair.\n\nI checked your profile, in your last 20 ranked games you NEVER had a Plat player in your games.

In those games you faced a few plat players which happened to be playing with bronze players, so that makes it not as unbalanced as you wirte. Besides normals and rankeds have different MMR so a plat player in ranked might have a normal MMR of silver which makes him being paired with you perfectly fine.\n\nSo maybe that's why you're not that good and around mid silver because you rather lie than face reality and act on facts rather than you illusion of what's going on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2016-05-26T17:04:12.809+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.

Back in late 2012 they made changes to match players not only based on ELO, but also on the number of games that player had participated in.\n\nThe problem this creates (IMO) is one of Local Maximums when looking at player rankings.\n\nExample:    \nPlayer A has a 1200 ELO rating and 1000 games played, the system matches him against other players with around 1000 games played.\n\nPlayer B has a 1500 ELO rating and 50 games played, the system matches him with/against other players with around 50 games played.\n\nThe problem as I see it is that player A might actually be BETTER than player B in the empirical sense! However, because the system is separating experienced accounts from newer accounts, there's no way to actually know for sure. This creates a weird system where it's possible for 1200 ELO > 1500 ELO.\n\nInfact, if you think about it... a player that has a long-standing account might actually find it easier to climb to a higher ELO bracket by leveling up a new account and getting queued against other newer accounts.\n\nI just think it's weird. I understand why they did it - they wanted to create the most 50/50 chance of winning balanced games they could, and there IS a direct correlation between games played (+ champs unlocked / etc) and skill, but I feel separating newer accounts from older ones makes rankings super wonky.\n\nA source for what I'm referring to:     \nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2012/11/matchmaking-factors-in-number-of-wins.html","replies":[{"poster":"Mojihito666","date":"2016-05-26T12:43:26.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG i am creating a smurf.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chessman","date":"2016-05-26T06:47:27.293+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> This is flawed because you cannot prove that you are actually balancing the matches rather than just rigging them.

This would easily artificially create the illusion that the sides are balanced when they are not.\n\nI don't think this is an accurate comparison.  Riot isn't altering the team elo's to create a 50/50 winrate between blue and redside, it's doing it to create a more even probability of either side winning in every individual game.  The winrate is 50/50 as a result because the games are more even as a result.

That is, does the game prefer to find teams of equal skill level, then give the advantaged team by MMR the red side to compensate if there is a disparity (and distributing sides randomly if skill is approximately equal), resulting in more games where team skill is even but their odds of success are actually uneven due to side advantage?

This is likely due to easier access from the Blue jungle to the Blue outer bot tower: it's easier for Blue jungle and mid to rotate to help defend the bottom Blue tower, and harder for Red jungler/mid to rotate safely (not straight down the river through wards / ganks) to help defend Red bot lane's outer tower. \nAdditionally / alternatively, Blue team has alternate means of secondary egress in the event of a tower dive on their outer bot tower - easier access to their jungle. Red team may not have as easy a time getting into a bush for safety - since it's so easy for a Blue jungler to get into the Red-side tribush - and no available similar position so near to the Blue outer bot tower (their tribush is over by dragon, or the bush by rock dudes). \n\n\nRecommendations: \n- doing something with the camera seems the obvious choice, LoL is a very low requirement game, it could stand to increase the requirements some to render both directions\n- Baron pit: potentially put the baron in the middle of the river with ~mirrored access from both sides\n- South of Mid: adjust the Red side walls slightly around Red's blue buff to make it faster and safer for Red to rotate and ward the areas south of Mid lane \n- Bot lane: give red faster/safer access to bot lane rotates, potentially by thinning out the rock wall attached to Red's tribush - between frog and Red's blue buff\n\nCrazy idea: think about putting all turrets in the middle of their lanes - this would likely help Red more than Blue due to the generally easier ganks on Red side (in both Bot and Top lane outer turrets).","replies":[]}]}
