This error usually comes up during a Champ Select and it would pop up and instantly close my game. If I try to reopen my League, it would take me back to the Lobby and let me queue and acted as if I dodged with no penalty. I have never had this issue Ingame, but only in a Champ Select. I would like some help and a fix if possible please.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperSarged","date":"2017-07-11T12:33:49.993+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats the point of this free win in your series if this fucking bug gives a free loss running a Radeon 6670 {{champion:67}}  happened during this chicks champ select another dodge another climb to gold. Its hard enough trying to get people to cooperate and play towards your team comps winning conditions. What does it TAKE RIOT. This new client crashes unexpectedly not due to outdated comps not due to internet connectivity its a bug within all the pretty animations of champ select. plain and simple doesn't happen during banning but when someone selects a champ and the pretty splash art gets shown. in 6 games its happened 3 times. luckily i wasn't 1st pick or second. I'm not even mad. I'm DISAPPOINTED. the old client worked it wasn't pretty but it worked. but I've been playing long before this game was pretty so I just want it to work like it used to.","replies":[{"poster":"GG Worst Lux NA","date":"2017-07-19T02:42:57.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"truth^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mister Dang","date":"2017-07-09T17:52:41.784+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM!!!!!

Luckily when I click \"okay\" on the popup message with the error the client loads right back up on its own and takes me right back to select.

It happens maybe every 4-5 champ selects for me.\n\nBut, I am worried that this will eventually turn into something worse or it will be my turn to select or ban and I'll get a leavebuster warning. Please fix this issue! This did not happen until the current patch. I repaired client, reinstalled, etc. Nothing fixes it.\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit: I want to reiterate it is NOT connection issues. following that guide does nothing to fix this issue.

It errors when it is my turn to ban or pick, whichever comes first. Crashes out, and sometimes the process (not the client) remains running in the background.
