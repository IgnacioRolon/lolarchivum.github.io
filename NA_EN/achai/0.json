When select is over, I wait for the loading screen, but instead I get a black screen and it says it can't connect to servers. I would have to restart my client and reconnect in order to to get into the loading screen. Is there a way to fix this so I can just connect. Over the years of playing this only has happened to me recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T20:39:17.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is having a hard time establishing a solid connection to the game server.
