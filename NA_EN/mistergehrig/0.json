The screen sometimes goes white and has caused my laptop to restart during the actual champion select. I need to find a resolution to this because I have lost around 40-80 LP because of the new clients bugs. I have tried to uninstall then reinstall and it didn't make the issue any better. Does anyone know if there is going to be a combination from RIOT to give back LP that we lost from their faulty client?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-09T20:38:48.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That sounds pretty stressful, and I'd like to help you get this figured out.  We can't alter game stats, so I highly recommend testing anything out in a custom at this point to be extra safe.  Firstly, enable [Low Spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) which will disable fancy aesthetics that can cause stress or freezing on your pc during champ select.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise we can continue from there!","replies":[]}]}
