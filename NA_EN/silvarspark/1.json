She has a shield, a sword, protects the planet and she has a pet lion!\r\nLeona needs a pet lion, too! Coming to think about it, she doesn&#039;t have a single skin that even picks up the lion theme.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} \r\nIf you like it, please show some suppurt by giving it a thumbs up and/or comment below. \r\n\r\nAlso check out my other skin ideas over at my artstation gallery.

Dragon Sorceress was kind of a let down -- there are so many AMAZING skins and Zyra's just feel super outdated. I would give RITO allll my moneyz for an exciting Zyra skin. The thing is, I've spoken to several of the Riot artists on twitter, and I've gotten pretty much the same response from all of them, which is \"Zyra skins are a challenge because of her plants\" which is a real bummer.
