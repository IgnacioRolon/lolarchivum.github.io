He is purple/turquoise.\nSince both existing skins have similar but slightly different color themes, I did the same for Orianna and went for purple/blue.\n\n\n*edit*\nhttp://orig03.deviantart.net/4434/f/2017/059/d/5/dark_star_orianna_balls_by_shockowaffel-db0o7pg.jpg\nHey again, here's something new. I did a few alternatives for Ori's ball, to see if something works better than just the black hole.\nI tried to build some kind of structure around the hole, but that doesnt really come together.\nOther ideas are to drop the black hole altogether and go for the dark star aspect. That might be in the edgy metal style or the broken planet.\n\n*edit2*\nhttp://orig09.deviantart.net/af12/f/2017/061/7/5/dark_star_orianna_by_shockowaffel-db0xvja.jpg\nI think Iike this version best.

Thresh at least resembles the original, but Varus would be unrecognizeable if you only saw the head.They're all dark without eyes or any superficial details except the bizarre teeth. My take on her was to try and keep the forms elegant and flowing. The gesture lines of the head mimic the lines of the torso as well.\nIt's rather hard to make heads of this skinline somewhat female.
