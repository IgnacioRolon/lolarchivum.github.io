After a minute I can hear the in-game sounds. I tested it by typing messages to my team mates and I flashed to make sure. But the problem is graphically I am still in the loading screen. If I alt+tab out then back into the game my screen goes completely black.\r\n\r\nI have booted into safe mode used a utility to completely uninstall my graphics card driver then reinstalled it and no luck it still happens.\r\n\r\nI have gone through Riot's troubleshooting methods one by one and they did not solve the issue.\r\n\r\nI have unchecked peer-to-peer and re-patched didn't work.\r\n\r\nI have re-installed LoL and didn't work.\r\n\r\nMy Computer Specs:\r\n\r\nCore i5 4690K (not overclocked)\r\nAMD FirePro W5100\r\n16 GB of RAM\r\n240 GB SSD\r\nIntel 7260 Dual Band AC Wifi Card (which gets ethernet speeds over wifi)\r\n\r\nI have a business so I have the highest non-commercial Comcast internet package so I don't think its my internet or the speeds (usually at 86 mb/s down and 15 mb/s up). I live in Michigan so my ping is normally 20-ish.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of a reason for this to happen and I have Google'd it far and wide with no results that have fixed this yet. Any help would seriously be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-03T22:53:24.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on what you're saying (you're technically making it into game, but your PC is showing the loading screen), I'd venture to say that this is either a case of the network for some reason not sending information back to the client to say that you're \"in-game\" or potentially an esoteric hardware issue.\n\nSince you've already completed the initial troubleshooting steps, go ahead and [submit us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with [applicable logs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs)).  I'd recommend including DirectX Diagnostic, R3D logs, and process list to start, though the team may ask you for others later.","replies":[{"poster":"MaxControl","date":"2016-05-03T23:07:15.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just submitted it.
