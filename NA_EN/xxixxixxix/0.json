So, I notice that a new update has been out and waited patiently for it to finish downloading and start a rank game as what I normally do.  Then, once game start, my computer froze. So, I restart the computer and try again.  Another game was froze. Now, I realized there are some problems.  Riot please fix this, I do not know if this is due to the win10 update or your update but its frustrating and i have leave buster (lower priority queue) placed on me .  Remove that and fix the problem please, I do not care about the rank points.  Thank You!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T22:48:37.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're using Windows 10, a recent update has been causing crashes or freezing like this.  I know everything seems okay now, but to be on the safe side I recommend disabling the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  It's been the culprit and it would suck if it happens again.
