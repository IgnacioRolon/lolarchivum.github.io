Riot games is legally recognized as a sport in the United states so it would be filed under unfair sports game play/ player treatment.

How does arbitration get started? (One of us sends the other one and JAMS a written notification describing the situation and relief sought.)\n> \n> Either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. The party commencing the arbitration is called the “claimant.” To start the arbitration, the claimant must send JAMS a “Demand for Arbitration.” JAMS has created a form for this purpose, entitled “Demand for Arbitration,” which is available on its website. In addition to sending this form to JAMS and paying a filing fee, the claimant must mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party, called the “respondent.”In the event you initiate arbitration against Riot Games, you must send a copy to Riot Games at the following address: Riot Games, Inc., ATTN: Legal Department, 12333 W. Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90064.In the event Riot Games initiates arbitration against you, we will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your account, if any, or if we don’t have a physical address for you, then to the email address associated with your account. \n\n> 15.12. Can either of us tell our friends and Twitter followers about the arbitration? (Nope.)\n> \n> You and Riot Games agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential. However, the prevailing party in any arbitration may file the arbitration Award with any court of competent jurisdiction in order to have that Award confirmed in a court order or judgment. \n>  15.14. If we do end up in court for some reason, can either of us pick a court location other than Los Angeles to file the lawsuit? (No.)\n\n> In the event that either you or Riot Games commence a court action, any such action shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California, and you and Riot Games both submit to personal jurisdiction there. \n\nAll of this is from [The Terms of Use](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#dispute-resolution). First, you agreed to use arbitration, not small claims court (except for an emergency injunction). Second, you agreed to keep your disputes with Riot confidential. Third, you agreed to take any court action in LA County, not your local court house.","replies":[{"poster":"II1III1III1II1II","date":"2019-01-27T02:51:52.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey that doesn't apply if you file the case as a minor you can have your parent be the one who does all of it and they have never agreed to any of this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DereC4","date":"2019-01-25T00:16:15.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um... k then","replies":[]},{"poster":"II1III1III1II1II","date":"2019-01-27T02:50:01.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey the best bet is going after Riot based in the fact they are declared as a sport so if you can prove unfair sports man ship/game play you would have full rights to try and get that removed witch would shut down all League Esports in NA.
