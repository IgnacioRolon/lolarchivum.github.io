Click on the one you'd like to use.\n\nI've attached a similar example with Pool Party Leona. \n\nIf you have any more questions about this, please feel free to let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"LordHalfBreed","date":"2015-05-12T07:07:01.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is all that is popping up!

That's because you're in Team Builder and the functionality isn't implemented for that particular queue yet. We're hoping to have it in next patch, if all goes as planned, I believe.  If you want to try and load them up in a custom quickly, you should see them no problem - that's how I loaded up Pool Party Leona. \n\nThat said, I've seen a workaround on Reddit where if you select and use a chroma in a normal game, it will be already set in Team Builder. Haven't tried it myself, but I've seen several people say it works.","replies":[{"poster":"LordHalfBreed","date":"2015-05-13T00:07:35.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok i see it does show up in custom, and ill try the work around and see if that works until the next patch! thanks for working through this with me!","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-05-13T00:37:09.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In approximately 36 hours this will be fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-13T00:18:07.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries!","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-05-13T00:36:37.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was right, It's Thursday.
