Please try to reconnect.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good afternoon folks,\r\n\r\nSince I've been trying to fix this issue for one day as of now, I'm already aware that this issue is viral and it has different causes and solutions, but however, none of them seems to work for me. I played LoL perfectly only for one session, which means it already ran smoothly once on my laptop. \r\n\r\nThe issue: Everything goes perfect until I hit the loading screen, the one that pops after locking in your champion and skills. I would say my ping is average. It goes between 90s-120s. Sometimes my loading stays at 0, sometimes it goes up until 70s, 80s, and even 90s. Eventually, it stops and I tried leaving it for long period of times, but no dice. It hits me with the \"The game has crashed. Please try to reconnect\" message. I also tried to reconnect many times but it doesn't work too.\r\n\r\nThe most annoying part? I have to wait for 30 minutes or thereabouts for the game in which I was enrolled. When it's over, I can attempt to try a new connect, but with having to wait on the queue list for 5(+) minutes as a penalty, and the amount of time ridiculously increases each time the game crashes.\r\n\r\nAttempted solutions: Turning off the whole firewall. I don't have any other anti-virus or any similar sort of programs that may prevent the game from running ( i.e lolreplay etc. ). Changing the DNS to 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4.  Tried public and private network. Tried using a different Wi-Fi connection. Tried repairing the corrupted files. Tried registering a new account to try a different server. There are probably some other attempted-solutions which I've forgot. It's also quite annoying because I've consume a shard and it's being wasted!\r\n\r\nQuick support is deeply appreciated! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T20:43:05.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure that this is necessarily a network issue because you are getting the loading screen to appear, and it seems to halt while trying to render.  If repairing didn't solve this, then there may be another issue like outdated drivers or something else.  I recommend starting off with our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide, which will go over a series of steps that will cover a range of reasons that cause issues like this.  Let me know your results, or if your issue persists afterwards!","replies":[{"poster":"BardianÖfGalaxy","date":"2016-08-14T03:55:48.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have updated my Windows and now I can't even launch LoL. It says pvp.net patcher kernel has stopped working. I'll try to solve this by searching for online solutions and report back. Please stay up to date with my case!\n\nEDIT: I followed these steps found somewhere on the forums:\n Go into your League of Legends folder in C:/Riot Games\nOpen up the \"RADS\" folder.\nOpen up the \"Projects\" folder.\nOpen up the \"lol_air_client\" folder.\nOpen up the \"releases\" folder.\nOpen up the folder that's in there. It changes every patch, but contains the same stuff.\nDelete the two files named \"S_OK\" and \"release manifest\"\nOpen up the \"deploy\" folder.\nDelete the \"lol.properties.\"\nRun the league client as admin.\n\nAnd it worked. The game now automatically started repairing itself. Let's see if I can connect now.\n\nFinal edit: Everything is perfect now! I would've liked to request for someone to remove my time penalties for the next 4 matches, but I'm sure I'll be done with them myself before someone comes online.\n\nThanks for your time Porocles!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BardianÖfGalaxy","date":"2016-08-14T00:10:44.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great. I will go over through it and I will make sure to apply each step, but while I'm at it, I would like to ask is it possible that it could be one of these issues in the game crash guide that is influencing me, even though I have played prior to being bugged by only a couple of hours?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Inst1ng","date":"2017-04-24T18:58:56.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the game is too picky?

I closed out for a little bit to nap for an hour and then drive my little brother to school and came back to play for a bit, joined a game, and suddenly this game crash thing occurred. Only difference is for the first few times it refused to load it was telling me there was something wrong with my internet connection. Which there is not.\n\nI am currently trying the steps in the third post to see if this helps. If not I may have to re-download LoL all together and I am not looking forward to it.
