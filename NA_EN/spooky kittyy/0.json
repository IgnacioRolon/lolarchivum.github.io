I just got done playing a game of Sylas and as I was trying to ult a few champions, like Nocturne and Garen, it would tell me &quot;Champion not ready.&quot; no matter how much I spammed the R on one of them. How does Sylas&#039;s ult work and when can I use and not use his ult? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-02-01T08:26:35.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sylas' ult has two cooldowns; one for himself, and one tracked separately for each enemy champion whenever he steals their ult. There should be a dark-blue indicator on the ground around them that tells you that they're still on cooldown. \n\nJust remember that you will generally can't steal the same person's ult multiple times in a row. If your ult is ready and you can't steal your lane opponent's ult, look to shove and roam so you can take someone else's and make a play there.","replies":[{"poster":"Spooky Kittyy","date":"2019-02-01T21:23:00.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you so much for that explanation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2019-02-01T08:18:43.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't steal a players ult after you've stolen it for 2x their CD for that ult, or something like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-01T21:54:30.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you read the tooltip for the ability you were trying to use?\n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dxqw00UqmIg/XDUhfII87rI/AAAAAAABNac/l_xLKPUmseoGjRJxEwVWC100xi0UyRxaQCLcBGAs/s640/sylasr.png","replies":[]}]}
