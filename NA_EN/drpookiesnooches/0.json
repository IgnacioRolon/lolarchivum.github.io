Are you guys not aware of how often these issues occur? I practice against AI and I try to learn but it makes no sense that people have to break the rules of LEAGUE . I tell them I report them and they say OK, just ok, no one is afraid of you guys. Do you understand that most of these players who break the rules get away with it half the time. its no fair to other players who try to enjoy the game and play it properly but instead they have to struggle. You tell us to report these players but how do we know you guys take justice and actually handle the situation? We don't , infact these problems shouldn't be handle by players but instead handled by you guys. that way, the problem will be fixed instantly. no one is afraid of being reported, why is that? because they know that nothing will happen and that's  very sad. while we play the game and try to enjoy it, idiots are still roaming and ruining it for other, A simple suggestion, how about you guys play the game and catch these people on the spot. that would fix the issue. well, that's if you guys care that much, which in my point of view you guys don't because these issues are still happening.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-25T21:21:33.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol..\n\nKill stealing is not reportable and does not even exist. More gold for the team, scrub.\nThere are no bots above about lv5. This is not a fitting excuse to report people who trigger you through your incredibly thin skin.\n\"Not staying in a lane\" is called playing the game properly. Roaming and ganking are intended, expected and important, and the laning phase typically ends by 15 minutes.\n\nIt sounds like you are just way too young to be playing this game and should go play something you can actually handle and understand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AzureDragoon","date":"2017-01-25T21:12:16.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might want to check Player Behavior & Moderation forums for some info. \n\nFirst off: \"Kill Stealing\" is not a reportable offense. \n\nThreatening and Soliciting reports, is a punishable offense it self (falls under negative attitude and harassment). \n\nHere's some links to Riot game's official support pages, which describe most of the behavior that's approved and disapproved. \n[Behavior Worthy of a Champion](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751874-Behavior-Worthy-of-a-Champion)\n[Reporting a Player](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you have further question about behavior that's accepted or not, post in PB&M.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CitadelOfIce","date":"2017-01-25T21:08:48.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if troll. If not you are so missing how League is played. You don't stay in your lane that would be silly. You keep moving and keep your openent guessing. Attacking another lane is called ganking. Go watch some ECL pros that will help you. Bots are only good for practicing the mechanics of a champion and even then only the bear bones basics. You need to play PVP to get any level of skill with a champion. You will fail... Alot but it's practice like years of it. Hundreds of hours.","replies":[]}]}
