The first time I tower dove for a kill and the tower slowed me down to the point I was unable to get in range AND DIED, I exclaimed in Skype \"OMFG this stupid turret!\" and my mate replied \"Well you shouldn't have dove the enemies' base...\". And I knew that. I knew I was being reckless for no reason. I felt like I was appropriately punished for making the wrong choice - and watching it happen over and over again still gives me good feels in my belly - e.g. you see their healthy fighter flash under tower and you flash away yourself and watching them struggle to disengage from their greedy decision (especially on champions like Diana with the slow-moving animation to really sell it). Sometimes the slow even helps you get away - making it the only turret that actually feels helpful to hide behind.\n\nRemove the damage reduction if this turret really is stopping split pushers.

It also heavily limits the amount of viable sololane-champs, as everyone that is vulnerable to early diving is just too risky often times. Shifting the Shield from the 2nd to the 1st turret could help a lot here.\n\n- towers don´t deal substantial more dmg to squishies than they do to tanks. They have too much armor-pen and by far not enough base-dmg. with just a warmogs you can tank them aslong as someone with a ruby cristall, a thornmail and a randuins combined. \nIt´s also one of the very reasons Assassins snowball as hard and feel as frustrating for a lot of players like they do currently - if you´re ahead only slightly with LB you can easily take 3 turret-hits when diving and still get away with it as one of the squishiest champs there is. \nTanking turrets should be primarily a main reason to bring a tank along in the first place.\n\nIt´s not the turrets that prolong games, it´s players that shy away from every risk because you overhype K/D/A instead of results.","replies":[{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-06-18T13:25:57.495+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I agree with many of your points I want to point out that moving the shield from second to the first turret is a really bad idea.

Hard-pushing a lane and reaching an inhibitor turret within 10-15 minutes tends to be a rare thing, but even in that situation the inhibitor turrets feel relatively weak. There's also a lot of frustration with tower dives, I think: players are conditioned to feel that turrets will always offer a last line of defense during the laning phase, but from level 6 and onwards even squishy champions can dive targets and make it out alive.\n\nI think there's a distinction here that needs to be made between the different aspects of turrets, namely their damage output and their tankiness. Tankier turrets would definitely stall out games, since it would take more resources for each structure to fall, but increasing their damage or other effects might offer more protection in the right situations without creating unhealthy amounts of stalling. If you made laser turrets deal maximum health-scaling true damage which ramped up over time, for example, it would have a minimal effect in discouraging splitpushing, but would prevent tanks from building tons of health and just sitting under those turrets indefinitely during teamfights. In general, health-stacking feels a bit too good against turrets, and now that health options are far more accessible, and often very powerful, I feel turrets have become weaker as a consequence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-06-18T12:26:30.305+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has there been any consideration to changing the early game power level of turrets?\nI agree that they should be a place of sanctuary early,  diving should be strongly deterred. Yet I find their power isn't like this at all. \n\nEven pre-6, supports will tank the turret in 2v1 dives bot Lane. Often someone will tank a couple hits during a jungle gank.  Successfully taking anything more than 1 turret shot during a dive pre-6 should be reserved for the very few champs that have something in their kit to encourage diving...\n\nOn the other hand,  I find trying to take that first turret to be very frustrating. I can be winning Lane pretty consistently where my opponent refuses to feed me and just bases repeatedly early game. So I push the lane in and do some turret damage each time,  yet it never seems to add up. Eventually their turret is at half health and mine's not yet touched and I get ganked and escape to recall and my turret is destroyed before I get back. They've recalled under pressure 5 times and I've only got theirs to half health, the first time i recall without pushing out the wave first I  lose the whole thing. It happens because there seems to be this point where champions suddenly start to deal a lot more damage to turrets and the enemy has their jungler helping to take it down. \n\nWhat I want is:\nEarly game turrets to be more threatening when a champion is there. Dives should be strongly discouraged unless the enemy is nearly dead and you're nearly full. \nEarly game turrets to be easier to take. Reward people who win push out a safe opponent who refuses to give up kills (specifically weak roamers who can't get kills elsewhere).\n\nI'd suggest making a change to Tier 1 turrets:\n1 - increased damage to champions when an allied champion is under the turret. If an allied champion moves within the turret range,  the turret gains 10% bonus damage to champions per second stacking up to 5 seconds (the bonus could be altered). This makes chasing someone into their turret unchanged,  but makes diving someone more risky once they've safely been at their turret for a while (i.e. you're waiting for your jungler to come tank it).\n2 - bonus damage against turrets. If no allied champion is within a larger range of a Tier 1 turret,  the first champion to attack the turret receives a buff that increases their damage against turrets for a few seconds. Either on-hit, or attack speed boost, or otherwise. \n\nI think this would transform turrets in to what they spoils be early game. Places of safety for a defender,  but a key objective to take when your enemy surrenders map pressure.

The removal of the slow on PBE means that they can take less damage from walking away without being slowed.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-06-18T04:37:24.211+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"In all honesty, I'm going to take the opinion that they should be pretty weak late game. Otherwise, you end up with three scenarios.\n\n1) Games going for exceedingly long times because teams can't rush towers\n2) A super tank meta emerging to deal with the turrets\n3) Stall comps that rely on the last defenses to hold out until their late game carry is fed to the brim.\n\nI've always felt that turrets have 3 'stages'. Early game, they're a defense, a primary means of safety. Mid game, they're an aid, something to help a sieged team. Late game, they're a deterrent, something that might make the enemy team think atleast once before rushing, but it isn't a huge benefit.  \n\nAlso, not sure why people think the lasers are weak, the damage adds up. I think after 2-3 seconds they start to vastly outdamage other turrets.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Caeler","date":"2015-06-18T02:06:24.306+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the damage to tanks is almost balanced to be honest. They stand on it for a little bit and then they start getting melted really fast. The inhib and nexus turrets could use slight buffs so they ramp up faster, but they're not really in a bad spot versus tanks in my opinion.\n\nI think the main issue with the turrets is that they do almost no damage to squishies. It's so bad that the enemy carry can dive pretty tanky people and get away with it. Then they walk out, auto attack a minion about four times and they're back at full hp thanks to lifesteal.\n\nTanks can stand under the towers for a long time, yes, but they probably aren't going to heal all of their hp back in 3 seconds afterwards.\n\nAnother issue with the towers is juggling agro. Because the damage has to ramp up, you can tank the tower for a couple of seconds, walk out, have someone else tank it, and then walk back in and tank some more because the tower just reset its damage. \n\nThis brings me back to the first point, which is that the towers should ramp up faster. It currently takes 5 seconds for the inhib and nexus towers to charge up to max damage. I think the towers would be a lot better with a 4 second charge time instead (20% faster yay) because the faster charge time would help address basically every problem the towers have without making them overbearing or too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-18T02:30:07.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You obviously haven't watched the video of the Sion tanking the Nexus turret for literally 33 seconds and not dying.
