So I tried to uninstall and reinstall and then I couldn't even get to the launcher. The badge would flash and then league would just crash and disappear. I ran the hextech repair tool and was finally able to download the patch and get into the client, but now it won't scan the files. It's stuck at zero percent perpetually. How could League just render itself completely useless like this. Nothing i try works and now the hextech repair tool crashes and says something about \"chromium embedded framework\" not working. This is an insane amount of issues to have considering all I did was try to open league. please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T21:01:31.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda weird, but it almost sounds like your OS doesn't have the right admin settings to allow League to scan its own files or even launch correctly anymore. Try adjusting your [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) and let me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
