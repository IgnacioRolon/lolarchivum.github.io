I clearly thought riot games would send out at least one warning but I guess that did not happen. I have seen many others more toxic than were toxic for a good year only at most having a two week suspension, to be permanently banned in only playing 25 ranked games as a new player is actually really interesting. I wonder how this system of terms of service works I need more clarification as to why I was permabanned......................","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-04-19T17:06:13.044+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You weren't banned for in game behavior.\n\nYour account was locked for other reasons.
