And when it does, it takes a lot more time to go into the loading screen.\r\n\r\nSometimes I can join the game after some minutes of waitting, but there are other times where I join the game at 5/ 6 / 7 minutes of game, or they aren't even playing and remaked the game. And I got already 2 / 3 penaltys because of that.\r\n\r\nFirst of all my computer is complete trash, but I allways played league without a problem like this, actualy this season I already played with no problems, not sure why is this happening now. I play this game for like 6 years and this error never happened to me. Can someone tell me if this is happening to anybody else or is it just me?!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-03T16:31:06.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can happen when your connection is struggling to transition from champion select to the game server, so it puts you into a dormant state.  Try out the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot, though I recommend doing it in custom games for now.

I had the same problem again. Everything is fine with my internet connection. The problem is that it takes too much time to go into the loading lobby. The transition from the queue to the champion loading takes forever and when it pops it's just me who is loading into the game, cause the rest is already playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-14T15:29:40.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even through your internet is fine, you can still have issues or instability reaching specific services.  In this case, it seems like your network is struggling to transition you between services like champion select and the game server.  It's super important to run through that guide and rule out possibilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Thabestofall","date":"2017-10-14T16:01:28.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem as  Xtreme222 sometimes and it also isnt my own conection since i have ethernet and i never have any problems with that and it sure is frustrating to have this problem since it makes it harder to climb etc...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
