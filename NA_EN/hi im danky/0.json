The number of reports don't matter as all it takes is one report to flag a game for review.  From [Riot Tantram](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/H67KxUT6-about-chat-restriction?comment=000000000002): \n\n>Actually, Erdrik is correct here.\n\n>A report flags a game for review. They do not establish guilt. The game is then reviewed for harassment, feeding, etc. This is why 'troll reporting' or 'gang reporting' do not work. False or inaccurate reports are thrown out.\n\n>You cannot ever be punished for saying nothing .. unless of course it's for something gameplay related like feeding, afking or cheating. But, you can never be punished for offensive language, hate speech or verbal abuse if you said nothing.\n\nAs for severity, that all depends on ones behavior. Things like death threats, racist comments and hate speech as well as gameplay trolling and intentional feeding/afking will result in a 2-week or permanent ban while lesser chat offenses such as general harassment and report calling will go through the punishment system as normal.\n\nFor the OP, Reform Cards always show 1-3 games that you were valid reported in. I'd say that it's just coincidence that in both of your permaban cases there were only 2 games shown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-12-29T10:52:58.947+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not true at all.

That's why this current system is in place, to weed out these kinds of players sooner while also trying to get players to reform quicker too.","replies":[{"poster":"hi im danky","date":"2016-12-29T11:16:00.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not like the players who currently grief games get banned anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2016-12-29T13:06:52.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hi im danky,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=X0E0ZZ32,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2016-12-29T11:16:00.361+0000)\n>\n> Not like the players who currently grief games get banned anyway\n\n [Here are](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken?show=rundown) two examples of gameplay trolls being banned.
