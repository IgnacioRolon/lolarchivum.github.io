I definitely want the Thresh one and I&#039;m going on May 9th. So, does that mean that I get the skin 5 days in advance? (It says they&#039;ll be released on May 14th, I believe).\r\n\r\nAlso, about the tickets. The printed option, uhh. Is it supposed to be like a giant ticket on printer paper? Thnx. (Kinda don&#039;t wanna drive to all the way there and then find out I goofed on the ticket)","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-29T15:45:28.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, you get a skin code for (of your choice) for each day you are at the event.
