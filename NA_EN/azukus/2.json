I received my TPA Ezreal skin, but still no sign of my SSW Thresh skin. I have no idea where it is and if I will get it. The only thing I could think of is they might be giving the skins out by each team. Example: First they give out all fnatic skins, then they give out TPA, then they give out SKT, then they give out all SSW Skins. I thought this until my friend got SSW Talon before I got Ezreal. The only other thing i can think of is they give it out by champion. Example: Corki, then Janna, then J4, then Karthus, so on and so forth. Bottom line is, I haven't got both of my skins and I want them. Riot will probably just be late getting them all out.
