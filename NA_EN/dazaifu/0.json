Then I will play lol from the USB on a library computer (they're all Macs).\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to download the Mac version it redirected me to the app store because it seemed to need something to start the download with. So I downloaded a thing called \"Total Manager Free\". Now I'm even more confused and I have absolutely no idea what to do from here. Please help :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-12T17:42:11.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like a strange issue, but I'll try to help!  Go to League's [Download ](https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload)page.  Select the drop down menu and select Oceania, OSX.  That will  just be the installer but won't open on Windows.  Hopefully, it will do what you're trying though.  Also I'm not sure how successful it will be to run League from an USB, and you may run into a lot of issues including permissions/security settings.  Still, I hope that helps you out somehow!
