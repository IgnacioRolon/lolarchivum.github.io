Before you click away, I will also say that I am not some 7 year old kid in his basement on his parents&#039; 10 year old potato thinking he deserves to be in the LCS. \r\n\r\nWhat honestly made me quit the game was the toxicity. And that toxicity came from higher ELO&#039;s, mostly from Silver and Gold. They start to be toxic to Bronze players just because they made it out of Bronze. All that toxicity trickles down to the actual ELO. At this point, every higher division within Bronze means that you think you&#039;re better than the people below you. This causes people to call others trash, and then the game is lost because your team is continuously arguing. That&#039;s when people say &quot;My teammates are garbage&quot;. Even if you try to get them to work together, they call you trash, and now you&#039;re subconsciously triggered. At this point, unless you&#039;re a God playing a champion that can carry, the game can&#039;t be won, simply because of the toxicity (Unless the enemy team throws). You&#039;re probably thinking &quot;You should&#039;ve been able to carry&quot;, but it comes to the negativity again. In higher ELO&#039;s, just because you&#039;ve fed, doesn&#039;t mean the game is lost. Your teammates are less toxic, and would work harder to win. In Bronze, because of the mentality that &quot;You have to carry ALL the time&quot;, you get frustrated. When you get frustrated, you get angry, and then you call people garbage. People also don&#039;t want to be called bad, so they work to get out of Bronze. As soon as they begin to lose, they get mad. This mostly comes from Silver players, who think that just because they made it to Silver, and are not Bronze, they&#039;re good now. Silver players typically think that they are impervious to bring called bad by higher ELO&#039;s because they aren&#039;t in Bronze, and that mentality is how the Silver ELO appears to Bronze players. A safe haven, essentially. \r\n\r\nIf the toxicity from higher ELO players is reduced, people would actually enjoy their games, have fun, and climb more. More people would get better, leading to a more challenging environment, which would make climbing more prestigious. \r\n\r\nYou are probably wondering (If you made it this far) now why I don&#039;t just play normals. The reason is that the end of each game is the same. You took their Nexus, yay. Sure, you would have epic comebacks, or had so much fun toying with the enemy team, but you are awarded with the same thing: victory and a new game. I play ranked with the goal to climb, and it kept me me going seeing how much I&#039;ll climb. With the current state of the game, I&#039;ll probably go on with my friends, or to collect rewards and whatnot. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[]}
