I'm just worried about my account being banned or something in the meantime. Should I just let them do the damage and let you guys handle it later or is there anything preventative that I should be doing. They sent a mass botted message to my friends saying to go to like this smurf website.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T15:40:48.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since they changed your verified email, it's likely they had access to that email. I suggest changing the password of that email, then enabling 2-step verification if your email provider offers that service.\n\nWe'll take care of the rest when we get back to you in your ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinx","date":"2016-09-21T17:41:44.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright thank you for your help again.
