I got one email verifying its existence but that was 4 days ago. Account is still compromised :L . Just looking for another admin to talk to so I can clarify some things. I feel like I'm not being helped at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T20:06:12.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see that you have a few tickets on this, and much like threads, just one is fine!  Having multiple tickets on the topic can cause delay and confusion in responding, and continuing to reply to a ticket can drop you back to the bottom.  I was able to confirm that your ticket was received and escalated to an account specialist.  They will be reviewing your case and reaching out to you as soon as they can.  Hang tight!","replies":[{"poster":"Shinx","date":"2016-09-23T23:42:35.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is kinda scary though haha my account is now permabanned when I tried to log in.
