I am able to see that you are in a mini-series for promotion, but at the time you played your game, your mini series would have just started and would not have been the game that would have caused you to win your series.  However, at the same time it looks like a game is missing from your match history if it was played roughly 8 hours ago.  As to why the game is missing, it is hard to say -- the individual game server itself could have had an issue, dropping the game for everyone, or the game could have been attempted to be drop-hacked.  Either way, if the game is currently not in your match history, it will not appear in the future :(\n\nAs of right now, you are currently 1-1 in your series.  I wish you the best of luck in winning! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Rancid34th","date":"2016-06-01T00:37:54.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Run program as administrator and it should fix the problem, did for me anyways... finally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZhenLaJi","date":"2016-05-31T23:25:19.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also in the same situation.
