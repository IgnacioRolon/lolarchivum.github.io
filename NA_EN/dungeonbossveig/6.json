If you are looking for a Team to start ranking up and training, that is what I am trying to assemble right now. *I am not going to be part of the team personally since I am playing on EU NE but I am part of an International Multi Gaming Community which provides the support for creating such teams, a dedicated \"Calendar\" for you to schedule team practices, a friendly environment to hang out in when not playing with your team, and a dedicated Team Speak server and TS room for your team to practice without being disturbed. If you have even the slightest interest, just add me on Discord > AFDragon#7702. Looking forward to hear from you","replies":[]}]}
