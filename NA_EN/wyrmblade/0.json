I'm a {{champion:33}} Rammus main therefor I'm sooooo used to playing a tanky champion that Sol's semi-tankiness somewhat helps. Don't get me wrong she's Definitely more reliable Full AP with Standard Builds but being squishy annoys me therefore I play her tankier than most. For example I ACTUALLY tend to use Courage of the Colossus when support in Summoner's Rift because Q and R proc it, BUT I do usually go Storm Raiders Surge Or Thunderlords, although I don't find it that necessary IF I have Magic penetration in my Runes or +4,5%MS(MoveSpeed) Runes. \n\nAnyways IDK if this is a trend but {{champion:136}} is FANTASTIC for Twisted Treeline 3v3 JG{{summoner:11}}Aurelion Sol's mobility allows her to roam freely through the map (I don't recommend JG in Summoner's Rift). The 3v3 map IS smaller Comet of Legend(E) Allows you to get to the Altars A LOT quicker and their are less monster camps which I Also find easier to kite so your clear speed is quicker. You also take less DMG than you would in the Summoner's Rift SO that's GOOD LoL. Since this map tends to have more Heavy AD champs or On-Hit AP champs the tankiness of the JG builds helps tremendously. I've tried pretty much every Build you  can think of & ARMOR does come in handy, FULL AP builds make you WAY too squishy\n\nPossible Builds↓\n{{item:1402}} {{item:3009}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3030}} {{item:3151}} \n{{item:1402}} {{item:3009}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3030}} {{item:3001}}\n{{item:1401}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3030}} {{item:3116}}  \n{{item:1401}}{{item:3020}} {{item:3029}} {{item:3090}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3060}} \n\n\n                                        Boots & Items MAY vary depending on matchup\n                                          These are just some of my few favorite ones\n \n\nIT'S VIABLE\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/epicrapbattlesofhistory/images/e/e8/Just-saying.gif/revision/latest?cb=20140929093455","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2016-11-18T01:30:25.308+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any plans for fervor?","replies":[]},{"poster":"notice me Sin pi","date":"2016-11-18T06:01:15.120+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"it's just ridiculous how AoE cc like alistar Q or amumu R grant same amount of shield as single-target cc abilities like elise E (spider form) on same number(1) of target\n\nedit: elise E human form","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2016-11-18T11:17:48.597+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elise's stun on E is in human form.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Huebone","date":"2016-11-18T13:55:18.041+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a suggestion, the only problematic champions I've personally seen with it are those who dive in without being that tanky, or having a shield that's hard to deal with in a short duel in lane(especially if they stack with another shield already), so why not make it bonus HP%?

While he still works as a jungler (albeit just about any other CC tank is better apart from mao) I feel any further nerfs to his base dmg/Shield or his CC's duration's/intensities (which is basically his identity) will force him out of every position.\n\nAssuming one or more of the above is implemented: He won't be able to clear the jungle(dmg/shield)//gank as well (CC), will lack utility compared to other supports and will be outright cringe worthy up top (But I wouldn't mind that, he is anti fun due to his early game lockdown. Just try and do it without crushing jungle naut)\n\nFor the first suggestion, which would come down to stronger cc=stronger shield:\n1. Suppression/stasis  **Due to the tiny amount of users (bard, WW, skarner, malz) and generally single target usage it sits at the top of the food chain**\n2. Stun/charm/fear/flee  **The final 3 are isolated cases and generally only affect one person, once in a team fight/engagement, hence why they get more oomf**\n3. snare **There aren't many cases but due to Naut's blatant abuse case it's lower on the spectrum**\n4. displacement spell (airborne)   **Easily the most common form of CC and the easiest to apply**\nThe shield strength goes from strongest to weakest in descending order, the harder the CC and the more isolated the usage.... the stronger the shield is. Pretty straight forward.\n5. Any point+click CC spell grants 15% less shielding as the base amount\n\nAs for the time window. I mean the moment you damage an enemy champion, you have X seconds to get AS MUCH shield as you can before it goes on (perhaps a longer) cool-down by applying as much CC in that time frame. This could be implemented along with suggestion one, allowing SPECIFIC CC values to be tweaked for certain abuse cases (EG naut and leo both using stuns). \n\nDiminishing returns. I feel this is counter intuitive to the entire purpose of CoC so it's really a \"we don't have a choice\" option to punish reckless CC spam.\n\n\nAny opinions you can off would be great, \n\nThanks for visitin the boards Wav3Break {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
