It looked like the other person had ~3 alternate accounts or 3 dedicated friends. 8 is ridiculous, and I know Riot tries to manage that. I've also watched the pattern of downvotes on the boards and seen that at certain periods the boards just get a stupid amount of downvotes on *every* post, and then it is reverted a little while later. I don't know if this is simply a strange pattern that occurs normally, or if people purposely downvote everything, but it is noticeable.","replies":[{"poster":"regonas","date":"2016-04-25T22:35:30.125+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrimsonCobra3,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=bdYW0yfn,comment-id=000600020000000000000001,timestamp=2016-04-25T22:25:22.899+0000)\n\nJust saying as thing happened.\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ncmOWUg7-champion-concept-nighto-the-spirit-of-suffering\nthis concept in 1 minute went from +2 to -6. While it is still bizarre how Riots allows downvote button to exists, it is no mystery, how something could get 8 downvotes in 1 minute - one person with many alts.\nSame thing, but in opposite spectrum, is with Vorazun. While i accidentally saw it, but he posted a concept and in 2 minutes he got 6 upvotes.\n\nCall me crazy, but this feel connected. 8 downvotes out of nowhere in 1 minute, 6 upvoted in nearly same amount of time, also from nowhere. Maybe it is me, maybe i am the crazy one. Maybe people truly are that coordinated, log in the exact same time, upvote and downvote exact same thing. Maybe they are chinese, because in china's army they have very good coordination and follow commands perfectly.","replies":[{"poster":"Vorazun","date":"2016-04-26T00:53:46.779+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"You call me a creator of strawmen when you are the one propagating the hypocrisy.
