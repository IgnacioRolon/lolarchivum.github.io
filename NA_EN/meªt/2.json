However near his estate was a gnarled tree of unknown specimen. It was said that the tree was planted there as a beautiful sapling by the orchard owner&#039;s grandfather, long before the Great War had swept over their nation leaving nothing but destruction and death in it&#039;s path. \r\n\r\nThe grandfather had perished in the war, not from fighting but from suicide after seeing the family orchard being pillaged. He had locked his son in a bunker, who emerged many years later to see nature take it&#039;s course, and thousands of young trees taking the place of their fallen ancestors. He then had discovered a horrible sight; his father had hung himself on the beautiful tree that he planted as a child. He had cut his father&#039;s decaying corpse down and layed him to rest next to the tree, to serve as a living gravestone for the man.\r\n\r\nHowever as the years past, the leaves of the tree had fallen, never to grow back, and the bark had turned from a vibrant brown into a darkened purple that had a toxic look to it. The tree was seen by many specialists who did not know how to treat it, as they did not know even where the tree could have originated from. \r\n\r\nAppearing as if it were just clinging to life, the tree had shortened in stature and gnarled into a hideous shape. The wife of the orchard owner was insisting that he remove it, as it was lowering the value of the property, and had started to emit a pungent stench. However he remained vigilant and refused, as it was the gravestone to his grandfather.\r\n\r\nOne day, she had enough. Late in the depths of night while the owner was innocently sleeping, she had brought bags of salt and rat poison to the base of the tree, intending to secretly poison it&#039;s roots and end it&#039;s existance once and for all.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nWhen the owner woke the next day, it was not next to his beloved wife. He called and searched for her throughout the house, and when he determined she had to be outside, he was witness to the most horrible thing that he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nHer severed, bloodied head, stuck on a branch lodged in the dirt of where his grandfather&#039;s tree should have been. The tree had disappeared, leaving no trace of where it could have gone. \r\n\r\nDeath was not the ending of this story however. The owner&#039;s orchards had produced the most beautiful fruits that anyone in the country had even seen, larger than a cantaloupe and more numerous than the leaves on the trees. During the profitable harvest however, the owner had made a curious discovery; upon each of the trees in his orchard was a single purple gnarl, at the base. \r\n\r\n{{champion:57}}\r\n\r\n-SquishyTentacles","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-25T16:52:36.573+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, SquishyTentacles (good name, though tentacles are never a good sign)\n\nI like the idea of writing an alternative origin story for Maokai, and I think you have got the seed (get it?) of a really cool story there :D  \n\nWhat I could recommend, if you want to do some more work on it, is upping the stakes a little.  For example - it seems somewhat extreme for an otherwise stable man with a family (and a bunker!) to commit suicide because soldiers are taking his fruit.  If, instead, that moment involved the old man having to distract the rampaging soldiers, while his grandchildren escape to the bunker unseen - then that might seem more believable.  Or push the stakes even higher - have the grandfather come to the grandson's rescue when the soldiers are there to kill the men and boys of fighting age, and kidnap the women.\n\nThis sacrificial act on the part of the grandfather would give greater meaning to the grandson's need to honor his memory and the tree - as well as give the impression that the tree (Maokai) was the result of terrible violence and injustice that cannot go unanswered.\n\nI found the bunker surprising (Do people have bunkers in Runeterra?  Enough food and water to last years??) but I understand that you needed time to pass for the new trees to grow.  \n\nLastly, grisly as it seems, I'm not sure that a corpse hung from a tree would actually stay... um... intact through years.  I'd imagine that rotting and weather and carrion birds would have reduced him to a scattered pile of bones fairly quickly - unless magic was involved.\n\nOverall there are a lot of cool ideas in there, and I was happy to read it! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Meªt","date":"2015-07-25T19:27:53.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bioluminescence (literally one of my FAVORITE biological processes, ever since I saw the cool-blue squid on the beaches of Japan. So beautiful. The only thing that would make your name better is adding Tentacles at the end c;)\n\nThanks for the feedback! I wrote this in the spur of the moment, so you understand that a lot of the more nitty-gritty could get passed over. Just as some context to my thought processes: \n\n the story doesn't necessarily take place in Runeterra, although it completely could. I was thinking more along the lines of World War 1, and the nation could be the innocent country of Zubrowka (+2 cool points if you get the reference). The Great War could be the first Rune War (canon still? idk tbh), if we want to put it within the league universe. \n\nI bet there was some form of bunker in the Rune Wars, let's be srs. LOADS of magical energy dropping upon the nations of Valoran, people probably want to build bunkers to not be accidently zapped by a Rune Prison {{champion:13}} \n\nAnd by pillage, I meant burn and completely annihilate, not just cherry picking for food. The owner's orchards completely ruined, not a single tree left. If you spend your entire life dedicating your time and work to growing fruit for your community, and it's suddenly all gone, I mean some emotions would come through. But your ideas are really good, I'm considering re-writing this!\n\nHaha, I completely missed the fact that corpses decay faster than what I was imagining when I wrote this. When I was doing that part, I was imagining like a Draugr from Skyrim. \n\nThanks for giving me your seeds (get it??.. wait.. oh god) for enhancing this story, I appreciate it! :D\n\n-{{champion:161}}","replies":[]}]}]}
