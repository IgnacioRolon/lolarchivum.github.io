I will continue the series with {{champion:31}} ! I might be making these too quickly, maybe I'll start making these a series since the Draven one exploded, and the Yasuo and Nasus ones got attention but not nearly as much. \n\nDisclaimer since I feel I need one: THESE ARE FOR FUN, DO NOT TAKE THESE WITH 100% SERIOUSNESS PLES BOSS (75% serious max cap). \n\n**Classic Cho'Gath {{champion:31}}**\nAs with all Classic skins, there are two possibilities that could arise from owning such a skin.\n1. Beware free-week (lets be real we all own cho'gath), as the sudden popularity of Cho'Gath (I'm looking at YOU BJERGSEN :'c) has sprouted the non so common champion to being one of the top ban/picks of thie meta. With this popularity comes the new-comers, with new-comers comes the mistakes, and with the mistakes comes your rage and anger, because a cho that goes AP mage and no tank with 0 stacks is coming to your late-game soon c:\n2. If you see a Classic Cho'Gath in ranked, I'm sorry. There really is no difference between these two options, these Cho'Gaths want to simply resurrect those 1337 Bjerg plays, and will a majority of the time, fail. Rupture-Flash-Silence-Feast onto a Zed just like Bjerg did? Easy right? You'll find that this mentality will soon land you in some muddy water. \n\n**Nightmare Cho'Gath {{champion:31}}*\nThe Cho'Gath of your nightmares. No, seriously. \n08:21 [All] 14cmganja420: report this lee, literally camping bot won't come no communication\n15:33 [All] 14cmganja420: wtf!! should i buy a tent for you? stay in silver scrub\n20:45 [All] 14cmganja420: lol team wont ff, who wants free kills\n\nMid, Top, Jungle, you name it. Doesn't matter the role, the only way you're going to win that game is to camp that lane. \n\n**Gentleman Cho'Gath{{champion:31}}**\nAlthough the price tag on this skin is generous, don't let the idea that only a skilled Cho wields this skin, because lo and behold, the Gentleman Cho'Gath skin is a JUICY contradiction (starburst commercial of fancy scottish ppl for those who don't.. nvm). These Gentlemen are probably going to be the saltiest players that you encounter, BUT YOU WON'T KNOW IT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. They will start off the game without a word, cursing every death and mistake under their breathes, and not in chat, but once a mistake by a teammate ends up benefiting his laning foe, then it'll begin. Sure the Cho is good at what he does, but if you want to keep your sanity intact, never forget about the /mute button. \n\n**Loch Ness Cho'Gath{{champion:31}}**\nA rare beauty it is. Loch Ness Cho'Gaths are a sight to marvel at, because you'll almost never see one. And they are almost always NOT TOO BAD at League of Legends. The reason why I say that it is one of the rarest is because the only time you'll see one is when they try to coordinate abyssal-oceanic champions together. Loch Ness Cho'Gath will usually accompany a Deep Sea Kog'Maw, a Deep Terror Thresh, and maybe sometimes if you're lucky... A Deep One Kass. \n\n**Jurassic Cho'Gath{{champion:31}}**\nJurassic Cho'Gath is the representation of a wonderful summoner. Congratulations, you have a homie who loves playing League, but more importantly, loves playing Cho'Gath. Not only will they be a great person to be with, but they'll be key to your victory. Add them and play with them more to delevop a fruitful relationship (and an unintentional Friendly banner abuse). Their humor is very controversial and unconventional so sometimes you'll say wtf instead of laughing, but realize that it only builds to their character. So laugh, my friend, because I guarentee that you won't. \n\n**Battlecast Prime Cho'Gath{{champion:31}}**\nHere we go. You're in your S2 promos for the 3rd time, because the past two times you've either had a Riven who told you, \n[00:41] KLSaruGamer: Hey, I'm in Gold 5 but I'm trying to lose to duo with my Bronze 5 friend so I'll be intentionally feeding (real player who said real thing, name is slightly changed so I won't get flagged for anything).\nor a Yasuo who never connected (grr..), and on you're first game you see this Cho'Gath. You tell your team that this is your series and you wish your team good luck and ask for coordination, and get responses from 3 players... but not from this Cho'Gath. He instead says 'invade, come' and your team follows sketchily. 45 seconds later you walk out with 2 kills to Cho, and the entire game is just his continual roaming and killing. He doesn't say a WORD to you, just continues getting larger and larger until it is literally conceivable that he is capable of 1v5ing. Battlecast Prime is the epitome of gameplay, the DEFINITION of smurf, and has what is known as silent charisma. Congratulations on your freelo. \n\nTHANK THANK THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK LEAGUE COMMUNITY /KINDLEJACK. \n\nHave a nice day~ SquishyTentacles{{champion:161}} \n\nLink to my other threads:\n{{champion:119}}:http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/XKiI2khW-draven-skins-and-what-they-tell-about-the-players?show=flat\n {{champion:157}}:http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/1UiMgHKa-yasuo-skins-and-what-they-tell-about-their-players\n {{champion:75}} :http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/gtijOM2A-nasus-skins-and-what-they-tell-about-their-players","replies":[{"poster":"Buttigieg 2020","date":"2015-05-13T00:16:02.485+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"DO ZAC NEXT oh wait.....","replies":[{"poster":"Meªt","date":"2015-05-13T03:31:42.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bussinessbacca,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=11N7ELgE,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-05-13T00:16:02.485+0000)\n>\n> DO ZAC NEXT oh wait.....\n\nI would love to!! oh wait......","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2015-05-13T17:46:18.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EZ\n\nBase Zac:\nCareful of these guys espicially on free week as they are terrible zacs\n\nSpecial weapon zac:\nThese guys just wasted 975 on a recolor gg\n\nCustom zac skins:\nMajin buu Zac:\nAuto GG, pity the enemy for this guy is a beast :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Berry Állen","date":"2015-05-12T20:50:04.645+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should do {{champion:11}} skins xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-07-08T07:53:28.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Jurassic Cho'Gath is the representation of a wonderful summoner.
