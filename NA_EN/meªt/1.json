Can expect mediocre to lackluster play, but he won't feed. He'll just be VERY VERY focused on gaining Adoration. Don't worry about him too much, just have your Jungler gank to cash in those stacks. \r\n\r\nSoul Reaver Draven: A very self conscious Draven. Soul Reavers will usually erupt on you if you even mention their CS/Stack count and will have the largest ego that you'll see. Don't speak to a Soul Reaver, but acknowledge his presence and give him praise, or else expect the Salt Reaver. \r\n\r\nGladiator Draven: You know you've found a good Draven when you have a Gladiator on your team. Gladiator Draven WANTS to win. Gladiator Draven is CAPABLE of CARRYING the team to victory. If your team loses, you cannot blame his Draven mechanics, because chances are, those weren't the reasons for your defeat. \r\n\r\nPrimetime Draven: You have found probably the most charismatic and mirthful character on your team if you see the Primetime. His Draven skills aren't bad, they aren't spectacular, but his humor is IMPECCABLE. You will be laughing with tears from this Draven's sense of humor, whether it be in defeat, in victory or just in the laning phase. You will thumbs up Primetime for being a good sport, even if he does feed, because he has the unnatural ability to make people laugh in League of Legends. \r\n\r\nw00t{{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Meªt","date":"2015-05-10T21:14:56.296+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this gets enough attention, I'll start making more, starting with {{champion:75}} {{champion:157}} and{{champion:63}} .\n\nHave good ideas swimming for them","replies":[{"poster":"Franco Sanchez","date":"2015-05-11T07:40:12.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TheFameAnimal","date":"2015-05-11T09:44:29.250+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh pls not that word, ANYTHING BUT THAT WORD! xD","replies":[{"poster":"Franco Sanchez","date":"2015-05-11T20:43:10.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right.
