I&#039;m so tired of having this over-tuned and NOT fun to play against champion having 9 kills and then <Removed  by Moderation> from another lane. The excuse for garen having such good numbers in his abilities was &quot;Better players can play around him&quot;. Where is that excuse when he is the #1-2 top laner in EVERY SINGLE ELO from bronze to challenger. Why is a noobtube champion meant to introduce the player to the game the most effective laner to climb for multiple patches. Even when I played garen a couple times to test, I DEMOLISHED. 4 games of garen with 0 prior games and 4+ kda&#039;s every single game running it down top and mid lane like a monkey until we won. It wasn&#039;t even fun, it felt unfun to be so overtuned on such a simple champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Salvor Hardın","date":"2018-07-25T11:45:25.829+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"53.88% in Platinum+ games........","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-07-25T12:11:00.289+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Salvor Hardın,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RdEYy7EH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-25T11:45:25.829+0000)\n>\n> 53.88% in Platinum+ games........\n\n52% plat+\n\n49.7% diamond+\n\nso the answer is no. he might still be popular because of his skin at the moment, but hes not op.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-07-25T19:39:13.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey OP, we deleted a small portion of your post for violating the Universal Rules regarding Mature Content.
