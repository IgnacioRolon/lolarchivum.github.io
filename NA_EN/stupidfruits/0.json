Whenever I sign into the client, the whole client lags and i can't do anything in it.  Please help.  I don't know what to do.\r\nAgain, it was working a week ago, until i updated my computer.  I think the Windows 10 update might have messed with the client, but I really don't know.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-27T21:58:34.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand correctly, your client is not functioning after you login so you can't use chat or hit the Play button?  This could be due to any third party programs that interact poorly with league.  If you have any apps running like play.tv, overwolf, or lolrecorder remove them.  \n\nIf your issue persists, I also recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide in case your network is having issues staying connected to the client, which would cause this unresponsiveness.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"StupidFruits","date":"2016-09-28T20:59:48.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried turning off the firewall, and it partially worked.  The client is continuing to lag some, but I have to say, it has gotten better.  I don't think playing in a PvP match is an option right now.  Is there anything else that I can do on my computer to try and fix the problem?\n\nAlso, I can now hit the play button and I can chat in my clubs now.  Just want to see if I can reduce the lag even more.","replies":[{"poster":"StupidFruits","date":"2016-09-28T21:29:43.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to let you know, my client seems to have fixed itself!  I just entered the client, and it didn't lag at all.  I even went into a custom game, and no lag was experienced.  I'll let you ,or someone else at Riot, know if something goes wrong again.  Thanks a lot for your help on this issue.  ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}]}
