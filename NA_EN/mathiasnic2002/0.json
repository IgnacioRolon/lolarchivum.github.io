I left my computer for 2 minutes or something, but when I came back, I said I could reconnect. I didn't think about it and played the game on.\r\nWhen the game had ended, we had won, but it said I left the game, unfortunately, didn't read the whole message, and continued on, because we won, and I did not think it would have any effect, but later on, I found out I had to wait 10 minutes before I could queue, I thought this only counted for 3 games, but I have played 4 games now, and nothing has happened.\r\n\r\nI want to know how many games I have to play before it goes away.\r\n\r\nThanks, Mathias :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-21T16:18:22.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mathias, it sounds like your account has received a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) lower priority queue.  This will happen after a history of leaving matches, setting you with a white timer for a set amount of matches.  You'll want to play through the required games to remove the leaverbuster.  Consistency is key though, if leaving or being AFK keeps up then the timer and required games will get higher!","replies":[]}]}
