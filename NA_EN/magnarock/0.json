In addition, every single time I log into my account, I get the \"Trying To Reconnect\" message. Waiting for several minutes (5-10) usually successfully logs me in, but the first win of the day quest does not reappear. I am playing on the Mac client and have tried reinstalling, initiating a full repair, and using the Hextech Repair Tool. None of these have worked.\n\nThanks for any help you can give.\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}\n\nEdit 11/14: Problem seems to have fixed itself, on both fronts...\n\nLogin happens immediately and the first win of the day is back. I feel like the two issues are connected. If the login issues happen again I will update again.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-11-16T00:02:54.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update, and sorry for the delayed response here; we're sorta drowning lately with preseason requests.\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}} \nIt's good to know that the connection trouble seems to have eased up with logins, but as for the 1st win of the day, were you making sure to give a full 22 hrs between each time the mission came up? Just makin' sure!","replies":[{"poster":"Magnarock","date":"2017-11-17T00:01:41.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, when I made the post I had been waiting for 2 full 24 hour periods from my last First Win mission. If the \"Trying to Reconnect\" error ever pops up after a login attempt, the mission doesn't seem to reappear.\n\n The problem is definitely tied to the connection issues (probably a preseason issue as well, not too big of a deal as far as I'm concerned). I've noticed that relogging after getting the \"Trying to Reconnect\" message and not getting the First Win mission usually results in the mission popping back up after a successful login.\n\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}} \n\nA little bit annoying, but definitely not a big deal, as the game still functions perfectly well even if the mission doesn't show up. Thanks for the response.","replies":[]}]}]}
