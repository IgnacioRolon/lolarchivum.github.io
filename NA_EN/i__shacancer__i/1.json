My client started to repair leaving me in lower priority queue. My laptop has battery problems so whenever it unplugs it powers off. leaving me in lower priority queue a tad more than others. PLEASE LIFT THIS UNFAIR QUEUE OFF MY ACCOUNT. Please and thanks! Much love from this Kat main!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-29T18:44:22.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know your leaving isn't intentional, but the system treats everyone equally because all leaves still causes other players a negative experience.  It's good that the client was able to repair the corrupt files, but I suggest testing it in a custom game just to make sure.  Your best bet would be to resolve whatever is causing these leaves, even if it means looking into another battery and play through those games.  Let me know if that clears things up, and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"I  ShaCancer  I","date":"2017-06-29T19:02:02.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay but this lower priority queue wasnt on me. it was on your guys update.... so how is this my fault?","replies":[]}]}]}
