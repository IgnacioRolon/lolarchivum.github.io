Whether it's well-deserved or not, I leave it up to you guys. What I find frustrating is how the community reacts with one another and how Rioters have handled the flak.\n\nI've started playing since Season 2. I quit for awhile, and came back around the middle of Season 3 and have stuck around since then. I used to only be a top laner back then, but have now become familiar with all the roles (ADC being my worst). I am a jungle main since my friends usually shove me into that role for the most part.\n\nI really love and hate Season 5 so far. I love that mages are being brought back to their season 2 roots where you actually ran out of mana, yet I hate how strong mana-less champions have become in doing so. I love that the new jungle gives smite bonuses, how new dragon and baron function, and even the new little vision crab. I hate how I can't jungle anymore as anyone but Fiddlesticks and J4 if I want to have any impact on the game (rip Assassin Noc, I mained thee well...I hope?) I really love all Riot's done for the players, but I also hate how little they meaningfully interact with us (PBE changes will go through no matter what, red posts mostly show up either to quell a negative reaction or to talk about poros). I love the new rift, but I hate the retcon (League of Legends doesn't exist) that came around the same time as it. I love how awesome, united, and hilarious our community can be at times, but I hate how toxic and immature it can be as well. I think I've stomped this love-hate relationship, so I'll move on.\n\n@Rioters: Look, I get it. Rioters are humans just like us; but several of their mistakes in the past have yet to be mended. A person can only have so much patience, especially in this community. My faith with y'all is like a roller-coaster at this point. Right now, it's probably at the lowest point, and I can only hope it climbs from here. What really ruined my faith with y'all is the discovery that our feedback in PBE has little to no say on some changes (I.E. Sona, Cassiopeia), and especially with how the retcon of the League of Legends was handled by Riot Opeli (I'm still salty about the situation, and how she handled the twitter posts, btw). However, I want to especially thank the rioters who do respond back to feedback meaningfully, or are just plain awesome to the community (looking at you, KateyKhaos, even when you had to be the bearer of bad news on Sweetheart Annie and particle effects \n\n@The Community: I also get it. We're gamers, and we really love this game. The idea of this game potentially going downhill is really scary. We get passionate and start getting vocal with raised pitch-forks at Rito, hoping the problem will be solved. Even I am a part of this mob at times, cause I really love this game. \n\nThere's not really much else I can say to y'all, cause we all think differently. I just wish we could get along better. To all the QQ-ers, just have a little bit of reason and understand the situation Rito's in with all the changes as of late. To all the \"Stahp QQ'ing, Riot's human, etc.\" realize that QQ-ers are also human, too.\n\nTL;DR: Just a jumbled post of my feelings on the current state of League of Legends. I feel it's a big love-hate relationship with everyone, to put it in a nutshell. But seriously, just read this, it's not as long-winded of a read it could have been. \n\nFeel free to share your feelings on my post, about so-and-so champ being op, or whatever you want. I'm honestly expecting this to get downvoted, especially after half my post got deleted. ; _ ; (Rito boards, plz.) And to all who've read this, I wish you a good day.\n\nEdit: Hope it's okay to put this under Miscellaneous. Don't want all the hardwork in this to get deleted... ; _ ; And no clue what happened with the picture. Still kind of new to posting on boards.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-01-30T20:39:12.152+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously, if every department had a Kateykhaos, Riot would be such a better company.","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper Felix","date":"2015-01-30T20:48:54.001+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"KateyKhaos is love.

I personally am guilty of being swayed by these popular views, as well as expressing some very strong and exaggerated opinions myself.\n\nThis isn't to say that I don't think the game has glaring issues; perhaps I'm just more optimistic than most people (I've seen changes that I personally suggested on Boards make their way into the game). It does always surprise me when I see a Red post come up on a thread that got buried under all the QQ threads.","replies":[{"poster":"missinggrave","date":"2015-02-01T04:28:45.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may - or may not have - been slightly and entirely swayed towards the, \"AHRI GOT NERFED WHERE IS MY ASSASSIN BB\" QQ opinion. So I can see what you're saying too. I think it may be safe to say that because of the extremes that we see with either white knights or warring mobs, Riot has a hard time finding what they can see as true constructive criticism.\n\nHowever, on that same note, Riot should still know that if almost the ENTIRE community mutually agrees on something and they refuse to resolve the matter it can have an effect on whether or not we trust them as a company at times. It's one thing to ignore controversial issues due to the fact that they usually resolve themselves, but I really wish that we saw more things get reverted back to the way they originally were if the community as a whole requests it (( #BetterNerfSona )).","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-02-01T16:18:26.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, it's also difficult to tell whether people expressing these particular opinions are informed about the topic, or if they're just armchair theorists (something I get accused of every once in a while, since I'm not great at the game nor do I really play that much; I do think however, that my opinion is fairly well informed much of the time because I'm largely echoing lessons I learn from more informed sources, such as coaches or high elo players).\n\nThere is also the misconception that the entire community of Boards is representative of the entire LoL community; even though there's quite a bit of traffic here, it's still a drop in the bucket when you take into account that overseas players often aren't posting here (aside from EU and OCE; I don't see many Chinese or Korean accounts on here, for example), let alone the other 70 million players that don't use forums, etc. If a post on here gets like 200 upvotes, that post is considered super popular, but on the subreddit, it isn't uncommon for posts to get 1000-3000 upvotes, and still that isn't representative of the LoL community since a lot of people (myself included) don't even have a reddit account.\n\nThis is an unpopular opinion, but I do generally agree with Riot's approach where they give more weight to a good argument than majority opinion when it comes to balance. Of course there are still mistakes made but I think far less than if they pander solely to popular opinion; I see stupid ideas get tons of upvotes every day.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reaper Felix","date":"2015-01-31T00:55:41.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I definitely know that feeling.

Got destroyed in a recent game by one who only had Blade of the Ruined King and Runaan's Hurricane and she was jumping all over the place. I feel the only justified nerf is to keep her passive \"hopping\" be constant no matter the direction she goes, even if it's towards an enemy champion.\n\n{{champion:89}} I'm kind of happy with where she stands. If you want a cc machine support, she fits the niche (Alistar/Braum being a close contenders if we're talking meta/conventional supports, otherwise Nautilus support is where it's at baby!). The only thing I'm not a big fan of for her kit is if your team's ahead, she will make winning team fights much more easier, but it's hard whenever the team's behind for her to be useful.\n\n{{champion:201}} Not really sure what you mean by an escape. Are you talking about his ability to hop to allies/minions (ala Katarina/Lee Sin/Jax, but without ward hopping)? His ability to disengage with Q (versus Nami/Janna Q)? The movement speed boost from his E (versus Sona's E)? Not really sure why you're singling out Braum specifically, but I don't think any support should be a living sacrifice.\n\nTimes have changed in league, and I used to think like that as well. But with gold changes for supports, I think they definitely deserve a little love in building towards a late game fantasy, than being just a sacrifice/cheerleader for the team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2015-01-31T15:54:39.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Idon't get why people keep on complaining about Sona, she's getting buffed on the pbe, they just wanted to decrease her damage output. As a Sona mid player, sometimes her damage output can be ridiculous, late game her Q power chords could almost oneshot somebody, now it increases the variety, but then again her slow with 700 ap is 70% so (still lots of burst there and most likely a dead adc). I didn't care about the damage amount decreases, but I did hate the movespeed nerf because it decreases your harass range during the laning phase so you can't keep on poking. Just to let you know what they were buffing is her movespeed back base health and mana regen (last I checked) check the pbe for yourself, i believe it was the same patch they added the marauder skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper Felix","date":"2015-01-31T17:18:01.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yeah, the movement speed nerf was definitely uncalled for, imo. I don't have the full context on why they did it, but I have a strong feeling it was because of her E, which they should have nerfed instead. I think the major concern is Sona becoming even squishier than before post-level 4 in trade off of having 15 more hp at lvl 1. I just find it really weird how Riot was against the notion of Sona being super aggressive in lane, but did little-to-nothing to changing how her Q works (other than the whole aura rework, which I think was a step in the right direction of more meaningful gameplay)","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-02-01T06:37:30.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Reducing her [E] basically meant making it of less use to her teammates and/or herself, so they \"fixed\" part of the problem by reducing her MS.\n\nDidn't even feel it. It was such an insignificant change that they're already reverting it on the PBE.\n\nI don't even know why in the fuck they are giving her better early game stats, but then again it could make her hyper-powered late-game easier to shut down.\n\nChanging her [Q] is hard. It's iconic and it'll probably never become a skillshot (more like shouldn't ever), so there's very few options left if you insist upon it.","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper Felix","date":"2015-02-01T07:30:40.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Just played a recent game with Sona (been awhile), and yeah, I didn't really feel the movement speed nerf much (or enemy Vayne and Janna didn't capitalize on whenever I went in to harass). I can understand why Riot's nerfing her health post level-4, since after the first back, I honestly expected to start falling off a little in lane, when that was far from the truth. After upgrading the spellthief's and getting a few mana pots, I was still chunking away at Vayne the whole game, to the point she says \"Wow, it takes a lot of skill to just press E (fail) all day as Sona\"\n\nOnly meaningful thing I can think of is keep her early game strong but tie her late game more to her ult/initiates versus having raw damage on her Q + Autos.

Puts focus on her support role, there's less collateral from the second projectile, and she may even get a slight power boost into the late-game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
