Glitch?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, sometimes when I connect to a game I am stuck in Fountain by some kind of \"Invisible wall\".\nI can flash over it, but then there's a second \"invisible wall\".\nI can teleport to a tower, but then there's a circular \"invisible wall\" around the tower i teleported too.\nEveryone else can leave to their lanes normally but I'm blocked by that wall.\nIt mainly happens on taliyah, but also happened on camille today.\n\nI usually leave the game in that case so that they can surrender without loosing LP. but now I got low priority queue for 5 games, which i haven't gotten since about 1 and a half years, and this is kind of pissing me off, given that this is not my fault.\nNever had problems with my internet speed in anything. Coputer is virus free. All backgroundtasks are closed when i play league. I tried redownlaoding league, but nope, stil not fixed. And pc specks are way above what is needed to play League.\n\nSo if anyone knows what this is, why this is happening or how to fix it, please tell me, cause it's really annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T23:57:56.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could be having a connection problem that's failing to communicate your actions to the game server, so you're kind of just stuck there.
