Why can't we have like a mallet wielding aoe based melee carry, with comparatively terrible single target damage and who is terrible in duels but with twitch-ult level aoe that can tear a team down as fast as fiddle if he is allowed free reign?\r\n\r\nHydra is only 60-20% attack damage bonus damage based on distance from the wielder, so even with 400 ad it is only 240 to 80 damage per auto and hardly enough aoe damage to compare with rumble or twitch or fiddles.\r\n\r\nI want an AOE based physical sustained damage melee carry. Why does every melee carry have to be a duelist? Its so boring.","replies":[]}
