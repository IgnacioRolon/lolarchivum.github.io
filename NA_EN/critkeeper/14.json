The natural counter to a tank should be strong disengage because the cooldown on the active durability would focus him to play a more timid role if the engage was unsuccessful.\n\nAn assassin should be able to threaten a tank that is roaming around in the jungle, and although not necessarily kill the tank, atleast force him to use an active and make a window for his team to play on.\n\nIf it comes down to a fight between a tank and any damage dealer, whether sustained or burst, a tank with all his actives going ought to be unassailable. The counterplay should be time and knowing when to fight and when not to fight, not \"just focus him\". The whole point of playing a tank is to absorb focus fire.\n\nWindows of high moments and low moments are more interesting to play around and with than a strictly passive increase in durability, the same way ghostblade active and temporary steroids like kogmaw bioarcane barrage or intermittent nukes like shiv are more interesting to play around and with than a strictly passive increase in damage like phantom dancer.\n\nHere are some example actives:\n\n* a shield equal to your bonus health, lasts for 3 seconds + 1 second for every 50 bonus armor.\n* flat damage block equal to your magic resist for 1 seconds + 1.5 second for every 1000 bonus health.\n* damage reduction versus area of effect equal to the higher of your physical damage mitigation or magic damage mitigation for 1 second + 2.5 seconds for every 1000 bonus health.","replies":[{"poster":"Eapenator","date":"2014-08-21T15:18:42.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot of champions already have this (singed,malphite, maokai, alistar, rammus, leona etc) so I don't really see the point you are making. \n\nIf you are trying to make a point about how Fighters are taking the roles of tanks, or marksman are destroying tanks, look at top lane. Maokai, alistar are currently top tier picks. Braum and Thresh are the kings of bottom lane?","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-21T12:58:27.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, doing this would increase the effectiveness of mobility, which is already getting kinda out of hand.  People would just disengage whenever possible and re-engage when your CD is off, like they do to the easily kited champs with shields.  I think this is also one of the main problems with playing tanky junglers right now.  Mobile Junglers can just come counter jungle whenever they want, because your damage is not so threatening that they can't just jump over a wall and be gone before anything bad can happen to them.\n\nI do mostly agree though.  Most tanky champs don't feel that tanky when the mid with DFG shows up and deletes your existence.  I think that is partially in line with how hard some champs can snowball compared to others.  For example, a LB or Xerath that gets kills faster than the rest of the game(and lets face it, that's usually what mids do), will do so much damage with safe gameplay that nobody has a chance anymore without a serious ambush or luck.  Something like this would at least give the generally much less-fed tanky guys a chance to do something when that mid shows up burning through champs like minions.","replies":[]}]}
