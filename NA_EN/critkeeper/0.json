It doesn&#039;t say anything about being immune to damage-- he is just simply immune to death itself for 5 seconds. If his health would be reduced below a certain amount (30, 50, 70), he still takes the damage but his health is instantly reset to that amount, and the damage doesn't kill him because he can't die.\n\nHe takes the true damage, then whether he would die from that or from Urgot &quot;causing him to die regardless of how much health he has left&quot;, he just doesn&#039;t die-- because he is IMMUNE TO DEATH.\n\nEDIT:\n\nApparently this is actually what Urgot's ultimate does:\n\nFirst it deals 100% of the enemy health as true damage, then it deals true damage in powers of 10 until the enemy dies, from 10 to 1,000,000.\n\nSo I guess if you had a 1,111,111 shield, you would survive. Regardless of how it is coded, the idea behind Urgot's ultimate is that it causes the target to die and the idea behind Tryndamere's ultimate is that he is immune to death.\n\nAsking for Urgot's ult to go through Tryndamere's ultimate is like asking for hard crowd control that goes through Olaf's ult.

Meaning if the enemy was low enough, the enemy would die no matter what, even with Tarics, Kayles and Tryndameres ult stacking.\n\nBut they decided against this because they thought it could possibly create too much frustration (Remember the complaints about Camilles ult?

Why should champions who are supposed to be in a state of invulnerability/undying Rage be killed?\n\nThat would just give urgot a counter to a bunch of champs. \nUrgot's ult does 100% current health, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 true damage. \nKayle/taric make your team invulnerable, so they ignore the damage - as intended\nkindred/Trynd's HP can't go below XHP, so they don't go below that  - as intended\nGangplank Disables Supress, and thus disables Urgot's second cast - as intended\n\nCreating a champ just to counter X champion would be bad design tbh.\nLore and Theme are important but Gameplay comes first.\nSometimes it just happens to work out like that. Example: \nShen VS Zed\nrivals, shen counters zed ult, this is ok because in a 1v1 Zed will most likely win because he can dodge most of shen's kit. \n\nThis is good champion interaction compared to lore, they both have the ability to outplay each other.\n\nUrgot can outplay most of them btw, you get like 3 seconds after hitting them. If you ult a Trynd who has ult, he deserves to get out. \nKayle's ult is 2.5 seconds so even if she had it active to block your first cast it'll be down unless you immediatly reactivate like a retard.\n\nwhat i'm trying to say is that countering isn't something to design a champ around (countering classes is fine ex.: malzahar).\nevery execute in the game can be countered in some way, even the 3k dmg veigar ult.
