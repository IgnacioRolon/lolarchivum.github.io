I don't think \"heavy and slow\" has to imply juggernaut. I think people associate it with juggernaut and can't imagine a melee carry with that sort of \"feel\" because all melee carries that have ever been made for this game were narrowly focused on sort of a \"blitz\" approach of doing as much damage as quick as possible to the most important targets, and then likely dying or snowballing from there. But thats basically an assassin with auto attacks.\n\nI want a proper melee carry. One that does the same job that a ranged carry does. Ranged carries can work because range is a defense that allies can amplify with peel and presence. I want to give Tryndamere an array of defensive tools that when used in conjucntion provide his allies the ability to amplify his Time To Battle, the same way his allies might be able to do so for a ranged champion.\n\nI want Tryndamere to feel like an undying brutal badass in fights but even I can see that you can't just give him the raw power to 1v5 enemy teams. You have to gate some of his power behind the strategy and interaction of his allies. I'm okay with that. As long as it means Tryndamere can be more of what he is supposed to be-- a proper melee carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-14T13:52:16.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an idea where instead of being unable to die he can just come back to the rift faster.

Barbarians scornfully reject the fighter traditions of arms training and discipline, instead tapping into a powerful rage that makes them stronger, tougher, and better able to withstand attacks. They only have the energy for a few such displays per day, but it is usually sufficient. Constant exposure to danger also gives barbarians a sort of \"sixth sense,\" a preternatural ability to sense danger and dodge attacks, and their running stamina is legendary. \nProficiencies: armor (light, medium), shields, weapons (martial, simple) \nClass feats: barbarian fast movement, barbarian rage, uncanny dodge, damage reduction\n\nSo light/medium armed raging warrior that dodge attacks and can outrun his enemies.\n\n2.\n> [The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Classes#Barbarian) (back when TES games were class based)\nDescription: Barbarians are the proud, savage warrior elite of the plains nomads, mountain tribes, and sea reavers. They tend to be brutal and direct, lacking civilized graces, but they glory in heroic feats, and excel in fierce, frenzied single combat.\nSpecialization: Combat\nAttributes: Strength, Speed\nSkills: Axe, Medium Armor, Blunt Weapon, Athletics, Block, Acrobatics, Light Armor, Armorer, Marksman, Unarmored\n\nAgain light/medium/none armed raging warrior that dodge attacks and can outrun his enemies.\n\n3.\n>[Heroes of Might and Magic III](http://heroes.thelazy.net/wiki/Barbarian)\nBarbarian hero:\nBarbarians are might heroes of Stronghold. They are little concerned with anything outside the pursuit of military might. Consequently, they advance most quickly in attack based skills and slowly in all others. Barbarians wield massive weapons and wear little armor.\n\nOk this description doesn't tell us much but if you check what are those \"attack based skill\" they \"advance most quickly in\":\n>Offense, Artillery, Ballistics(to destroy enemy walls), Tactics, Scouting, Pathfinding(to move fast), Logistics(to move fast)\n\nHigh offense, low/medium defense, fast army and good siedge.\n\nAnd last but not least:\n4.\n> [Warcraft 3](http://classic.battle.net/war3/orc/)\nDescription: The Horde possesses the game's most powerful ground units, including the savage Grunt and gargantuan Tauren. The Orcish Horde has modest air and ranged capabilities, but their true strength lies in their brute strength and raw melee power. Even the magic of their spellcasters is designed to enhance their frontline troops.\nAnd some of thier skills:\nPillage:\nCertain Orc units can be upgraded to salvage gold and lumber when attacking enemy buildings.\nBloodlust:\nIncreases a friendly unit's attack rate by 40% and movement speed by 25%.\n\nSo yeah, again fast, strong looters.\n\nLooks like trynda fits right into his theme.\n\nOr maybe you have some counter examples?","replies":[{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2016-10-11T20:49:21.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sherogarth,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Vr4sFriN,comment-id=001100000000,timestamp=2016-10-11T19:44:59.995+0000)\n>\n> So yeah, again fast, strong looters.\n> \n> Looks like trynda fits right into his theme.\n> \n> Or maybe you have some counter examples?\n\nDungeons and dragons, Diablo, Everquest, Morrowind are examples. You are entitled to disagree about what the barbarian trope is supposed to be or even if it is consistent with itself. I'm not interested in having a debate about it because I am not personally vested in the idea that the trope must mean one thing or another. I said the trope isn't necessarily aligned, which is trivially true.\n\nWhether it is aligned or is not aligned is incidental and irrelevant because different people will submit to different definitions of the trope, since the trope itself is defined indirectly through the media in which is subsists, but that very same media can't be determined to be appropriate examples of the trope unless you have a definition to make that determination if the first place.

I don't want him to be a huge hulking duplicate of Sion.\n\nI want a melee carry who doesn't attack all that fast but hits extremely hard and wide. There is no reason why every melee carry out there has to attack fast, move fast, and focus squishies-- they just start to feel like auto attack based assassins. \n\nInstead, Imagine a melee carry that moves slow and attacks slow, but has an array of best-in-game defensive TOOLS (not raw stats) that are powerful enough in the ideal circumstances to literally block the entire enemy team's focus fire.\n\nA ranged champion can, with protection, in the ideal circumstances, invalidate the entire enemy team's attempts to counteract. They can leverage their front line and with the assistance of their allies stay just out of lethal range of the enemy team, constantly whittling down enemies that stray near with a flurry of attacks.\n\nI want Trynd to take this approach, except with singularly devastating attacks that strike an area. And instead of \"staying just out of range\" I want him to be IN range of everything the enemy team can throw at him. His defensive tools should be of such caliber that if he is able to leverage his team in order to wield them to their maximum potential, he has just as good a chance of surviving focus fire as slippery ranged champions do.\n\nThe caliber of defense I'm talking about would be like a sword block that has a 2 second cooldown, roots Tryndamere and prevents him from turning, auto attacking, or using spells or abilities while channeling, and blocks everything in a 180 degree in front of him, whether it be crowd control or damage. The enemy could stop the block by getting behind him and either doing so much damage to him he is forced to disengage or ult, or cc him so as to interrupt the channel.\n\nAn ability like that would require him to coordinate with his team, because there are some enemy champions that can get behind him and ruin his day. However, if his team is able to protect his flank, he can single handedly protect his vanguard against anything, anything at all. 2 champs, 5 champs, 5 champs a morde ghosts a clone a bunch of heim turrets a baron and tibbers he just doesn't care. He might not be able to move, turn or attack while he's blocking, but you aren't going to do shit to him unless you approach him from more than one angle or can outmaneuver him one on one.\n\nEssentially I'm looking at this from a different perspective.

Its really frustrating, I know, because it takes way more team coordination to prevent a splitpush than it does to implement one.\n\nI think there is a way to fix this. But all the melee carries RIOT has every put forth are more offensive than defensive. They focus too much on blowing up someone before dying, rather than just pushing out lots of damage on whatever they can reach while NOT dying.\n\nThe latter is the pattern that ranged carries use to survive. I think we can have some melee carries designed around that approach, but they'd have to be slow, squishy, but with game changing, utterly warping defensive abilities that allow them to survive focus from an entire team reliably, repeatedly and persistently under SPECIFIC conditions that both teams struggle to control, with the same amount of conflict that both teams would generally have controlling range vs ranged champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Talisid","date":"2016-10-12T12:34:57.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but then you just have another fighter/bruiser archtype with a tank-shreding ability like Vi or tanky yasuo, and although I think Vi is fun she's not a really a melee carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2016-10-12T17:04:00.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talisid,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Vr4sFriN,comment-id=00040000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-12T12:34:57.615+0000)\n>\n> but then you just have another fighter/bruiser archtype with a tank-shreding ability like Vi or tanky yasuo, and although I think Vi is fun she&#x27;s not a really a melee carry.\n\nI don't think vi has the pattern I specified, she more or less just dives hard, hits hard and dies hard.\n\nYasuo is closer, but he can't go far enough because he tries to be part assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Talisid","date":"2016-10-12T17:28:19.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Critkeeper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Vr4sFriN,comment-id=000400000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-12T17:04:00.932+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think vi has the pattern I specified, she more or less just dives hard, hits hard and dies hard.\n> \n> Yasuo is closer, but he can&#x27;t go far enough because he tries to be part assassin.\n\nIt depends on how you build her. Personally I build a mix of one attack speed item (usually bloodrazor enchant) and tank stats. She grinds tanks down with surprising speed with her built in armor pen and % health shred. I know a lot of people build her as a sort of assasin-type where she just dives the backline and blows somebody up with an AD-Caster type item build, maybe that's stronger but I personally don't enjoy it and my team is usually lacking a tank anyway.{{champion:254}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2017-01-03T21:47:44.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ðelofasht","date":"2016-11-26T21:10:45.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted this in another thread, however I wanted you to hopefully see my thoughts as well, and wasn't sure you would in the other thread.\n\nJust off the top of my head the changes I would suggest would be:\n\nReduces incoming damage for higher fury\nFury used by all skills (not full bar, but some of it)\nPassive Crit removed, using a skill guarantees next attack to be a crit (lower % damage than usual, more when he's at higher fury levels)\nTaking damage gives him some rage when he gets low on health\nUlt make his fury explode around him after a small delay using up his rage and refilling his health (instead of no health and unkillable)\nSlow changed to frontal line with a wide width\nSpin moves much further towards enemies, less so moving away from enemies\n\nJust a brief start, keeping in mind his barbarian theme, and his skills do not require huge changes. . . thematically staying roughly the same, just shifting him from a more assassin style play to a more front line style of play. The playstyle is promoted to move toward the enemies by way of the skills and less so about running away, the small delay on full heal from ult means using it becomes gauging the damage of the enemies for what they are going to deal him very important and the detonation makes him want to be in the group of enemies.

The biggest reason Trynd can't work right now in a team fight is that the enemy team has all the control over when Tryndamere ults, essentially putting him on a timer. You can't expect a champion to be so powerful that he never needs more than 5 (or 7 in your case) seconds to make enough impact to compare with the roster. So I'd prefer if W served him to that end, taking some of the control of when he ults out of the enemies hands and into his allies hands.\n\nThats why I suggested in this thread a stationary channeled sword block that roots him and prevents him from turning but blocks all cc and damage directed at him from one direction. There is clear counterplay here-- get behind him and disrupt him or damage him so much he's forced to move. That kind of weakness can be covered by allies, who can body block and protect Tryndamere's flank. That makes him feel like a proper melee carry, and patently different than the melee carries we currently have.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tyrant Ken","date":"2016-10-14T21:58:39.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Olaf is a good exemple of a barbarian, and he attacks fast, really fast.","replies":[{"poster":"Saph","date":"2016-10-14T22:21:16.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, Olaf is a lot closer to the classical berserker archetype, where he charges in and fights until either he's dead or everything around him is dead.
