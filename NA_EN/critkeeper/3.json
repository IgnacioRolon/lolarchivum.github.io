Ultimately, understanding and building towards the union of what would make designers at Riot happy with the game and also what players find fun, engaging and variant game to game is quite a challenge. \n\nMarksmen have a unique power curve, such that just nerfing them doesn't make much of an impact by itself. By supporting a late game fantasy, it almost by definition makes them quite hard to deal with late game. The balancing factor is that both teams have one, so they kind of neutralise each other. Ideally, most designers would prefer that teams can play variant classes of characters in the \"support lane\", but the way the game is constructed right now, Marksmen are pretty much the way to go due to their tower killing proficiency and late game scaling. \n\nIdeally, the best solution in this space is to find something that both players and designers are aligned on (eg. players feel like all roles have agency, designers feel like you can do any number of meaningfully different strategies to win). \n\nTLDR is that nerfing marksman doesn't automatically solve the problem.

It only means that the Jungler should allocate their time differently, but it has no direct influence on how much a game will snowball.\nb/ Anyway, it's not true. Riot has always been clear that they want to support a variety of strategies and that they don't like when there is a single one that is always best.\n\nSo you can argue about the tuning, you can argue about the specifics.

Another problem is that while mages are definde by their spells, ADCs' main damage output comes from autoattacks, and those work basically the same for most of them, making it difficult to make them really different. I think there are a few ADCs who feel different to play (Graves, Ezreal, Quinn, Twitch, Lucian), but most hypercarries just rely on autoattacking a lot (tristana, kog, jinx, sivir,...)\n\nThis season ardent censer was quite clearly the meta-warper, and it helped ADCs a lot.

Like individually these things are minor but the decision was made to buff the IE + Zeal item spike by making it cheaper when it already was the best dps combo late game, and BoRKs changes made it better for AS based carries who need to survive early game.  Items will affect both the strongest and weakest carries, and there hasn't been a change to anything affecting adc this season other than censer which while getting nerfed is still the strongest support item for the fact its such an efficient on-hit.\n\nI think if Ardent didn't exist hypercarries wouldn't be such a problem since their powerspike would be more delayed, but I think we'd still see lategame focus with how good crit in general is.  However as is the fact supports rush ardent means that when an ADC is at one big item they're actually at 2 big items in-game, which has never been an issue with the class before and totally disrupts the powerspike.  IMO you should just cut AS from Ardent or something that stops it from being a powerspike, I honestly feel the on-hit healing or something defensive would be preferrable as an effect since most support items are cc or defense, its never been an issue until you gave contribution to the powerspike of your carry.  \n\nI know build diversity is important but Ardent has only DECREASED diversity or been a non-option since its inception, which has been a pattern for items that get deleted from the game.  If you want this item to contribute to an ADC's powerspike I think removing its AS component and making it more on-hit based would at least force you to buy a complete AS item to get value out of it without it instantly turning Twitch and Kog into team shredders.  That or you can nerf every AS item that exists or nerf crit as a stat to make the values of Ardent feel fair.  I personally think the existance of crit hurts a lot of playmaking potential ADCs might otherwise be allowed to have early game, so nerfing how much it hurts or how much crit chance is on items may be a suitable option but until Censer is properly dealt with I don't think we're in a good spot to assess ADC balance.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-10-09T17:12:23.973+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But hyper carries weren't used until every crit item got buffed...save Caitlyn ruining everyone's fun.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
