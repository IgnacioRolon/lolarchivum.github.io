If you get snared by Cait, her teammate CCs you, she places another trap and E's away. There is no way you can escape the 5s+ CC unless you burn flash in the inbetween period.\n\nThe point is having a 1s CC shouldn't let an ADC CC you for 4s. The snare should only last like 1.5s at most considering it also marks you for her increased range and higher damage AA.","replies":[{"poster":"Defended","date":"2016-07-13T00:59:06.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jefftiffy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NNsEkZeF,comment-id=00010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-13T00:54:06.337+0000)\n>\n> You don&#x27;t seem to be the one understanding.

Do you want traps to be disabled by _any_ CC?\n\nAnd if you made it so the cooldown was longer than it already is, it would take forever to clear traps after Cait leaves the area/dies.\n\nI can understand if you want to increase the time it takes between dropping traps, though.\n","replies":[]}]}
