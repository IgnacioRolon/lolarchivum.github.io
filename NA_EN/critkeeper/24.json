Instead of having the largest active slow stacking with 35% of the remaining slows multiplicatively (the way it is now)  have it so that only the largest active slow is applied.**_","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2014-08-15T18:44:26.162+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a great discussion.

Anyway, your questions.\n\n> Have we given out so many slows that it dilutes champion diversity?\n\nPotentially.  This is sort of a hidden power kind of problem, because slows affect things so much more than it might seem at face value.\n\n> Should ranged champs with slows be super rare in order to give melee a chance to close?\n\nYes.  Personally, I feel like melee champions should have just as many tools to close as carries have to...uh...open?  I think Ashe's slow is great, as it's basically her way to kite opponents and allow her to keep her distance.  She has no mobility, but she has crowd control to compensate.  The problem arises when you have a champion with range, mobility, crowd control, and disengage all in the same kit.\n\n> Do champs just need a slow these days to keep up with the status quo?\n\nIf they do, they shouldn't.  Slows should be a design choice, not a design requirement.  I don't think champions need a slow to keep up, however.

I'll often be smiling after getting hit, even if I die. Anticipating CC and avoiding it is a fun aspect to me. The \"oh shit!\" of Rammus spinning towards you and needing to shove minions between him and you due to the risk of a mini stun followed by a taunt creates an enjoyable tension. Being able to peel those bursty assassins for your ADC creates a sense of accomplishment. If you're taking out CC because it feels bad to be unable to fight - take out the assassins that can 100-0 people. I prefer stuns and hard CCs to bursty assassins. CC mitigation has individual counterplay, bursty assassins usually require reliance on the team to peel.\nAlso, if a big CC misses or was used at a bad time, you know that part of a kit is missing and you potentially have an advantage. (Say Sona missed her ult in an attempt to engage.)\n\nI really like LOL's CC. In general the skills don't lock you down for very long, nor can they be spammed.

I don't know how they'd make his taunt into a skill shot, but his kit almost completely revolves around it. It also has counterplay with the time leading up to him getting in your face. Taric's stun on the other hand... feels awful as a point and click.

I feel ranged champions don't necessarily need a slow unless that's a key use of their kit or it's easy to avoid. Some champions often may use the slow aspect of a skill as an added bonus. Like Caitlyn's net. I'm pretty sure the majority of people use it to move around primarily. The slow makes sense thematically, but gameplay-wise is likely unnecessary. (Maybe make it just do damage to keep the mechanics.) Tristana's jump has a similar issue. The other issue is the large amount of ground targeted slows. Ziggs, Lux, Graves and Gragas all have slows that either have another purpose (blind) or can be controlled for damage.\n\nI think in most cases the slows have a clear intent with the game play - Supports need the utility (Sona), some kits utilize the slow as a key aspect of the kit (Ashe), some compensate for the need to be in your face (Liss) and some have no hard cc or a good escape mechanism and need something to keep up with all the characters that have these (Miss Fortune). \n\nI also feel that thematically, Freljord champions should retain their slows. It sets their region apart and they're a relatively small portion of characters. Plus, I feel like all of their slows have the intent of being a slow - not as an extra feature.\n\nBasically... I feel like a number the slows in the game are almost unnecessary. They're often used more as a happy bonus to the actual use of the skill.

Items such as Mikael's crucible, Mercurial Scimitar, and Locket of the Iron Solari offer lots of counterplay to CC of any kind - along with Champions like Lucian, Thresh, and others - with appropriate team work, slows are nothing to fear.\n\nMany slows on the list only last a mere second, can be easily dodged, or counterplayed. I am not going to say some of these slows aren't borderline abusive *cough*Braum*cough*, but strategies and evolving builds are necessary to playing against them and showing them what for!\n\nConcerning the Melee Champion going against a Ranged Champ, the outcome should always be in favor of the Ranged on open ground, but ambushes are needed against them and in comes Assassins like Zed, Nidalee, Kat, or Jax who can melt faces like a Heavy Metal Concert.

Slows are immensely powerful tools and most champions should not have easy access to them. There should be a CONSCIOUS trade off for slows (or at least some degree of difficulty required in applying it) in every champion's kit. For example, Champions like Akali or Tristana, who have access to some of the highest damage output out of any league champion shouldn't have access to slows, for example. However, utility-based Champions balanced around their slows like Ashe are fine.\n\n2) Yes and no. Ranged champions should have LIMITED access to slows, and only if their kits are balanced around them. Ashe and Jinx, for example, are examples of BALANCED access to slows/CC. Ashe has the easiest access to slows out of any ranged champion, but in her case she's balanced around  the fact she has to make a CONSCIOUS decision to give up damage output  in order to provide utility to her team. Jinx has access to a slow and a snare, but both of her CC require heavy preparation time and her opponent is given advance warning to get out of the way.\n\nBy contrast? Champions like Tristana and Caitlyn should NOT have access to slows. Caitlyn is a sniper (which means you should be able to PUNISH her when you get in close to her), and her E already gives her enormous safety, so she shouldn't be able to slow her opponent after using her jump. In addition, seeing as how Tristana should be using her jump primarily as a repositioning tool and she already has one of the best peeling abilities in the game, Tristana's W should not slow champions.\n\n3) Yes, most champions require access to a slow because almost EVERY champion has a slow now, and most kits are too clunky to properly to function without one.  Ideally, slows should be much more rare than they are now.\n\n4) Ashe's Q, Lulu's Q, Nautilus's W, Singed W, Zac's W, etc. If a champion is based around utility, then they should keep their slows. If a champion has high damage output, then they should either have trouble applying their slow (like Jinx, which I think is a good example of how to give high-damage ADCs some form of CC) or they shouldn't have one in the first place (like Tristana, Akali, etc).","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheKaymon","date":"2014-08-15T19:35:14.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">*Have we given out so many slows that it dilutes champion diversity? \n\nI'm not sure it has diluted the diversity.

These days its almost to the point where if a champion doesn't have a slow, it feels like something is missing. As if, for some reason, having a slow is a requirement for the champion or particular ability to feel good. We need to find other ways to go about doing this, rather than just indiscriminately tacking on a slow.\n\n* Not necessarily, and certainly not for that specific reason. I think it depends on the kit of the ranged champ more than it does the kits of any other champ. Ranged champions without a dash pretty much have to have CC. Conversely, ranged champs that do have a dash probably don't need a slow as well.\n\n* This is kind of related to the first question and my answer to it. Basically, yes. Here's an interesting factoid on the subject; 24 of the 30 champions released in the last three years have a slow. 9 of the 11 champs released in the last two years have a slow. And all 3 of this years champs have a slow. Make of that what you will, but I see a trend.\n\n* We shouldn't think about it so simply. \"Iconic\" doesn't translate to \"healthy\". Teemo, for example, has an infamously unhealthy slow. What you really need to ask (more to yourselves than us) is: \"Does this champion have a reason to have a slow?\" Are there other ways to make the champion/ability feel good?

I've gone back and forth on how I feel about this since S1 though. On the one hand, a lot of slows don't feel like they add much gameplay most of the time. However, they can add to certain situation that happen a few times every game, the best example I can think of being ganks. Since I love tank junglers I would be just fine with most champions having less cc in general to make tank cc stand out more, but removing cc leads to very different chase and gank scenarios. I do think there is something of a homogenization problem. There are some champions who would function just fine without the slow, but would maybe become much more feast-or-famine. I think Lux would be just fine if you removed the slow and compensated her somehow. Her laning patterns would shift somewhat, but you would still have the safety, long range burst, and waveclear preserving at least a good portion of her identity.  How you compensate in a healthy way is a harder question. Too much damage with that range might be unhealthy, although there are stronger long range mages in the game now so maybe there's room (although, we can't make her too similar to, say, Xerath). She does have other utility that could be buffed, so maybe look there? Syndra is another example where the slow isn't really necessary to her core gameplay, but in both these cases the slow can set up the harder cc. I think I'm in favor of removing that paradigm from mages, but maybe I'm wrong there.\n\nRanged champion slows should be if not super rare, treated as much larger aspects of the champion than they frequently are. How many slows are part of an otherwise fine ability? Other people have mentioned graves and teemo as examples of slows that are attached to abilities that function just fine without the slow.\n\nI don't think champs need a slow, but it is easy to find room for in a kit and adds a lever for balancing. Yasuo is a pretty recent champ with no slow (and a s a melee champ no less) and he certainly isn't underpowered. Of course, he has hard cc, a unique utility move, a rapidly reusable (although conditional) dash, and is manaless. \n\nThere are slows that shouldn't be removed, but ones that shouldn't be removed because they are too iconic?\nAshe\nA lot of ice-based champions (Nunu, Liss, Sejuani, Anivia), but Ashe gets special mention due to her age and unique place among champions at her role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2014-08-15T20:50:16.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are we properly differentiating slows from cc?

I actually had worse examples since I took care to use champions whose character/identity did not relate to slows at all. The only one I could really se slow being a thematic linked to slows is Karthus, being a dead and all (but then again a wall of *pain* doesn't scream slow, it screams damage).  A sentient being of lightning does not equate slow in my mind, a kind of savant seeking balance does not equate slow, a little guerilla warfare yordle does not equate slow, a kind of psychedelic peter-pan syndrome fae could equate slow but clearly not that much.\n\nSimilarly, I don't see how removing a slow and putting something else instead homogenizes them.

As for Karthus, I'm not sure where you're pulling that out from but every single bit of additional defense you give to Karthus makes him a little bit more of a Raid boss; it's not like you can really kite karthus around (unless you're one of those 10 champions that have the tool, then you have a shot if you're 1v1).\n\n---\n\nAlso, it's normal that ideas that are simply \"replace X slow with Y\" won't look good, since the kits were designed around having a slow.\n\nIf you wanted to change Kassadin around you'd probably start by making his passive put stack when he damages someone. Those stacks reduce damage they deal to him by a minute amount that stacks up to 4-6 times. \nQ now makes the target's next spell's projectiles (if any) move more slowly by a small %. \nW could refund mana based on stacks. \nE would consume stacks to gain a shield. \nR would have a slightly bigger cd but it get reduced (%-based to not get CDR-abused) based on the number of people hit. \nThis now turns Kassadin from a mobile burst-mage with slow, into a champion that skips around the battlefield and dodges what you throw his way. Of course, the kit is far from perfect, since you can't get anythign really good in 15 mintues. It was simply to show an example of a champion who's given a new identity without his slow.\n\nAs-is, it's true that it's tough to change Karma's slow, but if you made her more of a disruptive (silence/blind/stealth/taunt) support, you could manage something really great. For instance, W could have slightly lower range and same tether range, heals you for part of the damage done and when using Mantra, you appear stealthed to the tethered enemy. It's somehing that allows you to stay relevant even as you get lower and it offers room for both play and outplay. Then, you have to add tools to perform without damaging the target, so probably a shield, and some kind of zone control with Q (heck, a slow similar to Lux' isn't even bad, since it's a different kind of slow).","replies":[{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-08-19T01:46:54.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The homogenization is not between champions, but within the champion.

Not just prominent, but the \"power cost\" of putting a slow on a champion has gone down, and now many champions have slows and don't even need to be functional, just because it allows them \"feel\" better compared to the other two thirds of the roster that happen to have slows.\n\nNow that slows are so common and cheap, it artificially culls the design space for melee champions. A melee champion pretty much requires a dash and his own slow or hard crowd control in order to function, and if he doesn't have both then he will have to itemize for the latter or fail to be competitive. So essentially, when RIOT goes to design a competitive melee champion they have to consume 2 of his abilities with mandatory gameplay and are only left with half of a kit to work on, which restricts creativity.\n\nThey can still be creative in that context, by tying a dash to some gameplay like a thresh hook or jarvan flag or something, but there are only so many ways to enumerate what is functionally a dash with a finite number of gameplay elements. At the end of a day any melee champion requires a dash to function, and the reason is because usually a melee champion without a dash can never reach a target before dying if he is slowed to 240 movespeed, so being able to dash allows the melee champion to apply his own slow and stick to the target he is trying to keep up with.\n\n\"Why not just give the melee champion a ranged ____?\" is a slippery slope.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ploki122","date":"2014-08-15T07:21:08.498+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let's break this bit by bit.\n\n> Shields are already ubiquitous\n\n80 champions have slow, wanna bet that there are less than 80 having shields? Otherwise, yes, there are a few click-to-shield abilities, which is where you have the right to add play/counter-play. There are a lot of heals, but I've never seen anyone complain about Shen's heal. Why? Because it's gated behind gameplay (well, and it's not enormous, but it's still a decent chunk, especiaally for a manaless heal).\n\n> Speed boosts have the same problem slows do\n\nSo you're telling me that slows are everywhere (since this is the topic)? Or did you mean that too much speed is the same as too much slow? In that case I'll have to go ahead and disagree, Once someone is too mobile, the game becomes extremely hectic around him, but too much speed never made the game perfectly unplayable for 1 person. Too much slows (perma 80-90%+ slow) will do that. with the right set of champions, you can probably keep a whole team at 100-150 movement speed, and that means they cannot do anythign except eat your skillshots.\n\n> Stealth is super niche and already gets flak for being toxic, \n\nI used the broad term \"stealth\", I guess I should've said vision-based utility. Graves' Smokescreen is an example, or Nocturne's Ultimate. A spell could very well make you stealthed for 1 second to champions you just hit. No one would consider that toxic.\n\n> slowing/accelerating projectiles is a weak utility if one at all\n\nAt this point, it feels like you're trying to discredit the ideas but lacking idea. Of course it's an utility, since it helps you fight without being power. And honestly, if you had something like an Amumu ult that stops projectile for 1-2s, I'm fairly confident that it would turn games around since it allows for easy jukes. One of the reason slow is nice is because skillshots become not-so-skillshots. Similarly, if you say that all projectiles around a target or travelling toward a target are accelerated, all skillshots are easier to land which gives you one of the benefits of the slow, but without the \"I can't move\" part.\n\n>delaying damage is not a real utility\n\nHow is it not a real utility? I can't see a single case where delaying (and possible reducing through one mean or another) damage is negative. You'll have to give me your definition of utility at this point, because for me, this kind of effect fits perfectly the definition of utility and is actually helpful and entertaining. Heck, I don't I barely see any cases where delaying the damage is negative (and the cases I see are pretty farfetched and can be worked around).\n\n> resistance shred is pretty weak as utility and also considered toxic.\n\nBy whose standards? I've never heard of shred/penetration as being neither weak nor toxic... Heck, it's actually blatantly overpowered, and the more you put in-game, the worse defenses get.\n\n> use of Resistance boost as utility has to be niche, redirecting projectiles has to be niche and Stealth is super niche and already gets flak for being toxic, \n\nResistance boost is on every single items, and at least half the champion have it in one form or another, I don't consider that exactly niche. Similarly, off the top of my head, I can probably see 5+ different ways of \"redirecting projectiles\" that means I could easily fit it into 8-10 different kits...\n\nOtherrwise, I don't see why being niche is bad. This post is exactly about the opposite. Slow has become the \"one size fits all\" utility, and we're trying to find alternatives. Of course not all of them are gonna fit on everyone, and that's perfect otherwise you'd have slow 2.0. When talking about utility//abilities, I always see niche as a good thing.\n\n---\nRest is gonna be in another reply since I'm hitting character limit.","replies":[{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-08-19T02:17:55.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Resistances:** Items of course do not count, because they provide personal stats.

A vision-denying team is a team that loses a serious amount of counter play. If nocturne's ult could be followed up by 2 more vision denials, it would make the game suck for enemies to take part in. Thus, suggesting things like resistance boosts or projectile redirection will give you, at most, probably 2 slows to get rid of, but more likely 1 or 0.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YouLostMe","date":"2014-08-19T02:12:17.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You appear to be confused as to what utility is, so let me help you: Utility is anything that contributes in a fight other than tankiness or damage. Putting a resistance boost on yourself is tanking power, but putting it on someone else is utility. Shredding the resistances of whoever you happen to be attacking is more on the side of damage, but shredding the resistances of whoever your carry attacks is utility.\n\n**Shields: **Woah woah woah, there are tons of different forms of gameplay in *slows alone*, which I already mentioned in the post you just replied to. You can't just say all slows are bad and need to be removed, but shields are totes OK because there are different forms of them. Also, replacing something ubiquitous with something else ubiquitous will also cause other problems. Replacing slows with shields just cause you can is lazier design than adding good slows in the first place.\n\n**Speed boosts:** Remember that this is a thread about slows being bad for melee, and not slows being bad for skill shots. If you are in this thread, you come to the table to talk about slows being bad for melee, because that is the thread title and subject. Now speed boosts do identical things for melee's health that slows do, because the whole point is that melee can't get in range. Slows and Speed boosts both make kiting easier, and thus melee QOL goes down.\n\n**Stealth:** Stealth is different from vision-denial, which is one of those abilities that is supposed to be rare (like projectile-blocking). But yes, 1 second of stealth against a target you just hit is *totally* toxic, and it's toxic in a crazy way. Counterplay.\n\n**Speeding/Slowing Projectiles:** Yes, there is a very very limited scenario where you can slow projectile that isn't already guaranteed to hit a CC'd target *and* isn't currently pathed to miss anyways *and* happens to be in the area *and* isn't auto-hit or you're paired with braum/yasuo (*and* their blocking spell is up). But that is so incredibly niche that it might come up once in an entire game, which makes it a weak utility. Speeding up projectiles is even less useful, because it messes with allied timings.\n\n**Delaying Damage:** That was a bad explanation on my part -- let me explain this a little better. If you put a delayed damage effect on a target, it's sort of like giving them damage immunity for the delay duration and then hitting them afterwards. This sort of short-term invulnerability is so powerful (channelers and squishy divers get to use abilities fore free) that it needs to be harshly gated. For the delayed damage to be a utility other than a tanking power, it needs to be placed on an ally. If a delayed damage effect is placed on an ally, that means you can put it on squishy divers and channelers for *extreme* power, which is probably too strong to be considered usable at all. Thus, any legitimate use of delaying damage will be a personal buff and will be a tanking power instead of a utility.\n\n**Shred:** \"Weak from a game-balance perspective\" =/= \"Weak as a utility\". Resistance shred is not a great utility ability because it's very strong and thus needs strong gating (much like delayed damage). Ex: Wukong and Jarvan use their armor shred as a way to win extended trades, not to seriously benefit other AD members of their team. For shred to be used as a utility, it needs to not be designed for personal use, which is probably too strong to be considered usable at all.\n\nResistance shred is toxic because it is mostly invisible power. You might see a broken shield or little red bands under your character, but the amount of armor shredded and the effects that has are not visible until you start taking damage, at which point it's already too late to communicate the information.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2014-08-17T00:01:21.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does anyone feel that the abundance of slows is a reaction to the mobility creep in the game?
