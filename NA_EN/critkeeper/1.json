It is very exciting and a much needed step up from the current archaic system.\n\nThe reason we are unhappy is because we feel as though we effectively HAD to buy runes to even play the game up until now, so the notion that \"we are replacing the current rune system with a new one, but we aren't refunding the ip that you basically had to spend as a matter of course\" is offensive to us. We are especially offended by explanations that don't seem to account for our personal perspective on this matter because it feels like an insult to our intelligence.\n\nThere wouldn't be an issue if IP were just something we got \"for free\" for just playing the game-- but from our perspective it wasn't. Runes were priced in such a way that many of us felt that we couldn't afford to buy champions early on with IP, because runes could ONLY be bought with IP and were very costly. So with IP being a limited resource and not enough of it to buy both champions and runes, we chose to purchase both by spending money on champions.\n\nThe choice given to us was basically \"spend ip on runes or you can't really play\" and \"if you don't have ip, spend money on champions or the lack of opportunity in champion select will occasionally cause you to lose.\" This was especially exacerbated by RIOT's early history of balancing league in a whack a mole fashion in season 2 and earlier that generally made it so that newly released champions were almost always overpowered because they weren't \"wacked\" by Nerf Master Suck Town yet.\n\nEventually we expanded our roster to a minimally viable size and grinded a few basic generalist rune pages-- then we were able to effectively play the game and grind up enough IP to buy most or all of the runes and champions. But that initial grind still sticks in our minds, and we totally agree that this pointless grind isn't something that makes league a better game.\n\nIf we had the choice, we would have spent IP on champions rather than runes-- we didn't have a choice though, not really. We understand your position and we even agree with the direction in which you are taking the game, we just feel like you don't see it from our perspective. We feel that you gave us a false choice and then told us our choice was wrong. Its kind of like having a bad Dungeon Master tell you there is a room with two chests and one of them is booby trapped, but it turns out that while one of them technically was booby trapped, in fact both of them were.\n\nWe couldn't NOT spend IP on runes to play, and yet it appears that spending IP on runes was a mistake. Some of us only bought a small subset of the runes, only the ones we really needed. Most of the long time veterans bought every single rune because we couldn't imagine that it would be a mistake to do so, and we had nothing else to spend our IP on after collecting every champion.\n\nNow all of a sudden our vast reserves of IP can be spent on things besides the occasional new champion-- its now called BE and it can be used to forge skins and other content, so we are happy. And yet, the runes we actually bought-- specifically the IP that backs them, have burnt up and are now worthless, so we feel unhappy. The most aged veterans don't really care because they are sitting on hundreds of thousands of IP and the 150 thousand they spent on runes is marginal. There are other veterans who have collected every champion and every rune, but haven't yet amassed a horde of IP, and they legitimately do feel cheated because you all of a sudden made an enormous chunk of their possessions worthless.\n\nReplacing the rune system with a better one is good for everyone, but replacing the work that people put into amassing their current collection of runes with value equal to 12% of that work is not good for those people. From your perspective you are just giving everyone all the runes and are additionally giving away some free BE to people so you feel magnanimous and can't imagine why people would be frustrated. From our perspective you are telling us that the time and effort we spent to gain a competitive edge by increasing our opportunity in champ select by amassing a collection of runes and rune pages was worthless because you've come to your senses and decided that the playing field should be even-- but you made this decision only after we made the choice to spend that IP\n\nFrom the veteran's perspective you punished us until we bought the runes by giving everyone who did buy them an opportunity advantage and then you punished us for buying them by deleting the IP we were forced to spend on them instead of champions-- almost certainly because you don't want that IP to be spent on champions or skins when real money could be spent instead.\n\nWe know you are trying to stay in business and we weren't asking for a mountain of free stuff, but you didn't even offer us the ability to recoup our opportunity value by giving each player a discount on things like skins and champions in proportion to the opportunity value lost by that player in the old rune system based on the number of runes purchased. Supposedly the BE we receive is supposed to function sort of like the aforementioned discount, but it isn't the same thing because the value of even expensive exotic runes in this regard have become the same as the mundane ones, and they are all less valuable. What we would have preferred is something like a 50% discount on future purchases until we exhaust the value of what we spent on the runes, because at least that way we could eventually realize all the value we had accumulated in those runes.\n\nYou aren't really seeing it from our point of view, and that aggravates the hell out of us. You basically don't want us to have 100% of that value back, you want us to have 12% of that value back. On top of that you are making enormous IP sinks like the limited edition WW skin, and everyone can see you are just trying to burn up as much BE as possible to destroy as much currency as possible so that you can make everything you are selling artificially more valuable. Its scummy.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2017-09-05T16:00:16.260+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":37,"body":"I wanna jump in here to say that I think a lot of what OP is saying here is valid and true. \n\nRunes were never a good experience for players. They were basically a barrier between you and your ability to be really competitive in ranked, and the only way to overcome that barrier was by grinding. Not really \"pay-to-win\" but more like \"play-a-crapload-to-get-on-at-least-even-ground.\" Now that we're removing that barrier for all players, people who had to go through the gauntlet feel like they got a raw deal. \n\nSo, for that reason, we do think it makes sense for us to give a little back to folks who went through the gauntlet to get runes. That's why we're rolling out the rune rewards, and emotes for players based on how many hours they've played. I think we're open to the idea of doing a little more for veterans, but it'll have to be something like giving you something cool that lets you show off how long you've been in the game—giving away tons more BE just isn't that feasible. \n\nI want to be really transparent about our thinking behind the rune rewards, because there's definitely a lot of confusion around that. I think we've screwed up by repeatedly using language like \"investment\" around runes, because they were never meant as something you literally invest in in the hopes of getting a return on. And we're for sure not going to do a full refund on runes, because we don't think that replacing a system with a better system should trigger a refund on the old thing; That's not a precedent that we're going to set. Plus (and this is real talk mode cactopus), the fact is that us giving away IP has consequences. IP/BE is worth money for Riot—giving it away cuts into future champ sales. We can pretty closely estimate how many RP-based champ sales we'll lose over any given time period after giving away IP, and I want to make it clear here that selling champs is a huge part of the way Riot makes money so we can reinvest in the game.\n\nAlso, by merging the runes and masteries system into a new, free system, we're already investing in a major upgrade to the game. This costs money, but we think it's worth it for the future of League. So, the goal with the rewards we've announced is to recognize the time you’ve spent getting Runes and reward you fairly for it, without going overboard. That's why we're doing what we're doing.\n\nOne more thing that I've gotta call out is this idea that you're only getting back 12% of what you spent on runes if you bought them before 2017. That's just not true—the actual number (depending on which ones you bought) is a lot likelier closer to double that. I showed how to calculate your rune rewards in this reddit comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6xga15/riot_pls_leveling_ip_and_rewards_nexus_league_of/dmfpgdi/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage\n\nI hope that makes sense.

Hell, it's just short of a fourth of what we spent.

The old runes system was this huge grind that you had to go through just to be able to play on even ground with new people. It was a barrier. Having that barrier disappear for everyone for free right after you worked to overcome it feels bad. No argument from me here. I think this is mostly a lesson for Riot going forward.

You'll get all the future runes for free, you'll get a decent amount back depending on how much you spent on runes (I'm curious to know how many runes you bought), and making the system free has other benefits that affect you as well—we can balance runes a lot more easily now, for instance. You're also going to have a lot easier grind ahead of you without the bullshit you went through before when saving up for runes. I know that doesn't feel perfect, but I think it's a good change that will feel pretty good. \n\nNow that being said, I wonder what else besides more BE we could do to make you feel like we value you as a player?

For instance, double the rewards of all quests completed until an amount of value obtained from those quests equal to the value of the runes has been acquired. This gives RIOT a lot of control over what the players receive, feels fair to the players since they can opt out of a quest they don't like, is graduated over an extremely long period of time (years) so it doesn't bankrupt RIOT, and keeps players playing and isn't disruptive.\n\nYou could also offer \"quest doubling\" boosts to other players for a limited time or for limited amount of value at a specific BE cost to encourage people to invest their BE plus their time to eke out more value from their BE than they otherwise could. Besides the feeling of commitment would probably cause more people to want to actually complete the quests, which means more players actually playing.\n\nAnd if you add in a few quests that involve playing with friends or a quest to play at least one game a day each day for a week or something... well there you go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-09-05T18:03:20.406+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I spent buttloads of IP on runes because i had nothing else to spend it on, and i'll have to do some math on this but i'm not sure i'm going to be able to afford urfwick because of the weak returns on runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2017-09-05T17:59:55.785+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"give vets an xp boost\n\nsimple as that\n\nbecause i had way more time to play back in the day then i do now, i would still like to level up but as someone who got older and got a job i simply don't have the time i did anymore\n\ni think that would best help vets","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2017-09-05T16:13:12.354+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"Is there any practical reason why a 2050 quint has the same return value as a 515 quint?

It is either a full refund for the new players or as it seems a refund tuned for players who already have more IP than they know what to do with and get a little extra for a special shop.\n\nBut there are a large part of the playerbase who don't already own all champions, who can't indulge in an IP shop and for whom choosing to buy runes instead of champions was a considerable investment. These players now are left with the options of buying champions for RP, regrinding thier loss from previous years of playing or quiting. Again for no other reason than that apparently they choose the wrong ingame system to invest in.\n\nReusing a part of my previous post;\n\nI belive the unpopularity of the old runesystem is clouding the judgement of what is fair and makes for a \"getting rid of it at all cost\" perspective seem more reasonable than it is.\n\nI'm generally not a fan of analogies but sometimes they help getting a point across:\n\nA while ago Riot experimented with having 10 extra support heroes for free in the weekly free champion rotation to see if more players would play support. Say it was successful and Riot now anounced that all support heroes will be permanently free come pre-season. Current owners of support heroes will be compensated 750 ip/be per champion and full refund for this seasons bought champions (a bit generous compared to runes but in general the same jist).\n\nNow new players wont be affected and players who owns all heroes likely wont be very affected. The problem lies for those who spent a substantial amount of thier ip on buying support champions making them have to miss out on other champions due to ip budget constrains.\n\nNow others can say, well that's thier own fault they choose to be a support main. They could have mained another class, besides everyone knew support was unpopular. These player chose to opt into a role they knew was unpopular and have only themselves to blame.\n\nLooking at it from this perspective makes the whole ordeal in my opinion seem a little more nuanced, is it really fiar to single out a particular group of ip spenders regardless of what they invested it in?\n\nThe important part to remember is that the players never upheld the runesystem, Riot did. But in the discussion that has followed it seems rune users (or atleast those that invested a substansial amount of thier ip in it instead of champions) are being portrayed as evil pay-to-win system abusers who should suit themselves for thier bad investment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EnkiduUruk","date":"2017-09-05T22:35:19.838+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Cactopus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=o1hsbxt5,comment-id=001b0000000000010001,timestamp=2017-09-05T21:54:33.565+0000)\n>\n> So you basically want to know why it wasn&#x27;t a higher percentage, right?

You claim you will have to give up revenue if a larger refund would go forward, so instead the idea is that we should give up something that we invested in so you can continue making the same revenue. How messed up is that? You profited from the existence of the old Rune system so effectively your future \"profits\" were earned in the past.\n\nAll you are doing is hurting your consumers.

That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re rolling out the rune rewards, and emotes for players based on how many hours they&#x27;ve played. I think we&#x27;re open to the idea of doing a little more for veterans, but it&#x27;ll have to be something like giving you something cool that lets you show off how long you&#x27;ve been in the game—giving away tons more BE just isn&#x27;t that feasible. \n> \n> I want to be really transparent about our thinking behind the rune rewards, because there&#x27;s definitely a lot of confusion around that. I think we&#x27;ve screwed up by repeatedly using language like &quot;investment&quot; around runes, because they were never meant as something you literally invest in in the hopes of getting a return on. And we&#x27;re for sure not going to do a full refund on runes, because we don&#x27;t think that replacing a system with a better system should trigger a refund on the old thing; That&#x27;s not a precedent that we&#x27;re going to set. Plus (and this is real talk mode cactopus), the fact is that us giving away IP has consequences. IP/BE is worth money for Riot—giving it away cuts into future champ sales. We can pretty closely estimate how many RP-based champ sales we&#x27;ll lose over any given time period after giving away IP, and I want to make it clear here that selling champs is a huge part of the way Riot makes money so we can reinvest in the game.\n> \n> Also, by merging the runes and masteries system into a new, free system, we&#x27;re already investing in a major upgrade to the game. This costs money, but we think it&#x27;s worth it for the future of League. So, the goal with the rewards we&#x27;ve announced is to recognize the time you’ve spent getting Runes and reward you fairly for it, without going overboard. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re doing what we&#x27;re doing.\n> \n> I hope that makes sense. I&#x27;m happy to follow up and answer any questions y&#x27;all have.\n\nI think a lot of the problem comes from the fact that many players do not have the business context for why you are making these decisions. I understand when you announce these things you usually want to focus on the \"game\" side of the story rather than on corporate maneuvers. However, I think that sometimes Riot could benefit from being more upfront about the \"business\" reasoning behind some of their decisions.\n\nOne example is the Blue Essence Store that will open when the new system arrives. This is obviously designed as an IP reset so that players that have hoarded a moderate amount of IP and spent a significant amount of IP and RP in rune pages feel like they are getting rewarded while resetting their IP counter so that they may spend RP in the future to get content that would usually have higher IP prices and thus be gated. If you had explained that only really veteran players that have played the game for a while longer would be able to access the higher tier rewards, then people would maybe have been happier about the announcement. Also I know you don't want to commit to specifics as the BE store is still in development, but making it clear that probably other rare skins would be available for absurd amounts of bE would make super veteran players happier I suspect.** For example. Selling Black Alistar** (which is worth a ton of money, but Riot doesn't perceive because you don't sell the skin) for a TON of BE so that basically only people that have been playing consistently for at least 5 years can get it might have hyped people more.\n\nAnother example is how lots of people feel self-entitled and think the new rune system is \"free\" while you are actually investing a lot of resources on it. I think it would had been better if you (Riot) had emphasized more the amount of resources and money they are spending on this new system. Then proceed to acknowledge the specific pain points that this new system has (veteran showmanship and feel like their value spent is being kept) and give clear rewards and explain the math behind it more clearly. Basically, make it easier for people to understand how all your solutions tie together instead of assuming they will work it out themselves. As a business you know when the transformation from IP and RUNES to BE occurs, the value of these items will be transferable to the BE store, champions and other items that the players currently might not be able to get; they may not see these connections necessarily because they haven't done \"the math\".","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2017-09-05T21:48:15.749+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"This is a really insightful post.

I currently have 10+ sets of each type which is a lot more than what is needed. People who spent 100k+ IP on runes/pages were doing optional unnecessary stuff that you should only do if you own all of the champions you want. People who spent the bare minimum shouldn't miss the IP they did spend on runes that much.","replies":[{"poster":"Octavia","date":"2017-09-05T14:08:32.881+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, and why should people who got the optimal pages for everything instead of sitting on IP be punished?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
