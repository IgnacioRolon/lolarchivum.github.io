He's \"quite balanced\" whenever I bring up how toxic he is.\n\nAgreed btw.  He can do the most ridiculous stuff with no defense whatsoever, and I can't even fathom how anyone thinks it's balanced.\n\nAlso, when people say \"just CC him\" that isn't an cure, it just slows the bleeding.   Most CC worth a damn is a skillshot and he rarely stands still since whoever he is destroying is running for their life or dying so fast he just moves on to the next guy in a second or less(when he isn't dashing out of the way).  When you actually do land CC, yay!  But unless you got more CC around to chain him for a bit, one move(unless you're morg :P) doesn't last long enough to kill him, and if he hadn't ulted yet he can just do it stunned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2015-02-03T11:15:53.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Torasuto,realm=NA,application-id=EBBIvmVK,discussion-id=xwVbslxA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-03T09:48:33.029+0000)\n>\n> I've been saying this guys stupid for ages and nobody listens to me -_- \"just CC him\" well why dont you just cc every fking champ in the game then we can all agree we're all bad and no champ is op\n\npls he takes so much skill i have to hit the buidling when i get to 6 items and my finger is sore from right clicking and orbwalking all day its not that easy my finger really really hurts at the end.","replies":[]}]}]}
