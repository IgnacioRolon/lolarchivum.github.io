One example that isn't an AOE melee attack is an active on malphite that scales with armor and ap and has piddly radius, and doesn't  count because its just an on hit AOE. One is hydra, which isn&#039;t really an aoe melee attack either, its just an on hit AOE. The only true AOE melee attack can only be used once every so often as a dragon form shyvanna, which is effectively the same as attacking everyone in the area once each, meaning it applies on hits like red buff.\n\nSomeone who already has a big weapon needs to be changed so that they are all about passively doing lots of area of effect damage with it. Maybe make it so that it replaces crit-- if the champion crits they do an area attack instead of double damage-- to really cement the &quot;AOE carry&quot; aspect.\n\nThe only problems I see with having a champion be based on doing lots of incidental AOE damage with their autos is that in order to use it you have to put yourself in situations that only tanks could survive. Having a tanky champion that does carry level dps (albeit aoe) isn&#039;t a good idea for game health because there isn&#039;t much you can do to play around it. So the champion would just have to be relatively squishy but have a really damn good tank steroid.\n\nThe only champion I know of that meets all those conditions is Tryndamere, and even he would require changes to his kit and ultimate to support such a playstyle.\n\nWould you rather Tryndamere be an AOE powerhouse than a strong duelist?","replies":[]}
