With just Botrk and no other lifesteal, you already heal for 32-40 hp per hit more than you did without this change, before armor, on those targets.\n\nWith armor it will be around 10-20 additional hp, depending on what you are attacking and whether it has 200 armor or 100 armor after pen.\n\nIn order to get that much additional healing and damage from just buying attack damage, assuming we are only talking about the first auto attack on a full hp tank, then you would need\n\n\n##THE FIRST ATTACK\n\n5k hp tank:\n400 ad with no crit\n200 ad with crit\n160 ad with ie crit\n\n4k hp tank\n320 ad with no crit\n160 with crit\n128 with ie crit\n\nBut this additional damage eventually goes to near 0 as they lose hp, so on the average it is worth half that much if you 1v1 the tank from full to nothing. To adjust, we just divide the numbers in half:\n\n##AVERAGE OVER ALL ATTACKS\n\n5k hp tank:\n200 ad no crit\n100 ad crit\n80 ad ie crit\n\n4k hp tank\n160 ad no crit\n80 ad crit\n64 ad ie crit\n\nNow to get the final value for how much it is worth in attack damage, just multiply by the percent crit that you have. For example if you have 50% crit chance, since the passive doesn't double on a crit, attack damage would be worth twice as much half the time (or more with ie).\n\nFor example, with ie and phantom dancer:\n\nAgainst a 4k hp tank\n0.55 \\* 0.8 \\* 64 = 28.16\nSo the passive alone is worth almost 30 ad.\n\nAgainst a 5k hp tank\n0.55 \\* 0.8 \\* 80 = 35.2\n\nAnd this is on champions with critical strike multipliers that make each point of attack damage as valuable as it can possibly be-- and still the passive on botrk shines. Even against a target with half the health of a tank it is worth around 15 ad.\n\nTLDR\nI can't wait to play things that aren't tanks again.","replies":[]}
