I was recently given a 2 week ban ( about a month ago ) I had never received a ban before and kind of just ignored it besides trying only to insult play not degrade another player. I have contacted support and tried to appeal the ban but they say the ban will remain. I have since asked them to reconsider my logs and see that I dont deserve a permanent ban. ( I will include the logs in link below as well as a copy and explanations)\r\n\r\nI now understand what I say affects others in game and am trying to rectify the situation with Riot. I am desperate for some help in rectifying this situation as I love playing this game. I am extremely sorry my past toxicity and horrible attitude towards the game but thought I had improved since my first ban. I took the ban lightly and didn&#039;t thoroughly understand why I had been banned.  I have held this account for 6 years and spent hundreds of dollars and I understand Riot doesn&#039;t owe me anything. All I am asking for is a reconsideration of the ban.Give me a 100 game normal draft only where im on probation, give me a chatban for 500 games, ban me for 6 months I dont care the consequence I just want a chance to prove I have reformed and will strive to make the league community a better place. \r\n\r\nI have made mistakes I have been toxic I have taken a 2 week ban lightly. I am sorry for my past behavior and only want to continue playing this game. I have played thousands of hours on my account that I have owned for 6 years and losing it made me realize how my behavior affects others. I am not excusing my behavior, I am simply stating I didnt fully understand the ban system to my own ignorance. I hope\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and I understand how some will say I deserve the ban. I can only hope you will understand that I made a mistake and want to fix it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlink:\r\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/339967874/banned-League\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChat logs as well as explanations.
