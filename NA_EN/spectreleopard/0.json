I run as admin and it still doesn't work. So I deleted RADS-projects-lol.patcher-0.0.0.69 and other files that the forums said to delete. Then I uninstalled League of Legends and all it's files. I then installed a newer version of the client making sure DirectX 9.35 and Adobe Air was installed. It seemed to work fined but right as it was opening the launcher it said \"bugsplat.dll error\" I then went to the forums and tried possibilities myself. I then deleted parts of RADS hoping it would patch up corrupt files. There was nothing on the forums [at least for windows] and I need help. This happened right when patch 6.20 came out.\r\n\r\n              Specs: Windows 10 ,  8 GB RAM ,  1 TB Hard drive storage , Toshiba Sattelite","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T15:23:34.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have missing files or driver problems that's failing to render, and we'd like to help if the was unable to.

Generally, bugsplat problems can be caused by driver and hardware problems.  The specific error you're receiving sounds like it could be a driver issue.  I know you've already done some troubleshooting and updating drivers, but I recommend additionally going through every step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to rule out all possibilities.  I also suggest using our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to restore your files, and not deleting them until it's specifically instructed in the guide.
