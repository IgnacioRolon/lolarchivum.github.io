So yes, I am a Talon main who is still quite upset from the silence removal. I still play him very often, and i do admit that he still has one hell of a burst combo. However, i feel that he doesn't really \"counter\" any mages anymore, and that's what he was well known for. He's more of a suicide bomber than an assassin who can single out a target who is out of position. What I'm asking for is a compensation buff of something like Kass's Q that interrupts channeled spells. This way he still has counter play to everyone but still has that assassin feeling where he can interrupt mages such as Malz Kat and Fiddles for example, mages that he was intended to counter since he was released. Imagine him jumping on any of the 3. Fiddles will instantly fear him, Malz will eat him alive, kat will just ult. Not to mention his early game is horrible and gets poked out by every mid in the game. There really is no reason to pick him over any other assassin even if the matchup is favourable.\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-18T19:01:37.400+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since the removal of his E, Talon has been shoved into a niche where he really doesn't have a place. He's obviously supposed to be mid, but he doesn't have the same kind of sustained poke or defensive abilities as the other melee assassins. He's got the burst and we all know that. He's still one of the BIGGEST bursting champions, though he's also still got huge mana problems unlike other melee assassins, mainly because most of them don't use mana. The one that does, Fizz, is able to compensate himself slightly for his mana problems by getting a Lichbane. Normally, I'd say 'Well, maybe we should do Trinity', but Trinity doesn't scale the same way a Lich does and is sooooo much more expensive. \n\nMaking his E interrupt would let him at least allow him to be of use if he doesn't get wildly fed and/or his enemies buy pinks/oracle lens.","replies":[{"poster":"12BloodyWings","date":"2015-01-18T19:09:24.863+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I agree.

Unlike every other melee mid, he has no defensive skills other than his R. Yasuo has his W and his passive, plus his Q is nicely ranged enough to get the caster minions, plus with a little bit of AS, it'll be up in time to last hit under the turret. Zed has his Q and his Shadow to last hit under tower. Riven, while she is rare at mid nowadays, has her shield to not only dodge many attacks but also take the brunt of a blow that she can't dodge and her Q let's her quickly shove the lane from under her tower. Best Talon has is his W, but that costs 60-80 mana, based on level. This ability can't destroy a wave until he's got it maxed and has a fully built AD item. Every other mid usually only needs that first brutalizer to clear a wave, but they also don't have to worry about mana. Talon's W has to be used to poke as much as it's used to last hit under the turret.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ginny","date":"2015-01-18T20:52:12.024+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Cutthroat\" slows by 99% instead of silencing.\n\nWow.","replies":[{"poster":"excodar","date":"2015-01-18T23:21:29.639+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ginny,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5O9evrWk,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-18T20:52:12.024+0000)\n>\n> \"Cutthroat\" slows by 99% instead of silencing.\n> \n> Wow.\n\n*slows by 99% for .25 seconds and is not noticeable at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Ginny","date":"2015-01-18T23:46:02.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Accurate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2015-01-19T14:06:26.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"TIL that if someone is slowed for a quarter of a second, it's strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Ginny","date":"2015-01-19T14:08:12.029+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not at all - it actually makes no sense to me that an ability called Cutthroat *wouldn't* have a silence.","replies":[{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2015-01-19T14:12:47.494+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still waiting for the appropriate rename, \"Pinky Cut\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hyeet","date":"2015-01-19T01:31:17.442+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Better passive, current one does fuckall","replies":[{"poster":"cshakes","date":"2015-01-19T14:50:44.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Solution: rush Frozen Mallet.

Perhaps Talon's burst could be slowed down somehow (shift some damage into Q's bleed DOT?) in which case he could probably afford a 0.5 second silence (just long enough to mess up his opponent's combo).  If it's not possible for Talon to have some sort of silence reinstated, then the ability should probably have its name changed...

He already has a slow on his rake and the slows don't stack .__. (if you land a W and an E they should snare you with a 100% slow I'm not even kidding) I think, however, he should get a mana buff. Laning phase is difficult for him, he shouldn't have to spend money on the crystalline flask that they added to his build when other ad assassins can build an ad item first thing. Sure, you can start with sword or dorans blade (I've seen this done, I don't see the point of building blade and only getting 1 pot when you can build sword and get 3 for more sustain since you are melee) but versus zed or yas, he has to back a lot sooner.\n\nAnother thing is, his invisiblity (R) doesn't cancel channel ults on him. Kat, Zed, etc. can still ult him while he is in stealth (although I think Wu and Vel ults are fine, just move out of the way .__. and how Kat ult does so much damage to you in shorter than the amount of time you can actually be able to run away is ridiculous) His stealth is also cancelled by pinks and sweepers so he really has no way of getting out once he goes all in if those items are got (but you can just pick on squishies yes?). I think he should at least be able to cancel channel ults (excluding malz, ww since you are suppressed).

He can't just GTFO like Zed does, but he's not quite as All-In as Pantheon is, either.\n\nI think the safest thing to do with Talon would be to give him a new Innate that's actually useful, give him his Silence back, and then dramatically lower BOTH the damage and the cooldown on his Ult so that he would be able to reasonably use his combo twice over the course of a Team Fight, potentially even make his Ult refresh on kill/assist.\n\nSo instead of Talon dropping his combo and then being a lump, allow him to use it to jump in and then back off while stealthed before jumping back in again once his abilities come off cooldown.
