Reasons?\n\n1) You have premades and soloes in same matchups, and the solo player is always at a disatvantage at those times. Thus there is no fairness and one group of players always has an advantage, thus be able to rise even if their skill level is not that high. This creates skill discrepancy over all rankings which results in even more unfair mathups and failures in matchmaking because it cant accuratelly distinguish someones skill.\n\n2) Even when premades are on your team, it is bad for the solo. Because it robs him of his team contribution. He will never contribute as 3 or 4 people will. Thus he has less decision power, less carrying power and is dependant not on his skill but on skill off his premade. This is especially bad when the solo is simply pushed out of the group and has to be playing pretty much alone.\n\n3) All of this results in rampant LEGAL boosting. Previously, you could still boost, but it was 1 account at most. Now you can boost up to 4 people. Again, this makes the ranking not matter because noone can be sure, who was boosted and who was not. And noone is sure if the person who is playing with you or against you even deserves his rank.\n\n\nAll of this results in the diminishing worth of any rankings since it is not dependant on skill as much anymore and is made by far more variables that before (Making it more innaccurate). This also results in worse game quality as solo players become disadvantaged, while premades are empowered.\n\nThus ranked integrity, is gone.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-07-01T06:03:46.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"solo players are higher elo than premade players in the same games to compensate\n\nI really haven't noticed a difference pretty confident it's almost entirely in your head that ranked games are worse now","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2016-07-01T06:09:15.951+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That does not compensate.
