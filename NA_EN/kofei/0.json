It's not lag because my ping stays between 40-60 and fps similar. It's a problem for me because 1-3 seconds can make or break and fight or help get away from an enemy. I don't know what it could be as I still have the same laptop and mouse and same internet connection. sometimes it'll happen while i'm trying to use abilities and it won't register till after those few seconds.\r\nI've reduced game quality and such, restarted comp, changed mouse batteries etc.  what could the issue be?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T03:46:53.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like your connection might be encountering a bit of packet loss on its way to our servers. Packet loss happens when parts of your connection get damaged or lose bits of data, so you imagine how that could affect your overall gameplay. Luckily we can run a quick and easy test for packet loss using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and the network logs of that game with unresponsive actions. Take a screenshot and post it here so I can go over it with you!","replies":[{"poster":"Kofei","date":"2017-08-12T18:43:29.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, yeah i found out from the log reader you linked that I was experiencing a high amount of packet loss. I believe I found a solution, as the past few games, the delayed responses have stopped. :)","replies":[{"poster":"KrisHenno","date":"2017-10-30T16:36:00.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully you read this Kofei. \n\nI'm experiencing a similar issue to yourself, how did you find a solution?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
