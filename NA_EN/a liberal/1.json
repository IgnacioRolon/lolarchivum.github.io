The community has aggreed that captain miss should be her default skin, so this would be the perfect time to do it.

He is no longer the leader of bilgewater,  he lost an arm, and he's all beat up.\n\nMF did not take his spot, she is not the leader of bilgewater, and physically nothing happened to her. There is no reason to make her new skin as her default beyond \"it's what a vocal minority on the boards want.\"  Which isn't surprising, because what it boils down to is \"give us free stuff\" and people back any post that supports riot giving away free stuff.\n\nThe community did not agree on anything regarding MF.  Most players do not take part in these forums (hence why there are  millions of players and rarely more than a couple thousand views on any given post). \n\n\nCould they have had it go down more like \"MF took down GP and all of Bilgewater now accepts her as the new leader\" and then make the captain skin her default? Absolutely. Did they? No. They sent Bilgewater into a chaos power struggle, which is why captain fortune is not her default skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-08-03T00:41:26.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not only about rising to power, it's also a direct reflection of Lore in game without needing to access RP.
