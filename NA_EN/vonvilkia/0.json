Every game is a new experience and I&#039;ve had some great solo and party moments. I log on and I see people of artistic talent post there works of art to LoL. Would it be possible to do the same with a book or novel? I know copyright rules are a serious matter and wouldn&#039;t want to infringe upon it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-06T04:29:50.996+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Vonvikia!\n\nThe Riot '[Legal Jibber Jabber](http://www.riotgames.com/legal-jibber-jabber)' page answers your questions pretty understandably, I think.

If you want to write a book for fun, post it on Fanfiction or share it with friends, so long as you aren't trying to turn a profit, you should be A-OK.  Otherwise the 3.9k League stories I'm seeing here on FF.net are also breaking that!","replies":[]},{"poster":"biomaster","date":"2015-08-06T15:29:38.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah basically what you'd be doing would be writing a fanfic, it's free for both you and the player to enjoy. (I have multiple lol stories going on) so yeah if you wanted to write something fanfic . net is a good place to go. Now if you wanted to publish and actual novel, that prob wouldn't be easy cause you wouldn't be able to make a dime off it and I don't know anyone who's willing to publish books for no sales.","replies":[]}]}
