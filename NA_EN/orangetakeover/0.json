How is this toxic. 2 week suspension for this shit.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":15,"body":"Just played a game of Aatrox and my jungler Ekko wants a leash on topside red buff. I say in chat I don't really like leashing top since he would probably path bot and never interact with my lane. But I leash him anyway and just like I say, he paths botside. The enemy Olaf knows to level 3 gank my ass tho right? So I'm then forced to tp away and Shen freezes the lane so I'm basically fucked. So I go into all chat and say \"Leashing top is bait, junglers start top and never interact with your lane.\" Ekko calls me toxic and says he's muting me. \r\n\r\nFast forward to 9 minutes Ekko finally decides to gank my lane. We kill Shen and he immediately comes in chat and says \"Stop fucking crying now\"\r\n\r\nI just don't get this. Am I not allowed to criticize a player in this game anymore? Is simply pointing out his mistakes considered toxic, but him telling me to stop crying isn't? \r\n\r\nAnd then my support Senna is watching my lane all game to spam ping every skillshot I miss (w's and q's). When I defend myself and say I can't land every skillshot I throw at him and how a Senna player wouldn't know about that, he then also says I'm toxic and that I'm muted. What the actual fuck? So I get flame pinged and when I defend myself I'm toxic? I didn't point out his score, I didn't watch his lane to see the mistakes he was making. I did nothing but defend myself saying I can't hit every skillshot. How is that toxic? \r\n\r\nAt this point I feel like I'm targeted just because I'm an Aatrox player. I just got done with a fucking 25 game chat restriction the day before yesterday because I was vocal about how broken Ornn is as a champion. At this point, whenever I play this game again I will permanently have my chat disabled and fucking ignore all pings in the game. Since anything I type is considered toxic. Remove this post, permaban my account, fucking find my IP and come assassinate me, I really don't give a fuck. I've had people call be a \"r%%%%%ed %%%\" reported them and never get back an instant feedback report. The other day I played a game of ARURF as Ekko and the Karma on the enemy team literally called me the hard r. I personally went to the \"report a player\" site and reported him AGAIN and it said we've seen this report already or some BS. Yet I check his account and he's still playing games? But I say in all chat \"Ornn players are cringe.\" and I'm toxic? I can search the Master Yi player who called me the \"r%%%%%ed %%%\" comment and still see that he's playing games. But aye we banned that toxic Aatrox player who called an Ornn player cringe. \r\n\r\nLogs for whoever cares. Logs always looks toxic when you have no context of what other people are saying huh.

They wouldn't explain their strategy and would simply lock in and let their team deal with sorting out how to play around it.\n\nAnd that Counterjungle Support Singed case had the punished player actually taking Riot's advice after the fact.\n\n> there were a couple of bans as well on the boards discussing this that later got reverted\n\nCare to link them? And beyond that, how do you know that they were punished simply for how many reports they got? Does the OP claim as much and you're just taking them at face value?\n\n> the system does flag those with exceptional high report rate and those examples got banned for exactly that\n\nAgain, you're going to have to provide proof to this claim. Find your cases, link them, and back up your claim. Bonus points if you can find an explicit Riot statement saying \"you can get banned if you get reported too much\".\n\n> the feeding criteria is very obvious to the player but somehow never obvious for the reviewer\n> i wonder why that is because maybe the system isn't broad at all?\n\nOkay, so if the feeding criteria is very specific, then do explain how someone can get banned for [Intentionally Feeding while having a positive KDA](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/4bchKgdr-my-account-has-been-permanently-banned-for-feeding-in-aram-despite-having-a-positive-kda).\n\n> hashinshin for example literally ints in 1/3rd of his games and he gets banned like once an year? very broad yeah right\n\nAnd do you know how frequently Hashinshin gets reported? How accurate those reports are?\n\nBecause from what I've seen, high elo players tend to be more lax on reporting others since they all generally tend to _know_ each other and deal with each other on a consistent basis.\n\nEither way, one player doesn't stand as a reliable argument against the breadth of criterion for determining intentional feeding.\n\n> it should be punishable especially when it brings 0 value to the gameplay\n\nThe chat feature isn't exclusively designed for gameplay-conducive communications. People are allowed to chat, and very frequently, chatter tends to have no value to the gameplay, but plenty of value to the people chatting.\n\nIf people aren't breaking the rules in chatting and still playing the game to their best ability, there is nothing wrong with chatting a lot.\n\n> hell it was punishable i don't know why riot removed the chat ban\n\nI have no idea what you're referring to here.\n\nTalking a lot was never punishable, and so far as I can recall, the only Report categories Riot removed were **Refusing to Communicate** (which was a placebo) and **Unskilled Player** (which was also likely a placebo, though it's said that it also was used to adjust matchmaking.)\n\nRiot never applied chat bans; they've used Chat Restrictions of varying degrees, but never straight-up chat bans. And they still apply Chat Restrictions today.\n\n> and again there are plenty of examples of report frequency influencing a ban\n> the fact that those bans were later lifted doesn't mean that the system doesn't ban them\n\nWell, if there are plenty, then you should have no problem linking them.\n\n> oh and i doubt riot has the man power to manually review millions of reports on a daily basis\n\nSo wait, you doubt the credibility of \"large influx of reports leading to manual review\" on account of insufficient manpower, but then don't question what is effectively the same argument of \"large influx of reports leading to false-positive punishment and later manual review\"?\n\nI don't understand this in the slightest. If they don't have the manpower to manually review the occasional rare case of disproportionate reports, how would they have the manpower to review the \"plenty of examples\" of people outright _punished_ for being reported a lot in order to get those bans lifted?\n\nAnd why would Riot use a system that straight-up _punishes_ people for being reported a lot, when such a thoughtless system would lead to more angry players than anything with zero benefit?\n\n> as far as i know manual reviews are triggered only if the person contacts the support team or it's something of a overblown issue like hashinshins 0/24 and nubracs teemo support\n\nWhile I don't have any knowledge on the referenced Hashinshin case and only have the vaguest understanding of the clusterfuck that was Nubrac's case (although it did seem to align with the general \"disproportionate amount of reports leading to manual review\" thing), the \"overblown issues\" usually come to light through...You guessed it, an asburdly large number of reports leading to manual review.","replies":[{"poster":"Bulshlaka","date":"2020-01-27T21:18:08.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Care to link them?\n\nyeah let me search for specific cases i've encountered years ago\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqwbtZT2mD0\nim pretty sure this effect is still a thing although a much more linient effect due to people getting straight 14 day banned instead of going through chat restriction into 24 hours into 3 days into 14 days into permanent\n\n> You guessed it, an asburdly large number of reports leading to manual review.\n\nthe manual review usually was AFTER the punishment not for it","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2020-01-27T21:53:40.922+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> yeah let me search for specific cases i've encountered years ago\n\nJust because Shaclone says that's how it works doesn't mean that it _is_ how it works. Let's break this down a bit;\n\n1) Judging by the fact that he refers to increasingly severe chat restrictions, that seems to be around the time when Riot did perform indefinitely escalating chat restrictions, so by default the video is _extremely_ outdated.\n2) The only information Shaclone had regarding his being reported was the fact that he was punished, indicating that he was indeed reported. He doesn't know how frequently he's reported, who all reports him, etc. - he's just guessing based on, as he says, \"pre-game/post-game trash talk\" and \"people (not liking) him\".\n3) He didn't actually know how the system worked, and judging by the nature of his rant, was likely grasping at straws as to how the system works to justify his frustration.\n4) His description of the escalating penalty was vague and erratic, starting with 20-games of restricted chat, jumping immediately to 500, then to 5,000. I highly doubt the system actually made such absurd jumps in penalties back then, and even if it were the case, it doesn't work like that now.\n\nThat video hardly suffices as evidence of \"plenty of people\" getting punished solely for getting reported a lot. It's an **old, outdated** video of **one** high-profile player **ranting about a system he doesn't actually fully understand**.\n\n> im pretty sure this effect is still a thing although a much more linient effect due to people getting straight 14 day banned instead of going through chat restriction into 24 hours into 3 days into 14 days into permanent\n\n24-Hour bans, to my knowledge, were never a thing. 3-day bans I know were used on people who deliberately spoiled new-release movies to others in-game, but otherwise I haven't seen that type of punishment used.\n\nAnd no, the IFS **_does not punish based on people getting reported a lot._** Even if, hypothetically speaking, Shaclone was actually right in that video, he would not be right today. It's not \"still a thing\", and so far as I know, has never _been_ a thing. And you still have yet to provide any evidence that it has.\n\n> the manual review usually was AFTER the punishment not for it\n\nThe wording seems to indicate that the manual review comes first before the penalty.\n\n> ...it’s a very unique edge case that seems to only present itself once every few months among thousands of audits that we process.\n>\n> If, instead of that, you wholly fail to communicate, or completely disrupt game after game, it makes sense that _you’d rack up a ton of reports, net manual reviews and even potential penalties_ from Player Support.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> (Upper snippet from Smite Support Nunu case, lower from Smite Support Singed case)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zilarious","date":"2020-02-02T20:30:07.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Umbral Regent,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2WmReRJh,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2020-01-27T17:04:38.092+0000)\n>\n> No, that's not how the system works.

I say in chat I don't really like leashing top since he would probably path bot and never interact with my lane. But I leash him anyway and just like I say, he paths botside. The enemy Olaf knows to level 3 gank my ass tho right? So I'm then forced to tp away and Shen freezes the lane so I'm basically fucked. So I go into all chat and say \"Leashing top is bait, junglers start top and never interact with your lane.\" Ekko calls me toxic and says he's muting me. \n> \n> Fast forward to 9 minutes Ekko finally decides to gank my lane. We kill Shen and he immediately comes in chat and says \"Stop fucking crying now\"\n> \n> I just don't get this. Am I not allowed to criticize a player in this game anymore? Is simply pointing out his mistakes considered toxic, but him telling me to stop crying isn't? \n> \n> And then my support Senna is watching my lane all game to spam ping every skillshot I miss (w's and q's). When I defend myself and say I can't land every skillshot I throw at him and how a Senna player wouldn't know about that, he then also says I'm toxic and that I'm muted. What the actual fuck? So I get flame pinged and when I defend myself I'm toxic? I didn't point out his score, I didn't watch his lane to see the mistakes he was making. I did nothing but defend myself saying I can't hit every skillshot. How is that toxic? \n> \n> At this point I feel like I'm targeted just because I'm an Aatrox player. I just got done with a fucking 25 game chat restriction the day before yesterday because I was vocal about how broken Ornn is as a champion. At this point, whenever I play this game again I will permanently have my chat disabled and fucking ignore all pings in the game. Since anything I type is considered toxic. Remove this post, permaban my account, fucking find my IP and come assassinate me, I really don't give a fuck. I've had people call be a \"r%%%%%ed %%%\" reported them and never get back an instant feedback report. The other day I played a game of ARURF as Ekko and the Karma on the enemy team literally called me the hard r. I personally went to the \"report a player\" site and reported him AGAIN and it said we've seen this report already or some BS. Yet I check his account and he's still playing games? But I say in all chat \"Ornn players are cringe.\" and I'm toxic? I can search the Master Yi player who called me the \"r%%%%%ed %%%\" comment and still see that he's playing games. But aye we banned that toxic Aatrox player who called an Ornn player cringe. \n> \n> Logs for whoever cares. Logs always looks toxic when you have no context of what other people are saying huh.

I don't think that this deserves a 2-week suspension. \n\nReading further - I mean, you can't really criticize anyone and you actually typed that you were. You can spam ping the shit out of people like the Senna did. If she pings you when you miss skillshots, you do the same. Or just mute everything if you dislike it and don't indulge in it yourself. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nAlso, you don't have to leash the Ekko or any jungler top. There is no punishment if you refuse to leash. You can play any way that you want to but criticizing isn't allowed because it can offend people. And anyone offended or uncomfortable with what you have to say can report you for it. Which in turn could get  you on the desk for a review. Another point to note for future reference, do not argue. Even arguing can lead to getting punished and you're already 2-week suspended. {{sticker:sg-jinx}} \n\nLook, if your lane was frozen because of a gank from Olaf and Ekko refused to help. Don't complain, just take Ekko's jungle or push to break the freeze. You die? That's not your problem but the team's. If they whine about it, say that you asked for help earlier. Remember, you have to think thrice before you type. Don't type anything that can be taken as 'Negative'. Even stating some facts which might be true but 'Negative' can get you punished. For example, pointing out someone's KDA, deaths. Now, back to your lane issue there - The alternative was sitting at your turret or just taking Ekko's jungle, right? So deal with it by action, not speech.\n\nIf Senna is harassing you with pings, either mute her or just ping back when she misses out on stuff. Now, I'm not encouraging you to harass anyone or start with harassing anyone with pings but if you have to and are on the verge of typing something to them **and** _they have been spam pinging you_ then you can do the same to them. Please don't start spam pinging teammates, it will tilt them. You will put yourself in a bad spot if you initiate this. To conclude, you don't have to type stuff to get back at someone being a jackass. {{sticker:draven-pose}} \n\nAnother thing to watch out for. You're playing Flex Q. And in Flex, people are grouped together like the Senna, Ekko and the MF may have been. So when you offend one guy, others are going to definitely pick on you and things aren't going to look too bright. That's how you probably got 3+ reports for it. So either mute them completely, don't type and play your game. Or just go on a Solo lane push rampage, do some PVE with Ekko's jungle and pretend that you're a Tryn on a split-push mission if you can't handle your teammates being toxic. Of-course, you will likely lose the game but if the alternative was getting a perma. by typing something then do this instead. Or just get off the game, turn off your computer and take a break. {{sticker:katarina-love}} \n\nNo one can force you to play the game. An odd-AFK or Leave because you simply can't handle toxic teammates _is excusable_ as opposed to typing something back to them which can get you perma'd. As long as you don't make a habit out of it! Good luck, OP. {{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2020-01-27T15:38:28.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean yes. If a jungler starts at a top side camp as their first camp, they will path bottom initially. That's how jungle pathing usually works. You should help leash not because you are going to get something out of it but because it will allow your jungler more agency and allows them to be healthier when they gank somewhere, go for scuttle, invade, etc. Don't help a teammate for pretty much free just because YOU'RE going to get something out of it.

Well there you go. Thats why you were punished. Because there is no context that the rules state it is okay to break the rules in. So now that you know that, it should be easier to avoid that impending permaban. Just know there are NO stipulations in the rules that allow you to break said rules. So next time you feel the urge to argue with some anonymous stranger, realize that you are then breaking the rules alongside them. Just report them instead of contributing to the chat war.
