When I tried to login, League said that it was having trouble logging me in and so I was forced to attempt login multiple times before it accepted me back. I was able to get back to the game but it constantly disconnected and reconnected. While this was happening my ping was around 30 and my other device was working fine when i checked the wifi connection. After the game, I was given a leaver buster unfairly since it doesn't seem to be my fault when the client said IT was having issues logging me in. What is happening? and could I get this leaver removed or?","replies":[{"poster":"ShinAkuma567","date":"2017-09-22T23:06:01.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is becoming a serious issue for a me. and has impacted heavily on my RP purchasing, i value my time more than i do my money as some one who works 55 hours a week and if the leaver buster is punishing me for bugsplats that i send bug splat reports too. then im not going to spend my money on something that punishes me for there own. my most recent punishment was the client bugsplated and kicked me out of the game, i rejoined, won the game and still im punished, this game is becoming a conspiracy to waste our time, they release faulty client's and punish us with timed leaver buster ques for using there faulty client. but they know they have the monopoly on digital crack that is yet to be regulated.yes im addicted to the game (digital crack), but its a choice if i want to to support riot with spending my money with them.i've taken to making spite purchases on other games aka Overwatch , dota ,Hots, etc despite the knowledge i will never play them as much as  LOL, solely so riot doesnt get the money because  i know im so addicted i wont stop playing lol.\n\nit's a love hate relationship.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-18T23:45:24.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The important thing to do right now is take a break from matchmaking to prevent anymore [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalties.
