I checked after the match and it now says i don&#039;t even own the skin. One thing to note was that the skin was gifted to me awhile back by a friend. If anyone is able to provide any info on why this happend or what causes this it would be greatly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-07-25T17:51:04.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey B1izzard, \n\n If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content. I'd poke your friend and see if that's the case first. \n\nIf you think that content you have received on your account has gone missing and is not due to that scenario, please sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  We can look into your account and investigate further!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2017-07-17T04:20:30.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya know the same thing happened to me a while back with Phantom Karthus. I put in a support ticket and they told me there was no record of me buying the skin. \n\nPretty bogus, but it was a cheap skin for a champ I barely played, bit of a bigger issue for you. Best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
