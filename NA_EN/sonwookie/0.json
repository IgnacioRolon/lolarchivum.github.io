Not trying to whine here, I am a new LoL player and I love it so far. Getting really good at it and really settled into some fun champions.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering, because I feel like if I did not get S rank from this game (one of the best matchmaking experiences of my life), how will I ever. If that makes sense.\r\n\r\nTo put it more into perspective besides the picture showing my kills, deaths, CS, etc, I won this game. I was playing with the worst teammates I have ever played with on LoL (They were really nice guys just horrendously awful. Standing and staring at turrets awful). We were down 17-0, but when I finally stacced Nasus and went god mode, buying all of his full build items, the enemy team could not touch me. So we won the game, a game we could have lost in 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nCan anyone explain how I did not get S rank? I know a lot factors in but please let me know what I could be doing better at because I want that achieve. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[](https://ibb.co/bvSFZ8)\r\n\r\n{{champion:75}}","replies":[{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2018-07-12T04:27:58.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Having a very low CS while having a lot of assists helps immensely.

Explain?\n\nFirst off, I was saying that the game thinks you're a support if you have low CS and high assists.\nSecondly, CS is not the name of the game. You need kills, assists, and vision on top of farm. It's also a good idea to avoid dying, even if it's an execution. I've noticed that executions really hurt your grade.","replies":[{"poster":"SonWookie","date":"2018-07-13T03:51:50.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meant to reply to other guy.

Did you last hit those kills or did you deal a lot of the damage too? What was your vision score?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WøOxer","date":"2018-07-13T04:45:28.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=afmghost,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TIJRqmEw,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2018-07-12T14:55:17.176+0000)\n>\n> Then explain to me how I can play Lulu and get an S fairly easily.

Either u get lots of kills or average kill / death ratio with huge CS numbers.\n\nAs a support u trying to die less and earn as many assists as u can. Entire champion ranking is based on averaeg players performance so some champs may need way better stats some way less, depends on champion popularity, I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2018-07-13T12:56:16.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WøOxer,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TIJRqmEw,comment-id=0004000000000001,timestamp=2018-07-13T04:45:28.331+0000)\n>\n> Different roles different criteria, for him assists as Nasus clearly won&#x27;t push him further than A+, since in overall basis they are farming and getting kills.
