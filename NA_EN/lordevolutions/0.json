I keep experiencing freezing, lag, etc on this client. It has numerous times prevented me from banning/picking a champ and I keep getting penalties when it's not my fault. Another strange activity is that my laptop restarts randomly because of an unknown problem but, it only ever happens when I'm playing League. All of these have caused problems with Normal, ARAM, and Ranked, and of which Ranked is the worst time for it to happen. Please do something ASAP thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-13T22:07:00.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your pc is stressed, especially during higher activity like champion select.  I suggest enabling [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode to remove the aesthetics during champ select and speed things up.  You could also have some more severe hardware issues if your laptop is just restarting, though.   There could be some overheating which can cause this, doublecheck your vents to make sure there's some solid air flow.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"LordEvolutions","date":"2017-05-23T01:42:52.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the help with low spec mode. I will look into my laptop more and make sure the restarting is not a hardware issue even though it only happens with League and it started as soon as the Legacy Client was disabled.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PilotofWar","date":"2017-05-13T21:31:38.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they wont because they only hire artist and story writer not programmers","replies":[]}]}
