This has been my 4th post on LoL forums to fix this shit. I can't rank up due to this ping crazyness. Riot has not even acknowledged this problem. I spend hours trying to rank and can't due to this BS!! On the edge of quiting due to this!","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dftKc0aIuk0","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dftKc0aIuk0/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I totally realize lag happens every now and then. But this issue has existed since 6.2 or so. This is BS! I&#039;ll have 3-4 games that are perfect (0 lag) and then all of the sudden i&#039;ll have a bullshit game like the one here. where it throws the game and ruins my LP i had gained. I can&#039;t rank for shit. I was almost silver then this shit happened. FIX THIS RIOT!!! WTF! At least acknowledge there is a problem. There are many others here that have posted similar problems.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-14T09:24:03.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let us know if you still have an odd game after this. \n\n[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-14T18:12:29.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The connection guide is a great resource to common solutions for connection issues.

Nothing on my end since i can go 2-3 games in a row with 30-40 ms ping. Then go from that to 300 - 500 for no reason. This is obviously riot's node and as you can see its more common on the forums. People are complaining riot. But you deny them and say its their connection.","replies":[]}]}
