Most of these texts are sarcastic. &quot;ez&quot; is said when they kill us. When I mention ulting because Panth spam ping me cause he died at blue buff all alone I&#039;m still level 3 - 5 holding tower alone.  Jhin leaves lane because I dare try to Soraka E+Q the draven before running off, but he kills me behind tower with his last axe so CLEARLY I&#039;m trolling. Leaves lane and Panth+Jhin flame me ALL game. Is it my fault? Maybe, but me getting punished for something someone else instigated is like getting kids in school trouble for throwing a punch back at a bully who&#039;s already given him a bloody lip. So no, I won&#039;t apologize. I will get this 10-chat ban off my account by being more anti-toxic than usual, but hell no this ain&#039;t my fault. No god-damn way.

Gameplay related offenses when proven to be on purpose are assigned a 2-week ban as the first punishment.

Yes it’s just a few examples, but it proves that they do get punished.\n\nThird off, other people behaving poorly does not give you a free pass to do the same (in other words the \"they started it\" excuse doesn't work here). You're not \"defending yourself\" by retaliating back, you're just being a jerk. Either respond back in a non-toxic manner or just mute them without responding back to them when it's clear they have nothing helpful or constructive to say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-07-04T05:29:43.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I`m not sure why game 2 was listed as a reason, maybe because you called someone blind...but then how would they see it?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MYSTlCFLOW","date":"2018-07-04T07:47:13.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  but me getting punished for something someone else instigated is like getting kids in school trouble for throwing a punch back at a bully who&amp;#039;s already given him a bloody lip.
