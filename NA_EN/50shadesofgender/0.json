In reality, everyone has shit to do and it is hard to coordinate 5+ people to play and practice together. Climbing to high elo should not be gated by how many friends I have or my ability to keep a consistent schedule. It makes absolutely no sense that riot would initially be opposed to sand box mode because it &quot;increases the barrier to entry&quot;, only to make playing solo a massive disadvantage for climbing. Some of the friends I had that got into WoW revolved their entire lives around their raid schedule. Is this what riot really wants high elo to become? &quot;Sorry I can&#039;t go out tonight, my LoL team has practice.&quot; I&#039;m sure some people are into that kind of gaming lifestyle, but for a more casual MOBA it really makes no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterSomething","date":"2016-04-15T01:31:48.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":16,"body":"I'm shit at climbing...\nAnd it has jack all to do with the system.\nI just suck at the game.","replies":[{"poster":"50ShadesOfGender","date":"2016-04-15T01:36:12.914+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MasterSomething","date":"2016-04-15T02:21:20.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eh, fair point.\nThough to me, I really just see a bigger duo queue when I see premade. Most people in high elos duo queue'd, right? Mainly because they could communicate more effectively than the average team- however, this put them at the disadvantage of not communicating with everyone else as well. \nIn higher premades, going 4 means you will always have one odd out and meaning you will have to communicate with him/her effectively, going 2 or 3 is not much of an issue either.\nBut here's the thing that most people are complaining about- 5 man queues. It's understandable- Better communication, better play, etc. I just wish people remember that Riot tuned the system so it would almost always be a 5v5.","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-04-15T03:34:38.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"except if u watch high elo player's stream/video u will realize that isnt the case.\nin high elo there are too small of a player base to make all premades of 4~5 to face the same number of premades. so the system either 1)extend the boarderline, for example matching plat and diamond with master and challenger 2)give them random solo players","replies":[{"poster":"I hate my ADC","date":"2016-04-15T10:11:00.514+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"And that is a problem Riot is trying to fix.\nBut what most people are complaining about isn't related to high elo. They complain that they can't climb in lower divisions, which, like MasterSomething said, has jack all to do with the system. The reason they can't climb is because they have either poor judgment, poor reflex or both. In short, they suck.\nI went from Silver 3 to Plat 3 since the start of this season from almost exclusively solo queueing and I'm still climbing at a steady pace. I don't even look if there is a premade or not in the game because they simply don't matter.

Just because one person climbs to plat by himself does not mean he is any better or worse than someone who climbs there in a group.  If 5 people that were gold last season group together and learn to play the game better and make there way to plat they most certainly deserve it. I love the flip flop arguments that this has started on the boards. People keep talking about how easy it is to boost someone now because all you need is a couple of high elo friends and bam you are instantly in a higher elo than you deserve. But then everyone says that there is not enough high elo players to make groups possible and it screws up matchmaking. Which is it not enough high elo people or everyone knows 3-4 high elo players. Then you get people saying the majority of people hate the Dynamic que system and they are all going to quit paying money untill riot changes back. But people keep saying riot only made these changes to make money off all the people that like to play together.

If you are say in silver, and you team up with some other silver friends, as long as you guys have voice chat there is a high chance that you can climb. because most of the premades right now are just people teaming with random people they knew online, not real life friends, the synergy and communication is much less than a real life premade.\n\nWith taht being said, say you are silver 5 and you climbed to gold 3 with your team, and now you play solo and queue with random people. there is a VERY HIGH possibility of you not being as good as normal gold 3s when playing in solo, because you rely on playing as a team and you climbed with team synergy not individual skill. Your mechanic will be outclassed and you will lose when you queue up solo.\n\nOr you continue playing as a team, then eventually your team will stop because your entire team is outclassed, to the point that even team synergy can not help you win the game anymore, because every single lane got stomp so hard. \n\n**TL;DR \n**\nIt is much more likely for players to focus on themselves and improve their individual skills when playing in solo queue. Even if dynamic queue player aren't asking for higher elo to boost them, they will still improve less because their focus is on the team play not the individual skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostbear14","date":"2016-04-15T21:04:39.620+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sorry but I am very confused you are saying that learning to play as a Team and work with a Team and play as part of a Team in a Team game will somehow become a detriment to your game play. You fully believe that a person cannot improve there own skill and team skill at the same time. My god the elitist bs in this game is ridiculous because there is no way that someone can improve there skill in the game without only playing solo. I hope they do put solo que back in because I want to hear about how long the wait times are in solo que with role selection because if you think it's hard finding people to play support now wait till you can't force last pick to play support in solo carry que.","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-04-15T21:41:43.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"U misunderstood\n\nLeague of Legend is a team game\nClimbing the Ranked Ladder is not a team game","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostbear14","date":"2016-04-15T22:06:59.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Is all the same game Riot believes that people working together in teams is more important than people trying to solo carry games.
