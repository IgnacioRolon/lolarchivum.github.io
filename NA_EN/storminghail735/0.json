I know you mentioned that you checked for corruption already, but let's double check by going through the steps in our [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974). Let me know if that's able to help, and if not we can dig a little further.","replies":[{"poster":"storminghail735","date":"2017-06-05T00:47:40.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for the reply, I did this and installed .net framework 2 weeks ago and it fixed the problem, but now i am having the same problem with the bugsplat. i have tried to do the same things that fixed it originality, but it does not seem to work, help would be appreciated. thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-05T00:53:27.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job getting it fixed up on your own in the past! It might be related to the same thing this time around, but there's a good chance that it's just an entirely different problem.

They'll be able to look much more in-depth than I can here on the boards!","replies":[{"poster":"storminghail735","date":"2017-06-25T00:07:35.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hello, so with the newest patch the first time i launched lol after updating the game worked fine, but the day after the same problem occurred and it bugsplats. i cant submit a support ticket because my account is not verified with the email it is attached to because i don't know what email it is on. is there any way i can change what email my account is connected to?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
