I believe they also talked about it prior to this one, but I felt that one reflected very well his mindset.\n\nAs for a Solution, I'd go Ashe's focus way. Give him a something that stacks while not doing something, then a buff while it's up.\n\nA few variations could be :\n\n  1. Heimerdinger heals its surrounding allies and structures for 10-40 hp/5. While out of battle for at least 3s, he start getting stacks of microtechmaturgicallymagical bots that doubles that amount. the effect is kept in battle while he still has passive stacks, consumed at 1 per second.\n\n  2. Heimerdinger gains stacks of microtechmaturgicallymagical bots for each attacks of his turrets, and 3 per AA. When he reaches 30 stacks, he send out a wave healing all allies and allied stuctures for *x*HP\n\n  3. Castign spells gives Heimerdinger stacks of microtechmaturgicallymagical bots, at 15, he heals the nearest tower for *x*HP.","replies":[{"poster":"JabbaTheHott","date":"2013-10-18T21:46:03.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of your 3 suggested ult, I think the #1 is the least complicated for Riot to do and for us to understand. \nThe only thing with this is that it will make people playing him not want to enter an aggressive mode....","replies":[{"poster":"ploki122","date":"2013-10-18T22:46:50.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 innates*\n\nOtherwise, I don't think that restricting the amount of aggression going toward him is that bad, based on the fact he is a sieger.

To top it off, the stats is a passive stats. If you get +10 AD, you hit, you deal 10 damage more, it's simple and somewhat shows an effect.\n\nIf you stand near heimer for 10 seconds, you healed 312 hp instead of 242... That doesn't make much sparks to my eyes...\n\nThe only good part about it is repairing towers, but that requires clunky playstyle and is even more of an invisible power than the rest of the innate.","replies":[]}]}
