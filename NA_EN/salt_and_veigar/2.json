Where did this blue midget come from? Are you even a champion?\n\n{{champion:78}} :Guys I'm Poppy, I've been here since forever...\n\n{{champion:6}} :I don't know what a \"Poppy\" is but it sounds dissapointing\n\n{{champion:78}} : ;w;\n\n*meanwhile*\n\n{{champion:38}} *Riftwalk* *Riftwalk* *Riftwalk* GAH! WHY CANT I LEAVE!\n\n{{champion:45}} :Ummm, what is this place?\n\n{{champion:38}} :*Riftwalk* DAMMIT *Riftwalk* DAMMIT *Riftwalk* DAMMIT\n\n{{champion:28}} :I told you, that wall is made of solid plot-deviceium, even if you could go halfway through you cant leave\n\n{{champion:82}} :Hey Veigar, this is the place where blah blah champions die blah blah nerf, you get the idea\n\n{{champion:45}} :Hey... that blue girl looks familiar...\n\n{{champion:78}} : ! You remember me!?\n\n{{champion:45}} :Aren't you Tristana? Why are you carrying that hammer?\n\n{{champion:78}} : ... *I swear to god I will kill you all one day*\n\n{{champion:60}} Hmmmm if I did this then... \n\n*Suddenly, the ground shakes. An earth-shattering roar is heard from the outside world*\n\n{{champion:38}} :THE VOID! IT APPROACHES\n\n{{champion:60}} :Kassadin! I know how you can escape! \n\n{{champion:38}} :QUICK! VALORAN NEEDS ME!\n\n{{champion:60}} :If we all gather our remaining strength we can Kassadin absorb it and he might get strong enough to escape! EVERYONE RAISE YOUR HANDS TO THE SIDE\n\n{{champion:2}} :Why the side?\n\n{{champion:60}} :So we don't get sued for plagiarism, duh.\n\n*All the champions barring Kassadin gather their remaining energy and form a giant ball of strength, stronger than even the greatest nerfs\"*\n\n*As Kassadin absorbed the ~~Genki Dama~~ sphere of power some of it splashed on Veigar*\n\n{{champion:28}} :Kassadin! Before you leave, please give this letter to Twisted Fate. Tell him that one day we will cross paths again\n\n{{champion:38}} :You still have feelings for him?\n\n{{champion:28}} :lol no, but he's great at &%$*%*$\n\n{{champion:38}} :ewww...\n\n*Kassadin approches the Wall*\n\n{{champion:38}} :699 units of plot-deviceium huh? No sweat. *Riftwalks*\n\n{{champion:28}} :Damn, his butt was nice.\n\n{{champion:6}} : .-. wow\n\n\n*As Kassadin Riftwalked through he lost much of his newfound strength, but nonetheless he emerged stronger than before*\n\n{{champion:90}} TODAY VALORAN IS OURS, THE VOID SHALL CONSUME ALL\n\n{{champion:31}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:121}} *Incoherent noises*\n\n{{champion:161}} :I need some new friends\n\n{{champion:38}} :NOT SO FAST VOIDLINGS!\n\n{{champion:90}} :Kassadin! But how did you escape? I made sure you were nerfed to oblivion! I HAD TO PAY SOMEONE $2.95 AN MINUTE TO MAKE SURE THE ENTIRE BALANCE TEAM SAW THE NERF THROUGH! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST? I RUN A NON-PROFIT RELIGION HERE!\n\n{{champion:38}} :THIS CAN ONLY END ONE WAY MALZAHAR! WE MUST SETTLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL!\n\n{{champion:90}} :FINE! WE SHALL SETTLE THIS IS BY THE SACRED COMPETITION OF THE VOIDBORN\n\n{{champion:38}} {{champion:90}} :A DANCE OFF!\n\n*Malzahar begins dancing*\n\n{{champion:38}} :Curses! How is he moving while dancing? His moves...too...much...swagger...\n\n{{champion:90}} :HAHAHAHA\n\n{{champion:38}} :Lights...fading...can't...breath...Evelynn...creepy...must file...restraining order\n\n\n*But from the heavens a miracle arrived. Clad in Trinity Forces, the gallant hero comes to save the day*\n\n{{item:3078}} FEAR NOT! DANCEMASTER PHREAK HAS ARRIVED!\n\n*Phreak begins dancing*\n\n{{champion:90}} :How can this be? Those moves! That swagger! AHHHHHH!\n\n{{champion:161}} :HES TOO GOOD! RETREAT!\n\n*The Voidlings and Malzahar retreat thought a {{item:3512}} , and Valoran is safe... for now*\n\nRemember kids!
