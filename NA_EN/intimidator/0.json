So now they get a free 20% damage reduction for a whopping 4 seconds. But no good sir, I have ignite! I will still outduel them! Nope, they get a free 54 + 6 &times; level true damage over 3 seconds while trading. That means that after 2 or 3 auto&#039;s they have already outdamaged your ignite.\n\nBut ignite has much lower cooldown than challenging smite! Oh wait, 210 seconds cooldown vs 75 seconds.\n\nBut they have put 850 gold into a useless lane item!! Again wrong, the smiter just goes to the jungle and smites a camp, going into lane with a level advantage. Perhaps recall early and miss a couple CS but with XP and gold advantage. They can do this whenever they go back to buy.\n\nThen enter the final nail in the coffin.. {{item:3931}} . This item (when stacked) is so broken it&#039;s beyond ridiculous already. Of course Riot will never admit that but that doesn&#039;t make it less true. Every champion is balanced around numbers and they just release this item without even considering the consequences. Champions like {{champion:105}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:106}} aren&#039;t supposed to proc their on hit counters so often.

I guess you have another acc on diamond/platinum that you play master yi in ranked?\nYi for a late game carry was horrible after the feral flare nerfs. You can pick any carry  for top lane and try your luck while having a tank in Yi's place that you have a better game. Hyper carries thrive on high gold income, that was the case of old feral flare, gold and faster clear times with quicker respawns (you could solo baron with a feral flare and spirit stone). You could get feral at 12 minutes. Now you expect your \"sated\" at 17~20.The new devourer is a mid game spike, where Yi is better as snowballing during the early game.\nYes. Corki can burst you. Graves can burst you. Vayne can own you if you don't Q the condem and don't use a red trinket for her ult. ADCs have the upper hand. Yi isn't a great diver unless you get someone out of position or burn a flash.\n\nYi was way better during S4. Back then he could actually 2 shot someone.\nSure, you can play Yi, get to diamond/plat, (hell I did - http://www.lolking.net/summoner/br/6901184#ranked-stats ), but there are way better picks if you wanna be a one trick poney. I like to define viable as boxbox defines riven being viable \"one more nerf and I will drop her\". \nI play Yi because I like all the \"git gud\", \"no skill champion\" that goes on all chat when you outplay people.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-07-20T20:05:17.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, this season i have not played yi in ranked. I was busy playing another champion that was ok but then made broken by the devourer, xin. However, i did play him after the destruction of feral. And i will say it again. YI was ok.\n\nNOt only that, i had yi in my team and my enemy team many times before. And he was indeed a really strong lategame carry.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHyper carries do not always thrive on high gold income. So hyper carries just have kits designed to work without a huge income. For example vayne and yi, both of which are hypercarries, need only 1 item to get rolling. Blade of the broken king. They get stronger the more gold they amass, but please, stop with the bullshit that hypercarries can not be in the jungle. They can. They really can. And they could even before the broken devourer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso, i do not think you know anything about yi. Yi doesnt have a good early, by no means. yi's early is dreadfull compared to any other jungler. Yi only gets a power spike once he gets his ulti. The new devourer isnt a mid game spike. It is just broken.\n\nLike i said before, feral flare and the new iteration of it called the devourer. Are feast/famine items. EIther you will lose miserably or carry everyone. If enemy jungler takes the advantage and ganks REALLY much by 20 minute and the devourer jungler is just stupid and ignore his team because stacks, then the devourer jungler will lose.\n\nHowever, if the devourer jungler farms and at the same time ganks, he can still have his devourer ready by 20 minute and prevent enemy from taking any strong actions with ganks.\n\nHow do i know this? Jungling with xin. I managed to both  gank and farm up my devourer by 20-25 minute mark. THe enemy couldnt do anything. I played with xin before the devourer and i instantly felt the difference. The current xin was 100% stronger than my old xin without devourer. I could do my q knockup in 2 hits, not 3. I could heal incredibly fast, i could do so much damage that even fiora would be ashamed.\n\nDevourer simply put, made xin from allready strong champ, into a broken one. The same happened with shyvana, kayle, yi.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdc's can burst, thats right. But even they wont outburst a yi. A smart yi has his q and w at disposal. And yi will kill them faster than they manage to kill me, i have seen this far too many times.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe only time, that yi was better than the current version, was the days of ap yi. No other iteration is stronger than the new one, even feral flare yi pales in comparison to this new item.\n\nHe can still 2 shot people, with this item especially.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nALso about \"better picks\" dont give me that bullshit. I play jayce as adc when i get the role, there are \"way better picks\" yet this pick works and i do well with it. Hell i main goddamn fcking shen. Better picks? My ass. THere are no better picks.

I guess I know nothing. Plat with only one champion means nothing. Please. MAIN it before you can rub in ones face \"you know nothing\" or at least play it in ranked. Seeing someone else play with it is something. Actually playing it is another.\nYi as a FARM jungler has a better start than most hyper carries that people are throwing in the jungle (Kayle, vayne, twitch). Sure. Yi gets a power spike with lvl 6. WW too, FIddle, twitch, orianna.. etc. etc etc.... (Sad {{champion:77}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:126}}  etc.., exceptions {{champion:421}} {{champion:223}} ). Lvl 6 is generaly a powerspike in anyone kit. If you mean that it enables ganks, I totatlly agree with you.\nYi as a GANK jungler sucks.\nYi as a control jungler, sucks.\nYi as counter jungler sucks.\n\nFeral flare was a way more broken item than the current devourer. \nPlease. Don't compare xin with Yi. Xin has CC, can be built tanky and still be relevant  because of the burst, he can even initiate and use  with ult to broke the enemy frontline. The play pattern is totally different with yi. Xin counter ganks are good (before and after 6). Yi has poor counter ganks, working generally as the clean up team (with people picking TP for that in early game). Apples and oranges.\n\nWhen I said about early game: \"where Yi is better as snowballing during the early game.\" You can consider Yi as an assassin with snowballing potential. But he doesn't  scale well in late game during TFs. Thats why you have to win before the late game. Feral flare gave a huge power  at 12 min that made Yi an unstoppable beast. 20 min as a devourer? No problem. I'm happy that he can solo baron again, but he could do it better and earlier in s4.\n\n\n> \n\n> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> \nI agree with AP yi.

Trissexual played only karthus in any role in diamond (suport, jungle, adc, mid, top...). It doesn't mean it was the better pick for other players.I said before and I say again. One trick poney. \nIt's the same way when you compare cars. Sure, you can carry stuff with your Nascar race car but it will have problems with space. You can use your truck in a F-1 race.

The game was just forfeit by then (around 20 min mark). At least without devourer she actually has to auto attack 3 times to proc that true damage.
