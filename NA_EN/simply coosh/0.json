I can&#039;t even express my wishes for this because I am now a broken player.  After TWO seasons of the following:\r\n\r\nToo many Maokai&#039;s playing Mid lane against a Jayce and getting destroyed.\r\n\r\nToo many Alistar Jungler&#039;s that can&#039;t understand WHY they are behind and of little use to the team.\r\n\r\nEtc, there has to be a better way for people to actually SHOW they have EARNED the right to play Ranked Queues.  And to all the people that will say &quot;I&#039;ll just play my friend&#039;s account and get him past the test&quot;, Riot - you need to start religiously tracking those IP Addresses and start tossing the BAN HAMMER a little more liberally.\r\n\r\nPlease do something.  Inaction will not qualify as an action.  You owe it to your players!!!","replies":[]}
