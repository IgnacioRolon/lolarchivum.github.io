At this point we feel confident moving forward with tests in more regions. Keep an eye on your client for signups!\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8Zpukqb.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n**What did we learn?**\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, we’re testing three major changes to Clash: **a staggered scouting phase**, to spread out the amount of games starting simultaneously; a more **streamlined backend flow**, to break out some of the systems that relied on each other to start Clash games; and a **disaster recovery tool**, for when we may need to easily extend or roll back each game phase. We’re now done with our time on PBE, and are gradually scaling up our testing in each region in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Key issues during regional tests:**\r\n\r\n_Champion mastery load_: We saw champ mastery causing unusual load during the scouting phase. We’re optimizing this now so the champ mastery service will be much more responsive.\r\n\r\n_Parties service errors_: As part of our streamlining efforts, we use the parties service (like when you get into a lobby or voice chat) to keep teams together. Last week, we saw some players incorrectly restricted from entering their Clash matches. Because Clash’s team creation handles many of these eligibility checks as well, we were able to adjust the parties logic for Clash specifically.\r\n\r\n_SMS verification_: The first major trial of our disaster recovery tool! We used it to extend the lock-in phase while we fixed an issue with SMS verification in some regions. \r\n\r\n\r\n**What’s next?**\r\n\r\nWe’ll continue to bring one-day tests to more regions around the world. Some regions may even see tests that go for longer than a day to ensure we’re truly as ready as we can be.\r\n\r\n**Stay up to date on Clash**\r\nAs we move into bigger tests and ultimately towards launch, you’ll see continue to see updates from us. Keep up with Clash [here](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/tag/clash), and we look forward to seeing you during regional tests!","replies":[{"poster":"DolceandMorgana","date":"2018-10-29T23:54:26.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question regarding start times: I understand for the test in NA there will be a single start time at 5PM PDT, perhaps to test server stress, but will we see a return of 2 different start times (5PM and 8:30PM~) for those who do not get home from work/school/activities by 5PM?

Thank you.\n\nIn the future we do plan to keep the two different start times in NA, but for this test we will only have the one start time.  That being said, we've adjusted the start time for tomorrow's test to 6PM PDT to try to mitigate some of the player concerns we've heard around a single start time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2019-04-27T00:44:43.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So uh...6 months later and I haven't seen any mention about Clash anywhere.
