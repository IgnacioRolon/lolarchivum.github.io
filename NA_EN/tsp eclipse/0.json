Like being able to drag the chat box/friends list  to the desktop so when league is minimized you can still see and respond to chats?\r\n\r\n2) the ability to buy skins in champ select. And/or gift someone in your lobby?? As long as you don&#039;t need anymore RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-06T20:06:16.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have actually talked about both of those features! Unfortunately that is as far as we've gone, for now. We won't be working on features that are not already available in the legacy client.

The new champ select removed a lot of existing features such as purchasing skins or wards in champ select. \n\nWill the new client address these issues players have been complaining about since the release of DQ? \n\nOr are you only gonna develop stuff which exists in the chanp select and not the past ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-06T20:22:24.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We didn't remove features.

They haven't implemented them yet because they're \"building\" it \"from scratch.\" That's my understanding.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TSP ECLIPSE","date":"2016-09-10T20:20:20.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding and i totally agree.
