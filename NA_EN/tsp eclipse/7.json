I know this is rather late but with Nocturne now being more played because of the black cleaver changes, I noticed a few things...\r\n\r\n1) His E-passive will only work with his own fear and Shacos... Because of Fiddlesticks change [4.3] his &quot;fear&quot; became a &quot;flee&quot;, nocturne cannot speed up to an enemy affected by Fiddlestick&#039;s Q or Hecarim&#039;s R.\r\n\r\nI believe since the act of making an opponent &quot;flee&quot; because of something terrifying should also proc his passive on his E.\r\n\r\n2) The champion &quot;bio&quot; in client doesnt state he passively gains movement when moving towards a &quot;feared&quot; enemy.\r\n\r\nI propose that Nocturne&#039;s E should apply to all fear/flee&#039;d opponents... Just so more comps would work with him..\r\n\r\nJust my 2cents\r\n\r\nTSP FEAR","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-02T07:16:10.507+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, nice catch, flee effects should definitely work with that passive.
