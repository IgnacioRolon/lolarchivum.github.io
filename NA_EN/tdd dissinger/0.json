I have been faithfully using said ward skin all year (and quite a few people have complimented it. I agree it is by far the coolest of last years ward skins.) When Riot Implemented the new summoner related Ward Skins, I had seen on reddit that there was a possibility the old ward skins got wiped and this is true. beyond submitting a ticket is there any way I can see if they still exist for me? I am about a months worth of time left with that skin and I kinda liked it, not gonna lie.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-10-02T04:40:25.586+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TDD Dissinger!\n\nThanks for reporting this!  We are aware of an issue in which people who still have active Ward Skins from Harrowing 2012, no longer have an option to use them in the League of Legends client.  We are currently investigating the root cause of this issue, and once we have a root cause of the issue, we will deploy a hotfix asap.\n\nI'm sorry for any frustration or aggravation this may cause in the meantime!","replies":[{"poster":"TDD Dissinger","date":"2013-10-02T10:28:32.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Dart I did a game and the ward skins are still active, I have merely lost the ability to turn them off. While I bought the years worth and I planned on using them for that year, I feel others may wish to turn theirs off to preserve them and they currently don't have that option. not sure if that info helps at all or not.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-10-02T18:57:54.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TDD,\n\nI am not sure what you mean by \"preserve\" them.  Please keep in mind that regardless if you use them or not, the timer on them will expire at the end of October.  We are working on restoring functionality of these ward skins as soon as possible, and may consider compensation for the time where you were unable to use this content.\n\nI hope this alleviates some confusion!","replies":[{"poster":"TDD Dissinger","date":"2013-10-02T21:46:25.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I say preserving what I'm referring to is turning the skin off so you don't use up the time left. I had no clue though that the ward skins would naturally expire after a year. Was that put out there somewhere for the people?","replies":[{"poster":"killtype","date":"2013-10-02T21:58:56.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes when you buy them you buy them for that amount of time if they are active or not the timer still ticks down turning them off doesnt stop it","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saberprivateer","date":"2013-10-10T17:11:00.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TDD, those ward skins should be back up for you.

Diehard Lux fan and to use the ward when it came out, but I got a year worth of the ghost ward because i had nothing to send ip on. Really looking forward to getting the ghost ward back for another year, i have IP stocked up for this. Now the permanent ward skins are cool. Lux and Raka wards ftw, and the Draven ward.... totally necessary for the league of draven xD","replies":[]}]}
