This just started happening recently and has kicked me out of promo’s 2 times now due to this. \n\nVery pathetic as i play and pay a decent amount. My connection is just fine, not sure why this is happening but it says i’m kicked for inactivity. But i was in the middle of a conversation so not sure why and the last time i just got kicked, it literally just jumped over to me to select a champ","replies":[]}]}
