I think the account may be permabanned and that's why they didn't send me a link back. Im thinking this because one day while i was on this account I saw that my hacked account was online and i began talking to him and all he kept saying was ill give you the password when its permabanned, because all game i spam racism and abuse. I have picture proof of this and would like to know if it is.

The best advice I can give is to be patient!  The more you \"bump\" your ticket, the longer it will take to get a reply since we answer tickets from oldest to most recent.  We'll get back to you and figure out what happened and why the email wasn't received.\n\nSit tight, we're on it!","replies":[]}]}
