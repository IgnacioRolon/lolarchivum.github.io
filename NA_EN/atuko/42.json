Sona, mana regen, not touching assassins, indirectly buffing resourceless, making jungle an inconsequential role, etc.\nI'm not a sona player myself as I think she sucks.

Sona takes two steps forward, shields herself, presses Q, and then the enemy adc has lost a chunk of health.  For free.  Yeah, she can be punished, but not nearly on a 1-to-1 ratio as she just punished you.  Which, mind you, will happen again in only a few more seconds.  And if you did punish her through poke, she will have healed it back by the next go around.  I realize this isn't a huge advantage, like you said at most it is a 30 cs lead at high level play, but also at high level play we're talking 30cs X 20g = 600g lead for just their adc, not even including whatever money Sona got from the consistent harass.

OP asked for an analysis and I gave one, the one that I'm assuming Riot is going with because that is what makes sense.  She is strong in lane.  One of the strongest.  But past that she is nothing.  I believe Riot wants to tweak her laning, which is what I'm assuming a small decrease in her MS does since, let's face it, late game that 5 MS means nothing between her upgraded boots and activated speed boost.  Does she need tweaking?  I think the answer is ultimately yes. Should she be a top priority or one at all?  Probably not.  But I'm not trying to prove that she is broken, because she isn't, but it is a harder time than it is against most supports in soloQ because she doesn't require as much adc interaction to get her job done, compared to say Leona or Thresh.  Personally I think they need to siphon power off of her Q and give her more utility shifted towards mid to late game presence.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2015-01-11T03:45:06.847+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"then your tea, fucks up and she will be useless for the rest of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-01-13T15:01:20.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Byrnes,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Qj0iNYbI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-10T22:40:58.067+0000)\n>\n> While @LastNameIceCream's analysis is quite - for lack of a better word - simple, it I think pretty much describes the essence of it.

In particular, if you get good at using Sona's AA reset on power chord, you can absolutely chunk people.  Sona's new W is quite powerful in scramble situations where everyone in the lane is low.  She can sustain up from 20% to 60% quite quickly.  Combine these two effects and you have a champion that can reasonably expect to win almost every lane.  \n\nIn teamfights, Sona is still mostly a walking ult, but her new E does enable easier catches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatesDefiler","date":"2015-01-11T16:22:17.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"the smartest thing you can do most of the time in the game is to sit back, play safe, and subtly help your team as much as possible.  sona is the easiest character who does that the most effectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-01-13T02:11:12.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Individually for her abilities:\nHer [Q] is undodgeable and won't care if you burn flash or dashes trying to not get hit by it.\nHer [W] makes it difficult to trade and out-poke her.\nHer [E] gives a fair amount of MS and that can be used any number of ways.\nHer [R] is almost instant and thus practically undodgeable, capable of stunning a whole team.\nHer passive's utility is strong, especially since it will be up so often.\nShe becomes stronger and stronger as the progresses, so her early phase barely compares to her power in the late game.\nHer auras scale with AP and CDR, making them even more effective in team situations, and there is no limit to how many benefit.\n\nLet's move on to her item synergy:\nArdent Censer lets her [W] proc the attack speed for the entire team, on top of the initial heal.\nLich Bane makes her [Q] pack a wallop, and will make building her as an APC hurt.\nAegis of the Legion makes her [W] more efficient.\n\nDue to her playstyle, her only counters are to pick the hard-engage tank supports Thresh, Blitz, Leona, or go with Braum and block all of her damage. Annie can maybe punish her, too, but that's more of a skill-matchup.\nTrying to counter her alone doesn't really help since her greatest strength is working with her team, and a smart Sona does not stray from her team for too long, so picking her off is difficult without wasting everything only to have to deal with her carries right afterwards.\n\nWhen directly comparing her to another support, they likely have to land skillshots or manage a more convoluted method of using an ability. At 100% potential and accuracy, Nami and Karma can and will surpass her, but since you can't land *all* of your skillshots or *always* proc off the secondary effects of your spells *and* make it worthwhile because of the enemy team's reflexes or through your own error, Sona's consistency and simplicity stays superior.\n\nNeed it any more in-depth?
