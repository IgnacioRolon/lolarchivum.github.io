If you force teamfights and act so as to avoid her to do a pick on sensible targets (aka, the team needs to ward well and avoid having the carry go facebrushing), she becomes unable to tilt the balance in favour of her team.\nI had games with her in which I was the most fed on the map but still couldn't do anything because of this. It's part to the counterplay she offers, imho. She's good 1v1, she can make good picks and jukes, but she cannot pressure objectives and performs poorly in teamfights. If the opponent groups up, her menace gets halved.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"God is AFK","date":"2014-11-18T03:21:23.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm afraid this request will probably fall on deaf ears. Leblanc's current kit doesn't have much interaction to it right now, the only kind I can think of is her E and how the player can move out of it's range to disable the snare from occurring, but since leblanc can also move to keep it attached that argument falls flat. \n\nTbh any champion's kit that contains a lot of point and click, unavoidable damage is probably going to be on the chopping block at some point.","replies":[]}]}
