And seeing that they're just going to keep adding more mobility and they don't know how to balance the game already, it's probably just going to keep getting less and less balanced.  I doubt it'll ever be even close to balanced ever again.  If you want balanced, you should give up on this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeonDemonOfDeath","date":"2015-03-08T02:18:56.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it's because I was a newbie, but you could pick whoever and do good with them.

While certain champs are noticeably stronger, if you know what you're doing then most champs can go pretty well.  For instance: maybe you feel like going Vlad mid.  Not known to be OP but he works pretty well.  Yorick top/ jungle?  He has great early damage and good snowball potential if you have one or two other snowball champs on your team.  Evelynn?  She doesn't have it nearly as bad as people think, most just don't know how to play/build her right.  A knowledgeable Eve can carry against most enemies.  Elise? Now she i can understand not playing.  She's in a pretty bad spot, but most are decently fine.  I still see Trundle and Nunu junglers do exceptionally, and I've been seeing a lot of Veigar supports do good as well.  Fiddle is still a strong jungler and I've seen him be a pretty good anti-assassin mid too.  If there are any champs in specific you have in mind (other than Elise), I'd love to hear them.  I like to look into those kind of things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-03-07T23:13:55.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, when did you think that was?\n\nRelease Xin Zhao for example, one of the defining champs of \"Play this to win\", existed way back in S1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoisauceCCH","date":"2015-03-08T00:11:10.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is no incentive to play anything other than the broken champions, because you get punished massively for doing otherwise. Riot is a new company that has 0 idea of how to balance their game, and it's showing. They hire people who are clearly inept (Ghostfailure), and balance around the .0001% of their players that they deem matter. If you're not a pro, you're worthless in their eyes.","replies":[]}]}
