Basically its a form of cc that allows everything except mobility spells, basically you can move, and use skills, but not flash or LeBlanc w. This would add counterplay to some hyper mobiles. I would recommend this on Talons E, which use to silence(silence bad rite)\"\n\n\"Yeah, I like cripple a lot, and I&#039;m going to echo what our champion design lead Meddler said: it&#039;s not a question of if, it&#039;s a question of when. We need to find a good fit! \nWe&#039;ve got the tech hooked up and almost ready to go (I&#039;d like more feedback for the victim to tell them WHY they can&#039;t move before we ship this on a champion/item) and we&#039;ve experimented with it both on an item (single target activatable, think BotRK, that crippled an enemy for x seconds) and on a champion on an ultimate (large area that cripples you as long as you stay inside of it). The latter was pretty punishing: when you can indiscriminately apply the effect you hose a lot of kits entirely. Champions like Ahri, Renekton, Riven, Vi feel like they cannot function at all if under a cripple effect, and that makes me suspicious that the effect may be too hard-countery to work on a champion (aka pick the dude with cripple and the enemy&#039;s Riven pick has been eliminated). It may be cool in a very gated way on an item? Maybe we&#039;ll add it to Exhaust? Maybe we&#039;ll put it on a single target champion ability on a champ that can&#039;t just kill Riven during the duration? Lots of questions to be answered, but I think the effect needs to be in League eventually.\" ---- ZenonTheStoic\n\n**i\ncan\nnot\nwait**","replies":[]}
