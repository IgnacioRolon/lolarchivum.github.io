The stun isn't long enough to escape and the movement speed boost doesn't hold up against 99% of champions mobility / slows.\n\nI have long wanted to watch some of these games.

Then replace her E with an actual spell. The spell portion of her E (not the aura) is literally the most pathetic spell in the game right now. Her W and Q aren't terrible when you ignore the aura, her E is a speed boost which does literally nothing since the aura already pushes her over the cap.
