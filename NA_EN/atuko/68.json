That a support champion has to build tons and tons of AP on a support budget to actually do well? And is more relied on for chunking people&#039;s health rather than actually supporting? \n\nLike I really feel like this is a legitimate concern that people are trying to voice, but everytime they try, everyone just automatically assume that people want simple Sona buffs when thats not the case\n\n/feelsreallybadman :/","replies":[]}
