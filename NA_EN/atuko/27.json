Unless you had the splash art done before and then somewhere along the rework figured you wanted to change her appearance a fair bit, aswell.\n\nStill, wouldn't it have been smarter to simply do the rework first and the splash art later so it was certain they'd fit?

Is it just me though? Am I the only one that thinks Trist's getup in the splash is a LOT better than what they did with her model? She's so much scrappier and interesting in the splash with the chainmail skirt, jacket, belts, metal gloves, etc. \n\nNot to say the new model for her base is bad by any means, but it just seems like they're trying too hard to make her seem rebellious or loose cannon. I think her splash costume is just a lot more interesting, tells more story. I'm probably gonna copy and paste this into a new thread to ask in general what people think, but I would be a lot more excited about this if we got the Trist they showed in the splash.","replies":[{"poster":"Melancholy Exile","date":"2015-01-13T23:22:01.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I definitely agree with this.

The chainmail and armor in conjunction with leather and the gun really gives her this awesome unique look.  But when I think to all the other heroes with metal in the model/skin that have received visual updates and the metal became \"plastic\" looking due to them reducing the contrast to fit in line with the new SR, I think it's fine that the new model stayed away from the armor.  \n\nAlso a lot of splashes have a way of making a hero look way cooler than they really are in game since the artist is not limited by having to think of what the champ looks like when animated/in the map(clarity); so I do believe that if the same artist were to make a new splash based on the new model, I'm sure you and all the rest of us would be more into the all leather/rebellious look.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2015-01-14T11:55:50.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her armor could be between the new and the splash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DynamiteGazelle","date":"2015-01-14T04:51:10.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
