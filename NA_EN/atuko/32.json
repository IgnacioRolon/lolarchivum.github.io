The first variation was better because it had a \"desert\", \"dry\" kind of feel to it, as opposed to the new one which is just \"orange\". Sure you can argue that she looks like a \"fire-snake\" but Cass is not a fire-snake nor does she have fire-powers, she has poison powers, so it does not fit. Cass&#039; home is Shurima, the DESERT, (edit : apparently its not her home but she still has affiliations with the desert.) which is what this chroma gives off.\n\nThe second one, or the \"blue\" one, I think the change completely ruined this chroma, it doesn&#039;t fit the chroma theme (curse) NOR does it fit Cass, Cass doesn&#039;t need bright colors, they don&#039;t they fit her base. The old palette for this chroma was absolutely gorgeous and complex in a good way, only to be replaced with a generic blue color scheme. Plus her arm bands are orange....WHY are they orange?\n\nAnd lastly the black one, I don&#039;t mind the change to the black one because it pretty much stayed the same, but I still prefer the old one.\n\nI don&#039;t know why everyone seemed to have a problem with these chromas, but the \"dulled\" colors fit Cass AND the theme of the chroma pack more, plus they looked gorgeous. It&#039;s called \"CURSE.\" That&#039;s why her skin was so pale, she&#039;s apparently cursed. (Everyone was complaining that her skin was too pale which is probably what resulted in the skin tone change in the blue.) The bright colors frankly don't fit Cass and the new variations don&#039;t even fit the theme of the chroma pack anymore.\n\nThe old ones had gorgeous, stone-like, ancient palletes, that fit the whole curse theme AND Cass only to be replaced by generic \"orange\" and \"blue\".","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-10T18:47:15.672+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of the first chromas looked dead and lifeless.

Dead and lifeless fits the theme better than whatever the new one is supposed to be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-08-10T19:59:27.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly. who wanted to pay money for dull, uninteresting color variations? it's about time someone objected to it, and the chroma pack is much better for it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-08-10T10:42:17.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The orange and blue ones were definitely better before, the black one i actually prefer the after though.

The blue one has ORANGE arm bands on a blue color scheme, that entire chroma looks tacky now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-08-10T12:30:29.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"At least riot learns from nasus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-08-10T09:29:45.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The blue one was better earlier.

The faded colors work much more with Cassio's theme. Now, if they could change her face to not look ridiculously ugly, that would be nice.
