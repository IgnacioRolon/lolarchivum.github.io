Akali already does the assassin job better than Diana can, so Diana should put more of her power in auto-attacking.\n\nOne thought I have is that her passive should give her greater AS bonuses as she levels up. They might have to cut a little damage off her passive's proc, but in exchange you'd get more procs and thus better DPS.\n\nIn essence, it could turn Diana into something like a \"magic-damage Master Yi\".","replies":[{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-03-23T05:05:50.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see Diana in a spot between Akali and Irelia atm.
