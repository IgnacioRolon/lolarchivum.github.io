Practice tool is League&rsquo;s version of sparring with a punching bag: the extra training you can do with a mechanically unfamiliar champion so you can enter the Rift with more confidence.\n> \n> Here are some of the things Practice Tool will let you do:\n> \n> * Infinite Gold\n> * Reset your Cooldowns\n> * Lock your level\n> * Freeze minion spawns\n> \n> We&rsquo;re still figuring out the full list of features, but future additions will be similarly focused on helping you practice more effectively by yourself and polish your mechanical abilities. Prototype work on practice tool has just begun, but stay tuned for updates as we keep working throughout pre-season!\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/road-pre-season-practice-tool-works\n\n!!!!!","replies":[]}
