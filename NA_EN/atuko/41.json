Also he has a silence(Q) and a mini-silence (R)! He also has percentage DoT damage AoE(W- 32% in 4 seconds ). And lastly a he has another Dot but worst becasue if a unit dies because of it it jumps to a target and deals a lot of damage. He isnt OP he is balanced in my opinion cause his q and w are REALLY hard to land and that is bad because those two skills are the beginning to his combo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthSpectrum","date":"2014-10-12T14:51:10.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on whose he is against.\n\nHe is very good against almost every melee mid lane since he can shut down their abilities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2014-10-13T01:29:29.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he's very strong.

If your team engages them and you manage to hit your silence on multiple units and have them sit on your AOE for even 2 seconds, you're dealing TONS of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2014-10-12T22:00:59.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.","replies":[]}]}
