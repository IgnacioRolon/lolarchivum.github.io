I agree with you. You cant play your favorite champs anymore. So many of them are obsolete and clearly just not viable. Is Singed top going to do anything to a Gnar? A Kalista? A Jarvan? Is an ashe ever going to be on par with Kalista? Never in your life. Rammus has to burn a summoner's spell to even get close to LeBlanc, only to be laughed at and dashed away from.","replies":[{"poster":"Terff","date":"2015-02-21T22:20:54.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Singed can proxy farm and deny other lanes ganks so thats pretty decent :/","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-21T22:54:22.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No reason to chase singed when with their mobility they've already caught you.","replies":[{"poster":"Terff","date":"2015-02-22T02:01:00.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-02-21T22:19:42.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's funny you say that, because Ashe counters Kalista.

I'm talking about what two similar 'classes' of characters,  how one set seems to have everything they need and more. Gnat does more cc, more damage, better laning etc. Kalista can kite an entire team with her dashes. Ashe can, potentially,  but kalista has far more effective tools to do so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-02-22T06:28:04.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar was played in several high stakes matches, not just LCS but stuff higher than LCS, like, between different regions (search The Best LOL Match Ever, WE China vs. CLG Europe, starring names like Froggen on Lee Sin mid, Misaya on Orianna and Weixiao feeding enemy Kog hard as Ez, with Caomei on Rengar).\n\nNow almost every single champ in that match is bad for the positions they were played in. Lee can't mid anymore, Kog and Ez suck, Rengar sucks, Chogath sucks, Zyra sucks, Sona sucks, Orianna and Rumble are good but slowly slipping, Its fucking sad how everything immobile got padding put on their kits while the mobile champs have god tier damage and sometimes are even tanky as fk.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-02-21T22:43:07.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's fun to me cuz i STILL PLAY MY FAV CHAMPS\ni MAKE THEM WORK\n\nypu're right, wheres the fun in playing the super meta fotm OP champs?\nyou can have fun making other shit work","replies":[]}]}
