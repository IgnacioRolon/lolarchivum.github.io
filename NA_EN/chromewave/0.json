I've recently had a problem with my connection, it started around when the world championship login screen was implemented.\r\n\r\nWhenever I enter a game in between 4-10minutes in I will normally get an \"Attempting to reconnect\" message that will happen about 2-4 times per game. its not my computer or my network, I got a new laptop and router in the past month.\r\n\r\nSomething different about these attempting to reconnect messages that I get that are different than the regular messages is a number of things.\r\n\r\nFirst, when the message comes up, I can see the game still going on around me even though it says I'm not connected and it will show when someone dies and I can even see the chat being updated, but when I try to type something or move my champ, nothing happens and I can type in the chat but it will not show up to my team.\r\n\r\nSecond, when I disconnect, instead of my champion running back to the summoner platform like usual, they will just stand there, not moving, and I watch helplessly as the other team gets a free kill, and during the attempting to reconnect it will still show me I died, go black and white, and have the countdown timer as if I died... because I did.. because I was just standing there not able to do anything.\r\n\r\nThis problem is really annoying and I've been dominating a lane when this happens then all of the sudden I'm way behind in my lane. Instead of explaining this looong problem to my team, I just joke about how I should stop stealing McDonalds internet to play LoL. I know I'm not the only one with this problem so I hope it gets fixed soon.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated,\r\nThanks! :D","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-25T21:17:01.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey reundeadmadman,\n\nI read through your post, and what you described is strongly indicative of an unstable connection.
