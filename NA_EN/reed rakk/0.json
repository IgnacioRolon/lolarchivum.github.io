I know this may not be the best place but I have to ask a customer support question. I am having serious issues, I also am aware support on weekends is limited, I am ok with a wait in regards to recovering my inactive/Hijcaked LoL account.\n\nI am attempting to recover my account on    support.riotgames.com\n\nI believe it is classed as Unrecoverable due to 2 years of inactivity and several attempts to reset, mixed with the fact I get zero email alerts to the email's they were signed up with.\n\nThe process is confusing  somewhat( a lot of information to remember back to around 2010) as I follow the steps and send off the account request ticket. Great right? The system works....except upon receiving a email alert with the ticket ID(finally some form of progress and the 1st step to recovery hopefully).\n\nMy attempts to view said ticket becomes a issue, the email request's I log into a LoL account. Seems very counter productive in a attempt to recover a account, that I need to be able to log into a account to view my submitted ticket. But wait there's more! I made a new account with a alternate email to view the ticket and it's future updates. Except when I attempt to view the ticket from another account, I get directed to a 404 page on the riot game support website. So in my attempt to view the ticket, I decided I would submit another ticket from my newly formed account. Alas as it turns out(as I navigate myself, again to the account recovery section of the support website) I am tossed a request to log out in order to recover a account.\n\n...(What?)\n\nSo to conclude, I have no way of viewing or updating my ticket for account recovery without the account username/password I am trying to recover.\n\nNow granted I may have yet time to receive a response, that is 100% understandable. My hopes have soured knowing when I get a email alert of Ticket update, I have no way to respond without logging into  the very account that is attached to my email address.\n\nIf a admin/mod/support member is able, I would love to give them my ticket ID # for reference sake.\n\nThanks for your time to read this, have a good one.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T03:03:04.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that's pretty weird =\\ .

In order to recover a account, you send a request while not logged in. Which means the ticket ID is attached to nothing from what I grasp.\n\nI appreciate your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T04:11:57.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it seems a little weird for us to recover your account through a ticket that isn't attached to your account. We use this process because it's much more secure for the player. If your account is hacked, the email address tied to it could be compromised as well so we ask that you use a different, more secure email to correspond with you while we recover your account. \n\nI do see your ticket, and those agents should be getting to it relatively soon. You'll still be able to write back and forth to them without being signed in, but you'll have to do so through the email responses we send!","replies":[{"poster":"Reed Rakk","date":"2017-05-21T04:14:41.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perfect, thank you!\n\nThat is comforting to know, I have no problem communicating via email if that's possible.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
