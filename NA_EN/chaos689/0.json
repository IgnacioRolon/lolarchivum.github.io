I remember back in S5 when I REALLY wanted to try Aatrox. Three months later, I FINALLY had 6300 IP, no runes, and no rune pages. I got into a game and BAM. It&#039;s Aatrox. I had NO way of trying the champion because A: He sucks and B: he&#039;s never free. This was a rare case where I actually still wanted the champion by the time I had the IP for him. RITO plz either let us try champs (not rentals) or reduce the grind.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-01-08T14:46:42.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you can always go for the refund.\n\nand 6300 IP are not that hard to farm.\n\ni mean, i'm sitting here with 20k+ IP and don't know what do do with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaos689","date":"2017-01-08T14:48:29.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if I used my refunds on Annie and Yi when I was new? \nWhat if I haven't been playing every day and play on the weekends like most sensible people have time for.
