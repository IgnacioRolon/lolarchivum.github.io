She wasn&#039;t meant to have AoE and tiny knockups and no damage.\nShe was meant to be an assassin.\nWith lower HP, almost every lategame attack does at least 10% of your maximum HP. That&#039;s like a tiny end of the bar! With her Q critting and being magic damage, a oneshot build with Void staff and crit burst makes her amazing! She had movement speed burst, a gapcloser that can *maybe* cc to lock down an ADC for a second or so, and her ult gave her a bit of protection while she dived onto the backline and oneshot the ADC with her critting and her magic pen and her stattikk shiv. She was PERFECT. She was beautiful and you killed her, Riot.\n\n(This video made me realize that she could be an assassin. Then I started thinking about her kit...)\n\nEDIT: Are you all Malphite mains? You must be - you have rocks in your heads.
