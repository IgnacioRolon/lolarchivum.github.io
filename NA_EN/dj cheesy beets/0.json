I am struggling because I feel that my cover letter and resume are both high quality, the only downside is that I have never worked for a video game company. I have over 7 years of management experience, even being an executive at a multi-million dollar resort, but is there any way to even get an interview without ever working in the video game industry?\r\n\r\nThank you for any tips/suggestions!","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2016-08-23T22:41:47.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give yourself some credit fam. Not working in a video game industry doesn't have to be perceived as negative. It can be perceived as a positive and fresh take on the position you're applying for. 7 years of management experience, an executive at a multi-million dollar resort? These are some pretty badass job experiences and life experiences that any employer would probably value. Being honest, probably not a lot of other people have this experience so take pride in it. It's totally on you on how you brand it and how familiar you are with the kind of work you are investing in. \n\nPS: If you get the job, please know I'm like your biggest fan and send a ticket to this resort my way *dabs away*","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Cheesy Beets","date":"2016-08-24T15:23:47.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Prynce,\n\nThank you for your feedback, I greatly appreciate the encouragement! For me, the main difficulty is that there is no way to followup on any applications, as Riot does not provide an option for this. I have even tried to call their main number for their office, but have not had any luck with getting through to anyone. It has been over 3 years of trying, but I do not want to give up as I have dreamed of working with them since i started playing in season 2. \n\nFeel free to add me in game if you would ever like to play!\n-Chase\n-ign: DJ Cheesy Beets","replies":[{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2016-08-24T19:58:53.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll keep that in mind :) !","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nami in Bush","date":"2016-08-23T21:24:03.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"*cough cough* \n\n\ngit gud","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Cheesy Beets","date":"2016-08-24T15:31:59.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello This Urgot,\n\nThank you for the constructive comment, I am actively trying to \"git gud\" and better myself to obtain my career aspirations. \n\nHave a great day!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DJ Cheesy Beets","date":"2016-08-25T13:52:55.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.","replies":[]}]}
