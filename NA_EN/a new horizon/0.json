I now remember why I would never touch this game again with all the RNG or crappy ass bugs but it still baffles me how this has been reported multiple times and is still not fixed. Yeah its -1 LP but it possibly could have been +(insert number) and possibly had ranked my bum ass up (I doubt it though).\nhttps://imgur.com/3Kqf4tp","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-14T02:53:14.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a bug, it's the way MMR works.  If you were playing a number of people lower rank than you and still only got 4th, the algorithm thinks you did worse than you were expected to.  It's not a cool feeling, but there's nothing to fix.","replies":[]}]}
