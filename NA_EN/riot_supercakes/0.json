More specifically, we have a &ldquo;Guide to Skin Price Tiers&rdquo; on our player support page that promises that 1350RP skins would have new sounds, and some of these SKT skins don&rsquo;t. \r\n \r\nFirst, I want to apologize that we&rsquo;ve not updated this guide in so long. When we originally wrote it four years ago, our philosophy on pricing skins was different (not dramatically, but still). When we change our thinking, this also means we owe you an explanation, and we failed to do this.\r\n \r\nIn the case of these SKT skins, all of our normal playbooks were thrown out. We didn&rsquo;t look at them as an individual set of features, but rather a holistic experience. We wanted to create World Championship skins that are highly commemorative and, because they are rev-shared, give you an opportunity to honor SKT in a really meaningful way. \r\n \r\nWe don&rsquo;t charge you for &ldquo;our effort.&rdquo; There is no evil overlord tracking our hours and converting that into RP.  But, there is a level of value and quality that we strive for when creating content and once we hit it, we price accordingly. In the case of the 2016 SKT World Championship Skins, we believe they are priced fairly for what they are: a high quality execution across a number of dimensions, even if those dimensions don&rsquo;t 1:1 match our checklist.\r\n \r\nBut we also know we made a commitment, so we&rsquo;re going to live up to it. We&rsquo;re still planning to release these skins at 1350RP in Patch 7.13, but we will release an update to them soon after that adds in sounds and checks those boxes. Honestly speaking, we&rsquo;re not sure if the skins are necessarily better for it. That&rsquo;s why they weren&rsquo;t part of their original design. But we also don&rsquo;t feel that we&rsquo;re holding up our end of the bargain otherwise.\r\n \r\nThis conversation also gives us an opportunity to revamp our policies to match how we currently approach our work. We owe you an updated explanation that really gets into why we make the things we make. We&rsquo;ll probably also update or retire that article once we can. \r\n \r\nWe&rsquo;re really excited to launch these 2016 SKT Championship Skins, and thank you for all of your feedback to help make them the best they can be. \r\n \r\nxoxo\r\nSuperCakes","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceBedazzled","date":"2017-06-23T03:07:23.773+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is just the way i see it and think it should be.. \n520- Outdated tier, sometimes even includes recolors that would just be chromas now a days.

If riot starts judging the quality of new skins by comparing them with old ones we have a massive problem, and that is what I fear they might do. If riot starts to decide these SKT skins are 1350 because their effects look cooler than their old 975/1350 skins then we are very fucked. At that point price reduction should happen often because the price no longer reflects the skins quality at the time but reflects the skins raw quality along all times.

This isn't a massive shift, but something that needs an update. From my experience, it's pretty infrequent that the difference between the tiers isn't clear in the product itself, but I acknowledge that it does happen. As an aside, I'm looking forward to getting you a dope AF Yorick skin after an unreasonably long wait.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-06-23T08:09:33.005+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SuperCakes,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=BmYixAkT,comment-id=00090002,timestamp=2017-06-23T04:33:13.158+0000)\n>\n>As an aside, I&#x27;m looking forward to getting you a dope AF Yorick skin after an unreasonably long wait.\n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nFrankly, I'm not interested in \"dope AF\" Yorick skin.  That sort of phrasing from a Riot employee doesn't mean much to me.  Hell, a Rioter told me on Reddit that Yorick's rework would be \"metal AF.\"  It wasn't and he knew it, even if he would never admit it in public!  So, when you make a \"confident commitment\" to getting Yorick a skin in that dev blog and say you look forward to getting a \"dope AF\" Yorick skin to me, be aware of everything I've been through as a League player.\n\nAs a long time Yorick fan, I've been ridiculed by both Rioters and my fellow players for my choice in champion.  I've experienced first hand the winces and groans from Rioters for telling them I was a Yorick fan.  I've lost FB friendships with a few Rioters on your team/department because I keep pressing them for a Yorick skin.  I've had multiple verbal scraps with Rioters (in person and over social media) about Yorick and his need for some positive attention from the company.  I've even had the pleasure of meeting Ryze and Tryndamere after Season 3 Worlds and mentioned that Yorick really needed a skin to them.\n\nAlso, I've been through all the \"special snowflake\" nonsense with other Rioters on the QA side of the skins department.  How they say Yorick is a \"tough champion to make skins for,\" despite Elise being just as tough and still having more options in half the time.  I've been through the blatant hypocrisy of the skins team when they say that reworked champions need time to get a new skin since all their old skins count as new, then see them release Pool Party Taric and Pool Party Fiora weeks after their reworks because \"they were inspired.\"  And, I've heard the excuses from both Rioters and players about how \"Yorick's just not popular and it's not profitable to make a skin for him,\" even though we all should know that excuse is complete nonsense.\n\n(I won't even mention how much money I've spent on this game, but it's probably enough to pay your salary for a week.  Not that it should matter.  Even a Yorick fan who's waited as long as I have and not dropped a dime for a skin should experience the same Riot love as every other fan.)\n\nSo, with all that out of the way, what I'm really interested in is a Yorick skin that makes all that worthwhile.\n\nI'm interested in a Yorick skin that shows the ultimate level of creativity, effort, and love from this company, that they're willing to do their best to do right by a long neglected fan base and that they're willing to demonstrate their regret for making those players wait so long.  I'm interested in a serious skin that helps promote a long neglected champion into being played and picked up by more players.\n\nAnd, I'm also interested in seeing if your team will continue to work on more Yorick skins after this one (at a faster cadence) or if you're just done with him for another 5 years.\n\nI've waited 6 years already, through all that nonsense.  If I have to wait another ten and a half months to find out how confident your commitment really was, so be it.\n\n(And, to be complete, six years is not an \"unreasonably long wait.\"  It's teetering on the edge of \"cruel and unusual\" and no other fan base should ever have to experience that.

I started playing League on July 1, 2011.  The first champ I bought (outside the ones that came with the physical pack) was Yorick.  I bought him because of his lore and paid full price because I didn't know about the sales.  Hell, I got a chance to tour Riot HQ last year because I was so damn critical of the Yorick rework, so someone at Riot recognizes my fandom and passion for that champion. (Thanks Reav3)\n\nNot that I needed to justify _any_ of that.  If I'm to hold SuperCakes to her word, you should take me at mine.\n\nAlso, the idea of Riot needing to make a profit is a joke.  Riot Games is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings, a Chinese internet firm (and have been for at least a year and a half).  Riot's only need to make money is to justify Tencent's investment in the company and to keep the doors open.  If Riot was built solely on making money, they'd have released a dozen Yasuo skins and just as many for Jinx as those two champs are the company's most popular (by a long shot).\n\nHell, not everything Riot _currently_ does generates a profit.  Their NA internet backbone likely costs them more than it's worth.  They haven't make any real money on their professional circuit in five years since they don't advertise during the broadcasts.  And, no, their skin sales don't pay for _all_ of that.\n \n> You don&#x27;t have to expect anything. &quot;worth your wait&quot; lmao. You take this way too personally, no one&#x27;s out to get yorick fans. He was a badly designed champion, somewhat fixed in his update, but still a bad champion.\n\nUp until recently, Riot has a company that demands high expectations from their players. because they had those same expectations for themselves.  Why shouldn't I, you, Joe Schlomo or any random player hold them up to it?  If you are willing to settle for \"meh\" work, that's on you.  As a player, I choose to demand the best that this company can produce.  That includes a high quality and wait worthy skin for a champ that, for reasons real and imagined, hasn't seen any love from this company since launch.\n\nAlso, Yorick is \"a\" champion, not a \"bad\" one.  The \"bad\" is generated from your personal opinion, which is worth almost as much as mine.\n\nHave a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"Challenged Jinx","date":"2017-06-24T04:34:20.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Also, the idea of Riot needing to make a profit is a joke.\n\nThey're a business, they exist to make a profit. they sink money into the LCS because it's a long term investment.

I don't have to have a personal opinion about him being a bad champion. It's a fact weather you like it or not, besides not being on rotation for years, and after his rework he still had a low pick rate. He isn't a popular champion he's still the most braindead \"antifun\" champion to lane against next to heimerdinger, who because is a yordle, is at least someone popular enough to get skins.\n\n\nI buy skins that look neat, I don't care what champ they are for. Jinx is my favorite champ, but i'd say 95% of the time I don't use skins on her because they don't look neat to me. If they stopped making skins for her It wouldn't bother me in the slightest, and some of my favorite skins that I have are for champs I don't play, I just buy them to support the game.\n\nCould they do cool skins for yorick? Sure (void, cosmic, cat lady). WIll they before another rework? Probably not. The shadow isles event was probably the best update for him, and that didn't even save him. Until they figure out a better way to balance him, he's going to keep festering at the bottom of the regret pile.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-06-24T08:20:59.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Challenged Jinx,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=BmYixAkT,comment-id=0009000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-24T04:34:20.589+0000)\n\n> They&#x27;re a business, they exist to make a profit. \n\nRiot is a **wholly owned subsidiary** of Tencent Holdings.

Spend a lot early to make a framework that isn&#x27;t shit, and reap the rewards a few years down the line.\n\nYou assume so much in this statement, it's jarring.\n\nDo you know how the major sports in America (NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS, NHL) make most of their money?  **Broadcast rights.**  Local and national networks, including cable, pay billions of dollars every year for the rights to broadcast the games, which are then shared between the team owners and, eventually, trickle down to the players.  For example, the NFL will receive nearly $40 billion from four different networks between 2014 and 2022.  Split between the 32 teams, that will average out to almost $1.25 billion each over those 8 years.\n\nOn what format does the NA LCS broadcast their professional matches?  Twitch and YouTube, which are free for fans who have an internet connection.\n\nOn the subject of \"big advertisers,\" sports leagues don't touch all that much.  While they may have \"official product\" designations that companies will pay for, most of the advertising dollars go to the networks who are trying to recoup their losses.\n\nAnd it's not like Riot's hasn't had sponsors either.  Coke Zero (for the Challenger Series) and American Express have both sponsored entire seasons of the NA Challenger Series and the NA LCS.\n\n> You&#x27;d be surprised.\n\nWould you be surprised to know that a significant portion of the skins Riot releases aren't intended to make money, but that they're something cool for fans to have and enjoy?  The most recent example of this is Dragon Sorceress Zyra, a skin they admitted in that dev blog wasn't going to be worth their work (low play rate and all that).  You can also add all of the \"Ultimate\" level skins and the Hextech crafting ones to that list.\n\nLike I said before (and you conveniently ignored), IF Riot was all about profit they'd have released a dozen Yasuo skins and just as many for Jinx.  Those are Riot's two most popular champions by a wide margin.\n \n> Remember when yorick wasn&#x27;t on free rotation for years, and Riot said releasing the champion was a mistake and they apologized for it?\n\nI challenge you to find a Riot quote where they apologized for Yorick's release?  They've said that he was rushed (he was forced into a slot meant for Vi, if memory serves) and one Rioter admitted that his ultimate was added at the last minute, but they've _never_ issued an apology for releasing Yorick.\n\n>I don&#x27;t have to have a personal opinion about him being a bad champion. It&#x27;s a fact weather you like it or not, besides not being on rotation for years, and after his rework he still had a low pick rate.\n\nYou're combining opinions of the old and new versions of the champion.  Has this conversation really affected you that much?\n\nCurrently, according to champion.gg, Yorick enjoys a win rate between 50% and 57% depending on rank and amount of games played on the champion.  He's also picked in 1% of all games.\nYorick's win rate is just too high right now to justify any buffs, which explained most of the QoL changes in Patch 7.10.\n\n\"Whether or not\" you like it or not, you're projecting a personal opinion as fact and it's inherently wrong.\n\n>He isn&#x27;t a popular champion he&#x27;s still the most braindead &quot;antifun&quot; champion to lane against next to heimerdinger, who because is a yordle, is at least someone popular enough to get skins.\n\nYorick is not \"popular\" right now because he was not created with the current team-fighting meta in mind, but with an intended focus on split pushing.  Any sentiments of \"braindead\" and  \"anti-fun\" are just your personal opinions.\n\nAnd, for the record, Heimerdinger hasn't had a new skin in three years (July 14, 2014).\n \nAlso, Riot's not going to rework Yorick.  They're fine with him the way he is.\n\nHave a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"grimbldoo","date":"2017-09-28T05:13:03.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TerraRising,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=BmYixAkT,comment-id=00090000000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-24T08:20:59.236+0000)\n>\n> Riot is a **wholly owned subsidiary** of Tencent Holdings.

Sometimes we add more into a skin than those guidelines call for and we don't change the price because we don't think it's necessary.
