Now we have serrated dirk which builds into items that scale better into the late game than old {{item:3142}}. Plus there is so much free damage in runes.\n\n It's not Wukong's fault. He was borderline useless until the new runes came out and showed up briefly in Season 6 or 7, I can't remember which, as a jungler with a similar play style to {{champion:56}}. Wukong lost viablility in Season 4 and hasn't seen much playtime till now.\n\nIt's honestly quite fair for him to finally get a moment to shine, but it's not really his fault that he is so strong because it's really just anyone who does high burst damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"9NINE","date":"2018-08-22T08:29:42.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wicked Jesterr,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bs6gQcQl,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-08-21T23:27:50.892+0000)\n>\n> He does not need to stabilize, he needs to be reworked, specially the Passive.\n\nor just change how people should have more armor and mr or health","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-08-21T23:30:29.118+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"Wukong should probably be kept sub-50 until his rework.\n\nIt sucks, but, tbh, he's just too toxic in playstyle.

I'd hope that Wukong would be next after that, but it feels like every time he gets a chance someone with a more popular champ shows up asking about their champ and Riot instantly jumps to that ship... sad thing is he's also supposed to get a title change when he gets updated which again, hasn't happened yet T.T","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2018-08-22T02:51:08.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"see, I'd normally agree cause MY GOD does he need a rework, but at this point his rework could be anywhere between another 3 weeks and 4 years from now after Riot updated EVERY other champ and a few of them 2-3 times over and they don't have anything better to do. The thing with Wukong though is that he is pretty much in the same boat as {{champion:32}} in terms of where he should be skill wise. Amumu generally is really good at low elo and generally bad at high elo and that tends to make their win rate above 50% on average. Wukong is fine with an average 50% win rate at least if he's REALLY got to wait for a rework but under that just feels terrible for his mains (I looked it up and he has the same winrate as {{champion:164}} atm, who has a far higher skill cap).\nOf course all this would be moot if they just... you know... took some time to update him >.>","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-08-21T23:50:59.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly agree he needs a rework he has been unhealthy for a long time people just didn't notice it until he was steamrolling games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-08-22T00:52:23.044+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats actually pretty high for base attack speed.\n\nit looks like a really small buff, but this is also scaled up with attack speed items and any other source of bonus attack speed, like his e and precision runes.\n\ni think theyre trying to push him back into more of a fighter and sustained damage build from his 1 shot assassin build. though hell need larger changes to accomplish that.","replies":[{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2018-08-22T02:49:13.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can't push him into a sustained damage fighter when he has no real sustained damage in his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-08-22T02:54:07.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gabetheguy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bs6gQcQl,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2018-08-22T02:49:13.650+0000)\n>\n> you can&#x27;t push him into a sustained damage fighter when he has no real sustained damage in his kit.\n\nwhat about his e? and he can build more tanky with triforce and titanic hydra to survive longer engagements.\n\nim not sure how viable classic fighter wukong is, and if this is going to be enough to make him a better fighter again.\n\nbut this seems to be the general idea behind his nerfs and this buff. they want to reduce frontloaded damage, and give him more damage in drawn out fights by increasing his attack speed scaling.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BadPiriPiri","date":"2018-08-22T22:01:25.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw this before and im pretty sure it will be the additional % bonus attack speed at lvl 1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2018-08-22T03:19:58.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In lies the root of the problem honestly. he NEEDS larger changes.
