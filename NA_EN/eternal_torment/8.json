There will be no discussing this. Worse namesakes have been found to already existing champions, some can be directly referenced to censored slurs, so if this name is an issue to you then the entire game is as well, following the logic of name-sakes being absolutely no-tolerance that has been expressed beforehand.

She has low cooldowns, which can be near-nonexistent late into the game, reliable Combo Potential and STRONG survivability. However, her Damage Ratios are in a grey zone and she has short ranges and is very strongly built around her Passive, restricting her to be a fighter and not an effective Mage. Phallas' Strongest bet lies in the potency to deny positioning with extremely present and threatening Zoning tools, at the risk of said Zone always carrying herself at it's center. Phallas stands out by not creating a line in the sand, but being that line herself. \r\n\r\nThe Strongest Itembuild on Phallas would be, without much question, a Tanky AP build with some Offtank-Options. {{item:3100}} {{item:3151}} and {{item:3030}} are recommended Items and {{item:3020}} or {{item:3047}} will be your Recommended Boots with sub-options for Items being either {{item:3285}} and {{item:3089}} for a Full Damage course, {{item:3157}} {{item:3165}} for some Ap and Sustain or  {{item:3053}} and {{item:3065}} for a much tankier Approach.\r\n\r\nThe Recommended Lane for Phallas is Toplane.\r\n\r\n--\r\n**TRADES**\r\n\r\nTrading with Phallas in lane is fairly simple. You close in as much as you can before using your E and hit the enemy Champion for the first time with your empowered Basic Ability before using your Q for it's Second Ability and it's Bonus Effect. Should the Enemy feel Provoked and decides to go in hard, you can use your W To siphon some Health back while on the retreat, but be careful, your W is a channel and can thus be prematurely interrupted by hard CC and Channel-Stoppers (Kassadin Q and Viktor R) so be sure you use it AFTER your enemy fired their disabling Effects.\r\n\r\n--\r\nWhen beginning an All Out Fight, typically Phallas will begin with the same way she does her Trades, up to the second Ability.\r\n\r\nNext, you will want to use your Ultimate, instead of your W like with lane-trading, to really begin your All In, using your third Auto Attack to charge the first attack of 3 for the Execute. Since your cooldowns have been lowered a LOT due to the cap-ignoring CDR, you can restart your Process of using your Dark Prayer: Invocation for another Shield, more Movement speed and Attack 2 out of 3 and then follow with the combo of Dark Prayer: Folly and use Dark Prayer: Curse while Folly is still in Effect, applying a Slow and a not to be underestimated combination of 2 Damage over Time Effects. \r\n\r\nThrough this Combo, you have one charge for The 4 Dark Prayers, marking your 3rd Basic Attack within your Ultimate's Duration , and thus making it your Execute, combined with the Extra Damage Application from the Dark Prayer: Curse Bonus since that was your last used Ability and replaced Dark Prayer: Folly's Bonus Effect. If everything beforehand hasn't killed the enemy the Execute should do it. If not, continue to go ham for the entire Duration of your Ultimate and slowly plan your retreat once it Expires. \r\n\r\n---\r\n#Small lore:\r\n\r\nEast of The Iron Pinnacle, at the peak of the Mountainrange lies a small Shrine dedicated to the World Runes and their power to create or destroy the world as is known. Created Millenias ago, it has held a Historical purpose and serves as an Focus point for Pilgramige to those who seek to study the History of the World Runes and the full extend of their individual powers.\r\n\r\nPhallas, a specially Brash and self-Absorbed Shrinewarden and former Priestess, is the sole Occupant of the Shrine. She has been around the time it has been created and has served as it's second Warden ever since, having been chosen by her Predecessor, it's Architect. \r\n\r\nPhallas realised very early what the protection of the Shrine really meant and, devoured by the false Sense of Greatness, performed a Dark Ritual to bind her soul to the Shrine itself. However, the Ritual misfired desasterously and annihilated all other Occupants, leaving Phallas to be it's sole survivor, her existence Ankered to the building making it unable for her to leave for extended periods of Time. \r\n\r\nThis Ritual corrupted Phallas and turned her Hubris into borderline Personality Disorder, completely emptying her of any Positive emotions and rendering her to be all Rage, Pain and to suffer an endless loop of Inferiority-Complexes fed by the dread of unappreciation, rendering her to Roam the world as a hateful being to instill fear into any and all she comes across for the sole purpose of her own Infamy. Not only that, but her Soul has been fragmented and bound to the Shrine, rendering her ageless and everliving until the Shrine is destroyed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#A few Dialogues:\r\n\r\n**PICK:** \r\n\r\nEnlightenment is a gift given only by me.\r\n\r\n\r\n**BAN:** \r\n\r\nThis Hubris!

Where my last champion was good, this one is pure evil. An actual AP bruiser type champion, something Sylas has tried to approach and only somewhat succeeded at it, Phallas is meant to at least create the Idea of a full Bruiser with AP Ratios that function. \r\n\r\nSadly, making an AP Bruiser was impossible without somehow overloading at least one Ability, so I chose it to be the passive Ability since Passives are the easiest to control. \r\n\r\nAs for the Lore and thematic, Every champion in LoL has some kind of Higher calling or purpose, from a certain point of view. Even the Evil ones.\r\n\r\nThe Void seeks to devour all for it's own sustain and survival\r\n\r\nAatrox is just really, really, REALLY depressed,\r\n\r\nMordekaiser wants to establish a united world under his rulership, even if his personality is tyrannical asf, World unity is still a higher callin IMO. \r\n\r\nPhallas? Fuck anything and everything. Her self-worth stands at the center and absolutely NOTHING else matters to her. She doesn't need a kingdom, she doesn't need any revenge or purpose. Her only goal is that every living being knows, and fears, her name. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#I hope this Kit was a good read and if there are any feedbacks please be free to share it.","replies":[{"poster":"ChickenWrap","date":"2019-08-12T01:05:30.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The OP of this thread has asked the moderation team to disable voting, and it has been done.\n\nNothing to see here, back to your regularly scheduled discussion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheUrbanKitsune","date":"2019-08-12T02:00:29.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A 1.5 point and click silence???\nYeah, sorry, but no thank you.\nThe entire kit seems very overloaded in my opinion, and doesn't make much sense cohesively.\n\nI'm not gonna comment much further on the kit, but her lore...\n\n>\"This Ritual corrupted Phallas and turned her Hubris into borderline Personality Disorder, completely emptying her of any Positive emotions and rendering her to be all Rage, Pain and to suffer an endless loop of Inferiority-Complexes fed by the dread of unappreciation, rendering her to Roam the world as a hateful being to instill fear into any and all she comes across for the sole purpose of her own Infamy.\"\n\nDisorders.

Thanks for offering more than a oneliner response.\n\nThe goal was with her personality to be deranged to a point where it doesn't make sense to define it. It wasn't meant to be a defining personality trait in itself, it was meant to be the focus point that influences her personality traits. As stated, every single other champion in the game, maybe say for shaco, has some form of purpose or grey zone in who they are. And even Shaco has some form of intended gain in the form of his own joy. Yeah, I could have written it out more to make clearer definitions, now that you point it out, it does look somewhat mixed up. I should have written it out rather than try to keep it short. i realize that.\n\nAs for the name...Another namesake could be Pallas, the honorary title of Athena, goddess of War and Intellect, but not a single fucking person, say for the one guy who's comment came right after yours, have even dared to think about it. This entire name trainwreck started because one guy wanted to make sure nobody could think of any other possibilities. Aside from that, Phallus is the name of one of the lesser mythologic gods of joy and fertility. The synonymous terminology for a genitalia was taken after his namesake...so even then the comparison is really only there if someone specifically looks for it, and I don't have many good news if you see a name and the first comparison popping into your mind is a dick.","replies":[{"poster":"TheUrbanKitsune","date":"2019-08-12T19:14:35.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">\"As for the name...Another namesake could be Pallas, the honorary title of Athena, goddess of War and Intellect, but not a single fucking person, say for the one guy who's comment came right after yours, have even dared to think about it.\"\n\nI'm not much into the finer details of remembering every name in mythology.

You don't have to look very hard at all to see the name 'Phallas' and instantly connect it to 'Phallus'. It's literally a letter off. \n\nYou ask for serious criticism only, and even go as far as to have the mods disable voting, yet when you get serious criticism you come back with defensive arguments and personal attacks.\n\nI am a Fine Arts major going on my fourth year of university. I am very interested in character design and the likes, and have done a lot of study in that area, as well as many required art history classes.\nThe words 'phallus' and 'phallic' come up pretty frequently when discussing certain parts of art history, especially Greco-Roman stuff.\nThat's kinda why my mind makes the ever so difficult jump (sarcasm, in case you didn't get that) of one letter.\nEven without this background, I'm sure most mature adult humans can and would make that connection fairly easily, though.\n\nRiot has talked about having to change champion names before because they didn't translate well into other languages, being that they looked/sounded similar to existing words in that language that may cause issue. [Here's the post about it.](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/12/naming-new-champions/) \n\nNo matter how much you may like the name, and think it's clever or whatever, it still sounds way too close to 'phallus' to ever be used.

So first of all, I'm guessing Phallas is supposed to be a reference to Pallas, aka Athena. Having a strong Targonian connection is fitting for such a goddess. I like the idea of having an establishment that is connected to the history of the World Runes with an association to the divine. It gives a connection between the celestials and the World Runes which is a much needed justification for their crusade, which went as far as leading to the mess that made the Darkin.\n\nAs for her kit, the one unique trait that stands out to me is her ability to ignore shields. That's is an incredible utility that alone is worth revolving everything around to take advantage of. {{champion:92}} Riven and {{champion:77}} Udyr were considered issues in the past due to how well their shields mitigated damage output. Even shielder supports were nerfed due to how oppressive it was. Circumventing shields altogether offers an existing tool to deal with these issues even if they were to ever become significant again.\n\nI would like to see the shrine explored in depth. A color story to express her emotional turmoil as well as the history of the World Runes that the shrines provide would be a compelling piece. This would make her situation more relatable and human while giving a chance to explore the awe that Mount Targon provides. As of now, it is difficult to understand the weight of her folly which is creating a disconnect with her lore and her kit. It's difficult to see her as a dark individual, in the same way as we see {{champion:25}} Morgana.\n\nOne way to make Phallas's kit more personal to her character is to use her abilities in her lore to create a connection between legend and reality. If it isn't possible to clearly express a mechanic in a seamless way within storytelling, then it is most likely extraneous and should be removed as it runs the risk of leaving the champion overloaded. Currently, her kit has too much going on and can benefit greatly with simplification in design--aka removing unnecessary mechanics. One example of an unnecessary mechanic is the ability to ignore grievous wounds. This only serves to minimize methods to balance her and doesn't feel good playing against as a level of counterplay is stripped away without any compensation.\n***\nThese are troubling issues that even I had issue with when creating my custom champion. I fortunately had a strong theme and lore-to-kit basis which made adjustments quite easy while maintaining personality. I empathize with the desire to create an AP Bruiser that actually has powerful AP ratios rather than simply _significant_ ones.\n\nSo, I hope that during an extensive lore based build, you are able to think of ways to achieve this in a grandiose, intuitive manner rather than an overloading of mechanics.

So first of all, I'm guessing Phallas is supposed to be a reference to Pallas, aka Athena. Having a strong Targonian connection is fitting for such a goddess. I like the idea of having an establishment that is connected to the history of the World Runes with an association to the divine. It gives a connection between the celestials and the World Runes which is a much needed justification for their crusade, which went as far as leading to the mess that made the Darkin.\n> \n> As for her kit, the one unique trait that stands out to me is her ability to ignore shields. That's is an incredible utility that alone is worth revolving everything around to take advantage of. {{champion:92}} Riven and {{champion:77}} Udyr were considered issues in the past due to how well their shields mitigated damage output. Even shielder supports were nerfed due to how oppressive it was. Circumventing shields altogether offers an existing tool to deal with these issues even if they were to ever become significant again.\n> \n> I would like to see the shrine explored in depth. A color story to express her emotional turmoil as well as the history of the World Runes that the shrines provide would be a compelling piece. This would make her situation more relatable and human while giving a chance to explore the awe that Mount Targon provides. As of now, it is difficult to understand the weight of her folly which is creating a disconnect with her lore and her kit. It's difficult to see her as a dark individual, in the same way as we see {{champion:25}} Morgana.\n> \n> One way to make Phallus's kit more personal to her character is to use her abilities in her lore to create a connection between legend and reality. If it isn't possible to clearly express a mechanic in a seamless way within storytelling, then it is most likely extraneous and should be removed as it runs the risk of leaving the champion overloaded. Currently, her kit has too much going on and can benefit greatly with simplification in design--aka removing unnecessary mechanics. One example of an unnecessary mechanic is the ability to ignore grievous wounds. This only serves to minimize methods to balance her and doesn't feel good playing against as a level of counterplay is stripped away without any compensation.\n> ***\n> These are troubling issues that even I had issue with when creating my custom champion. I fortunately had a strong theme and lore-to-kit basis which made adjustments quite easy while maintaining personality. I empathize with the desire to create an AP Bruiser that actually has powerful AP ratios rather than simply _significant_ ones.\n> \n> So, I hope that during an extensive lore based build, you are able to think of ways to achieve this in a grandiose, intuitive manner rather than an overloading of mechanics.

I was starting to lose all hope of getting serious replies with everyone missing that Phallas relates to Pallas Athena and instead decided to jump the bandwagon and compare it to Phallus instead because one guy thought the mere chance of it means that I absolutely should not get any positive recognition at all.\n\nYou do make some valid points. I have tried, and still try, to make an AP bruiser kit Idea that can be minimized in terms of it's offering but jesus it is so difficult...it almost feels like trying to balance comet. If I set the cooldowns too low or the ratios too high the character becomes a poke or burst mage respectively, and making a unique kit with minimal tools is so damn near impossible since a lot, and I mean a LOT of options have already been exhausted on existing champions. That said, I will keep trying.\n\nOnce again, thanks for your indepth feedback. it was the first one where I could genuinely build something up upon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Divin1ty","date":"2019-08-12T00:44:52.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh, another Concept to Phallus?","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2019-08-12T00:54:04.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Divin1ty,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=yfJtQh9A,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-12T00:44:52.785+0000)\n>\n> Oh, another Concept to Phallus?\n\nThe post is serious replies only.\n\nIf you cannot adhere to that then I will have to make note that your comments don't validate.
