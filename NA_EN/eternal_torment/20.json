This is bad\n\nThere is a simple counter-argument to this, showing why this reasoning is flawed.\n\nFor simplicity, assume that every single player in LoL is a self-centered, super-toxic player, except few honest guys (who I am gonna call “victims”).\n\nA victim plays support and, as you may have guessed, gets forced by others to go AFK. The problem is: how are they gonna do that, precisely? They can flame in chat and spam-ping, sure. They could also resort, in some cases, to intentional feeding, trolling and similar things (but this is inefficient in the long-run since they will just lose games out of it, so this method is self-defeating). Finally, they can, if capable (big “if”), try a DoS (or DDoS) attack to force him out of the game, but this last point can be counter-acted effectively via standard methods against DDoS and, in any case, you could do this even now (for example, to stop a team-mate from feeding/trolling).\n\nSuppose that this abuse on victims goes on for roughly 2-3 weeks. After that, what will happen is the following:\n1. The number of reports will sky-rocket;\n2. The number of punishments will also increase;\n3. Chat and pings will get systematically muted, since this is the true “counter” to what toxic players are doing;\n4. Some players will quit the game, but those who stay will have likely developed a very good knowledge of these “AFK abuse tactics” and how to effectively counter it (or become immunized).\n\nAfter the dust settles, the so-called “winning strategy of forcing AFK” will fade out.\n\nThe real reason is simple: apart from what is basically a hacking attack, there is no way to strictly “force” a player to go AFK in LoL.\n\nYou can flame/spam-ping him: /fullmute.\nYou can troll/feed: oh wait, we already have that. And the purpose was making him go AFK to win the game, so starting to troll yourself is self-defeating (enemies become stronger and the probability to win decreases).\n\nThere is an additional case which I am not going to discuss in detail here, which is when you have, say, a pre-made botlane of friends in vocal chat. One may say to the other: “please go AFK so that we can try to win”. This is the “cooperative AFK strategy”. This may actually work... for a while. But not in the long run.","replies":[{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-09-01T09:58:17.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A victim plays support and, as you may have guessed, gets forced by others to go AFK.

Riot encouraged, enforced and validated the current meta. It is unrealistic to think that Riot will do the same for the forced-AFK strategy. More generally, it is really a stretch to put \"the standard way to play the game\" and \"abusing a player to make him AFK\" on the same level, ignoring all the dynamics which led the former to become the meta.\n\nWhat about reports and bans? Support not csing won't get you banned, while trying to force someone to go AFK will. You cannot arbitrarily ignore the social dynamics and all the processes which created the meta in the first place.\n\n> Of course it is much more acceptable for a support player to give up farming minions than to give up playing at all, but still there should never be a situation in which anyone going afk is better for the team than staying.\n\nThis is all the difference that matters. Also, situations like that, although quite extreme, already exist. It is the reason why \"go afk\" became a thing. Finally, the key point to be made is that Riot can fine-tune precisely how much having one (or more) AFK(s) translates into an advantage. It doesn't need to be a big advantage: in fact, it doesn't need to be an advantage at all, only a band-aid to the wound caused by the AFK in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2019-08-31T13:44:34.049+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Riot doesnt care\n2) Theyd have to spend amy time implementing something and these days id it doesnt make them a dollar they are just too lazy to bother\n3) They are surprisingly out of touch and dont see it as near the problem it really is and dont really care how frustrating it is for us cause it isnt frustrating for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-08-30T08:56:01.675+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Riot is afraid that it will just allow the fed champion to carry and cause feeding players to be bullied into afking….\n\n\nWhen in reality, its always better to have that extra kit on your team that could mean anything from cc to utility to at the very least some map pressure.\n\n\nEspecially considering, even if the still connected players had addition stats, they would just get out rotated and lose objectives...\n\nProvided that the team of 5 has a brain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2019-09-02T12:24:41.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They think loss prevention would lead to abuse, and more wintrading.\n\nThey are concerned a compensation mechanic would increase toxicity. \"Alt f4, we're better off with a bot than you\"\n\nWhich is hilarious, considering how toxic the game already is.

The best solution, I think, is stat increases (mana and cooldown boosts in particular). This can help make up for missing damage and CC, for example.

All these bots do is feed which bolsters the enemy team's XP lead much faster than if there was no player there to feed them consistently. Also, you can't form complex strategies with bots, for example, setting up an ambush or sneaking an objective. You might as well be playing 4v5.\n\nI've never played DOTA so I can't speak to how effective their approach is in that game is but this definitely won't work in League. I'm sure you have been super fed before and managed to get yourself 3 manned in the jungle and died still. In League, having a stat advantage is nothing compared to having a numbers advantage. Unless these afk compensation stats go way overboard, it's not gonna make it any more likely that you can win. There is also something else that having a bunch of extra stats can't replace and that is pressure. The lack of pressure being a man short creates is the number one reason 4v5s are nearly always unwinnable. No amount of stats can give you a single player worth of pressure.\n\nAs for the solution used by mobile MOBAs. You seem to be suggesting here that the LP loss be reduced. I don't really want to get into an overly long technical post so I'll just say this. It won't work. It will fuck up the ladder and can lead to abuses that will make things far worse in the long run. LP has a direct relationship to MMR. When you start tampering with LP gains without consideration for MMR, you open the door for all kinds of shenanigans.\n\nThere really is no good solution to this problem. Punishing players for leaving might actually be the only viable solution and I hope we stick with that. I don't like afks anymore than the next guy but I don't want any of these solutions you proposed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2019-08-31T02:42:04.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">DOTA gives remaining active players passive stat increases based on the number of AFKs, \n\nNo, Dota 2 only splits up the afk player's passive gold and letting you sell their items. Neither of these are worthwhile. The main thing Dota 2 does is let you leave games people abandon (afk for 5+ minutes), but there is no real attempt to make games winnable in a 4v5. It would prefer you just leave.\n\n>Heroes of the Storm lets the AFK's champions play on the hardest difficulty bot to offer some consolation and contribution.\n\nWhich is often considered to be an active detriment to attempts to win 4v5 because the bots are so bad that they'll accidentally feed at all opportunities. It's a token effort that definitely doesn't make 4v5's actually playable. I'd personally rather the bots just sat in base or behind a wall soaking exp instead of trying to help.","replies":[{"poster":"CH1 LONG QUA","date":"2019-12-01T05:30:08.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Letting people leave after someone abandons is lightyears ahead of LoL.

The fun of LoL goes downhill quickly once you can't buy any more items (meanwhile you have gold you can't use and your teammates haven't finished their builds).","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2019-12-01T13:18:47.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">On a tangentially related note, LoL needs to allow players to trade gold and/or items at all times, also like Dota.]\n\nBarring neutral item drops (the items you can not buy), Dota 2 doesn't allow that. Someone else can hold your item, but they won't benefit from it in any way. Its only purpose is to help transport items. Sharing items was something that was in the original dota mod, and it was removed because it led to players putting all of their items on their carry and 6-slotting them before anyone else had any items. That wasn't considered very fun, so it was removed a very long time ago and has never come back.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
