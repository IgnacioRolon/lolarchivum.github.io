Key frag drops regardless of whether or not you win now, they kinda just drop as long as you're playing the game. Though atm the key frag drop is changed so that it behaves a bit strangely, sometimes it will go at long periods without drops and suddenly give you 3-4 shards in 1 go, or frags would occasionally just appear in the loots without any notification; however typically key frags drop when you log-in and the game will make sure you know you've been a good boy recently by blocking the screen to tell you that.\n\nThat said, as stated, \"getting key frags is not an indication of progress, they just appear because you're not honor rank one.\" Key shard drops is only tied to the Honour system in that its drop rate is connected with it, but otherwise the 2 are separate systems; one does NOT need to get honoured in order to receive keys, they are still dropping at random with a cap just like before.\n\nAlso, getting reported will not drop the Honour level, but getting punished will (low priority queue is an exception to that rule I think, as in it's not counted as a punishment by the Honour system). Key frag drop rate is I think halved in Honour level 1 and crushed into none when at Honour level 0. \n\nHonour will be earned as long as you play, getting honoured only means you'll level faster than just playing. Also if everyone in the same team honours somebody after the game, then everyone receives extra bonus to their Honour progression, it's pretty much done so as a \"honour everybody after a very good match\" (though this is still not stopping people from asking \"where's the option to honour more than 1 person or everybody after the match?\").","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"korg023","date":"2017-07-24T14:00:30.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is wrong with grinding it?

You receive 1 'point' every time you are honored up to a maximum of 30 per week, you receive 2.5 points every week if you haven't been legitimately reported beyond a specific threshold and/or you engage in positive or neutral play, if you receive a certain amount of honors in a given 30 day period you receive 5 bonus points... etc.  There is always a hard cap to the number of points you can earn per week/month so that even if you are honored by all of your teammates every single game many times a day you will not achieve the next honor level any faster than another player per se.  \n\nWhat I showed above is an example, but I am guessing that's actually kind of close to reality, because if there wasn't some type of cap---similar to what there is with chests, then someone would have hit honor level 3 by now... particularly those that stream and receive 3-4 honors per game, times 15 games per day.  \n\n-\n**BOTTOM LINE**:  It's actually a pretty poor design.  Why?  Because if players aren't seeing regular progress they will become less engaged in the system and overtime the incentive for good behavior becomes less appealing, particularly when they see their favorite streamer playing 15 games per day and getting multiple honors yet not progressing.  \n\nObviously those that designed the system are great at math and programming, but never took a social science course in their life and most certainly didn't have a social science specialist, psychologist or sociologist help in the basic architecture of the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Douglas Funnie","date":"2017-07-24T11:55:56.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot specifically said there is no cap on how much honor a player earns per day....","replies":[{"poster":"ntbcool","date":"2017-07-24T14:16:27.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"honors is different from scary door's theoretical honor points.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2017-07-24T00:25:57.768+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are already avoiding giving out honours in part because it feels like doing so is worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"korg023","date":"2017-07-24T14:02:05.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same, i used to be very excited for Honor but now when i dont even see progress it feels just bad and worthless i really dont care anymore if im honored or not.

Here are a few reasons why:\n> \n> 1. We didn&#x27;t want to anchor people on the &quot;grind&quot; to honor levels. By not having progress indicators, we wanted to root the reinforcement for being sportsmanlike on the feedback you get from other players (the honors), not any artificial motivation from being &quot;close to the next level&quot;. \n> 2. Our behind-the-scenes systems which determine honor level ups aren&#x27;t simple. The types of calculations we do to determine if a player is ready to level up take into account their holistic behavior across many games, and don&#x27;t lend themselves well to being surfaced in an &quot;XP bar&quot;-style system. Anything we surface here could also warp behavior around trying to &quot;minmax&quot; the most honor points, which really refocuses it away from the point of the Honor system - play good games and you&#x27;ll make progress.\n> 3. We wanted to have a few discrete levels in Honor, since bloating the number would make each feel less meaningful. However, we wanted players to progress over the course of a season or half-season, which means that progress to the next level would necessarily be fairly slow. We didn&#x27;t think it would be a great experience to reinforce this through some progress indicator.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-07-23T19:16:15.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">For example, if i am Honor Level 2, how do i know when i can ascend to Honor Level 3? where can i see how close i am to fall back into Honor 1?\n\nYou can't see how close you are to progressing as there isn't a perfect calculation for that.
