Fine and well, not the first time, not the last time. I Click send report as per usual and close the automatically opened browser leading to the Support site.\r\nHOWEVER, upon restarting the client, it notifies me that it has detected defect codes within it's data and forced and entire system overhall. i literally had to download every core data of the Client which was a good 6 Gigs big, and i couldn't even say no to it.\r\n\r\nThis has never before happened in any of my games during any instance of my 3+ years of playing. Not even with the pre-reworked pulsefire ezreal. Knowing that i assume the skin has a defect data.\r\n\r\nThank got my team dodged that game, but i am probably eating on some reports now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-20T18:53:24.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry you had to dodge as a result of this, but it sounds like your game files somehow became corrupted.  When this happens, you'll usually see a bugsplat and the patcher will need to rescan your files to check for bad data then fix it.  Since the repair has been done, everything should be okay now.  Just to be safe, though, I recommend doing a custom for assurance!  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
