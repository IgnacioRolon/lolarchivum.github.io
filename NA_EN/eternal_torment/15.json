More and more I see meta adc&#039;s stack 2 or even 3 doran&#039;s blades to win lane because of the stats it gives, same in midlane with doran&#039;s ring and on champs like {{champion:31}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:420}} i sometimes even see half the itemslots full with Doran&#039;s shields.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have any issues with it, but almost everything in lol is unique for the precise prevention of it being stackable, which begs the questions why the starter items are an exception.","replies":[{"poster":"Tesladin","date":"2018-06-11T07:38:49.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's unique about Dorans items - they are stackable while others are not.
