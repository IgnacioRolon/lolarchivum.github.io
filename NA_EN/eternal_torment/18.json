Adblock denies you access to your premium Pornhub membership profile\r\n\r\n8. Redmercy clickbait\r\n\r\n7. Running out of cookies when you are in a terrible mood\r\n\r\n6. People who eat ass. Seriously, whoever does that, your tongue must probably look like the back of Shaq&#039;s neck after the long game.\r\n\r\n5. when you are trying to tie your shoe and noticed on one of the two laces those little plastic tips are missing. holy FUCK does this frustrate me when my shoelaces are asymmetrical.\r\n\r\n4. When your favorite TV show goes on an unannounced break *looking at you, CW shows*\r\n\r\n3. Task manager crashes. Not only is this annoying, but you are majorly fucked.\r\n\r\n2. Any CoD player.\r\n\r\nand finally,\r\n\r\n1. the urge to pee JUST as you finally found the good spot on your bed or couch. Then you have to look for it all over again.","replies":[]}
