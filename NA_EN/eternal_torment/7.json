We get it, you wanted to introduce a legal thick petite with a stuck up egomanic attitude. That in itself is fine.\n\nBut please, at least make the proportions believable. Also look at her torso to hip ratio. I gotta believe that something went wrong with her and she survives through ancient and powerful magic because jesus christ this is such an eyesore. \n\nAnd note, this is the most frontal picture of her that I could find from the clip. Nowhere else does she stand as straight up while facing into the camera, so if this doesn't convince you then IDK what will.\n\nEdit: After some critics both good and bad about the post, I have additions to write:\n\n1. Yes, some champions do get disproportioned so the bird's eye view works out. But these are kept at a bare minimum or are angled in a way where you have to stare like a sicko to notice it, like Darius' arms stretching to 2.5x their length during his ultimate dunk. But, none of them are quite as brutal and visible as Qiyanas. Her trailer has some rift gameplay and even there you can notice it extremely well.\n\n2. The issue has little to do with her attractiveness. Her beauty isn't a problem, it's that it doesn't fit with her thematic at all. For someone who's supposed to be from the jungle, she has quite a modern haircut and quite the civilized set of clothes, for example. Hence why her hair has been a critizised point so far.\n\n3. Have you looked at her torso? From the chest down to the hips, shes a literal triangle. Fuck, I actually used paint and drew a triangle just for this point, and it's a fucking perfect fit.\nhttp://magaimg.net/img/85wl.png","replies":[{"poster":"Shmeeve","date":"2019-06-07T22:06:44.633+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":7,"body":"Here is the thing, the game is bird's eye view, so what looks completely out of proportion when seen on the battlefield below is supposed to look normal from the main player view...

They make the model with the intention of you seeing them from above, not face level. That's why they look like this. Every champion in the game has body issues when looked at from this level because they shape the model to make it look good from the top. If they gave her a completely normal looking body (which no champion in the game has btw), she'd look extremely bad. The best example of this is Ornn or Annie. Annie has extremely EXTREMELY long arms and ornn only looks like he matches his splash art from top down, if you look at him face level, he doesn't because he isn't supposed to be looked at from face level.","replies":[{"poster":"CytheGuy","date":"2019-06-08T04:51:34.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Dalloway","date":"2019-06-08T05:31:40.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CytheGuy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=gW2dIh5i,comment-id=000900000000,timestamp=2019-06-08T04:51:34.384+0000)\n>\n> There is literally never a reason to not follow proper body proportions when you're making a human figure unless it's comic relief or they are deformed canonically.

There are so many champions that have crazy body problems when looked at from this angle. The champion is supposed to be looked down at, not at face level. You can point out a model issue with a lot of champions if you look at them like this. She probably looks super cool when looked at from top down. She is a thiccer girl, the idea is probably that you're not really even supposed to see much of her waist in general when looking down. No one from the riot team makes these models in expectation that you're going to look at them like this and they don't make a seperate model just for the champion teaser.  You're making an issue where there shouldn't be. I honestly feel really bad for riot. They get comments like yours every day about certain champions. If that person did the slightest bit of research they could find rioter's responses to things like this. I believe Ornn had a pretty big issue like this that everyone was complaining about despite it not actually being a problem past the teaser and a rioter replied.
