I am not gonna do that, not in this particular post, that is why i want you to really fully read through everything to understand my opinion and point of view.\r\n\r\nSo, having that out of the way, i want to talk about where league is heading and how i see it.\r\n\r\nLeague has it&#039;s ups and downs and riot is doing a really great job listening to the community and playerbase and do their very best to satisfy These wishes and requests. I admire such cooperative work between playerbase and Developers because that is often not only rare, but misfunctional aswell, as everyone can see with CoD.\r\n\r\nBUT, lately it feels like that has gone out of balance. Riot has been putting so much focus in giving us what we wanted that it is slowly crossing into itself, causing the game to become increasingly unstable. Some cases are tilting towards the technical imbalance, others into a more emotional distress and disturbtion. I Feel like League is lately suffering strongly from the &quot;Good idea, bad execution&quot; Syndrome. The new Honor system, all those champion reworks, new items, improved game stats and design aspects etc. Riot is without a doubt putting a lot of work to make league of legends grow for everyone&#039;s sake, but if i look at Things like how the champion balancing is mostly determined by either Proplay scenery or by a massive shift of power from one lane to another, it feels like riot wants to just bring out more content to satisfy us, disregarding the Quality of said content. Lethality has gone out of control the second time since it&#039;s initial release, and every patch since 7.09 has had between 12-16 champion changes alone. buffs or nerfs/Hotfixes. that excludes new releases, bug fixes, potentially updated skin arts for the OG champions etc.\r\nan average of 14 champion changes. EVERY. SINGLE. PATCH. chew on this for a while.\r\n\r\nThen there is the Problem with how said overflood of content is influencing the game. League of legends has originally been designed as an MOBA of time, strategic advancement, measure and improvement of Skill and demonstrations of the performances, combining it with a massive fun factor, a very colourful unique action-based animation with fluid executions which add to an aesthetic to the high focused battles between 2 teams of 5 Players respectively. League was constructed to be a long game, which you thoroughly Play through, trying to both enjoy the game itself aswell as individual performances.\r\nhalf of what i just listed is in the gutter since this Season came out. Let me explain why.\r\n\r\nKeyword here is **LONG**. League is not made to be a blitzkrieg type of game where a single decision alters the entire Outcome at the start of it. League is not designed to be short. And that is exactly where it is currently shifting. league is becoming a short paced game which is pushing it&#039;s main aspects into high Level competitive gameplay, which, even if unintended, disencourages good performing and fun for any non-competitive Players. Fun may not be killed, but it is dying. League is not fun anymore for a lot of people. I discount myself from that lot, even thought i share a lot of horrible emotional moments due to the game, i still find it disturbingly enjoyable. But such cannot be said for an increasingly big part of the community as a whole. Short paced games which are decided by a single mistake are not how the game becomes healthy. And that greatly affects the mindset and experience of Players.\r\n\r\nShorter paces for the games mean more stress towards good performing, stress means less focus, which means a worse sensation for the Player if he does commit a mistake. Or if he suffers from one caused by a teammate. League becoming short paced is also turning the game&#039;s victory decisionbalance from &quot;their Skill&quot; into &quot;your lack of Skill&quot;. victories are more and more defined not by how good someone is, but by how much worse their enemies are.\r\nneedless to say, such triggers a chain reaction within people&#039;s mindsets to think of themselves as great. As all stereotypes present, stuff like &quot;i deserve challenger&quot; &quot;my teammates are at fault&quot; and other notable toxic attitudes that involve shifting your blame onto others become more and more defined and present with this massive shift of victory-definition. I have had not a single game in this entire Season where the whole party, speak my AND the enemy team was all 10 people having calm, chill thinking with a cool personality. at least one Person would get horribly arrogant over the all chat if they do well, shaming their respective losing laning enemy, or they would flat out accuse someone of cheating if that someone did better than them. It promotes negativity on a terrifying scale by amplifying people&#039;s sense of good and bad ingame performances.\r\n\r\nRiot may never really see this, but if they do, i really would wish for them to become a bit stricter with what they do to league. I can for a certain part understand specific changes, but that reasonable part in new content, balance &quot;improvements&quot; and updates is becoming increasingly vague and rare. i Only can wish that riot will listen just a bit less to the Players and focus more on making their content into a healthier part of the game. All that new stuff is great and fine, but even new toys are useless if they hurt you more than they bring you joy. League of Legends is a very great game with so much potential and content and out of all the games i Play it has some of the most innovative creative range of playstyles that even puts warframe to embarrassing shame. But So much content is not enjoyable if it lacks the necessary Quality and Detail.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s why i hope riot will slow down a bit with all those updates and adds and instead shift their work more on improving the game itself and not just what it has to offer. \r\n\r\nI Wonder what everyone else thinks about all this. Do you agree? Do you disagree? Or do you want another ivern bush nerf?","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-08-07T08:56:50.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"I prefer shorter games to drawn out shitshows that last until someone fucks up.
