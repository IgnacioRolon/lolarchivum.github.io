STUPIDLY large Range, equally stupid hitbox, and it heals herself no matter what, as long as it's used. The latter part in particular is why nobody will ever play senna as a support. It's too much free power. ALL supports have exactly one thing in common: Defensive choices are not global. Senna is quite literally the first support who can sustain both herself AND her laner without any conditioning whatsoever. Soraka for example has her own heal being over time, incredibly small, and can be *accidentally* passed on to someone else through her main healing Ability. Nami has to be in the heat of the battle for the bounce to hit her and by then it's much weaker than the main healing was. Taric has insanely high manacosts earlygame and can't affort to use it more than once every half minute or so earlygame and if he does spam it it becomes much weaker due to the stacking mechanic. Senna is the first support who's heal can cover the entire team that isn't somehow heavily gated behind skillful use. \n\nHer Q heal should either be massively conditioned to fit the support role (Example, only heals her as well if she hits both an ally AND an enemy) or it should be removed entirely. \n\nThat and it shouldn't proc Onhit effects because of Klepto. So many people I have seen play Klepto Senna because it's even more abusable than Ezreal, and I speak in matter of facts if I say that **NOBODY** thought that could be intentionally possible. Well, how it stings to be wrong.\n\nHer Q, as is, is an ability you'd actually expect on a modern Juggernaut. Juggernaut-Abilities on ranged Champions has never, in all the 10 years, ever worked. Every time self-sustain on an ADC became problematic it was immediately nerfed (See BORK Lucian Meta for examples) because of how much it upsets the meta and it's balance.\n\nAfter Lucian, Draven and Vayne last season you'd seriously think Riot learned not to give ADC's too much free sustain. Like, our expectations were low but holy fuck.

There are VERY FEW skills that can actually punish a Nami healing herself.\n\nIf you're trying to be an offensive poker, bait out attacks by harassing a support/ADC with E charged autos on either you or your ally, and adjust accordingly to double bounce THEM. \n\nI really don't think you understand Nami's ranges and capabilities if you think she has to be in the heat. 725 Range means that if you are trying to tie it with an auto attack, all you have to do to hit 3 times is to walk up behind minions, but close enough to auto, W > Auto > Q, and then back off. Her auto attack range is 550, and her move speed on being buffed makes her the king (queen) of early game peel. \n\nAnd yes; I can triple Tap a Senna while she is bubbled. takes me .7 seconds after the bubble to > W > Auto > run out, and she doesn't get off a single auto attack.\n\nShe's not like other 550 rangers whose kits force them to STAY. She has a perma Dash in her passive, which is why as supports, on average, even though she has the lowest starting HP in the game, she STILL has one of the lowest death per game averages, even though this is a damage meta. _**Mobility is a tyrant, and if you don't embrace it, the players will walk all over you.**_\n\nhttps://u.gg/lol/combat/?role=support\nSort by deaths. #4, with only {{champion:26}} {{champion:350}} {{champion:117}} beating her in survivability. Two of those are self explanatory as to why as well. (one is untouchable as long as adc is alive; one actually is a mobile Guardian Angel). I'd surmise the only reason Lulu is up there is because many Lulus Pix onto a minion or other champion and poke remotely, playing the safe game, and not fully utilizing her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"VoidThicc","date":"2019-11-17T21:25:21.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that, and OP *likely* does too.

She doesn't most of the time. Even at high elo, you can still get off 2 hit procs in a poke volley. \n\n\nHe's arguing that Senna's range and heals make supports inconsequential. Again..... not true.\n\nDirect quotes:\n\n \n> Defensive choices are not global.\nFalse. I cited examples.\n> Senna is quite literally the first support who can sustain both herself AND her laner without any conditioning whatsoever.\nAgain...... False. Nami heals without conditions. The only question is how much the enemy and allies cooperate with her. The same could be said for Senna. Will the opponent line up nicely behind a minion line to get Poked by Q? Will your ally get in front of you and completely line up with the opponent, so you heal one, and damage the other? (Seems to me like Nami is the perfect counterargument, because placement plays a HUGE role in both champion's ability to both maximize heals and damage)\n\nSoraka has three DIFFERENT heals, and although all of them have different conditions, only ONE of them has a NEGATIVE condition. Q is self sufficient, has a strong heal, that the OP is writing off as weak. \n\nThe only negative is her W costs HP, but it's a direct heal, with no delay, on a low cooldown. R is a no condition HUGE heal Global.\n\n> Nami has to be in the heat of the battle for the bounce to hit her and by then it's much weaker than the main healing was.\n\nAgain..... WRONG. She can be the primary target. Also, any AP above 200 AP the heals are not weaker; they are greater by magnitudes. As I said, I don't consider 725 range + a brief movement speed steroid to be \"In the heat of battle\" either.\n\n> Senna is the first support who's heal can cover the entire team that isn't somehow heavily gated behind skillful use.\n\nI'd argue that if Senna heals an entire team, she is using her heal skillfully. Also, False. Soraka's ult can nearly full HP a team with relatively no skill at all. Janna's ult can disengage a fight and heal an entire team with relatively low skill.\n\n> That and it shouldn't proc Onhit effects because of Klepto. So many people I have seen play Klepto Senna because it's even more abusable than Ezreal, and I speak in matter of facts if I say that NOBODY thought that could be intentionally possible.

Sona is also THE Squishiest  champ in the entire game without items and this is the first season where she didn't become an outstanding problem. Being squishy doesn't automate death, that's a very lame apologist excuse to say a champion's overpowered state is okay. \n2. Even with a rather thin damaging part, the range in length is absurd. You can stay a good standart ranged AA distance away from the back minions and if she hits the front minions at max range she can still hit you. \n3. Or maybe she's...idk...going for short trades? Goes in Q-AA backs away again. Healed up any damage from the enemy trade and got her chunk of damage done. Kind of precisely the reason this is an issue.\n4. With Soraka I was mistaken that her Q heal over time doesn't get lost when she uses her W, never picked that up. But you still get the point. It's extremely small, over time, and a flat, finite amount. Taric's Ability actually takes considerably longer than I first thought. Half a minute would be just for a lvl 2 Q. At lvl 5 the charge time for all 5 build-ups, without any CDR  or the Passive, becomes a whopping 75 seconds. So if he is ever anyhow pushed away from a creep wave or can't get any melee trades, he does legitimatedly sit there for an entire minute and then some for one big heal. \n5. The only condition is that she uses it. The Onhit procs are a very abuseable bonus, again, pointing at Klepto. Ezreal had pretty much *THE SAME* arguments and look where it got him. \n6. Speaking of 5. no it wouldn't. All it would do is prevent her from abusing Klepto, which again is the key argument here.\n7. Never said the champion is designed like a juggernaut. Feeble strawman argument. I said the ABILITY is designed like one thanks to the self-heal. Short-trade moderate damage high healing low cooldown Ability. That's pretty much a summary of a Darius Q. \n8. Her W Stealth literally makes her untradeable for ANYONE with point and click. There's literally only one assassin who can do jack against her and that's fizz because fizz is a fucknugget to any bot lane champs. Almost everyone plays Senna as the adc instead of the support. Riot says she's a support, not an adc, playerbase says fuck you, she's an adc. \n9. Precisely the issue here. Her self-heal is broken. Every champion who can maintain an above 50% winrate on release has been notoriously known to be broken. Akali and Zoe are your two most recent and prominent examples, one of whom is still a problem after a whole year. \n\nThat last part was just blatant mock that serves no purpose other than demonstrate derailing and strawman-ing. If your arguments are to hold any legitimate value, refrain from being an over-arrogant jerk with these kinda comments. they only beg to backfire.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Firebeard","date":"2019-11-17T17:54:31.286+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Defensive choices are not global.\"\n*laughs in* {{champion:3}}, {{champion:98}}, and {{champion:16}} \nDidn't even read after that line.
