I thought of some ideas to maybe spice up the Items a little.\n---\n#OHMWRECKER:\n\nBuild: \n{{item:3056}} (2800g) (500g combination)\n- {{item:3105}} (1100g) = {{item:1029}} (300g) + {{item:1033}} (450g)\n- {{item:1031}} (800g) = {{item:1029}} (300g) + 500g \n- {{item:1028}} (400g)\n\nStats: \n- 300hp\n- 70 Armor\n- 30 Magic Resistance\n\nEffects:\n- UNIQUE: Passive: Receive 4% less damage from Turrets for each Ally champion nearby. \n- UNIQUE: Active: Cancel target Turret Fire on target Ally and reset turret's Champion Damage modifier for consecutive hits. Afterwards, Turret will focus item wielder instead. Cooldown 100 Seconds.\n\nPlaystyle: The new Function and build makes Ohmwrecker an ideal Item for extremely aggressive plays, specially in botlane, to encourage trading or even all-ins under enemy turrets. The Passive allows the wielder of this Item to receive less turret damage which gives way for better tanking  and the Active further increases that function by resetting the Turret's damage growth from hitting champions multiple times, which makes way for some very rewarding towerdives if they are pulled off in decent succession.\n\n---\nZZ'Rot's Portal:\n\nBuild: \n{{item:3512}} 2900g (900g combination)\n- {{item:3211}} (1200g) = {{item:1028}} (400g) + {{item:1033}} (450g) + 250g\n- {{item:1031}} (800g) = {{item:1029}} (300g) + 500g\n\nStats: \n- 500hp\n- 50 Magic Resistance\n- 50 Armor\n\nEffects:\n- UNIQUE: Active: Place down a Void Portal that lasts for 180 Seconds. Can be replaced after 120 Seconds which removes previous Portal. Can only be placed within a Brush and only within Ally half of the map. \n- Void Portal: Next time you are defeated, you will respawn within 10 Seconds at the Portal. The Portal will then disappear and the Placement cooldown for Portal Placement will be set to 120 seconds regardless of it's previous cooldowns.\n\nPlaystyle: Old ZZ'Rot only offered a slight split push which took the attention of maybe one enemy champion for a couple seconds to get rid of it. This one is meant to up that pressure and allow you to respawn somewhere other than the fountain for decreased respawn times. It is a big trade off since it takes an entire Item slot up for it but the large stats, for an off-tank Item should make up for it and an immediate return to key points every few minutes is still powerful specially during mid-game phase where you have to quickly move between objectives. \n---\n#MIKAEL'S CRUCIBLE\n\nBuild:\n{{item:3222}} (2300g) (725 Combination)\n- {{item:3028}} (800g) = {{item:1004}} (125g) + {{item:1004}} (125g) + {{item:1033}} (450g) + 100g\n- {{item:3801}} (650g) = {{item:1028}} (400g) + {{item:1006}} (150g) + 100g\n- {{item:1004}} (125g) \n\nStats: \n- 200 Health\n- +100% Health Regeneration\n- +100% Mana Regeneration\n- +25 Magic Resistance\n- +5% Movement Speed\n\nEffects:\n- UNIQUE: Passive: All healing given and received is increased by 10%. Does not stack with other Item heal increases for healing applied to other allies. \n- UNIQUE: Active: Cast on an Ally champion to give them the Effect \"Mikael's Mercy\". Cooldown 60 Seconds.\n- Mikael's Mercy: Lasts for 8 Seconds. Cleanse current Disabling effect on allied Champion. The next disabling Effect (Stun, Root, Surpression, Transform, Knockup) Will be Spellblocked and enemy Champion to cast blocked Disabling Effect will be slowed for 20% for 2 seconds. \n\nPlaystyle: Same as the earlier two Items, the new playstyle pretty much goes like their old ones but upgraded and actually worth using repeatedly. This Mikael's doesn't just remove the current CC from an Ally, it also spellshields them from the effects of the next one. The Block however does not deflect the damage, only the CC and it is only a temporary Effect which makes MIkael's still a remarkably difficult Item to use, but this version would actually reward mastering said difficulty.\n---\n\nI have tried my best to give those Items new and more functional builds and stronger effects while preserving their Identity and the Idea what they were used for. Overgeneralizing, this could be seen more as suggested extreme buffs than reworks, if it were not for new Itembuild ideas too.\nThe change in these Items would however see a potential Removal of Raptor Cloak since it would only be used by one Item which is {{item:3306}} this thing.\n\nI hope these changes seem okay and I would appreciate opinions about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-08-16T13:29:06.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> OHMWRECKER:\nStats:\n- **_3000hp_**\n- 70 Armor\n- 30 Magic Resistance\n\nExcuse me?\n\n> - UNIQUE: Active: Cancel target Turret Fire on target Ally and reset turret's Champion Damage modifier for consecutive hits.

Mikael is already pretty strong in high skill/pro games, and this active is effectively old active+8 sec spellshield that can only be removed by hard cc, and will cc you for it. So if there is enemy adc who we need to cc, we have to waste 2 hard cc spells for the 3rd one to actually work.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2019-08-16T17:50:06.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Posui Gart,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=dFA8muea,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-16T13:29:06.229+0000)\n>\n> Stats:\n> - **_3000hp_**\n> - 70 Armor\n> - 30 Magic Resistance\n> \n> Excuse me?\n> \n> Thats even worse than current active\n> \n> So, you die, respawn after 10 sec and die again because enemies will wait you there, correct?\n> \n> Thats how a split push should work.

Like, wow, even the mule in Winnie the Poh has better thoughts.\n\nThat said, I still apprechate the review, even if it was just worst case scenarios without any decent, good or even best cases considered.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"thaBeast","date":"2019-08-27T21:42:34.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3306}} wasn't that item removed?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-16T12:34:28.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with Ohmwrecker is that its passive is too aggressive for a tank item. It needs something entirely new.
