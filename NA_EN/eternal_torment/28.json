Her mana-costs are mediocre but her cooldowns are comparably short so if she tries to use her passive a lot she will run out of mana quickly. \n\nNeeko has none of those drawbacks for a burst-mage with 550 attack range:\n\n- Her skills ignore unit collision entirely, and her Root even profits from it. \n- She can safely back out if she is baited into an even remotely unsafe positioning using her W.\n- Thanks to her Root duration after at least 2 unit hits she can fire an entire 3 AA-serie into you with absolutely zero danger or risk yet with all the reward.\n\nIf I had to do precisely one change about her kit, it&#039;s either remove her 3 hit passive or shorten her AA range to 500 from 550.","replies":[{"poster":"Salvor Hardın","date":"2018-12-11T12:50:11.058+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, the range is a good place to nerf.\nI would also remove some AP scaling in the R as well as more CD's to it.\n130% is way too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2018-12-11T13:01:50.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd say that toning down the AP ratio wouldn't be bad, but it would be the most obvious suggestion.

Her E has a standart Ult manacost at skill-rank 3 which is lvl 5 for most lux players (Some people actually max Q first) \n\nI repeat, I was not comparing the initial skill and it's activation, I was comparing the drawbacks and risks in ratio to the reward.

If you think it is more difficult for a lux with a 200 range advantage on her abilities to proc her passive than it is for a neeko, then idk what to say to you.\n\nIf you try to say that she can hit a minion twice then W and auto you once, well guess what? her passive at lvl 3 hits only 10 dmg more than lux, but can only be procced once every 3rd auto.\nBut if you include her W skill into the mix, then guess what? lux also has a W that at lvl 3 ( champion lvl ) shields 150 dmg. How is neeko safer than lux again?\n\nAll their skills are essentially identical. But the one with shorter range is some how safer?","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2018-12-11T16:04:40.243+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You forget everything else her skills offer. You just dismantled one singular part of the wholesome argument of mine at the neglect of all the others.\n\nSo I will do the effort of repeating myself.\n\nYes Neeko's R requires you to go in, but this \"risk\" is nill and nothing with a shield that's half the size of your health pool, then a stun added right after the burst to make sure you can't retaliate whatsoever once she gets going. Furthermore it's impact in general is much larger and her burst damage spikes higher at all stages of the game. Her base damage at skill rank 1 is just 25 lower than lux's while her AP scaling is almost twice that of lux'.\n\nNeeko's root does cost more mana, but I did say once again that the root in itself isn't the problem, it's what it offers for the rest of her kit. She can cc for 1 whole second longer than Lux, allowing the full 3 damage procs of her Q to hit with fair ease. Which makes her 3 hit passive mostly just a provocative poke, yes, but one that, unlike lux, can be tossed in whenever wherever at whim.\n\nMeanwhile Lux has to stay close to the person she just rooted for her AA to go off which against many matchups will be the ruin of her one escape. \n\nAnd I repeat on that, too. Yes, Neeko's 3 hit can only be procced once every 3 hits but it can be done so FREELY. AT ALL TIMES.\nLux can't use her passive without using her skills at all, necessarily tying her passive to the manacost of the skill she decided to use.\n\nFurthermore Neeko does gain a slight movement speed boost each time she hits that 3rd passive so not only can she use it at all times, at no costs, but gets a fleeting swifty boost incase the enemy decides to fight back for that poke. Lux does get none of those safeties.\n\nLast but not least, yes, Neeko's root range is a bit lower, but it's travel animation is much faster, allowing a more fluid and faster follow-up or escape, since it traveling faster equals it being harder to dodge.\n\nSo for defensive purposes, like rooting your enemy to disengage, it is safer because it offers more in ratio to what it costs.\n\nAgain, this isn't just about risk OR reward, this is about the ratio between risk:reward and in that regard Neeko reigns on every scale as far as I am concerned.","replies":[{"poster":"Still Virgiñ","date":"2018-12-11T16:37:59.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are completely wrong, her shield is not half the size of her health pool, and while diving the enemy she opens herself up to being bursted down before even getting the ult off.\n\nYou just said her 3 hit passive can be tossed in whenever at whim, yet she is in auto atk range of a champion like lux who can proc her passive multiple times while negating alot of the damage from neeko at the same time with her W?\n\nLux can proc her passive at a minimum of 2x if she lands her bind and then walk away. Neeko cannot. It seems like you are trying very hard to find a reason to call her passive W OP when in reality it is harder to proc than most 3 hit passives in the game.\nLux and neeko both have the same auto range, so how is it lux needs to stay in auto range to proc her passive and neeko does not?\n\nLux also has her passive at lvl 1, while neeko has it at lvl 3.\n\nHow is a 3 hit passive proc'd freely at all times? If a neeko walks into range of you to auto, you are in range to trade back into her. Her E is a root, not a stun, you can still deal damage during the root.\n\nNeekos root is not a faster travel time than lux Q, it is only faster when going through minions.\n\nAt no point in any situation will a neeko ever proc her passive more freely or nearly as quickly as a Lux.\n\nFor example lets say we have a neeko vs lux mid lane. Both are lvl 3.\n\nFor neeko to ever root lux, she has to be within range for lux to poke her and just walk away without taking any damage.\nIf neeko manages to root lux, then her 3 hit passive only deals 50 damage, while lux has a 2 hit passive that deals 40 damage.\n\nSo lux, shields some of neeko's damage, while hitting 4x? How exactly did lux give up her safety? Neeko is actually the one who gives up her safety to proc her passive.\n\nYou assume everything goes perfectly for the neeko and the enemy does not trade back into her.\n\nIn lane phase, a lux can poke you outside the range of minions, a neeko cannot and she will take at minimum a few hits from minions for trying to proc her passive.
