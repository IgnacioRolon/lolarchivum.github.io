After a lot of tinkering I found out the problem,  it's cpu(0), I don't know if it's always 100% or not but, whenever I untick affinity for it in task manager all of my problems are gone and my game works fine, unticking cpu(0) fixes problems with everything, but I need to do that every time a new game starts up.  \nMy specs are : Intel Core i7 6700 @ 3.40GHz\n                         Ram: 16.0GB \n                         Motherboard: ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. B150M-K (LGA1151)\n                         GPU: 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 (EVGA)\n                         Hard drive : 1 TB toshiba\n                         PSU: 650w (I forgot the brand, but I tested it on different rigs and no problems)\n\nThe thing is, I replaced every single part but problem still persisted, I didn't change cpu and motherboard myself though, since I didn't have them at home, so I took the pc to the  shop I bought it from and they changed it there, but the problem was still there, reinstalled windows, formatted pc, reinstalled,upgraded,downgraded drivers, the ONLY thing that solved the problem was adding a new PSU, at first problem seemed fixed but after like 4~5 restarts same thing starts to happen, I tried it with 3 perfect PSUs, I even bought a brand new one just for testing because I was at a loss.\n\nIf there's a kind soul that can help me I'd greatly appreciate it, I have never in my life encountered a problem like this, it seems impossible to fix to me at this point ... \nP.S I'd like to add that I used to have 2 TB toshiba HDD when the problem happened all of a sudden, I called someone and he told me that it's an HDD problem, so until I changed it he installed windows 7 instead of 10 and everything worked fine for few days, then the problem started happening again, then I got a new HDD but nothing changed, my friend lent me his HDD to see if it helped and it was still the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-11-16T19:32:57.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you have tried a lot of steps to figure out and resolve the issue.
