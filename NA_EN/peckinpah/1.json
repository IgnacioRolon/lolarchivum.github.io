You need to learn how to farm at an at least 80% proficiency without putting yourself in any danger. Subconsciously.\n\n(2) Understand your support\n\nDifferent supports do different jobs. Different people playing support have different play styles. Finally, different support match ups tend to be the deciding factor for bot lane in the early game, not ADCs. Unless you become a Caitlyn or Draven main, your play style must entirely reflect your support. If you're playing with an aggressive Sona, make sure you time your movements so that you are close to her and the enemy when you think she's going to use her Q. If you're playing with a patient Leona, make sure you use your abilities as little as possible on minions, saving them for the moment Leona starts a fight. Be humble early, as your Support is there to carry you until you farm into a threat.\n\nUnless your Draven. In that case, just be Draven.\n\n(3) Understand your ADC (early game)\n\nSimilar to the last point, different ADCs are designed for different jobs. My personal classification goes Hyper Carry, Burst Carry, and Utility Carry. \n\n- Hyper carries _need_ to farm into the late game, and you generally want to stay as far away as fights as possible. You may fight, but you need to keep in mind that at this point in time, you're not at your full potential power. Lay back, play safe, and let your teammates draw the course of the fight. Always look to out farm and focus on staying in lane as long as possible.\n- Burst carries have a given power spike at certain levels according to which abilities they have and which they level up. This is more specific per burst carry but the general rule is that they have a lot more flexibility in terms of when and where they can fight. Lucian and Graves for example both have tools to get a lot closer to the fight than most hyper carries can afford to so that they can pick their own prime targets. These guys are all about the mid game power spike and using it to shut down other squishy champions.\n- Utility carries lack the raw punching power that Hyper carries have against tanks or Burst carries have against squishies. Instead, they come with powerful CC and utility that is used to support their teammates. Play to these utility carries' strengths. Sivir loves team fights that require getting somebody(s) from point a to point b. Ashe kites and isolates enemies like almost no other. Take advantage of these utilities.\n\n(3b) Understand your ADC (late game)\n\nAlways build like a tank buster. For one, base armor and thus Last Whisper is deceptively more powerful than you expect, meaning even the Last Whisper is a phenomenal item on a Burst ADC that's aiming primarily at squishy champions. For a second, it is literally the ADC's job (well, at least the Hyper Carry and Utility Carry based ADCs) to kill tanks. The rest of your team is going to be phenomenally less capable at tank busting unless you have something like an AP Marksman mid (Cass/Azir) meaning that if you want to win, especially late game, you need to prepare to be the one who slays the hyper tank on the enemy team.\n\nFigure out your win condition. 90% of the time, this is objective control. ADCs are the best equipped class for handling every major objective, so you need to keep your eyes on towers your team can siege and keep in contact with the Jungler over Baron and Dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electric Grandma","date":"2015-09-22T21:00:42.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not an adc main myself, but I did play heavy amounts of Cait and Jinx for a time last season. So here's my general advice: \n\n1) Well, obviously the first thing is to learn to CS well. \n\nTo do that, you really need to 'get' how each champ auto attacks. Some adcs, at least in my opinion, have smoother attack animations which makes a huge difference when I farm. So pretty much, you should go into a custom with Sivir--since you've mentioned her--and just got bot lane and practice csing. There are a bunch of 'how to cs better' videos all over Youtube, so go check those out.\n\n2) When to harass, when to give up cs and other stuff. \n\nYou generally want to harass your enemy opponents when you see them out of position (idk if I'm explaining it correctly) such as if the enemy support goes too deep trying to harass you and is caught in the minion wave. Another good time to harass is when the enemy adc is coming in to last hit your minions. When they're moving up to kill it, harass them down a bit and move back or run into an unwarded bush to get the enemy minion aggro off you. \n\nIf you're playing vs an unfavorable match-up (say you're Vayne and the enemy is a decent Caitlyn) and the enemy adc/supp are bullying the hell out of you. Don't sacrifice half your HP just to get a few last hits in. The gold may not be worth it if you end up dying to the enemies. If anything, stay in range of getting experience and work from there. Since it's most likely that they'll be pushing you up to your turret, learn how to cs under turret. I can't tell you how many waves of cs I've lost just because I was stuck under turret. It can make a world of difference. But the general rule is melee minions need 2 turret shots and then you auto the minion to kill it. For Casters, I find it a little difficult to get these because early game your ad won't exactly make the cut. But generally, caster minions need 1 turret shot and 1 auto attack. Early game, when you have low ad, the support should auto the caster minions once, let the turret hit it, and then let you finish if off. \n\n3) Positioning in team fights\n\nStay in the back. Preferably behind your tanks. Get someone (most likely your support) to peel for you if the enemy has someone who can easily jump you. I've seen a bunch of people scream at adcs to shoot priority targets, but I feel like that's a wrong approach. As an adc, you want to shoot the nearest enemy to you. So if their tank or fighter jump you, don't zone in on the enemy adc and try to kill them first while you yourself are getting bashed. Focus on kiting the enemies on you first, kill them, and then move on. Imo, your job is to survive teamfights/throw out as much damage as you can so that you can grab the major objectives. You can't really do that if you run willy nilly into the enemy team and die.\n\n4) Learn your champ.\n\nThis is a pretty universal tip for any lane/role. If you're playing Sivir know what her passive does, learn the approximate range of her Q so that you can hit it properly, why W procs turret shots if there's an enemy champ under turret while you're taking tower, how to properly time your E, and best scenarios to use your ult. Just like.. things like that lol. Understanding your champ is a big deal. You'll understand when to go aggressive/when your power spike is, or things like how to play a certain match up.\n\n5) Practice and apply.\n\nIt doesn't matter how much advice someone can give you if you never properly apply it. Of course practice CSing, but also learn to cs against real people and in real situations. Not everything's going to be dandy and easy. Some games you'll be against a rough enemy lane that know what to do to make your laning miserable. Sometimes your team won't be able to peel for you in fights. Etc, etc. It's really about experience and application.\n\nSorry if this is a lot lol :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-09-22T21:00:17.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the adc\nAs sivir you mostly just push lane and poke with q. You do a fuck ton of damage . Just never engage a fight,  poke them down first then let your support engage or let them waste their engage (spell shield it ) then counter engage.
