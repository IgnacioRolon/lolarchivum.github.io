You&#039;ve consumed my life and kept me entertained for so long. As a strictly solo player, I&#039;ve really tried to embrace dynamic queue, but all the little negatives about it have added up to where I&#039;m not enjoying my games anymore. Solo queue was my hope for the game, and all the backtracking and delays is so classic Riot that I would not be surprised if it never comes out. \n\nIf it does, you have a six year playing customer coming back with gusto.
