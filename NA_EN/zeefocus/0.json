I recently played a game as vayne where i condemned him, then he just gathered movement speed so condemn was useless, i used fleet of footwork and q to get away, but hten he just slowed me with his skillshot. then proceeded to stun me and pull me. I really cant do anything against that, not even banning because there are other picks that need to be banned like morgana, lulu, zoe, etc. Can yall at least remove the slow from his stun?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-15T03:33:12.238+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this a shitpost?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodJormungandr","date":"2018-02-15T15:47:05.872+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing to skarner as a vayne? what the hell do you think you are?\nOfcourse you'll  cry skarner op rather than saying \"i suck bad and i gotta learn how to right click with adc champs\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2018-02-15T07:10:29.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you are complaining about Skarner? The jungler that is forced to have his spires early on that you can easily see where he is if he takes one back. Skarner that his E is so damn slow a thresh hook is launched faster. Skarner who's E is almost a 100% hit bot of miss. The fact that he is already in melee range of you and hits it doesn't mean it's his fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodJormungandr","date":"2018-02-15T15:59:30.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Skarner is too much\"... really? he is not even played and he is probably the worst jungler in the game so far. \nThe thing is you were playing \"Vayne\" absolute 3 shots tanks killer, you must be extremely underskilled player","replies":[{"poster":"I say Facts","date":"2018-02-15T17:35:18.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol right","replies":[]},{"poster":"zarxus1234","date":"2018-02-15T16:09:59.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vanguard Prince,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LEdehQvg,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-02-15T15:59:30.300+0000)\n>\n> Skarner is too much&quot;... really? he is not even played and he is probably the worst jungler in the game so far. \n> The thing is you were playing &quot;Vayne&quot; absolute 3 shots tanks killer, you must be extremely underskilled player\n\nlol you have no clue. lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ealenor","date":"2019-02-11T13:37:31.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Qss?
