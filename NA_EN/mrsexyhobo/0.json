He does enough damage and CC threat in melee range so you don't really want to close in on him if you aren't sure you can take him head-on, but he also has some tools to deal with people attacking him from range if you use them skillfully (hitting someone in front of you to hit somebody further back with E spikes, the whole game of hitting/dodging Rupture). And yet, his enemies can capitalize on his relative immobility and relative weakness in laning phase to deal with him. The only case in which he becomes overwhelming in lane is when you're so far behind/he's so far ahead that he can just sustain through your damage - but that's somewhat true for every champion in the game.\n\nAnd I can't really see you buffing him somewhere easily - his base stats are mostly above average already, with him leading the field (together with Skarner) in base AD. His abilities have good base damages and high scaling, but accessing that damage faces a fair set of restrictions (aiming or short range, his mana costs). His passive is tuned the way it is to avoid oppressiveness in lane. \n\nOnly thing you could do there is increase his base AS a little, but lower scaling - so he stays mostly the same if not building AS, but making the stat a little bit more rewarding. But that is just a personal pet peeve of mine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chide da jungler","date":"2014-12-10T19:12:51.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Our primary goal with these changes was to give Cho'gaths that fall too far behind (lose all/most of their stacks and can't afford to build them much because they need the CD available) some better options for getting them back, without trivializing stack building.
