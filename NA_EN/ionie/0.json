Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status 0xc0000020. \r\n\r\nJust for the record; I played a game of league, closed the client, then restarted my computer; since then I have been running into this error. I have attempted repairs with the Hextech Repair Tool... and tried a fresh install using it, however this is not helping. I get to the point where I am able to click on 'Launch' - but right after, I am confronted by this error message again. \r\n\r\nHelp please!","replies":[{"poster":"ionie","date":"2017-09-30T10:24:07.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whoops; sorry i did not realise that this was replied on! \n\ni managed to get this solved by repatching the leagueclient ... but how exactly i cannot recall. it's been a while!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T20:52:13.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's try taking a bit more of a manual approach to fixing this dll issue. Refer to the image below for a certain file to delete, and then try running League from the other file mentioned.

I found another thread that said to delete the patches and wait for it to update again.  Which didn't work again. So I went back to try this a 2nd time today and it finally worked. Although now I have to wait for the game to update. Which is a pain and may have been trolled by someone but I was desperate. This is the only game I have played for the past four years and I still love it as much as when I first got it. \n\nHappy this finally worked for me. I didn't want to miss out on the new game mode.","replies":[]}]}]}
