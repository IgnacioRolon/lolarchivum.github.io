A few months ago my girlfriend and I found out we were going to be having a baby! We are super excited. Now I&#039;ve played League off and on for quite a few years now. I don&#039;t know when I started but I know it was before ranked become a big deal. I have almost always played support and Leona has always been my go to. So while discussing possible baby names one night I went out on a limb and threw Leona out there. As luck would have it she liked the name and now we will be welcoming baby Leona into the world in March! To clarify I didn&#039;t name my child Leona solely on the character. I really like the name itself. So thank you Riot for helping me find a good name for my future daughter!","replies":[]}
