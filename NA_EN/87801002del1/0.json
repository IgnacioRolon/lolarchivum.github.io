So I recently had to do some business so I left the champion select portion of the game. Then I noticed I got a penalty and I have to wait 6 minutes. After I waited that time I was able to play a game. If I ever leave the champion select ever again, will the waiting time be longer and longer? If so will it ever reset back to 6 minutes?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-18T01:28:22.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you happen to get a low priority queue like that, they typically do last a specific amount of games. It looks like your account still has about 8 games left as of writing this.","replies":[]}]}
