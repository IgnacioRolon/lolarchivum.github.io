For example - in announcements http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official or in Esports http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports you can click links that take you off of the boards.\n\nOver time it's likely that we will do more of this (enabling people to link to youtube videos, streams, fansite articles, strategy guides, etc) which means there are cases where you WILL have viewed the content but won't have gone to the page that has the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-07-17T22:54:22.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I thought we were going away from Reddit.","replies":[{"poster":"Elan Tedronai","date":"2014-07-18T02:19:31.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What gave you that idea?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-07-17T20:04:18.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the rationale was that the downvote fairies are going to do that whether or not they have to click into the thread first, so why make it harder on the regular folks?\n\nAnd, to be fair, I have actually voted from the Boards Feedback page before - sometimes when I'm mousing over and reading a short post with just the tooltip, sometimes on posts that I've read before but didn't vote on the first time around.\n\nAt the same time, though, I agree that it does feel a little... weird.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MajorPain9","date":"2014-07-17T19:54:41.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because reddit.
