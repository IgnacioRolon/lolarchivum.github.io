All the \"balance\" threads are made by bronze, silver, unranked and possibly a low gold player(which is quite rare but somethimes happenes). Have you ever asked yourself \"why aren't high elo players making balance threads\"? Because they know what is broken and what is balanced. Often I see high elo players getting downvoted for making good points about champions just because they think differently than the mindless hate army.\r\n\r\nTldr the title.","replies":[{"poster":"Alderon WolfBane","date":"2015-02-01T22:03:14.545+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only \"High Elo\" player's i see comment are just one trick pony's when there champ get's (RIGHTFULLY) nerfed.\n\nA good example is Fizz{{champion:105}}  they didn't even bother giving the change a chance they instantly bashed it and cried \n\njust because you are low elo means nothing i have seen countless thread's with great analysis by low elo player's and the one's high elo give's are just one sided trying to protect the freelo champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Altricad","date":"2015-02-01T21:45:12.598+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because High Elo players want to abuse the said OP champions.\n\nWhen Lee Sin nerfs were proposed and ward hopping removed, high elo players and professionals came out of the woodwork and protested to save their elo.\n\nBelieve it or not, most high elo players get there by playing a small \"strong\" ( mind you not broken or OP)  champion pool, and as long as they can keep playing them they really don't care about game balance.\n\nThere are some that legitimate high players that take part, but the occasional stupid threads \"Yasuo/Riven/Jarvan is OOOP\", are low elo players that refuse to acknoledge their weak points.\n\nYes, i said jarvan cuz despite popular belief his ulti is the one with the most counter play when compared to either getting ultied by  {{champion:254}}  or the zero-counterplay insec by {{champion:64}}","replies":[{"poster":"Duobyte","date":"2015-02-01T22:03:20.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are kinda right. A lot elo players are sheep and they only play what they see on lcs. Low elo players do that as well but they just don't have the game knowlege nor the mechanical skill to pull the LCS stuff off. \n\nHowever a good portion of high elo players got there by spamming certain odd-ball champions. You can't deny that fact that there will always be a random Morde , Viktor or an Amumu main out there terrorising Soloq even at higher levels. The only ZERO counterable champ in the game is VI because her ult has no counter outside having a morgana support. Jarvan's ult is similar but most champions have a way to escape it. Lee's performance highly depends on the actual skill of the player behind him. Unless you main lee and the jungle role and have a lot of expirience, you will fail hard with him. Most low elo people feel cheated when he kicks them and gets away same with zed. Hense the \"gut lee sin posts\" even though he is sub par in soloq.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Duobyte","date":"2015-02-01T22:12:33.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that people are downvoting a thread to oblivion dispite the thread itself isn't offensive.

Low elo players however will complain about almost anything if they get destroyed by a champion and consider them OP like Yorick and Darius. \n\nWhile there are very glaring problems (jungle) they get overshadowed by people who yell the most. I've seen too many comments and upvotes to threads that complains than threads that actually criticize in detail. So rather than the community supporting the author of the detailed thread, they support a general, simple complaint.\n\nOh and majority of players are silver and bronze so that says something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharQueen","date":"2015-02-01T21:09:08.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because good players don't want to see change to various champions. If Zed is OP, then that is fine. They can either enjoy his playstyle or counter him because they know what to do.

Zed is dealable unless mega fed but so is every champ. IMO low elos shouldnt even care about zed or lee in the first place. At that level of play these champions are useless. They dont have the tools to hard carry a game (no resets, no insane dps) and take a lot of skill to play correctly(dispite what shitters say about lee taking no skill to play)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gromble","date":"2015-02-01T21:33:13.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"league snobs lolz.

LOL i love your projection also. You hate lower elo players and tell them to stfu and know their place then claim that your the victim of hate and intolerance. lolz.\n\nI'm not the one saying high elo players must stfu. Sure I'll pay more attention to someone above me has to say, but i'm not telling anyone to know their place like you are.  I bet you go on sports message boards and tell all the fans that since they never played in the NFL the should sftu with their dumb opinions also right? Herp to the Derp. or how about telling high school math teachers that since their aren't pushing the cutting edge of mathematics they are morons who don't know anything about what they are talking about?\n\nI'm sure there are bronzies out there who know this game in and out better then higher elo players, they just don't have the physical skill it takes to pull it off. Doesn't mean they should be spat upon like your doing here.","replies":[{"poster":"Duobyte","date":"2015-02-01T22:54:26.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't go to sports forum because Im affraid of them finding out my ip and getting my personal info like where I live.

I understand I am low elo so instead of hopping on here and making a balance post I just try to figure out what I did wrong that game, then spend the next 5 games not making that mistake. Then rinse lather and repeat. The day I make a balance post I am going to know what the hell I am talking about. Also the high elo \"peasant\" bull shit really needs to stop.
