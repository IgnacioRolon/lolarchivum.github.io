I lost that match which was my last loss to lose my series. It now shows I have 45 LP. How did I lose 65LP when normally you would only lose 20-30LP, making you have to win one or two games to get back in, not 4-5. I'm sure I'll get heckled for being \"a bronzie just complaining\", but I feel 65LP is a pretty harsh loss.","replies":[{"poster":"IndianaHardcoreX","date":"2016-09-09T22:31:06.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But my thing is this: How did I lose 35 LP in two series loss's when I've lost two games in a series before and only been taken down to like 80LP? Is it because it was an advancement into a new division? Or I was just expected to do better based on my MMR or whatever and since I didn't live up to it, I lost mad LP?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-29T21:04:59.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can lose LP inside a match, and as far as I know, there's no cap on how much can be lost. The amount of LP gained or lost from a match is calculated with a fairly large formula. Some factors that go into this number are your MMR (matchmaking rating) and the expected result of the match (win or loss). \n\nAll of this is covered in our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ).
