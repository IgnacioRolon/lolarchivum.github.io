I wanted to identify my strengths and weaknesses. so i looked at my champion collection and saw i was the best at engage tanks and carry assassins. But assassins at the top i figured i need to learn a new one who is currently not nerfed to the ground and that works in jungle, which excludes zed, kassidan, leblanc, katarina, akail. i mostly jungle which i have the most experience in so thats why i wont mid.\r\n\r\nThe two champions that i don&#039;t have are Evelynn and Nocturne. Evelynn (going of the summary tab) offers some dmg, tankiness, utility, and mobility, while Noc offers more dmg, No tankiness, and the same amount utility and mobility, while offering cc.\r\n\r\nI need opinions on which champion is better carry ranked games with and the least difficult so i can reach gold and get the gud border and Graves skin.\r\n\r\nBtw if you could drop some advice on playing the champ of your opinion that would be great to!\r\n\r\nThanks for the help, Xfinity","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2017-11-21T04:54:18.175+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely of the opinion that you'll be able to learn Nocturne faster.  He's a bit easier than Evelynn to get a hang of and he seems to match your two strengths: engaging and assassinating people.  \n\nI would look at some fansites for the best builds and follow them until you get a hang of him and can make your own more informed choices. Think both Electrocute and Dark Harvest are pretty good on him.  Pretty important to focus on getting to six fast and then picking your targets for ultimate wisely.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-11-21T18:15:24.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my opinion : Dark harvest is trash atm, and close of troll.

With evelynn your usually going to be catching people who are alone by warding properly, using predator to run to them, or by sneaking up behind them (so when you charm they walk into you) she requires a bit more planning and position where as Nocturn kind of just Pressing a couple key's in the right direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Xurreal","date":"2017-11-21T22:11:58.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1.\n\nAnd to add to that, it is very easy for enemies and teammates alike to screw up the planning phase.\n\nIf i had a LP for every time someone with more mobility than me ran ahead and scared off my target before I could get into position, I'd be Challenger.\n\nAlso, Evelynn is more hated among the player base, so you tend to get flamed for getting screwed over a lot when it happens.
