I use a mouse with my left hand but I lost the tactile sense of touch on my right.  I can also use a multi button mouse with my left hand depending on the location of the buttons.  Most mice aren't very left hand friendly.   I can still rely on muscle memory on my right but using a keyboard is difficult.  Any suggestions on a controller, which I can use with my right hand, or a combination of my left hand mouse or something else?  I'm open to any ideas.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T21:39:01.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to look into this with you!
