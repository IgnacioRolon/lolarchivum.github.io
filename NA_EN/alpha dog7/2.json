Then one day she was locked in during an LCS game and because of this became banned in almost all of my future games being deemed \"broken\" and \"OP\" by the community. After being able to play Kayle in every game because nobody else wanted her for almost a full year she had suddenly become picked or banned in every champ select until eventually being nerfed to the ground. I was just wondering why a champion that nobody wanted to play for over a year because she was \"bad\" suddenly was considered to be the most broken champ in the game although the champion had not changed in any way. \nA champions strength lies not only in the power of their own abilities but also in the style of the meta. Certain champions become very strong in a certain type of meta that is well suited to them and because of this are nerfed when it is not the champions abilities at wrong but really because the meta suits them and so when the meta shifts out of their favor once more they are made very weak as champions because they have worse abilities and don't fit in as well to the new meta. This has caused the downfall of many great champions and more should be done to help them recover after they are no longer in the meta that caused them to be considered \"OP\" i know that many players will have had to search for a new champion to main after this has happened to their favorite champion and it is unfair that people should have to stop playing the champion they once enjoyed the most because of being deemed too strong by the community at a certain time that has long since been moved on from.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ser Garland","date":"2015-05-07T17:18:08.888+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"I remember, I think, this last fall when I was on the boards saying \"Hey guys, Sejuani and hecarim have been getting buffs for the last 5 months.

Most people are going to stick with strategies they know work. Some people go out of their way to research relatively unknown champs/strategies, and have the mechanical skill to make them shine. Those people are the pro players. Then, they show off the maximum potential of an otherwise unknown champion, and other people see what item paths/playstyles support it.\n\nAdditionally, game shifts over time can vastly change the strength of an untouched champion. Even though Kayle was static before that moment, the game was moving around her. Sometimes a new item comes out that works really well with a champion, potentially in unexpected ways. Sometimes a patch buffs up a specific role a lot, and suddenly a new champ is needed that can counter that role.\n\nIt's really hard to truly determine what is \"OP\" as opposed to just \"FotM\". Partially, this is due to the fact that everyone has different ideas of balance. I imagine most of Riot's balance is around the concept of promoting a healthy meta game, not overly dominated by singular strategies/combos. Thus, balance is a relative thing, and if one choice stands out as clearly superior to all other choices in all cases, then it can be considered \"OP\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"TDubH","date":"2015-05-07T17:52:39.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think someone already said it, the strength of a champion is determined by \nA: its optimal setting\nB: how easy it is to hit that setting...\nOften in solo-queue its a bunch of idiots (like me) playing what's good or what they're good at resulting in teams which can essentially do everything or nothing, meanwhile EVERY CHAMPION in league is good for something and bad at something, so all champions are constantly in equilibrium in terms of power, however in LCS;\nyou have a situation where team-comps are focused which means there are champions who have niches which work well against certain things;\nGot a team comp focused on deleting one person in a quick period of time?\n{{champion:10}}.... ok maybe not going to work...\nOh well lets use sustained damage \n{{champion:26}} Well, \nthat didn't work, lets use close range assassins\n{{champion:117}} CRAP! that doesn't work.\nOk lets ban them out, lets use zed\n{{champion:6}} Urgotta be kidding me!\nEach champion has an IDEAL situation, a composition they work well against, however it can only be attained in high class 5v5 scrimmages...

Superior numbers on base stats/abilities. Self-explanatory.\n2. Is extremely strong  in current meta.\n3. Too good item synergy.\n4. Overloaded kit (or kit with little to no counterplay). Similarly to number 1, but in this case it's overabundance of effects on abilities.\n\nHowever, even if champion have any of the above, it doesn't mean it gets acknowledge as OP champion immidiately. Usually someone big have to play the champion - like being played in LCS, or a popular streamer starts playing him. Mind you that it makes sense. LCS players will usually try to pick strongest champions and they are played on very high levels there (so normal players can easily see how strong they really are).\n\nNow, to give you some examples of champions that were OP in each way:\n\n1. Kayle. She definitely had too high numbers - mostly her scalings on Q and E. If I recall correctly it was 100% AP for her Q and 40% AP on her E. She just went unnoticed because she was unpopular at the time (after her previous nerf, where her damage amplification on Q was removed - damn, I remember when she had it and was literally two-shoting people). Right now she might be in need of very minor buffs (for example increasing her heal based on missing health), but I wouldn't say she's bad.\n\n2. Renekton, back in \"renekton-bar\" times. The popular opinion at that time was that he's completely broken, however, without any changes to him he went out of meta (due to some other champion and item changes). Recently he got some changes that were supposed to buff him, if I recall correctly.\n\n3. Warwick and the devourer enchantment (or whichever it was) along with challenging smite. The combination made him completely broken, however both him and the item in question were nerfed already. Now Warwick is way weaker than ever before.\n\n4. Yasuo is one of the best examples here. Double passive, no resource, skill with cd that scales with AS, 0,1s cd dash, immovable wall that blocks all projectiles etc. etc. Riot had to nerf his stats pretty hard, so he became managable and is recently carefully trying to make him come back to the game. However, the moment it happens they will have to nerf him again, just because of how ridiculous his kit is.\n\nAnyway, very rarely (sadly, it happens from time to time) a champions is nerfed to hell to such a point that you have to find a new main. Unless you main only champs that are considerably stronger than the rest of the roster, in which case you will have to find a new main everytime this happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-08T02:24:32.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Is extremely strong in current meta.\n\nThat does not make a champion OP\n\nExample: Viktor.
