No matter i nice i try to be, or how many wards i place i cant win. I main support and sometimes top.\r\ni build sightstone first or second, make sure my wards are out, and try my best to get my adc fed which i normally do. ive even tried different Champs. Ive mained almost every support in the game at one time including non meta ones like ashe. hell ive even done good with things like amumu. I just cant seem to carry. I dont rage but i do try to tell people what they did wrong. Like if top lane trys to 1v5 then i just tell them straight up to wait for us and group.\r\ncan someone tell me what im doing wrong? Tbh i dont know and if some higher elo player would like to do a norms and just tell me thatd be great. If anyone would like to do norms and tell me what im doing wrong. Hell just tips in general would be good.\r\n I mean is there just some broken champ i can learn that can let me carry horrible teams that dont listen that i just dont know about?","replies":[{"poster":"Lights And Magic","date":"2015-02-24T23:26:48.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leblanc support\nBrand support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yash Gautam","date":"2015-02-24T23:16:03.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well don't play support if you want to carry.

Only main support if you can carry your trash ADC. Like me. Oh wait Low ELO ADCs don't know what peeling, positioning, kiting is, this is why I'm done maining support. DONE. LOW ELO ADCS ARE STUPID. DON'T. MAIN. SUPPORT. (If you insist tho it's ok T_T)\n2. Both roles you are playing now aren't VERY impactful. Play jungle/mid to possess greater potential of carrying your team. Well if you don't focus objectives then just play top and sleep while your team is fighting kk.\n3. Play strong early/mid champions. Late game champions are ok but you know, late game champions need time to ramp up their powerspike + items so I don't really recommend it. Sometimes it's better to play late game champs tho, but most of the time, meh. Like Twitch is really weak early/mid game. He does little damage that stage of the game. Meanwhile enemy Corki has Triforce and has reached his power spike, therefore he is stronger than you therefore he wins the teamfight therefore he probably does more than you therefore you need to farm farm farm avoid fights until late game not to mention Twitch's lack of escape and needs peel. Yeah sometimes strong early/mid game champions are better. MORE IMPACTFUL THROUGHOUT THE GAME\n4. DON'T DIE. This single handedly got me out of Bronze. Lane phase? Don't die. Just don't die, cause if you don't die you don't give enemy the gold. DON'T DIE especially when you're ADC/APC.\n\nI saw ur op.gg and you just die too much\nyou just need to NOT DIE\nnot to say im good or anything but if you look at my op.gg my death is usually less than 5. I mean yeah you see that 8 death Rumble? BECAUSE MY TEAM FORCES ME TO TOP. (Side note: when people say \"ADC or support only,\" they mean it. They will make you lose LP because they mean it.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"OhOkYeah","date":"2015-02-24T23:24:23.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play karma. Pretend to be support.
