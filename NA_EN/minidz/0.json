Yesterday I played a game and upon conclusion I received a permanent ban. I don&#039;t believe what I said constituted as toxic but maybe you guys can help understand if I was justly banned. The worst thing from the logs I can see is when I mentioned that my botlane bitched about the jungler ganking my lane more often but I don&#039;t think that it was hurtful. The only zero tolerance word I believe I used was N-word and people in my community use that as a term of endearment. We've taken away the power of a word used to oppress us and took away its power. If anyone is curious <removed by moderation>. Anyway, I truly believe I wasn't toxic in these two games because since my last ban, I've been watching what I say.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nMinidz: brrrrrrrrrrrrrt\nMinidz: thats not funny\nMinidz: i have a sgriimp\nMinidz: k thought you wouldve come wiht nme\nMinidz: but okay\nMinidz: my bad had yall muted\nMinidz: llets turn up blitz\nMinidz: u wanna push\nMinidz: aight\nMinidz: i was waiting for ganks\nMinidz: relax\nMinidz: youre annoying\nMinidz: ?\nMinidz: have you ever played blitz before\nMinidz: them hooks is off fam\nMinidz: team is toxic\nMinidz: you kids are just bad and toxic\nMinidz: sheesh yall annoying gonna ahve to mute and carry\nMinidz: every lane lost but that&#039;s jhin&#039;s fault somehow\nMinidz: not the feeding jung\nMinidz: %%%%% i hold onto the shot in case tf engaged\nMinidz: stupid\nMinidz: like how he holds his yellow card\nMinidz: its called presence\nMinidz: learn about it\nMinidz: we need to group\nMinidz: yall stay split\nMinidz: no\nMinidz: i literally can&#039;t kill her if im zoned\nMinidz: you guys dive carries and do not peel\nMinidz: i have 0 protection so imma kite everyone\nMinidz: you weren&#039;t?\nMinidz: not even kda\nMinidz: its in terms of making smart plays\nMinidz: yall die too much&#039;\nMinidz: pick winning ifghts\nMinidz: you follow every q yopu hit lee\nMinidz: dude\nMinidz: go tank\nMinidz: you&#039;re super behind and building damage\nMinidz: teamwork makes the dream work\nMinidz: why is he so tanky\nMinidz: that boork hp drain\nMinidz: You right\nMinidz: Just know yall are getting reported\nMinidz: was that my fault too?\nMinidz: see that&#039;s what i mean\nMinidz: group\nMinidz: this is dumb\nMinidz: we&#039;re gonna throw\nMinidz: wait for a pick\nMinidz: Pretty sure this game is lee&#039;s fault just sayin\nMinidz: he feed all their carries\nPost-Game\nMinidz: Toxic af\nMinidz: Reported\nMinidz: I did the same damage as everyone else\nMinidz: But this game was my fault\nMinidz: lmaaao\nMinidz: You literally fed\nMinidz: and were flaming\nMinidz: enjoiy your report\nGame 2\nIn-Game\nMinidz: bot\nMinidz: chill\nMinidz: 6 times?\nMinidz: havent fed 6 kills though\nMinidz: why did you keep[ pushing?\nMinidz: Lmaoo im not crying\nMinidz: You are\nMinidz: bitching about ganks\nMinidz: report me for?\nMinidz: go ahead havent said anything wrong i just said play safe\nMinidz: you getting on sensitive and saying im bad\nMinidz: cuz i got ganks\nMinidz: because I didnt push and was thoughtful enough tio ward\nMinidz: ?\nMinidz: vayne\nMinidz: do\nMinidz: something\nMinidz: please\nMinidz: Lmaaaao\nMinidz: Now i understand\nMinidz: uh\nMinidz: botlane says iim bad it must be true :(\nMinidz: no he froze\nMinidz: im in discord with him\nMinidz: relax\nMinidz: botlane is toxic that&#039;s all it is\nMinidz: you def said im bad\nMinidz: lmaoo\nMinidz: no\nMinidz: you literally said i got ganked 4 times and im bad\nMinidz: ff\nMinidz: LMAAAO\nMinidz: LMAAO\nMinidz: brand is easy?\nMinidz: they type too much\nMinidz: ggwp\nMinidz: end\nMinidz: team wont ff halp\nMinidz: no you win because you didnt tilt 15 minutes in\nMinidz: literally brand means a squishy boitlane\nMinidz: you abuse pre 6\nMinidz: where he is weak\nMinidz: but brand is a better champ\nMinidz: game is over\nMinidz: and we have free will\nMinidz: you right\nPost-Game\nMinidz: Botlane\nMinidz: WHere toxicity and feeding meets\nMinidz: Bruh\nMinidz: The damage\nMinidz: I wouldnt either bro\nMinidz: You were super fed\nMinidz: I dont gank fed lanes\nMinidz: ward\nMinidz: miss cs?\nMinidz: Well\nMinidz: Enjoy ya chat ban","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-11-20T13:36:30.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can share your chat logs, but no other circumstances will allow for slurs, such as what your posted video contained.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).","replies":[{"poster":"Minidz","date":"2018-11-20T20:25:29.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be honest, I appreciate the thought but I'll just be moving on from LoL.

So if some old white guy calls a black guy the n word angrily, you feel nothing cuz the word has lost all power? Stop with that bullshit. It only loses power when its convenient, and regains its power when someone needs to be seen as a victim, so the \"power\" that has been \"taken away\" is suddenly invoked when someone can gain something from it. Its just as powerful as it always has been, hence, youre banned.

Ive heard contradicting opinions from other black people. So i simply say again; you dont get to decide just because youre black. \n\nIt seems its usually the older black people who are still against using the word. Imo, its mostly the youth or those in the rap culture that use the word. I respect elders more than the youth, as they have more life experience to base their views on. Whereas, you probably heard it in rap music and thought it sounded cool. \n\nIve heard that too. \"Why do you use the n word?\" \"Cuz it sounds cool!\" Lol ive literally heard that as a reason to use it. Nothing to do with \"taking its power away\". They just wanna sound gangster like their favorite rappers.\n\nI grew up saying the f word (gay slur) to my friends all the time, and they would say the same. Never meant it in a homophobic way. If I said it on here, regardless of my sexuality, it would be treated as hatespeech. Kind of the same thing. We cant go case by case and decide the implication in a game with such a large playerbase. Be careful with your use of hateful words, because you dont get to decide how other people will take it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-21T23:34:38.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw \"youre annoying\" near the top of the chat, and I rolled my eyes.
