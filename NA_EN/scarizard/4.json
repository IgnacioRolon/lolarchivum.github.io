One particular area of focus is the unopposed laneswap meta of the previous patches.\n\nLaneswapping, while difficult to do successfully, is starting to feel pretty formulaic with few strategic tradeoffs. As it&rsquo;s become more prevalent and teams do it more efficiently, it&rsquo;s led to passive turret trading and less direct early conflict. When laneswapping becomes a default opener, it creates a non-interactive early game with. We&rsquo;ll be making some changes in the upcoming patch to address this.\n\nAt a high level: we&rsquo;re adding factors that heighten the risk of laneswaps. Our goal is not to eliminate laneswapping but to make it a strategic choice with actual tradeoffs.  \n\nFor reference, here are the changes:\n\nFirst, incentivize attacking and defending turrets. The first turret taken now grants a &lsquo;First Blood&rsquo; reward, but turrets are now better at defending their allied champions.\n\n* New: &quot;Turret First Blood&quot; gold: +275 local, +25 global (400 total gold across the team)\n* New:  Turret AI has been updated, and are better at defending allied champions (coming in 6.16)\n\nSecond, target a lane that&rsquo;s ideal for fast push strategies. Bot lane&rsquo;s outer turret defenses are no longer identical to the other lanes, and cannon minion spawns now rotate between lanes.\n\n Fortification (temporary damage reduction buff on turrets) changed\n\n* Duration: 7 minutes -&gt; 5 minutes\n* Damage reduction: 35% -&gt; 50%\n* Fortification removed from bot lane turrets (we&rsquo;re investigating a more nuanced approach to this)\n* Outer turret HP: 3300 -&gt; 3500\n\nCannon minions now spawn differently\n\n* Each team gets one cannon minion per wave, rotating lanes.\n* Specifically, Bot gets a cannon minion in lane at wave 3, Mid at wave 4, and Top at wave 5. This then repeats.\n* Post-20 minutes, Mid has a cannon in wave 40 then both Bot and Top get one in wave 41. This then repeats.\n* Post-35 minutes, all lanes have cannons in each wave.\n\nWe know the timing&rsquo;s not great and ideally this would have landed sooner to give teams time before playoffs to adjust. With that said, we think it&rsquo;s important for the state of the game and something worth implementing now versus waiting until the offseason. We also want teams to qualify for Worlds in the same general meta that they&rsquo;ll be playing in this October, meaning now&rsquo;s our only chance to make these changes. While we&rsquo;re be iterating over the patches to come, these are the last **major **changes coming to the game before Worlds.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-07-20T19:26:10.897+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoa, this is interesting.

You get a turret, enemy team gets a turret, no risk, plenty of reward.\n\nNow, however, the **first** turret taken in a game gives extra gold. So, swapping lanes and trading turrets is no longer an even strategy.

So both teams will want to put at least two members bot lane. If a team just lane swaps and goes top, they lose their turret faster AND the enemy team gets more gold.\n\nBy heavily favoring taking bot lane turrets faster while simultaneously making them easier to kill, you force players to actually defend the turret or risk falling too far behind in the early game.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK HALO V10","date":"2016-07-20T21:47:39.971+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Yetii Rider,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=B2y4p4vE,comment-id=00040003,timestamp=2016-07-20T19:31:50.049+0000)\n>\n> Well, take this into account:\n> \n> Currently, both teams just want map pressure and gold, so they send all of their players into top lane and the other team sends them all into bottom lane.

They're not worth fighting over compared to safe gold and map control.** Riot is trying to cover this issue by adding MORE early objectives (specifically, the bot lane turrets) into the game, but this is just clumsy design that doesn't address the core problem. Riot reinvented the laning meta with their objective changes, but when players adapted, they disliked the result and are now **forcing the old meta** through contrived means. I'm disappointed.\n\nIn classic LoL, the point of sending two players bot lane was so your team could contest Dragon and get early team gold. The moment Dragon became an \"arbitrary buff\" creature that could be ignored, lane swapping became a viable strategy. Now, with Elemental Dragons, the once-formulaic arbitrary buffs are now RNG based and less consistent, making lane swapping even more lucrative. Ironically, while Riot desperately tries to remove \"hidden power\" from champion kits (Kayle, Taric, etc.), they've made every Elemental Dragon effect some microscopic garbage that doesn't actually mean anything until it's compounded by an Elder Dragon buff, _which players can't get until 35 min in._ In other words, **there is rarely any reward for an early Dragon kill, nor any penalty for giving up an early Dragon.** Killing Dragon does not give me a buff that IMMEDIATELY helps my team make a powerful follow up play (like Baron), nor does it give my team gold that also would let us make a follow up play (via team fighting). With no incentive to fight, safe, consistent play generally wins out in most shotcalling scenarios, and thus you have the LCS lane swaps you see today. \n\nIf Riot REALLY wants to promote early game conflict, they need to give players a Dragon worth fighting over early on. Giving early Dragons team gold, a _noticeable_ team buff, or some combination of the two would work, but there are surely other ways to accomplish this. In any case, making bot lane turret \"the new 'old' Dragon\" and breaking map symmetry is an awkward design concept that introduces way too many arbitrary \"answers\" for a relatively simple problem. \n\n**TL;DR: Make early Dragons worth fighting over and lane swaps will disappear.

Make towers acknowledge calls for help if the ally being hit's outside their range, but the enemy hitting them is under the tower. At present it's unintuitive and really punishing that if you're zoned really far back from your tower enemy champions can stand under it and hit you without risk. \n\n2. Give towers some concept of champion aggression memory. Basically towers won't go back to shooting minions until there aren't any enemy champions in their range who've recently damaged one of their team's champions. Main impact of that is expected to be on champions that dive at low levels using untargetablity effects (Elise, Fizz etc). The ability to swap agro onto another champion's still there and still powerful, trying to defend a tower in those circumstances shouldn't be as lopsided though (risk just isn't there for the attacker at present). As with lane swaps we don't want to remove early tower diving, we don't think the risk being taken/price being paid's high enough though, leading to a situation where you just don't bother trying to defend at all (tower still goes down, you just go down with it).
