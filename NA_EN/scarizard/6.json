You)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"UPDATE: COLLECTION IS NOW CLOSED! All our nerf-bats are at the ready beating up your questions - answers on the way!\n\nHey y&#039;all - this year, we&#039;re focused on building more stable communications between ~DESIGN TEAMS~ (that&#039;s us) and all you beautiful players out there. This means more iteration and experiments to see what works and what doesn&#039;t, as well as more dedicated feedback sessions to see what you&#039;re interested in as we move along. Today we&#039;re unveiling one such experiment, _creatively _ titled the **Live Gameplay Q+A. Let&#039;s get down to bronze tacks**.\n\n**So what is this thing?**\nGlad you asked! Simply put, players submit questions to our official ask.fm [ask.fm/asklivegameplay](http://ask.fm/asklivegameplay), after which we gather the Live team, fish a couple of responses out of the ol&#039; mailbag and put together a blog-style response to be posted here for your consumption every few weeks.\n\n**What kind of questions are we talkin&#039; about here?**\nAs our name suggests, we&#039;re only really able to shed light on topics related to Live Gameplay - luckily, that comes with the broad definition of almost everything in the game. Systems, items, and champion balance? You got it! Skins, servers, and player support tickets? not so much.\n\n**Can i just ask questions at any time? **\nDue of the large amount of questions to keep track of, we&#039;re focusing on set collection periods where we&#039;ll actively monitor your submissions. We&#039;ll post in advance when these periods begin and end, as well as keep track on the official page itself.\n\n**The first collection period runs from May 4th to May 10th - hey, that&#039;s right now!**\n\nHead on over to the site [[ask.fm/asklivegameplay](http://ask.fm/asklivegameplay)] to begin submitting your questions on all things Live Gameplay right now and tell your friends! \n\n(Unless you don&#039;t have friends. Make some friends and then tell them!)\n\n(unless that doesn&#039;t work either. i&#039;ll be your friend.)\n\n-S","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2015-05-04T19:47:12.813+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you talked to the Boards team about possibly implementing this kind of service if it turns out well?

The one challenge we've had with communications for some time now has been twofold:\n\n1.) Getting internal teams all synched up with what we want to do, what we want to talk about, our values, etc.\n2.) Finding scalable platforms to communicate with players without burning out both designers and players.\n\nOver the past year we've made a lot of progress on 1 (and have a lot more to go), but 2 has been a huge challenge because we have so many different regions that speak different languages, use completely different social hubs, etc. Our initial thought was to pilot super-mega-holistic solutions that solved everything, but we're quickly realizing that won't work. Instead, we're trying to pilot smaller, agile concepts (like Scarizard's idea to do a Live Gameplay Q+A), see what works and what doesn't work, get feedback, and then continuously iterate as we go. If you like things like this or get inspired to ask for something else, let us know and we'll throw it into our idea board.\n\nLong term we should be able to identify what works here and in other regions and then we can let everyone do their own thing while tying it all together under new programs.\n\nTL;DR though if this is super successful, why not pilot it in-house and get resources? But if it doesn't, we'd rather not put all of our eggs in one basket because that makes us pretty slow when it comes to actually trying things.

Almost always about the same or similar thing. Without those, hopefully that'll let more inter-community discussions pop up.\n\nIf successful, could this possibly turn into a regularly scheduled thing? i.e. monthly? It'd give the community something to look forward to and if kept regularly they can hold onto the best questions they have.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-05-05T01:15:45.507+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our hope is to make it a regularly scheduled thing that mitigates exactly what you said.

But over time, Riot has slowed down the flow of his kit, including a stealth-nerf in the \"buff\" that was the increase in his time in his ult&#039;s untargetability, which, in reality, just made him even slower. Let&#039;s list off everything that they slowed down about Zed, not including the already mediocre speed of his Q (which was meant to be that way, to help it be dodgable)\n\n_ **E&#039;s cooldown.** Went from 3 to 4, nearly identical to his Shuriken&#039;s cooldown. Your shurikens are supposed to be something you measure; something you need to be sure to hit before you cast it, due to its slow speed and thin hitbox. So, why does his E, a low-damage melee-range ability, have to have such a lengthy cooldown, on a champion that is built around Energy? Think about it. The intent behind E&#039;s design was to be spammed if you have the energy, and if you&#039;re in range. How much you can spam it is dependent upon your ability to land a double Q, or a double E, to gain your energy back. So, what sense does it make to make it a 4 second cooldown? I guess it&#039;s supposed to try to reduce his split-pushing power, which was extremely strong back in the day. In that case, why not reduce his attack speed instead, and keep the flow and speed and integrity of his kit intact? Oh wait, that is what they did...yet E remains in a nerfed, extremely slow state. Keep this in mind, because you will soon see that Riot has a habit of nerfing things the wrong way with this champion, then nerfing the RIGHT way to get what they were originally after, without undoing the previous wrong nerf. You will see this again when I begin talking about his ult.\n\n_ **W&#039;s projectile speed.** They said that they wanted Zed to think about where he places his shadows, instead of just throwing them willy nilly while making plays. However, all they *really* did was make it nearly impossible to use W to dodge skillshots, which was about 90% of what made the skill so fun to watch and use. I remember the first day I tried playing Zed after the reduction to his W&#039;s speed. I was against a Brand. I could remember always dodging his Pillar of Flame, because he was misplaying and only used it on me whenever I had my shadow up. His bad plays, my good plays. *Not anymore.* Now, I couldn&#039;t dodge his pillar with W unless I happened to have it out somewhere already, which is extremely unreliable, on a champion that isn&#039;t meant to have unreliability except in his Q. I got hit with it *every time* despite the fact that this Brand kept using his Pillar on a target that had his dodgability and mobility open. Except this time...the target didn&#039;t have it open. He didn&#039;t have that ability anymore. Brand was just doing the first thing he thought, with no heed to my ability to dodge or not. His misplaying, my....***inability to make a good play.*** Riot...you know...for people that like to make articles about \"rewarding good play\" you seem pretty hypocritical in your balance changes sometimes. Additionally, this serves to further slow down Zed&#039;s kit, reducing his integrity as a fast, speedy, *reactive* ninja.\n\n_ **Ult.** Remember when I was talking about E, when I said Riot likes to nerf things the wrong way, then do it the right way, without undoing the wrong nerfs? Here we are again. Not only does the untargetability increase slow his kit and flow down even further, Zed no longer has easy ways to regain his energy after he ults, since the shadow spawns where he ults rather than behind the target. Since his E&#039;s spam is so dependent on his energy upon engaging, and his ability to regain it...why does the cooldown remain in a nerfed state, despite the fact that he no longer has easy ways to get his energy back? Think about it, seriously. It&#039;s to the point where using W to try to get your energy back ends up being a Noob Trap because the energy spent in casting W can give you a net loss in energy regain because of where they moved R&#039;s shadow. Yet, despite this, Riot doesn&#039;t bother to give Zed more depth in choice, because they are under the belief that buffing a cooldown would buff the character overall. No. Zed is such an intricately made champion. With characters like him, sometimes decreasing a cooldown or increasing some numbers will offer more *choice* or more *intricacy* rather than simply making the character more *strong* and that is what Riot fears, preventing them from making changes to this champion that need to happen.\n\n_**Ult and W** When The R-back works it&#039;s extremely annoying for the enemy team and involves no skill aside from just pressing R. Reworking his ult back to the way it used to be will increase his skill cap and risk and reward altogether making Zed a more balanced champion and making him a lot less annoying (Whee I pressed R and escaped WHEE I&#039;M FAKER WHEEEEEEEEE!!!) I miss when escaping with Zed *actually look skill.* Can we please make it that way again by reworking his ult back to the way it used to be? 0.35 second untargetability, Zed reaches the target within that time, Zed appears in front of the target with the shadow appearing behind them. If this change were to occur, the W shadow&#039;s speed would ***HAVE*** to increase, since Zed can&#039;t dodge a skillshot immediately after he ults (since his ult shadow is behind the enemy instead of back where he ulted) so he would need that travel time gone for him to be able to do what he needs to do if he&#039;s played by someone who knows what they&#039;re doing.\n\nAs a final note, I'm not saying Zed is \"underpowered\" but he just doesn't feel right to play as anymore. That hasn't stopped me from playing him of course; I love him dearly. I just feel like he can *afford* having these bits of extra power I mentioned without being pushed overboard. His ult suggestion is more of a nerf than a buff however, and it would really require his W speed to increase in order for him to have a chance if it goes through.","replies":[{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-05-09T03:02:30.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as i am aware, there is no cast time on his w, only the travel time.

He should be able to send out his w immediately after exiting his ult and then do his full rotation and jump to his w as he finishes his rotation.\n\nThe problem with his e being spam-able as long as he has energy is that it would give him back the insane wave clear that reducing his attack speed was supposed to remove. \n\nAs far as energy use along with his ult, I personally think he should have just enough energy for a single rotation of spells + 1 extra. Given how fast it regenerates on its own, you should have to at the beginning if you are going in for a trade or an all in, you shouldn't be able to change your mind after trading and then still get a full rotation after your ult.

Given how fast it regenerates on its own, you should have to at the beginning if you are going in for a trade or an all in, you shouldn't be able to change your mind after trading and then still get a full rotation after your ult.

Although reducing the travel time on his W would have to be mandatory if he got his ult reverted back to the way it used to be. He needs to at least have the *option* of using an immediate-dodge aside from Flash when he ults. The speed can't stay slow and unreliable when his only other shadow is immediately next to the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-05-09T15:32:43.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe, I see that time he has to wait as something he needs to assess before using his ult, will I have enough time to do what I need to and still get out.\n\nBut I see it that way because I am against multiple instantaneous movement, built into a kit, flash doesn't count. Currently I don't have as much of a problem with zed because of the small delay. Leblanc is the biggest offender.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2015-05-08T22:04:19.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there going to be something like this for other departments?

I assure you players absolutely love interactions and addition of them would benefit everyone. This makes sense to me considering the amount of attention which was given to the Lore of the game and how people are really interested in seeing how the champions interact.\nKnowing this doesn't bring in any funds I can imagine its not a high priority, but I was just wondering if we can expect to see more of these little interactions in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InflictedChaoS","date":"2015-05-06T17:26:20.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the mastery system, can we expect to see any more rewards in the near future?
