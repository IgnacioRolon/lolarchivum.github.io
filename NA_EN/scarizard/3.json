Even then, a lot of adaptation had to happen, and we realized then we didn’t do a great job of communicating what had actually gone into the decision. Recently we've seen a few players asking about the camera angle choices (specifically keeping the same zoom level / field of view) we made for the updated Summoner's Rift, so I wanted to give some extra context on the forums.\n\nWe didn’t arrive at our camera angle choice easily: months of research, lab experiments, and user experience studies went into this. If you’ve read our gameplay dev blog on the updated Rift (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/dev-blog-srs-gameplay-updates), you’ll also know what our results were (we kept the zoom level, decreased the field of view, and pulled the camera further back from the ground plane), so let's talk about what we didn’t change: the camera zoom.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the issue:\n\nFirst, mastery’s a key pillar of League of Legends design, and a lot of the core skills of League – positioning, map awareness, skill shots, combat movement – are balanced around our current camera zoom. Creating discrepancies through mods or pulling back the camera zoom disrupts a lot of fundamental skills that all players value. League is an ever-evolving game, but your basic combat instincts – how much time you have to react to an enemy gank, how you move in a team fight, your level of map awareness, etc – are things we definitely want to maintain.\n\nSecond, echoing the above through a game health lens: League is balanced precisely around our current level of camera zoom, so we need to consider any implications a change like this would have. Like I mentioned before, we pulled back the camera on Howling Abyss to weaken long-range skill shot champions (many of which are still very strong on the map for obvious reasons), but those same champions do have meaningful weaknesses on a map like Summoner’s Rift. Lux can be super annoying on a 5v5 ARAM, but put her on SR where a Vi can sneak around to punch her in the face, and you get my point.\n\nThird (and finally), there were questions about offering varying levels of zoom in the options menu, but we’ve seen that almost all players (specifically the competitive ones) default to showing the maximum amount of real estate as possible. The competitive advantages are just too much to ignore, so while it might be considered a ‘choice’ for some, max level zoom would be an assumed for anyone who wants to be competitive.\n\n This feeds into our larger philosophy on third-party mods: if they’re perceived to give any form of competitive advantage, then they become the default choice for pros, and that just creates this weird divide between those ‘in the know’ and outsiders. Specifically relating it to camera zoom, this obviously falls into the realms of competitive differences, and it’s why we deliberately do not allow any modifications of FoV or zoom.\n\nTLDR, the camera angle, the field of view, and the level of zoom that we’ve chosen to go with on the updated Summoner’s Rift are ones we’ve considered very carefully. Not only do we need to balance the proper level of information players are receiving at all times on their screen, but we need to ensure the game remains exciting and that even the most map-savvy pro can be surprised by a sneaky play. Hope this gives a little more context behind our decision!","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-11-11T01:30:24.626+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The competitive advantages are just too much to ignore, so while it might be considered a ‘choice’ for some, max level zoom would be an assumed for anyone who wants to be competitive.\n\nOne thing I've always wondered about: extra-wide monitors.\n\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fscg18ZmxxE/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nWhile League limits maximum zoom, it seems that it will always fill the monitor. Normally, this just means that people with widescreen monitors have a modestly larger field of view than people with more square monitors. However, one can (apparently) exploit this to a much more dramatic degree by having an exceptionally wide monitor, or by using a system like Eyefinity to create an ultra-wide \"virtual monitor\" that spans several monitor units:\n\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/xayrLrdrYDA/maxresdefault.jpg\n\n\nWhat's Riot's position on this sort of thing?

It's borderline cognitive overload for most to focus on the actions of a single monitor, much less trying to track three while playing.\n\nSpecifically zoom modifications or higher levels of zoom end up presenting more information in a way the brain can digest in moment-to-moment combat advantages. Multiple monitors spread that out a little... well, *very* far.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-11-11T03:26:42.672+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Without getting into official stances (because then I'd have to track a lot of things down),\n\nQuite understandable. I'm definitely not asking for an official policy ruling, but I do think this merits discussion.\n\n> It's borderline cognitive overload for most to focus on the actions of a single monitor, much less trying to track three while playing.\n\nExtra-wide monitors (or sets of normal monitors) give extra horizontal vision. Zoomhacks give extra horizontal and vertical vision. I'm just a simple country cupcake, but it seems to me that if extra-wide monitors cause \"cognitive overload\" then zoomhacks would cause *more* cognitive overload. I guess I could imagine that having lots of extra horizontal vision, but not as much vertical vision, might be confusing. But my impression was that LoL was designed so that the view is *just a little* too cramped, just narrow enough that you can't see all the crucial areas of a lane at the same time. (I believe Zileas referred to it as a \"slightly paranoid\" level of zoom.) If so, then just a bit of extra width could make a huge difference, e.g. by allowing you to see all the entrances to your lane when you're pushed forward, without having to pause to mouse around.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tceaLRNGpRY#t=481\n\nBeing able to pick up those crucial extra bits of vision with a glance, rather than having to take the cursor away from the action (and lose vision on your Champion) to scroll that way, sounds like a pretty massive advantage. I don't think it would be unreasonable to set some sort of limit on how wide (or tall) of a screen League will display, regardless of hardware.","replies":[{"poster":"Wags","date":"2014-11-11T13:46:47.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of the shape of your eye (oval) and not square it is designed to give more horizontal vision than vertical.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paptimus","date":"2014-11-11T06:58:52.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Increasing the game's resolution also has the secondary effect of generating more viewable area, as I recall.  Players with superior graphics cards and higher resolution monitors are able to take advantage of both of these factors to improve their access to information.\n\nUsing more advanced hardware to improve performance is pretty bread and butter for online games:  players with the fastest internet, better CPUs and graphics processing, with better network infrastructure, more RAM, etc will have a technological edge.  It is interesting to note that geographical proximity to the server also makes a difference in latency.  Living in Michigan and despite having the best internet available in my area (cable; 60 mbps), my signals have an inherent 18 ms latency due to geography *each way*, assuming there isn't any from any other source *and* assuming the wires take the most direct route possible.  Throw in packet management, numerous intervening server handshakes and other factors and it all adds up 100 ms latency for me.  Typically my latency is ~95 +/- 10 ms total and this is completely beyond my control.  I don't expect Riot to do anything to help me address this difficulty.\n\ntl; dr  players with better hardware and those living in the southwest have a technological advantage over less affluent players and those in the East, Alaska and Hawaii.

The previous particle grossly misrepresented the ability’s area of effect, while the new particle is far more functionally accurate. In approaching a change like this, the argument could be made that inaccurate particles create gameplay through deception, but this collides directly with clarity as a core value: **the game should never deceive players**. The player should deceive other players!*\n\nIt's one thing to be unable to see the enemy because they're hidden within the fog of war or invisible.  **It's another thing when the enemy is in plain sight but *happens* to be just outside the camera's field of view.**","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-11-11T02:16:29.418+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not quite, although we're going to get into the realms of semantics at this point. Sneaky play implies things like using line-of-sight to hide around the corner and then ambush an enemy. Or firing a skill shot from far away knowing (or hoping) they won't see the windup (ie: Ashe initiate). That's not the game deceiving the player.\n\nYou say \"happens\" as if it's arbitrary that someone can be out of a camera's field of view when, in reality, it's a decision point for their opponent to put their focus somewhere else. That's pure control for both parties, and the game is designed around manipulation of that point.

And then it's another toss-up whether they notice the puff of smoke at all.  At least the latter can be attributed to skill.\n\nI'll turn your example with Ashe's arrow right back.  That's a perfect example of something that no one below diamond can react to because they can't see it coming until it's too late.  If Karthus's Lay Waste was changed because the deception was caused by the game (you couldn't see the actual threat), Ashe's long range arrow is the same idea.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-11-11T02:47:25.560+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"But those have their inherent threat tied into the balance of the ability. No ability should be 100% reliable or unreliable. Some abilities have high degrees of reliability associated with them (eg: Cone spells or Lux E), but not 100%. Other spells have lower degrees of reliability associated with them (eg: Jinx W at long ranges, Karthus Q). Clarity is about making sure that the spell's reliability is clearly communicated and it's left up to reaction speeds and anticipation to work around.\n\nFor the Shaco example, that's a perfect demonstration of deception. The point is that Shaco doesn't know, and that skill is attributed to both. I still don't know why you downplay where a player puts their camera as *not* an aspect of skill (because it is). If Annie knows there's a Shaco around, maybe she keeps herself at the bottom left of her screen while constantly spotting for those deceive puffs. Maybe she centers the camera on herself because she doesn't feel Shaco is a threat. Both are singular choices made by the Annie and nobody else.\n\nAshe arrow is intended to have a high degree of reliability but can be dodged by anticipation. Most high level plays are a result of anticipation rather than raw reaction speeds. Lack of clarity is the expectation to dodge something with anticipation but being unable to comprehend what went wrong when you didn't dodge it (ie: Karthus). When Ashe hits an arrow, you know every time you get hit *why* you got hit, even if it came from super long ranges.","replies":[{"poster":"Eotw","date":"2014-11-11T03:24:31.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I was going to post something about Shaco guessing, but I realized that at least 9 times out of 10 the bottom river bush will be hidden better than top.

That's a new one.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with the current camera (I've had this problem since Day 1) is that there are constantly important things just outside the field of view.

I would like to clarify that I had not touched PBE since February of this year and have not heard anything relating to the camera angle from any official posts or otherwise. \n\nHowever I do agree that I am probably a rather small minority. In fact I complained about the camera angle changes on Howling Abyss and have refused to play on that map for the longest time due to the adjusted camera angle. You can personally check the match history of my account \"UchihaScar\" for confirmation that I have religiously refused to play on Howling Abyss. \n\nNow after all of that useless fluff text I would like to ask and request on behalf of any and all summoners like me who do not favor a change in the camera angle, of a \"legacy camera angle\" to be implemented with the release of the new Summoner's Rift. From what I gathered throughout the explanations and reasoning behind the new camera angle, I think it's reasonable to conclude that you would not gain any notable advantages from playing on the old camera angle as opposed to the new one. To the best of my understanding (my apologies if I misinterpreted some of the logic behind the change due to the fact that some of your posts and Nekomaru's seem to contradict each other) the amount of \"area\" you see on your screen is the same before and after the changes, but was accomplished by zooming the camera out while also modifying the camera angle so that it would be slightly more above the champion (sorry for a lack of a better phrase here). In addition, these changes were quality of life changes made to accommodate players playing on locked camera as well as improving clarity in the edge regions of the screen. As a result, if anything, I would expect you to be at a slight \"disadvantage\" if you play on the old camera angle. \n\nOne last point that's not directly contributing to my plea but I hope it is not forgotten in the development team that League did in fact have more than one camera angle option before.\n\nPlease give my request some consideration and give me your team's honest response as to why this will or will not be a feature in the upcoming Summoner's Rift and the reasoning behind your decision. Personally I'm going to continue playing this game and support everything Riot does for esports development, but I would rather not be forced to spend dozens, or maybe even hundreds of games to get perfectly acquainted with the new camera angle. I would be satisfied even with an answer such as \"you represent a extremely small majority of the summoner population and it is not worth the development time and money required to implement such a feature\" since I concur that it would be a very reasonable business and development decision.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2014-11-11T15:20:42.781+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was there ever a discussion on whether or not the SR map would be completely horizontal like TT?

I know that in the tutorial is shows how to unlock the camera but I seriously doubt most new players are going to refrain from playing locked all the time even with this knowledge.\n\nLocked camera is kind of required to play the game with bad performance. Or a sluggish mouse, etc.\n\nThe real solution to the camera angle issue is to split the map vertically instead of diagonal. When was the last time anyone ever complained about the camera on Twisted Treeline or Crystal Scar? Never. Weird. Yet SR and ARAM have had horrible camera angles that players hate and Riot can't seem to figure it out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MungoGeri","date":"2014-11-11T20:29:12.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue I have with the camera is not the overall amount of screen that's displayed but the difference in the amount of enemy facing screen space I can see when playing the blue side versus the purple side.  When playing blue side, I can see Blitzcrank setting up for rocket grabs or Leona positioning for a Zenith Blade.  But when playing purple side, these skills come from off the screen.  If you could allow a player to flip the map diagonally across the river, that would solve all my problems.  That is if you made it so that a player could choose to always start in the bottom left corner no matter whether they're playing blue or purple side, that would be perfect.  The other advantage of flipping the map diagonally is that the top side remains top and the bottom side remains bottom.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Steelflame","date":"2014-11-11T06:38:01.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scarizard, while I say that yea, we shouldn't change the current field of view, could we potentially get a small change for the locked camera in that it is positioned like 50-100 units further down?    As is, there is always a FoV advantage to the team on blue side, as they always have about 50-100 more units of vision range in the form of being able to see more of the ground above them.   Purple side does not share this advantage, as seeing above yourself on purple side often just means you are seeing empty space devoid of action, compared to blue who often can catch the bottoms of enemy champions that purple would not see the tops of due to the hud.   I could understand it if the map was perfectly symetrical on a N/S setup, rather than the current NW/SE line it currently has, because never would a team have an advantage on the matter.   Fact of the matter is, the UI has always favored blue team, and short of fully redesigning it from the ground up so that it is positioned perfectly equally all around the 4 corners of the screen (from it's current heavy focus on bot, with light upper corner use), it always will.\n\n\nThis won't affect people who use unlocked camera at all, but will be a great boon to locked camera users by just letting them see that extra few units that often enough make the difference between an ADC attacking you from under your hud, to an ADC attacking you just above your hud where you can click them easily.","replies":[]}]}
