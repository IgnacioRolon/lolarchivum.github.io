I´m making this post as detailed as possible, so there are no misunderstandings.\n\nSo, Zyra has been ignored from competitive play for 1 ½ years now. People argued, that this is the case due to meta changes, but this is definitely not the case. Over these 1 ½ years we had the Bruisermeta → Assassins → Hypercarrys → Assassins → Tank / Controlmages → Juggernauts. She was irrelevant in all of those, although the idea behind her kit is to be good in the Tank / Controlmages and even in the Juggernaut-meta.\n\nShe was only picked in 1 game in a highly competitive level: In Game 3 SHR vs YG in the LPL by Yansir. She ended with a 0/8/5 KDA, vs a Kennen Support.\n\nWhat is her problem? There aren´t many Champions, who offer as much counterplay as Zyra does.\n\n- Zyra has the 2nd lowest Base HP in the game\n\n- Zyra has one of the lowest defensive scalings in the game (20 armor + 3 armor per level/ 479 HP + 74 HP per level)\n\n- Zyra lacks a passive. Even if you assume to get 1 kill per game, 95% of your Passive-kills have no great impact on the game.\n\n- Zyra has the slowest snare-projectile in the game. Not necessarily a bad thing, because its an AoE snare-spell. But, this spell snares herself for 0.5 seconds. - The snare on enemys scales from 0.75 to 1.75 until level 13. Its basically her only escape when she gets ganked. Its easily dodged (1150 misslespeed), worst case its flashed and you just have snared yourself for 0.5 seconds and became a freekill. You are basically punished for casting this spell at all. It has a 1100 range, but it won´t hit anyone anyway above 800 range with its width and speed.\n\n- Zyra lacks the waveclear of other Champions. With 75/80/85/90/95 manacosts on her Q she has to invest way more mana for less waveclear than other Mages. You could argue that her W costs no mana, but the plants don´t add that much to solve that problem. The manacosts are balanced for her supportrole, but not for mid.\n\n- Zyra got balanced as a “longranged mage”. But, the delays on every ability force her to be at least in 700 range, which is infact not longranged. Neither 1v1 nor 2v2. In 2v2 the supports are most of the time slightly infront of their ADC to apply their pressure. So, if you are in 700 range to hit the Q the enemy support can just trade back/all in you, since he will be closer than 700 units towards you. You basically try to get positive trades on the enemy ADC for your own HP and outsustain with potions. To get the full potential of Zyra´s kit you need to be in 575 range for an Autoattack.\nThe delay on the knock-up of Zyra´s ult is 2 seconds. The radius of Zyra´s ult is 500-550 (?). Let´s assume someone gets into 700 range of Zyra and Zyra simply ults him. A Champ with 330 MS can cross a distance of 660 within these 2 seconds. He simply walks out of it. That´s why you have to use Zyra´s ult as counter/secondary engage. If you combo someone, you need the knockup to kill your enemy with a last Q. I already mentioned, that her E is a hard spell to use (especially offensively). When you cast E the enemy has 1.2 seconds time to dodge for a spell which needs 0.7 seconds to hit him (at 800 range). The animation shows how you aimed the snare. Even if you hit it, you need to walk up for 0.3 seconds to cast the ulti immediatly. You probably won´t get the knockup anyhow because of escape-mechanics/dashes/MS buffs like: Ahri Q/R, Azir E, Cassio Q, Ekko E, Fizz, Jayce E/R, Karma E, Katarina E, Kassadin R/ Kayle W/ LeBlanc W/R, Lissandra E, Lulu W, Orianna W, Syndra can Q -> E you out of ult range, Talon R, Viktor Q, Zed W. They are all enough to deny Zyra the knock up and no knock up means no kill for her. Since you have to move up straightaway after casting E for kill-pressure, you are out of position in the case that the E doesn´t hit and you will lose any trade. Zyra´s ability to make plays on her own is very small. Zyra is both immobile and not able to handle mobility. She is not a Champ, who should be mobile. I agree with this. But, the second point is too much. The “If Viktor did not flash (…) it would´ve been an easy kill” \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9DLY0Qrcm4&t=3m5s of Zyra´s Champion Spotlight happens usually every game, because Zyra cant keep up.\n- Former favorable matchups for Zyra like e.g. Ahri and Viktor completely got turned around after their updates. Zyra, whose kit counters the concept of Viktor´s can´t match him in anyway except early 1v1´s. When Viktor gets his augmented Q, Zyra finally can´t do anything at all. Zyra was considered as the only true counters of Mordekaiser and Ryze in a 1v1. She can´t handle Ryze anymore and gets overrun by Mordekaiser in the botlane. Viktor saw so much play in competitive level and a Mage, which should beat him pretty hard in lane never sees any play.\n\n- “Early game - Zyra´s plants make her one of the games best duelists” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9DLY0Qrcm4&t=2m25s . You recently changed the plant AI. But, in the end it wasn´t that big of a deal as it seemed to be/was initially on the PBE. And she is clearly not the best duelist in the league. She is way to vulnerable.\nUhm gapcloser? No way to respond to it.\n\nZyra has more weaknesses than strengths. Every controlmage can do their job better. Siegecomp? Get Azir. You got a lot midgame power? Get an Anivia to scale and waveclear  for lategame and kite the enemys. Teamfocussed AoE comp? Get Orianna for a safe lane and gamedeciding ultimate and a lot of utility. Strong Jungler and not a big frontline of the enemys? Get Syndra.\n\nIn what comp is Zyra the best? Zyra´s scales good into midgame and falls slightly off. The reason is that she has no damage scaling at level 14/15/17/18. You get 1 sec less cooldown on your seeds and additional 2% CDR and low defensive stats. Not a bad thing, whatsoever. A midlane Zyra offers a good amount of kiting later on to run a Hypercarry-comp. You dont need a Janna for your Jinx/Kog´maw when you have a Zyra and you can go for an Alistar, for some primary engage and e.g. Gragas as reliable disengage in the Jungle. Zyra´s kit as a Champion fits so well in these comps. The numbers in her kit do not interact well with each other on the other hand, making her 1. clunky 2. unsafe as a Champion. You can go other Controlmages for an easier lane, more utility, more reliable damage and to be safer as a Champion.\n\nMost common counterargument? Zyra´s winrate. But, what do you expect a winrate to be, when she has the second highest playerbase average games played? People, who played her in rankeds have ~140 rankeds with her, mastered her, learned to play with those disadvantages. Of course its higher than 50%. And she is rarely seen, thats why people are a bit unfamiliar with her and might not expect the damage she is able to do, if the enemys misplay. Does this make her too OP to help her out? I don´t think so.\nA champion does not need to be strong in competitive play? Well there is a reason why she isn´t, because she is not oppressive, high risk and a low reward Champion. Professional players play Champions, who bring something special to a team, who are good in certain situations. The reason nobody picks Zyra is, that she does not offer anything unique worth picking up. Why pick a slow AoE low duration snare, when you can pick up safe long duration single target snares? Why pick an 2 second delayed  1 second AoE knockup? Every Champ can run at Zyra. Zyra can´t run at other Champions. She is not abusive as she was in S3.\n\nIf you want her to be strong in melee range, give her at least the necessary defenses to stay alive. Or to use the full potential of her kit. The frustrating part is, that she is still considered in your point of view as an OP Champion with no rooms to buff. It sounds like this is the final version of Zyra people have to play with until she gets something like a Viktor-level rework. If you would be release Zyra today, would she be exactly the same as she is now?\n\nWhy does she see such a treatment in contrast to other Champions in the game? Is she seen as a Champion unfun to play against like Yorick or Poppy and you don´t want her to be strong? If this is really the case just say it. I feel sometimes that she is kinda a taboo. I would really love to discuss a bit with you about her.","replies":[{"poster":"SmashGizmo","date":"2015-10-16T20:19:32.154+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thanks for sharing such in depth thoughts here, really appreciate the effort you put into your post.  I'll try to go through and touch on some of the important parts where we seem to see things differently and hopefully give you some insight as to what we think of Zyra:\n\n* \"she is still considered in your point of view as an OP Champion with no rooms to buff\":  This just isn't true.  We buffed her plant AI in 5.20 and have been considering additional buffs from there.  It is true that we feel pretty limited in what we can actually do because her winrate is actually quite high, which suggests that she's probably not as weak as people think, but it's just not true that we don't consider that we have room to buff her.\n* You talk a lot about how we view Zyra as a long ranged mage, but I'd say that we view her as a 'zone-controller', more akin to Anivia and Heimerdinger than say Lux and Ziggs.  A large part of what defines a zone control mage is their slow movement and set-up time, but extreme power once they have established a position, which is a large part of why they tend to have low defenses and movement and slow casts.  What this means for us is that many of the weaknesses you point out on the character are actually intended weaknesses.  Her E is supposed to represent a window where she spends set up time to CC opponents and establish plant control and I at least feel it's important for it to have a longer than usual cast time.\n* You also talk a lot about Zyra's matchups as a Mid laner in the context of professional play.  While I think we do want to support Zyra as a Mid Laner for Solo Queue play, it's felt out of reach to get her into Pro Play as a midlaner (similar to Annie).  I don't want to say that this is completely off the table long term, but as our team mostly works in 2 week spurts, making Zyra a desirable Professional Mid Lane pick without straight breaking her for the overall game is just out of scope.\n* With all that being said though, I will say that Zyra probably isn't getting enough payoff from her kit at the moment.  Personally, I have my eye on the Ult knockup duration and Plant scaling throughout the game as potential areas that we could buff on the character in the near future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HeartPalpitation","date":"2015-10-16T20:44:10.811+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":25,"body":"Can we address the elephant in the room?

Riven players love their brokesword.\n\nWhatever you do, don't just give her another flat damage nerf :( I have i think around 500 riven games, 100k mastery points on her, currently plat 3\n\nIn my opinion, shes fine the way she is, considering she's entirely dependent on the enemies being semi-bad enough to let her run around in the team fight unchecked, and she absolutely NEEDS to win lane or she can only really kill an isolated target.\n\nThe nerfs to her ult speed and movement speed really made her just feel clunky, but i've grown used to them and it's not as bad anymore.\n\nHer E cooldown is the only thing that springs to mind that maybe could use an extra 1 or 2 seconds cd at rank 5. I believe with 40% cdr it goes down to about 3.9 seconds, which is rather strong for the amount it shields and moves you.\n\nI also might be saying what you guys are thinking, but thats my 2 cents.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iGrappleFTW","date":"2015-10-16T19:41:36.411+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I noticed that recently, ever since the worlds patch, there haven't been any drastic balance changes or even that many small balance changes.

With it gone, she fell into decline as other competitive picks went ahead in the buff/nerf cycles. The resurgence of tanky champions also exposed more faults in her kit, further putting her behind as a meaningful pick. \n\nIn short, she was built for an era of glass, where everything died to burst and 'true tanks' were a rare, non-viable handful. Now, ever the victim of meta-shifting and her competitive picks becoming better, she's sitting a quarter way to the bottom of the barrel. Workable, but not fantastic, even when she's fed. The stars have to align for her to achieve anything, rather than her moving the stars instead.\n\nTo my eyes, she faces tough problems in her kit not having answers in a … healthy, way. At the moment, Syndra's only viable play style is a 'pick off' sniper approach, using her long range E+Q combo to make plays. Her ability to sustain DPS is only practical against other carry-champions, since devoting all of her resources to fighting the frontline (tanks, bruisers, etc) is detrimental at best. Having no mechanics other than her stun to by-pass the frontline, she's forced to deal with them, and she doesn't have the tools to effectively do so.\n\nOther issues arise, conceptually/mechanically, in that her kit doesn't fully convey 'unleashed power' (once overshadowed by her early dominance). As the game progresses and she 5 points her abilities, her passive is to make them significant power spikes, but doesn't. I'm aware this is being worked on, as of at least some months ago, so I'm not sure what's planned for there. \n\nThis is a kind of broad overview of her problems, since I'm conserving space. The core principles of her kit, I feel, are good. I'd like to see them maintained or refined, since the ramping/tempo + control playstyle is what I fell in love with. The success of that style, however, has been in decline for quite some time now. I've [mused on such ideas over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/syndramains/comments/3kuppx/musing_on_passive_ideas/), which might shed light on where I'm seeing it from.\n\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"ricklessabandon","date":"2015-10-16T20:45:53.790+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"hi, hi~\n\nreading over your post, it sounds like your analysis of syndra is pretty aligned with our current understanding of where she's at, how she functions, etc. to recap (and make sure we really are on the same page), here are some key notes about syndra:\n\n* role/function - if we were to 'zoom out' and pick just one threat that syndra's opponents should be mindful of, it'd be her ability to make picks. opponents should need to be more mindful of the space around them when fighting syndra, and mistakes in positioning shouldn't be forgiven very often. we'd want syndra to be functional in this regard above most other threats she could provide.  \n* power timing - syndra's 'thing' is about her ascension to more powerful states, so we'd much rather have larger amounts of her power come from things like her upgraded abilities than her first few levels in lane. currently, this is an area where we have a lot of room to improve. changes to address her power/impact/satisfaction in the later phases of a game (_e.g._, levels 16-18) are likely the next project we'd want to take on for her.  \n* cadence - i personally feel like syndra is in a really good position to have one of the more satisfying and clearly represented 'ramping threat' profiles in league, especially since it directly ties in with her threat relating strongly to a need for spatial control and cashing in on good play there by making picks. i'm not sure if we'd have a strong reason to make further improvements here in the near future, but i can imagine a world in which we get to play this up even more and that makes me excited! practically speaking though, making refinements in this area would likely be a larger undertaking since it's tied so strongly to the feel of playing the character (which i personally find quite enjoyable) so prioritizing it over other projects can be a tricky proposition.\n\nso, getting back to your original question, i think the future of syndra includes a lot of focus on getting her timings right regarding power curves. we'll most certainly look at her passive (a lot to be gained there, i feel) and anything else that lines up with a project in that vein. when making those adjustments, we'll be looking at preserving her baseline function as a control/pick mage and playing up the good feels around her cadence if possible.\n\nhopefully that covers your question!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2015-10-17T01:49:26.724+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":7,"body":"What are your opinions on 3-hit passives and why are they the best?","replies":[{"poster":"Freezman","date":"2015-10-17T06:51:44.902+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"Someone didn't get the joke, huh.

TL;DR - We evaluate supports on similar metrics to the rest of our champions, though we've seen large swings from small changes in this category specifically due to the smaller pool of supports (so even a small nudge could make someone played a ton or played a little, because the next one replaces it).\n\n2. Heavily, actually. Our changes to all of the Juggernauts in 5.18 (where all 4 + GP/Fiora were nerfed) were actually done with champions like Gnar in mind, who we consider to be a popular and effective counterpick to these champions. Worlds has proven this to be _mostly_ true, though obviously GP and Mordekaiser need further work.\n\nOften times if some champion or strategy is domineering, we'll think a lot about why that is - and in some cases, endeavor to buff a champion or item that's part of that champion's counter-matchup (such as making Spectre's Cowl more efficient/better when mages are everywhere top, etc).\n\n---\n\n1a - Leo's pretty strong, definitely in the top 5 of star-signs for the moment. Unsure if we'd buff, will have to check my horoscope.\n\n2a - Best support in the format is definitely Evolving Wilds. Battle For Zendikar's proven to be a more diverse limited format than Rise of the Eldrazi in terms of color identity and strategy, so the windows you open yourself for a 3 color deck (4 if green) by early-picking Evolving Wilds outweighs some of the power you lose in the process.\n\n3a - Rengar spends most of his time hunting monsters much larger than him, which I imagine translates into a large amount of fractures. Pretty good shape considering.\n\n---\n\n1b - SmashGizmo had a pretty good Sheik until he got frustrated and went back to playing Melee full time, but ya boy scarmander's got the dirtiest DK this side of the Mississippi \n\n2b - It's really hard to walk around and **not** see people playing some of these games at their desk, but for our team specifically?

Well, let's say that we do a lot of different types of analysis for what a champion's numbers should look like. Sometimes we look at pretty basic comparables (i.e. this is Lucian's full combo at 9 with a BF Sword vs Graves) to get a first sense that something may be off. Then we can look into much more detail. For Ekko before release, Gypsylord and I looked at multiple different burst profiles (poke damage, full damage besides ult, full damage including ult) and measured them against other champions in his class that either had similar burst styles (maybe Diana) or had really spikey high-ends with huge AP Ratios (Leblanc, maybe Annie).\n\nWe also have a pretty decent read on knowing what small base stat changes will do to a champ because we've seen the effects of them so often.\n\nThat said, a lot of what we do is pretty well tied into both the objective aspects of playing a champion (i.e. this guy has X base damage at 13), as well as the subjective aspects (i.e. we have a huge amount of expertise on this topic, and we can confidently say that Darius is overtuned...that one may be a gimme).","replies":[]},{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2015-10-16T19:57:22.969+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally bro, gotta climb that ladder.\n\nKidding aside, I stay far away from pushing for buffs for any champions I'm playing to avoid conflicts of interest.

Whenever I die and my clone is out, he follows the most recently targeted champion around but never attacks them. He doesn't blow up. He doesn't even follow them into bushes like a Maokai Sapling. This has caused me to lose several potential kills since he becomes useless once I die. Is this intended? If so, why? Often times I feel cheated since he won't even die when I do.\n\n2. This is the same for many champions with similar mechanics, like Annie, but why does controlling Shaco's clone with the \"R\" key acts differently than controlling it with \"Alt+Right Click\"? Whenever I use R, it feels very clunky and delayed, to the point where I'm forced into using A+RC, which is fine usually, but when my clone dies and I still use A+RC, it'll instantly change to controlling me, causing me to turn around and either give up chase or get killed for free once every couple games I play Shaco.\n\n3. This is more of a request, but would it be possible for Shaco's clone to have a range indicator on it similar to the one Orianna has with her ball? It'd be very useful seeing the max range and judging how far my bait can go.\n\nThanks for reading and hopefully responding!

We have a ton of different metrics that feed into our balance decisions. For example, we look at base win rate across all elo, Plat+ win rates, pro win rates, and experienced player (more than 30 games on a given champion) win rates. Aside from win rate, we look at picks and bans, popularity, player perception, etc. We monitor this stuff from patch to patch, so it's pretty easy to pick up on trends as well as predict them.\n\n2. We get together for each sprint (basically our tasks per patch) to both pick tasks and assign them.  We use a healthy mix of data and intuition to select our projects and then assign them pretty organically (whoever wants it, takes it - though we tend to have people who \"own\" various champions because they have more experience with them than anyone else)\n\n3. Like most of Riot, and really game development in general, we're pretty diverse. We have people with no college education up through PhD's. It creates a really unique design atmosphere because everyone sees things in a different way. Some people are very good about thinking in systems, others better in numbers or thematics.
