When I died, her death sound was played over and over, not her KO, but her moaning for like 5 seconds and then it would go away. And then it would always do it when I died with Arcade Riven(I don&#039;t know if it happens to her other skins tho).","replies":[{"poster":"Leblancs Boob","date":"2017-06-18T15:42:12.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bug. The skin is based off arcade fighting games. When a character dies their cry echoes for a bit. Riven's death is meant to mimic that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-06-19T19:47:07.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! Thanks for the post! Can confirm - Arcade Riven's death is working as intended :) as ImSeahorsing pointed out, her death VO effort has been processed to deliberately reference the somewhat heavy-handed and tacky audio design of the fighting games of yore than we grew up on! It's a bit dated sounding to our 2017 gamer ears, buuut isn't that part of what the Arcade line is all about? :D","replies":[]}]}
