Everything is normal until the hook leaves his hand, then it disappears until it reaches it&#039;s destination or strikes a target. The disappearing makes it impossible to judge the actual path. \r\n\r\n1. Play against Nautilus.\r\n2. Watch Nautilus throw his anchor and make it disappear.\r\n3. Hope that it doesn&#039;t appear attached to your champion.  \r\n\r\nThis has been happening over multiple patches and with multiple different skins.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-13T16:20:43.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for the report! I haven't personally seen this in my games, and it's not something I'm currently able to repro. Have you tried running a client repair to see if there's a jumbled file somewhere, causing the anchor to become invisible?\n\n* Open the League of Legends Launcher.\n* Click the Gear button to open the Settings menu.\n* Click the \"Repair\" button. The repair process will take about 30-60 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"KBingo","date":"2016-09-15T01:07:29.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FYI, it's actually the question mark button, not the gear button.","replies":[]}]}]}
