Pretty boys have a specific body type and facial type.\n{{champion:81}} - The pretty boy king, who was based off anime from the beginning.\nBeyond him we have \n{{champion:90}} - When his hood is down, the guy is the second prettiest boy character after Ezreal himself.\nSeen here [in his old splash.](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L78zEKWCMII/TUhvZiDc6-I/AAAAAAAABZU/6GZn6ac4KJg/s1600/Malzahar_Splash_0.jpg)\n{{champion:91}} -Outside of his base skin, he's pretty much always depicted as a pretty teenage boy when his face is shown, easily the third most bishonen character.\nFor instance [SSW](https://lolskinshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/TalonLoadScreen_4.png), [ES](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a6/Talon_EnduringSwordSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180814200149), and [DB](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/a3/Talon_DragonbladeSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181021055849).\n{{champion:245}} - He, excluding literal children, is the youngest male character in the game at only 17.  He fits by default.   \n{{champion:523}} - League's newest pretty boy for extremely obvious reasons.\n\nThose are the five most suited to the 'pretty boy' role.\n---\nThen there are the ones with the proper body shape to have pretty boy skins made for them, even if personality-wise and style wise they don't fit.\n\n\n{{champion:141}} - Kayn is not quite a pretty boy, but he could easily fit into the role with minimal design changes.\n{{champion:4}} - Yeah, TF.  If he cleaned himself up and shaved, basically had a style overhaul, the guy could definitely look like a pretty boy.  He has a slender frame fit for the role.\n{{champion:112}} - Viktor is the nerd to Jayce's jock, Jayce is a tough guy type with a broad build, Viktor is the opposite.  Though he'd need a lot more changes than Tobias.\n{{champion:110}} - Varus is very much like Kayn here.  He is literally made up of two pretty boys so it makes sense.\n{{champion:8}} Vlad, despite his ugly af model, could also easily become a pretty boy, and has actually done so for the Academy line: [See?](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/3/3d/Vladimir_AcademySkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181021015940)\n---\nThen you have the guys who, despite being attractive, aren't really 'pretty boys'.  They're more jocky.\n{{champion:497}} - He is at the border of this category, moreso due to his personality than his build.\n{{champion:157}} - Also at the border.\n{{champion:238}} - Along with Shen, maskless art has shown us he could potentially fit into a pretty boy role.\n{{champion:98}} - Same with Zed.\n{{champion:13}} - [As Young Ryze shows](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/b/b9/Ryze_YoungSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181021083809) he is at the border with them in pretty boy potential.\n{{champion:63}} - Remove the charred corpse aspect and Brand could definitely look like a pretty boy.\n{{champion:236}} - Lucian is definitely attractive.  Saying otherwise is honestly just trying to go against convention, even if he isn't your type, but he's not a pretty boy.\n{{champion:126}} - Jayce could easily be fit into a more boyish role, as his Battle Academia skin shows [here](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/0/00/Jayce_BattleAcademiaSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190430214625).\nBut as his debonair skin [shows](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/91/Jayce_DebonairSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181021121145), he definitely isn't a pretty boy.  And the Battle Academia skin even has him in the 'cool best friend' role to Ezreal's own pretty boy.\n{{champion:119}} Draven, like Rakan is on the border here, but he's on the opposite border, he could probably be made to work as a pretty boy, but it would be _really_ jarring, and not feel natural.\n---\nNow we get to the, and I hate myself for using this, please suggest a better category name, 'daddies'.🤮\n{{champion:104}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:23}} \nNot elaborating, because, well, no, I'm staying away from this category.\n---\nThen we get to the really buff guys, outright body builders, despite their attractiveness.\n{{champion:86}} - Shoulders.\n{{champion:122}} - Shoulders.\n{{champion:201}} - Shoulders.\n{{champion:44}}  - _Actually at the border_.

Replace those with starry sparkle trails, it would be easy to do.  You could do it for virtually anyone.\n\nAnd for a lore focused skin line like Star Guardian, yes they most definitely should offer more to the narrative than 'already sparkly abilities'.\n\nI've yet to see a single person make a convincing case for Star Guardian Taric.\n\nThe best argument ive seen is my own: her fit well as a mentor type from Janna and Syndra's  team.  But if put there he steps on Janna's toes.\n\nIt's okay to want him, but you need to have an actual good reason for him to fit into the narrative.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-12-16T11:41:10.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a fact lol.\n\n\nYet again, you just don't want it to happen.

It is not an opinion.\n\nPretty, young, boys, is merely the word for word translation.\n\nThey are specifically designed and dressed to invoke femininity or at the very least less masculine appearances despite having masculine character traits.\nThey are usually the protagonist of their story, and in female oriented works, the main love interest, since it describes the ideal male to the common Japanese woman.\n\nYou cannot have an opinion on whether someone is Bishounen.  They either are or are not.  Is aphelios young looking?  Yes.  Does he have feminine features?  Yes.\n\nHe is fucking Bishounen and no matter what you say or think it will always be factually true to say Aphelios is a Bishounen character.\n\nSame with Ezreal, same with Talon's skins, same with Malzahar and same with fucking Ekko.\n\nTaric, on the other hand, is not designed to look young, nor feminine.  So he is not Bishounen, and once more no matter what you say or think it will always be factually true to say Taric is not a Bishounen character.\n\n_Kayn_, meanwhile, is in fact designed to look young, and in his base and Oddysey skin designed to have somewhat feminine features, such as his hair and jewelry.\nSo, once more, _no matter what you say or think_ it will _always_ be factually true to say Kayn is, in fact, a Bishounen character.\n\n\nThe _'best friend'_ is my own words on refering to the youngish masculine character who lacks the feminine aspects.  Seen extremely commonly in Japanese works.  Called such because they are more often then not the best friend and or rival or mentor figure of the protagonist.\n\nSuch as Jayce in relation to Ezreal in Battle Academia.\n\nIn the terms of a five man band, these two characters are often the Hero and the Lancer of the group, respectively.\n\nThey are specific and common, objective character designs.  And no matter what you say, do or think, will continue to be so.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-12-16T13:15:51.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, you can cause he doesn't and Taric does.\n\naesthetic = / = body type. \n\n>concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty\n\nSo, still the term meaning pretty boy is highly emphasizing the PRETTY.
