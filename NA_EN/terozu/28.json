She has a close range stun.  She has a stealth decoy.  Her ult temp gives her the character's entire kit and can target enemies _and_ allies.\r\n\r\nYet she still isn't as frustrating to deal with, because?\r\n\r\nShe's actually built with a power budget.  She dies to a fucking sneeze.  Some cases that is literal.\r\n\r\nBlizzard aknowledged that her ult is an insane amount of power.  They took it and gave her a simplified base kit, with a bit of self peel and made her squishy to make up for it, letting the player rely on wits to trick a foe.\r\n\r\nSylas?  His ult is an insane amount of power.  Riot took this, and decided, that he needed a _stronger than average base kit, with more tools than a normal champion._  On top of that, _they made him tankier than average_.\r\n\r\nAnd leading this back to the title, _WHY DOES NO ONE SEEM TO CARE!?_\r\n\r\nThe outcry against Akali was so fucking loud. She lost both obscurance and her healing, which was her whole shtick!\r\n\r\nEven though the healing was far less powerful and actually had a condition in that to utilize it she had to play passively and wait for a spell rotation.\r\n\r\nHis heal is more powerful and far more aggressive.

Akali can use two of her dashes (r) in any direction, and her E1 in any direction, while her E2 is dependent on enemy positioning.

You're being very vague with regards to the actual changes and what their impact is. A buff doesnt always equal a nerf, it depends on severity and the impact that the change has on the champion, in which, Sylas is getting some very impactful nerfs compensated by unimpactful buffs.\n\nThe lower passive AOE size is HUUUGE and cripples his laning harrass consistency, as good sylas players would constantly proc this to harrass laners. Not to mention how much waveclear hes losing due to passive, which hurts his ability to push and makes his laning much less scary for opponents like Darius or Renekton who can fight him early. \n\n>slightly lowered\n\nYou mean 30% lowered.\nDamage buff is compensation mostly, its +4 at level 1 and +6 at level 18. Wow. Massive. Totally net neutral.\nThe two charges is nothing. All it does it let you use E1 and immediately E2, good sylas players don't need two charges as they would space out E1 and E2.\nThe Q's secondary damage AP ratio is getting lowered by 1/3rd and its base damage cut by 5 - 30, which is pretty extreme considering Sylas relies heavily on his Q for damage, as his W is mainly an execute, and he's often forced to save it for the heal.\nW heal is a revert buff.\nE moving of the shield is massive. This effectively means in lane, your shield lasts 0.5 seconds less (as thats the time of his E2's stun) and also hurts his dueling, since Sylas in lane often delays between E1 and E2, which means hes much less safe. The shield base strength buff tries to help with this, but this is very far from a net neutral change. You're deluding yourself if you think the changes to sylas are neutral, they cripple his safety and massively hurt his ability to lane into ranged champions especially. His W healing and E shield compensation aren't enough to make this a net neutral change, when mechanically, he's losing much of what makes him strong.\n=============================================================================\nEDIT: Here's the actual Changelist thats on the PBE, so that we can have full clarity:\n\nPetricite Burst (Passive)\n- Damage changed from [(100% AD)+(5+2.5 per level)+(20% AP)] to [(100% AD)+(9+3 per level)+(20% AP)]\n- radius reduced from 400 to 250\n- now does 30% reduced damage to minions other than the primary\n- Now has 2 charges\n\nChain Lash (Q) \n- Q2 explosion radius reduced from 200 to 180\n- Q2 Damage lowered from 45/70/95/120/145 to 40/60/80/100/120\n- Q2 AP lowered from 60% to 40%\n\nKingslayer (W) \n- Heal increased from 60/80/100/120/140 to 70/95/120/145/170\n\nAbscond / Abduct (E)\n- Abscord no longer shields\n- Abduct now only shields on champion and monster hit.\n- Shield value increased from 60/90/120/150/180 to 80/120/160/200/240\n\nEDIT 2: My mistake.

If Mark is detonated by her abilities high damage.\nW(2): Send a clone to a specific spot and stealth.  If you take damage or deal it remove stealth, if clone takes damage becomes a badass bird and flies away.\nE(3): Snare all enemies in front of you in melee range.\nR(4): Become an enemy or ally for X seconds, you have their full kit.  Cooldown is based on whether you used their ult or not.\n\nAkali\nPassive: After hitting a target with an ability and successfully disengaging(or more difficultly, chasing) your next auto will do bonus damage and minorly restore energy.\nQ: AoE attack with a smaller aoe that slows.\nW: Shroud that makes you invisible within it's moving aoe and move buff, also large energy recover.\nE: Throw skill shot and dash opposite way.  If hit you can dash to hit enemy.\nR: Dash with little damage to microstun targets.  After a moderate lock out dash again to execute.\n\nMy issue with Sylas is, they're actually very similar.\n\nPassive is an enhanced auto, but Sylas' is flat out better.\n\nQ is an aoe attack with a conditional slow.  But Sylas' has a larger aoe for both and deals more damage.\n\nW is a great defense tool.  But Akali forces her to go passive to make use of it.\n\nE free dash, conditional skill shot dash.\n\nTheir base kit is really similar, but well, Sylas is just better.  He has better burst, better sustain, more aoe, better single target.\n\nThen you get to ults.  Sylas can complement that same amount of safety, and damage and mobility, with a ton of different options.\n\nSylas' kit is more overloaded than Akali's, but she's hated and he's not really mentioned.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeyphel","date":"2019-06-03T05:48:42.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say anything about the comparison with Morrigan since I don't know that character well enough but with regards to Akali, let me say why Akali is consistently more of a problem than Sylas.\n\nWhile it is true that Sylas Q1+Q2 could do more damage than 1 Akali Q if the Sylas player is good enough to hit both parts (which is nothing easy btw), Akali's Q is much easier to land on an enemy and has nearly no CD. Compare 1.5s CD to 9/8/7/6/5s CD.\n\nAkali is also much more mobile than Sylas in most aspects. \nShe has more movement tools than Sylas and also most of them are dashes which give her more freedom of movement around the map and better roaming. \n\nAs an extra detail, she has way much more burst damage than Sylas and her combo is much more easier to do than Sylas's combo and even faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-06-03T06:15:45.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will say her combo is probably faster as well, but I don't think a full combo from Akali does as much as Sylas, and the mechanics in her kit seem far more difficult.\n\nI'd have to actually do the math on that though and I'm to tired to, I'll do it tomorrow.\n\nShe has one more dash than Sylas though three of her dashes aren't reliant on a target, but they can _also_ be dodged making them less valuable since hitting them is more required for her.\n\nAlso, since Akali's Q is gated by a high Energy cost you actually have to consider that, saying she can Q twice from full Energy, you can consider it charge based.  She gets 1 'charge' every 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 seconds, hitting her passive refunding 1 second.  And unlike actual charge based spells that can't be lowered by cdr.\n\nThough her W gives her one free charge.\n\nI will also point out that Sylas' Q has higher base damage and it requires 2 Akali Qs to match one Sylas Q anyways.\n\nTheir passive damages are roughly equal but lean in Sylas' favor due to natural ad scaling and his passive dealing damage equal to a crit + AP scaling.\n\nBasically, to match Sylas' damage Akali needs to Q twice and get both assassin's marks on the enemy, this will match Sylas' getting the first part of his Q off and his passive off.  If the second part of his Q goes off he wins.\n\n Akali has to reposition way more to get her passive her slow is conditional and very narrow area and she has much less aoe damage in general.\n\nAkali has to work harder for less damage.  \n\nAnd then Sylas is also safer.\n\nNow I feel like this comment is probably nonsensical and confusing because I can barely hold my eyes open.  So I'm going to bed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
