It's so very hard to spot them because they zip past so fast and your brain aggressively tries to filter them out while you play.  Easiest to see them when watching a youtube video of the level :)\n\nThey were fun to add in at the last minute though!","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-04-07T00:02:37.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...
