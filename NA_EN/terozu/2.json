A balance between the two is _literally_ impossible. Up every teamfight, and it's too useful, and completely invalidates shielding supports. Up only every other teamfight (or less), and it's just not useful enough. The only possible way it could be good without being broken is if it gave good stats, and the active was a 5-min CD, tacked on. And then it'd essentially just be stats with a tacked-on, almost-forgotten active. And then it'd see prevalence in every game, anyways. And then you'd have the exact same issue, because nobody would bother picking shielding supports, when there's an item picked every game that can still render them irrelevant.\n\nThink of it like a Zhonya's that you choose the target for. Now think of how the hell that could _ever_ be balanced properly. Either the CD will render it broken/useless, or it'll have such great stats that there's no point to picking an assassin, because it's bought every time.","replies":[{"poster":"Dead Anime Dad","date":"2017-12-05T17:01:56.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True as this may be it really does come full circle and there really is no counterplay to shields/shield comp.
