That could means Lucian and Olaf will appear. While this isnt much diversity, princiaplly because Lucian is almost a SI champion at this point, it's still some good new possibilities.","replies":[{"poster":"AnotherPurple379","date":"2019-12-15T17:18:55.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's because Lucian and Olaf both appeared in Shadow and Fortune that made me curious about whether other non- Bilgewater/SI characters are going to appear.
