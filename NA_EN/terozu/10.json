The name pops up repeatedly in Ezreal's new VO, across multiple skins, and even in his base, and all of them are different in terms of what they are (Classic seems to use it as a pseudonym, Nottingham uses it as a DnD name, and Pulsefire asks RiftQuest skins if he can be Jarro Lightfeather in their game, etc). So what exactly is this name all about? There's no lore at all about why he's using this name and what it's relevance is.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-10-04T22:48:03.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually there is.\n\nJarro Lightfeather.\n\nJar of Lightfeather Pomade, his favorite brand, it's a giant pun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2018-10-04T21:47:12.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3PxwAOKz,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-10-04T21:29:46.314+0000)\n>\n> Speaking as a former resident of Nottingham... this skin confuses me...\n> \n> {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}\n\nMaybe YOU are part of the Rift Quest universe now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2018-10-04T17:30:04.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that's a good question actually","replies":[]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-10-04T08:13:18.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Prolly but after the Infernal Akali debacle riot knows better than to trigger the community","replies":[]}]}
