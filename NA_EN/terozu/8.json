I want to see players who are creating drama and starting stuff removed and more harshly punished. I want to see my progression and where I am at with my honor.

Show me all these chatlogs of these falsely banned players, and then we can talk about how the system is supposedly broken.\n\nFirst, lets get over this \"link all the threads here proving your point because I don't feel like looking into it myself stuff.\" If you care to find some false positive report threads, easiest thing to do is look for the behavior threads Riot has responded to. They exist and are easy to find.\n\nNow that we have that set aside lets discuss. I am refering only to false reports in regards to chat. I do not know anything about the other two you mentioned. Now think about what I am about to say. We both agree false bans happen, however rarely they occur. It does happen. I am going to guess we both know how bans and lowered honor happens, not by 1 single report but by many, unless they are those key zero tolerance words. And last, we know the report system is predominantly reviewed by a program and not manually. Which means it looks for whatever algorithms it was programmed to. \n\nMy original statement that started all this was simply that \"false reports do matter.\" in response to it being said they don't. Nothing more. Just that one statement. \n\nNow, it has been proven, evidence is right here in these boards. That false bans based off this programs misunderstanding of use of zero tolerance words do in fact happen, aka false reports. I do not see it logical to assume that the program does not make mistakes and doc points off lesser infractions on a daily basis. Aka, false reports do happen, and do effect honor since \"positive negative reports\" do effect honor. \n\nIn summary, false reports DO effect honor.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-04-19T15:50:42.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">We both agree false bans happen, however rarely they occur.

We both agree false bans happen, however rarely they occur. It does happen.\n\nFine, then **any such honor reductions happening falsely are equally rare as false bans** (And in no case is this reduction tied to the number of reports, which you haven't proven and there is ample evidence to suggest it doesn't work this way)\n\nIn this case it's easier, since player support will actually pull your chatlogs and give you an idea of what you're doing wrong. I've also seen many instances on this board, and wouldn't you know it - people aren't being as nice and non-toxic as they claimed to be.\n\nGiven that you think Riot is lying about how the system works (again, with no evidence), your position is unfalsifiable, and so incompatible with logic.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2018-04-19T10:26:21.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2dLK3IWP,comment-id=000500010000,timestamp=2018-04-18T19:03:15.586+0000)\n>\n> Im playing for 4 months now im in honor 1 second level LOL...\n> Last season i got to honor 5 in 4 months...
