The early gold is accelerated, which I honestly think could be abused by carries who can just sell it later like they do doran's items now, but on an actual support gets punished extra hard for your team falling behind unless the game drags really long, which Riot actively makes changes to prevent. So if you want a full build, or even just an average build for the last few seasons you will have to do things that will piss off your team.

Old spell thief required a near by ally.\n\nSo, with new spell thief, your gold rate increases from 78 gold/minute to 102 gold/minute.\n\nSo first phase your gold income has largely increased.\n\n\nOld frost fang was the same but granted 22 gold per stack consumed, so you got 144 gold/minute.\nNew one grants +3 gold per second but keeps to 15 gold per stack.  108 gold/minute.\n\nOh and also, you're getting 450 gold for free since you get the update for free, so let's divide that per minute of optimal play.\nThat adds 97 gold to it.  For a total of 205 gold/minute.\n\nHuh, gold gain still didn't _actually_ decrease.  But... by the time you get the third item, it should fall off, which it does.  You go from 144 gold/minute to 18 gold/minute, BUT also a free immediate 800 value item and you can cs again.\n\nThe fact of the matter, played optimally, it is a buff to Support's laning phase gold.\n\nThis isn't mathematically debatable.\n\nIt does however, punish bad supports.

Just from a numbers perspective you dont even gain 400g worth of stats from them.\n\nTier 2s are also worse, as you lost damage/regen/cdr. Yes, it didnt cost me gold to upgrade, but it doesnt come with anything that i physically need specifically for lane. It also comes later, as it costs 500g to trigger upgrade, where as before it cost less to buy the upgrade.\n\nYou lose all your lane specific stats in these items in the laning phase. I need the regen/healing more than i need a small amount of AP/HP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-11-25T02:49:23.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The loss of any form of sustain and the loss of the entirety of the tribute passive after it gets fully upgraded is a huge issue with me. Is it that broken to still have those passives on the fully completed items? Specially when getting the fully stacked items can take forever? Why does it matter if you can get another 1k gold in another 20 mins? How about the mana/health regen? Is it too much to ask for even 50% regen to be on the items? These items feel horrible to use.\n\nI don't care that I don't have to spend money upgrading them, the money I am saving upgrading them is spent pretty much on trying to get back what they don't give anymore and then if you somehow manage to get full build you are left with a very underwhelming and pointless item whose only goal is to provide wards. I rather get a dedicated ward slot so I don't have this borderline useless item on my inventory.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImGoingScotty","date":"2019-11-25T02:04:27.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I really like the changes.
