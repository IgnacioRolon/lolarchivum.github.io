Stars align.   \n\nI’m lucky enough to direct VO from time to time.  \nI had just wrote the Ashe comic.  Had some free time.\nThey were doing a big skin for Ashe.\n They asked me if i would write her base VO.  \nAnd then I was lucky enough to direct it and the skin’s VO.   \n\nHopefully, I’ll get the opportunity to do something like this again.\n\n(I’ve actually even pitched bringing Spike Spencer back in for a similar rework.\nI’d love to write a really funny wukong script and I loved working with Spike on  Kled. Spike’s super funny, game for anything, and it be nice to have another character in league that’s silly and lighthearted.\n\nI’ve also pitched a Kled “VO skin”.   A whole new VO script of new Kled jokes.  \n\nBut, you know... creatives don’t get make those sort of decisions or plan product strategy— at riot or in basically any industry.  \n\nSo we wait for stars to align.)\n\n\nThanks\n-WAAARGHbobo\n\nP.S. Anivia\nActually even back before I was writing the comic, I had already decided that Ashe’s hawk shot should instead be Anivia.   Because Ashe is ultimately a hopeful character, possibly a reincarnation, who is determined to completely rebuild her society, and has ice magic.  That’s a lot of thematic overlap with what you might expect from an ice phoenix.  \nSo why not embrace that thematic similarity and make it a connection?  \n\nCurrently,  I think Anivia is probably the spirit god /demi-god that speaks the most to Ashe’s beliefs and hopes.  So it’s probably the god she prays to the most and has the deepest connection too.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Poldy Scarecrow","date":"2019-09-27T00:58:09.791+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully they buy your pitch, I'd love to see Spike back for a Wukong VO.
