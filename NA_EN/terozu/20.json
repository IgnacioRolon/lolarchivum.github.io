It's nice when games make characters that are gay because that either normalizes being gay, which feels good for me because hello, a lot of us got bullied for it, we like feeling normal or they show the character going through the same struggles we did, but then ending up as a hero. Why is this part of a political agenda? Riot isn't running for president. I just want characters I can relate to lol. Less than like 3% of the popular is gay, and less than 3% of champions in league are gay, why is this an issue? This trend won't eventually die. Did the trend of adding black people to movies because everyone was racist af die? No eventually it just became normal. I hope you realize people used argument like yours against normalizing black people living with white people. If you think there's something wrong with that, then I don't even want you to respond to this. You scare me if that's your thought process. So multiple words. Not one. Not politics. Maybe sometimes it's politics, but not here. By the way riot wasn't trying to make a big thing out of Neeko or Fiora being gay, hell who even knew fiora was gay till now. The community, like you, made it a big thing. Literally all riot said was yep Neeko identifies as a lesbian and put voice lines that could easily be brushed off as a friend thing into the game. It's not even in here lore. It's literally only in voice lines in the game. Same thing for fiora.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-11-20T18:40:28.908+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"And a lot of us who weren't bullied for it were just in the closet for a long time...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tyermaillin","date":"2018-11-20T14:11:05.477+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's one (1) character with gay dialogue.

This is pretty darn close.","replies":[{"poster":"NanaRanger","date":"2018-11-20T20:06:36.411+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":9,"body":"Seeing as Matt had to come out and had to say she's definitely a lesbian, I would say this is 100% obtrusive.  You can like that she's a lesbian all you want, but recognize that it's shoehorned into a new character and shoved in your face rather than slowly shown through story or action (how it should be), There still more of her story to be revealed, if they wanted to do this right they should havel et the narrative tell us she's gay rather than throwing it out there not 24 hours after reveal.  She will now forever be \"That gay reptile bitch\"  instead of that \"that chameleon bitch\"  And all because they decided to shove it down our throats on the first day of her reveal.  this is where I have an issue, not that she's into the ladies, but that she will never be any thing more than that gay champion now.  And don't try and chime in with \"representations and relating\" because that argument is stupid.  I am not a little adorable yordle searching for a hero, yet my favorite character is Poppy, I don't need to relate to her to love her, and as a lesbian myself, I did not need to know Neeko was gay to like her, I liked her before, less now.\n\nSexuality in champions isn't and shouldn't be important.  To show how ridiculous it is, how stupid would it be if when Zoe came out they said \"yup, she's totally strait\" But at least Zoe's hostility toward Lux is jealousy that her crush has the hots for her, unlike neeko who just across the board treats male champions with indifference and disdain, which makes her the worst kind of gay person.  How stupid would it be if a strait male treated all other males like she does? or a strait female treated all other females like neeko treats men?  answer, very stupid.  If your sexuality is so tied to you that you can't treat some one your not attracted to well, your a horrible person, and the character acting like that is a terrible character. \n\nThe only times sexuality should be brought into a champions story is if it defines who they are, and if being gay defines them as a character, then they're a very bad character.  The other is if it's important to their story.  Lucian is strait cause he was married to Senna, Varus is two gay guys inside a demon.  These are important factors in their character.  Neeko being an lesbian because \"lol she's a lesbean\" is pandering idiocy.  It should have been left a question mark until it became important to a narrative.  Her story thus far reveals nothing about her being a lesbian, her voice lines saying that she misses Nidalee were just seen as her missing the first friend she made after narrowly escaping death and coming to a strange new land.  If I HAD to assign a sexual orientation to Neeko, a chameleon like creature, I'd have said she was bisexual given her ability to take different forms.  But even that doesn't make much sense as she's from a race that sees into the soul over physical appearance.  She truly shouldn't have a sexuality if this is this case.\n\nWhen I first watched her interactions I thought \"Oh hey she likes being the pretty girls more, maybe it's because she sees it as wearing cloths, so putting on a new pretty form is fun for her, while putting on male cloths is weird and strange. like how a man would feel awkward in a dress, but nice in a suit.\"  But then Matt comes out \"she's a lesbian\" and suddenly her enjoyment of changing forms is no longer whimsical and fun, it's that she's gay and likes being other girls because she's gay.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-11-20T20:30:32.205+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe someone asked whether she was a lesbian and it was confirmed.  My understanding of it is that they didn't just go \"btw people Neeko is a LESBIAN!  YOU GO GIRLLL\"\n\nI don't care what the sexuality of the character is, yet you for some reason seem to care a ton.  I mean my main is Xerath and I think his sexuality his completely unmentioned.  I also plan on playing a ton of Neeko because her kit looks super fun.  I don't see her as the gay champion, that's you seeing her that way.  Btw there's already Fiora, Varus (sorta), and (likely) Taric.\n\nI'm sure that if people asked about Zoe's sexuality, they would have pointed out her adorable crush on Ezreal.  Also Neeko doesn't say all guys are nasty, though she is a bit rude.  A large part of what she says about guys is that it's weird for her to look like a guy, which makes total sense.\n\nYou already countered your argument about sexuality needing to be an important part of their character.  How important is it that Zoe is straight?  Plus it makes sense that a lesbian character might express attraction when they're surrounded by characters like Ahri.\n\nHer changing forms is still pretty much what you said.  If you pay attention, her interactions involving sexuality are when she comes across a champion like Shyvana.  You're just looking for opportunities where she's showing her sexuality even if she isn't.  She literally says that it's weird for her to look like a guy, which goes perfectly in line with what you originally thought.\n\nYou seriously seem to have a much bigger issue with this than is warranted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-11-20T23:54:29.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot: So, that wraps up our new champ—oh and by the way she’s gay.

Noxus will destroy every other country in the world if it succeeds in its goals.\n\nAlso you forgot the shadow isles\n\nLike caesars legion people like to try and paint noxus as not actually that bad, but again like caesars legion, noxus is bad.\n","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2018-11-26T05:44:23.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I say \"I am done here.\"\n\nYou write your longest comment in the entire chain.\n\nYou're really high-strung, ya know that?","replies":[{"poster":"AugustHeatHaze","date":"2018-11-26T17:45:50.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't writing it for you bud","replies":[{"poster":"AugustHeatHaze","date":"2018-11-30T21:20:16.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HalfTangible,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E54EQQcl,comment-id=000a0002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-30T06:02:48.993+0000)\n>\n> I know.\n> \n> But I brought it up to make the point: You&#x27;re high-strung.\n> \n> What I really find amusing is that we actually agreed as far as the OP is concerned: he&#x27;s full of shit.\n> \n> {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\n\nlol its 4 days later what are you doing","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Paletongue","date":"2018-11-20T17:34:31.923+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you think the existence of gay people is really that controversial?\n\n\nProbably think black people don't play League too, and that Lucian was a mistake huh","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2018-11-20T19:07:12.842+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think the timing of this is atrocious.\n\nNeeko being lesbian feels less like part of her character, and more like something popped in as a result of recent controversy (see riot and kotaku)","replies":[{"poster":"Paletongue","date":"2018-11-20T19:19:34.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree that the timing may feel forced, but I'm not upset.

Like it's literally just who they are attracted to.\n\nALSO I think it is part of her character! She's a spirit essence shapeshifter, and it would make sense that she would admire and be more drawn to the gender she identifies herself, more similar to her own sho'ma. Likewise, she would reasonably have a disdain for changing herself into a male, so different from her own form.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
