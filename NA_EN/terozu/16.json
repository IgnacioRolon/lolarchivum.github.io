If it is your best possible role, whether you do good or not that game, it was still, by the definition of the word, Meta.  And if, currently, having more dps, over a support, is more effective, or having all tanks, or all adcs, or all supports, w/e is effective, it is meta.  In addition, the winning team, regardless of comp, was the meta for that game, the losing team was off meta, this is fact, regardless of if it was the most common tactic, it was still off meta, because the winning team, is the team with the meta.  And yes ik that meta is rlly just slang, still felt like making this post, and if you're still reading this, then I just wasted like 3-4 minutes of your time, here's a cute chinchilla gif: \nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/87f5116cb5c1b550e67c1cd4beaf026c/tumblr_njs6ko1xPS1rjlj53o1_500.gif\nhttp://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/chicken_regret_nothing.gif","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-12T10:16:47.794+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"alot of people need to read those first four words","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-02-12T10:22:43.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JVP15","date":"2017-02-12T16:01:34.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a really cute chinchilla, but I do not quite like that meta has become an acronym. I know of course that acronyms happen, especially in games where slang is often better at communication, but it still slightly irks me, especially when meta is an actual word.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-02-12T18:47:32.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The meta as used in league has always been in acronym, people nowadays don't realize that and insist that meta means normal and regular, when it doesn't.  The actual word meta, means self referential, and refers to when a subject talks about themselves on a more basic level, neither of which matches up with today's current usage of the word.","replies":[{"poster":"JVP15","date":"2017-02-12T19:03:02.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This. Thank you.\n\nAlthough I don't think it always was an acronym. I know that, in competitive Pokemon at least, people still refer to it as the metagame, meaning the game within the game. I never see metagame used in LoL, but I believe that is what it stemmed from.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-02-12T17:18:05.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, you can win with off-meta comps.
