It doesn't sound like this has affected your ability to change or choose which mastery page you're using so you should still be okay. Let me know if this little visual error starts preventing you from changing your masteries.","replies":[{"poster":"Oom Allfather","date":"2017-08-03T11:03:16.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have something similar, but it's while rearranging pages, since I have a predetermined order. I can change masteries, but it is kind of annoying arranging pages by order, come back while editing and them being out of order again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShynnSup","date":"2017-07-31T04:16:48.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For now its just a real annoying visual error. This feature should be pretty basic, just as the windows file explorer. I wanted the 00_ontherun to always be on top..... and have all my ap, ad and jungles in \"groups\" not mixed as the image shows. \n\nIts a good feature to be able to organize it, lets now fix it, because as it is the feature ceases to exist...","replies":[]}]}]}
