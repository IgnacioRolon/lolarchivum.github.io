If you have already won and continue making douchey remarks you're just being an asshole. And the summoner's code reflects this, requesting people to show \"Humility in Victory, and Grace in Defeat\". So I feel confident that Riot's stance on this matter doesn't differ much from my own.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2019-08-17T00:10:41.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot doesnt care about the summoners code lol they only use it when it benefits them lol, but nothing i said really contradicts tantram but w/e.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-08-17T00:24:25.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">riot doesnt care about the summoners code lol they only use it when it benefits them lol\n\nWhat the hell is that even supposed to mean?\n\n>nothing i said really contradicts tantram but w/e.\n\nYou specifically said it falls under a category of behaviour that is allowed.\nYou specifically said it didn't matter whether you reported for it.\nYou specifically said it wasn't bannable \"in any respect\".\n\nDo you really think that those don't contradict the statement that it can help contribute to a penalty?","replies":[{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2019-08-17T06:53:07.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"tantram said u couldnt get banned for  saying ggez,  just that it contributes, if it doesnt get u banned it is allowed therefor it doesnt matter if u report it what are u failing to understand.\n\nHe said it is reportable but then again anything is reportable, doesnt mean it is bannable. He doesnt explain anything about those who say it consistently so that is unclear but if u say it once u cant get banned. i litterally cant get u banned unless you follow it up with actually toxic comments in which case those comments would be the reason for your ban and not the ggez itself.

Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n> \n> Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2019-08-16T00:28:21.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"Because it's rare to see people so fragile that something like gg ez shatters their world.","replies":[{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2019-08-16T00:57:43.108+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kanzler,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Je2UiQRE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-08-16T00:28:21.775+0000)\n>\n> Because it's rare to see people so fragile that something like gg ez shatters their world.\n\nBut it's not rare to see people so fragile they need to type it in in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2019-08-16T01:31:03.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"its a joke to say it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrexTheInfedel","date":"2019-08-16T23:50:11.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typing anything after the match to put down the other team is toxic, and not 'trash talk'.
