I do see you've played a few Lee Sin matches, but they did not result in an S grade.  Per our [champion mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide) guide, make sure that you're playing in summoner's rift and earning an S or above.  S- will not earn a token for level 7.  Best of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"q8VIMPIREq8","date":"2016-10-05T11:01:09.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty <3","replies":[]}]}]}
