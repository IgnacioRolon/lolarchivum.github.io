IMO things like Vi, Xin Zhao and Irelia are bruisers, while things like Darius, Garen and Big Doggo Nasus are juaggernauts. If you think about if if a whole 5 man team collapses on a fed Irelia, she could escape but it is extremely unlikely she could kill them all, if a team collapses on a fed Nasus it is unlikely he could escape but also their is a small but real chance he could kill them all, or enough of them to make the enemies retreat. If for irelia that chance is 0.5% for Nasus that chance is 5%. ( Trust me I have 1 v 5'ed as a fed Nasus once before, I don't if I would've won because my teamates came in and scared them away, but when I was around a third of my health I had already killed sup, and jungle, mid was at about 50%, Top was at 10% health and ADC was at full.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hot LeBlanc Yuri","date":"2019-08-25T23:43:15.413+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The thigh guy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wUYBgdPo,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2019-08-25T19:03:58.316+0000)\n>\n> But don’t you know?

Even in losing match-ups darius can easily win if the opponent makes one wrong move and gets pulled. Then in his winning match-ups there is no counterplay. A good example is most tanks in the game. Sion V Darius. Darius takes ghost in the match-up and if sion goes in melee to farm he dies, flat out. He has no way to avoid the E in melee range, no mobility to get away and darius does way too much early damage compares to early defensive stats. Their are very few other champions in the top lane where literally clicking the wrong pixel means you die for free.\n\nHe is also a wish for more wishes champion. His E gurantees his W and his W gurantees his Q meaning if you get hit with one ability unless you have crazy mobility which is rare in top lane, your getting hit with all three of his abilities. I think if they are going to keep his pull, his W needs to not slow OR if they want to keep his E and his W in current state, they need to make the bleed a regular dont and not stack. The synergy is way to strong, there is no reason being pulled once can basically shut you out of the game, especially in a melee lane. Blitzcrank is acceptable because it's a range lane and the enemy support usually has tools to portect the adc as well, IE there is counterplay. In top, avoiding his pull is praying pathing doesn't screw you or that you have more range than him. Otherwise, you are inevitably going to get grabbed in one of his 1000 attempts.

Just because illaoi, morde, sion, cho, and malphite don't have amazing mobility? There are in fact zero toplaners with LESS mobility. Maybe equal, but not less, and certainly many who have plenty of mobility.\n\nWhere did I say no mobility? Pretty sure my exact words were crazy or insane or another similar vocabulary.  If you think leaps the distance of urgot's pansy ass dash does anything against a 90% slow your crazy. Now if it wasn't an empowered AA you might have an argument because then you couldn't get it off while the opponent was still in the air for your pull but as it stands your leap only matters until after your already slowed because from the time you get pulled you are unable to move until the slow is already proceed.\n\nAnd it is a guranteed lane, just because someone completely threw free lane doesn't change that. I won a game and lane with AP draven support, does that one fluke make AP draven viable? That \"one time this happened\" logic is invalid. Darius easily wins that and the vast majority of similar match-ups unless the darius just throws.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"ImTheJuggernauty","date":"2019-08-26T20:15:26.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"False.

I said the leap is irrelevant and pansy ass and doesn't help him with darius W. Nothing about the match-up. Urgot is able to compete in the mactchup do to his range advantage and decievingly well melee range fight capability. Nothing to do with his mobility. If anything, an urgot is more than likely to E _**into**_ you after you pull them givin he was properly using his range advantage to gain a health advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"ImTheJuggernauty","date":"2019-08-27T15:16:11.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not pansy ass though, you're making that up to convenience your own argument. My point was that it CAN be used to escape if necessary. Sure, it's not great if used at the wrong time, and you are right, he DOES often use it to jump IN on darius. That doesn't negate anything I said though. Oh and you lied, you specifically stated that urgot's \"pansy ass\" jump doesn't do jack to help him as a mobility spell. Which is of course, you just lying. \n\nAnd it's true, looking back, I got carried away in my examples, however, I can still salvage my argument and examples by refuting your claim that you need \"crazy mobility\" to win lane or play safe and farm up against a darius. that's utter bullshit and you know it. It only takes one mobility spell to play safe against darius. And guess what? The champs that can't outright duel darius early on, are generally the ones that, even with less CS, can outscale him in some significant way later on, whether that be dueling, teamfighting, split pushing, etc.\n\nAfter all, why the FUCK should a tank even COMPETE with darius in lane in duels (providing that jungle influence is equal, and both players are of relatively equal skill, and providing that there may be certain rare EXCEPTIONS), when they will clearly become more useful later on, when all they have to do is BE SMART and PLAY SAFE and NOT FEED him so that HE DOESN'T gain a lead. If he is starved of a lead, he is only 2/3 of a champ unless HE GETS LUCKY OFF ENEMY MISTAKES.\n\nSee, that's the thing, lots of champs can effectively put darius behind, by accepting that, if they can't beat him through kite/harass/short trades, or other forms of dueling, then all they need to do is make sure they stay within 30-40 CS and not give him free kills, then he will be behind and can't get back unless your team makes colossal mistakes. That's a fact.\n\nAlso, you accused me of making false arguments in your name in order to refute them, but the only person here to do that was you when you mentioned your stupid Draven analogy, as if I ever made claims based on singular, rare, or purely exceptional evidence. You stuffed that in my mouth and shoved it down my throat you hypocrite.\n\nTo further refute your bullshit, you mentioned earlier on that \"Their are very few other champions in the top lane where literally clicking the wrong pixel means you die for free.\" That's patently false. If you give an irelia or akali a single mistake, you will die, and they will snowball like crazy, and unlike darius, you won't be able to keep safe xp distance of CS. If you come within three melee waves of them, they will kill you if they have the slightest of leads. \n\nOr should I mention renekton? If he gets a lead, oh boy. Heck, he doesn't even need a lead. He can die to you twice in lane and totally one shot you when he returns.\n\nOr riven? One mistake, oops you're dead. but she can many mistakes, even if you are a fed darius, and still get away, even when behind.\n\nOr should we mentioned fiora? One mistake, such as using a critical ability when she parries, means you most likely die and she snowballs. \n\nHow about tryn? If he gets a slight lead, he'll build early crit or sustain and because near impossible to kill, while chunking you for loads of damage. Got him low? he just E's away, or ults if desperate. \n\nHe has a lead? good luck escaping as an immobile champ against his ranged slow, crits, MS items, low Cooldown E dash. Oh, and he will outscale anyone besides maybe jax as well. \n\nthen jax, sure he's not a beast early game, but he certainly has the ability to outplay darius at any time if he's even somewhat competent. If you make a major mistake, even as darius, and die, then the lane is lost unless jax is an idiot.\n\nOr how about vayne? one missed cc ability (and they are easy to miss against her) and she will end you unless you are near turret. \n\nHow about jayce? a missed pull and he'll either chunk you for 50% with no retaliation, or finish you. Oh, and even if you do pull him, he'll just knock you back, and if you Q him, he'll jump into you, unless he misplayed himself.\n\nthrough all of this though, there is a common denominator. Darius has the power to punish mistakes, however, any top laner has the ABILITY NOT to make critical mistakes versus him, thus beating him through attrition, scaling, dueling, or whatever means. Even taking ghost, and/or righteous glory/deadmans, he is still very kitable, especially if you have teammates with you because HE HAS TO MOVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE. He has NO DASHES for dodging ANYTHING and a TELEGRAPHED Q that can be counterplayed multiple ways. \n\nAnd to cap it all off, I'm just going to say it. Your suggestions for fixing him are absolute garbage and you have no clue what you're talking about. You're just salty.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2019-08-27T15:37:20.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ImTheJuggernauty,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wUYBgdPo,comment-id=001600010000000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-27T15:16:11.710+0000)\n>\n> It's not pansy ass though.\n\nyes, yes it is. Low range, delayed take off, slow movement during actual leap. Darius' W hits you before you can attempt to dash due to the animation buffer and he walks right back up to use before your leap even finished the animation lol.\n\nAll of your champion examples except renekton are incorrect and I'm not gonna write essays back and forth on why. Even then renekton is still regarded as irritating to most top laners but is generally agreed to fall off hard enough and lose game if he doesn't win lane so people can bare it. Darius is a classic, 1-4  doesn't matter because for some reason he doesn't need items to do damage. All he needs is 5 stacks so being behind on gold only effects your tankiness past the first 1 or 2 items. A 1-4 renekton might tickle you before he falls over and dies in the mid and end-game. Either way like I said, they are both regarded as irritating and annoying. If darius didn't take up team's ban spot every single game I'm sure that renektons ban rate would be higher.\n\nSorry that your main is dumb champion and is banned profusely throughout every single elo in the game. Every single elo bracket isn't misunderstanding your proud darius. He's just shit to lane against and everyone except darius players would rather not.","replies":[{"poster":"ImTheJuggernauty","date":"2019-08-28T16:13:39.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't write more essays either, i'm just going to say I think you are near completely wrong and don't know the matchups as much as you pretend.
