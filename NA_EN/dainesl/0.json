Granted, I haven&#039;t played the game since a bit before 6.9 so I might be a little bit rusty with my idea of &quot;what is new&quot; but let&#039;s begin. I may end up not being noticed but it&#039;s worth a shot.\n\nSo Solo Queue is officially dead, and there seem to be two groups of people; those who are in extreme dis-favor of Dynamic Queue and those who are saying &quot;pfft those people who are complaining are just lying to get upvotes&quot;. Both groups of people have valid points, however, Dynamic Queue did have its fair share of issues which people have covered extensively, pros have been saying &quot;the queue is shit&quot; for ages now. Thing is though, it does seem like Dynamic Queue was not meant to be this way; Riot are indeed trying to fix it and I don&#039;t think that they&#039;re 100% in the wrong here. They may have made a ridiculously stupid decision for some, but this is very unlikely to be an intentional middle finger to everyone as lots of the vocal people including Dominick are proclaiming.\n\nThing is, people want healthy discussions, and this is understandably a big topic, right? However, when 95% of the boards is filled with &quot;Dynamic Queue sucks&quot; with the exact same points repeated and upvoted over and over, the boards become stale and thus less efficient discussion can take place. This also applies to the endless amount of memes (most of which are repeats too, and are usually crap) that are upvoted, and I don&#039;t think this is the right way to take things. Granted, Riot may be in the wrong, but to simply continue this behavior is to promote the fact that the boards are very hiveminded.\n\nAs for the other side, the same applies. However, this is more of an issue of prohibiting discussion about certain topics, rather than just choking other points of discussion to death. When I see a bunch of people on either side saying &quot;Oh, you&#039;re wrong, I&#039;m right, _insert x reason why I&#039;m right and you&#039;re wrong, blah blah blah rito sucks/rito is perfect/overwatch looks mighty fine_&quot;, I realise that both extremes are not healthy, and I see this all the time on the League of Legends subreddit and boards (not sure about non-NA boards as I usually look at NA and from what I remember, other region boards are pretty much not worth looking at). Riot is indeed a corporation, I doubt they would want to intentionally kill off their own game. They make mistakes, they do unpopular things (like keeping the tank meta around, and people always generalise every single tank into this sort of &quot;they&#039;re a problem please gut them&quot; box). The community is understandably shaken by the fact that Solo Queue is dead, but at the end of the day, you still have your own choice. I, for one, remain neutral regarding this change.\n\nAnyways, that&#039;s just me giving my thoughts on potentially the biggest issue of 2016. Just remember, hiveminded opinions are often not healthy for discussion. This is the point that I hope I emphasised properly, and uh, yeah. See you guys around, I guess, if I feel like posting more.\n\nEdit: TL;DR, (cause I failed to put one in...nice job me) Having an extreme mindset and following that to a fault is not promoting healthy discussion, it is quite the opposite. Make sure to take into consideration all viewpoints, or at least a decent number of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-06-01T17:05:35.655+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Neither DQ supporters or SQ are necessarily right or wrong, but the crux of the problem here is the horrid communication by Riot on the issue. \n\nPeople are very hive-like in the way they think, when a popular opinion or statement gets rolling, there is no stopping it. Its important to nip in the bud, Otherwise the problem just snowballs and becomes more and more difficult to fix (See Zed, See Kalista when she was released, See the new Mastery Rankings.).\n\nAll of this could have been avoided if they have simply been more transparent. I uninstall league this morning after a few final games, not because I'm raging at the issue of no solo Q, but more of I'm simply blown away and angered by how awful Riot handled this. And to me, this is a sign of what is to come, this isn't something that happened overnight. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone who witnessed first handed the shit show that led to the downfall of WoW and the shit show that led to the downfall of RuneScape. I don't think either of the two fuck ups JaGex and Blizzard did to kill their game even remotely compares here, they pretty much point blank said in their video, sucks to be you solo players, deal with it. \n\nAnd to me, its just frankly...mind-blowing. They had two well respected members of the LoL community in that video to discuss it and they both made it clear that they thought this new system was/is awful, yet despite that, they continue to defend the DQ. \n\nScarra point-blank said at the end of it that he strongly dislikes DQ and that there needs to be some MASSIVE changes within the next month to fix it. To which, he got a typical response: Riot just shaking their head saying yup yup yup, but chances of anything actually happening is extremely slim. Newsflash, they've been trying to make this new DQ work for how long now? Two? Three months? And its still horrible, its time to pull plugs and recognize that it simply doesn't work. \n\nAnd along the same line, this whole fiasco just seems eerily similar to the decline of those two popular games, the \"we know better than you because we have the numbers, so you can suck it\" attitude and the blatant middle finger to the older veterans/dedicated players of the game. I refuse to stay and watch it happen first-hand for the third time.  \n\nThe fact of matter is, even if you know better, even if you have the statistics to back up your changes, none of that matters if you refuse to communicate it actively to your player base or if you piss your player-base off big time and its truly saddening to watch yet another massive gaming company fall into the same trap I've seen others fallen into.

I don't really have much to say about how Riot communicates given that their communication schtick has practically become a meme of its own by this point, but as you said, communication is key. I personally never witnessed the downfall of RS and WoW, and I hope this issue doesn't affect LoL as much as everyone says it will, but Riot does need to change.\n\nIt is difficult to communicate in a way that makes a lot of people happy, however, with this announcement I feel as if they need to realise that, perhaps, more communication is needed. The community wants Riot to communicate more, I agree with them, Riot thinks that the community doesn't want to communicate because of issues like 5.16 Skarner. The issue is that they fluff everything up, which is easily fixable, by being more direct with the community. This would likely prevent fiascos and huge backlashes like this one.\n\nEdit: Wanted to reduce some of my own fluff, so I put the points into 2 paragraphs instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-06-01T17:21:20.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree that its difficult to communicate in a way that makes everyone happy, but some communication is better then next to nothing outside of the occasional acknowledgement on patch notes. \n\nLike I said, I don't have a problem with the removal of SQ, I have a problem with how it was handled. At the end of the day, the removal of SQ was definitely going to draw some backlash, but its something that needs to be done immediately and with 100% clarity because its a huge deal and issue, ignoring it for months on end, then coming out and saying, oh BTW, its not coming back, is not the correct way to do it.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Dainesl","date":"2016-06-01T17:26:59.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing is, how is one able to say to Riot \"hey, your current scheme of communication is failing. Why not try this one instead?\" especially in threads that aren't too popular? What you're saying is valid, but it unfortunately seems not too likely that we'll be able to make a change that benefits both Riot and us, both short and long term.\n\nAnd yes, ideally the solo queue fiasco should've started and ended with the beginning of Season 6. However, stuff happens, so meh. The best we can do is to try and convince Riot that what they're doing is, as you said, not the right way.\n\nIf you have any possible solutions, let more people know about it.

I have suggestions and opinions of my own id like to state but just cant be bothered as I know it will just get ignored in the long run.\n\nThere are many many suggestions on the front page even right now but they get 0 attention from any rioters.

I'm not saying YOU personally do that, but if you count the threads about DQ, it's still the majority.\n\nIf SQ defenders only post bad pretexts, then the DQ defenders will only debunk them, not try to have a meaningful conversation about the philosophy behind DQ vs SQ. DQ'ers wont start a discussions about the philosophy, since they already agree with it, it's for SQ'ers to do the first step and bring the discussion to the table.

Yes, there are people inbetween the extremes.
