Stuck in loading screen at 100%. How would I know that game has started and the cilent has crashed. By the time i realised league crashed, game has been remake and I have been place in low priority... \nHopefully this can be looked into and solved \nEDIT: I have to stress that none of these were intentional. There were neither bug splats nor any indication that league has crashed until you start clicking or using Ctrl+Alt+Delete.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-11T21:57:42.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"When someone disconnects from a game, it negatively impacts the match for all players, regardless of the reason for the disconnection.

Ping spikes during games. 30ms normally and proceed to 300ms in fights or during log in screen or when i hit play button. I noticed it through command promt when pinging the EUW servers. \n\nI also tried repeating these steps but pinging another IP address and get no disparity which suggest to me that it should not be my end?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-10T15:12:49.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If changing your local settings causes no change, paired with the latency (ping) inconsistencies, it's likely there are issues along your ISP routing to the server.
