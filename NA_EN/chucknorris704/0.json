He counters champions like {{champion:157}}  and {{champion:55}}  preety hard with how his shield works. Though this is for close range mids. Against champs like brand he is a poor pick but yeah if you like the ability to just stay in fights for a REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLY long time then go for {{champion:82}} . He is cheap and easy to learn as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"SongofStorm","date":"2014-11-11T23:20:15.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best at Malzahar","replies":[]}]}
