For the same reason that I had to tell the first 10 junglers after the patch that gromp spawns later and you have to start buff now, who were surprised that their smite didn't give buffs anymore or wondered what plants do. Reading comprehension is really, really low. Also, most 3rd party replay viewers don't fully support old replays anyway (and have the disadvantage of randomly breaking from patches or not working for days while the service is patched), so I don't really understand how it's inferior. It's beta - perhaps they'll update the code to allow cross patch replays.\n\nTo your item sets:\n\nNot only can you actually create your own entirely independently of the client (https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/item-sets - you can even download a template and just replace with your own), you can also download from specific sites (Championify as mentioned in Riot's own newspost downloads the highest w/r sets from champion.gg https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify , or you can download the ones you like with a chrome plug-in like LeagueSets https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leaguesets/eoekgdlembbelehimiljbdnofnldepmc?hl=en-US ).
