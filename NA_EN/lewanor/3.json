Your body of work is as impressive as it is staggering.  As I hope you can appreciate, I don't have enough time to read through every facet of your work here.  However, I found your gameplay kit proposal and would like to focus my feedback around that (especially since it's what I do at Riot!).\n\nI really liked the emphasis on Talon's bladed cape, which I think is the coolest part about his visual design.  I agree that there's a lot we could have done to push that idea further and make his cape more incorporated into his combat pattern.  Maybe some of these ideas infringe too much on Irelia's identity, but I think the space is rich enough for two blade masters in one game.  :)\n\nAs for removing his stealth on R and giving him some other tools, I think that change is a bit risky.  You caught yourself by admitting that it may be too overloaded, and I agree with you.  For an Ultimate, it's usually better to create 1-2 effects with obvious success/failure cases.  Talon's current ult succeeds at this because it does the two things he wants most- deal a ton of damage to one isolated target and escape afterwards.  By giving him damage reduction and slow reduction, I think he becomes less of an assassin and more of a skirmisher.  Still a cool identity, but likely a different one from what Talon is today.","replies":[{"poster":"Lewanor","date":"2019-10-21T22:04:15.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all... No, thank you for taking your precious time to read, even if it's just the gameplay part ^^ \n\nYes, my intention was to give Talon an identity around what he stoods out with, his blade cape. Only thing that makes him unique. Not gonna lie, Irelia did play a huge part in it. With all the blade's going out and coming back I think they are pretty similar, just that Talon is an old champion so he's of course not on the level that Irelia is.\n\nWell since I'm always more focused on the lore the only reason I tried to give Talon a gameplay update was to make his gameplay canon, like the new champions and rework we have nowadays. Talon's blades coming out and coming back to him, him going invisible instantly... I only wanted to get rid of these without thinking how it'd play out, not sure if I do even now. But I know something, if Talon is to revolve around his cape, it requires a new kit from ground-up, not just some differences. But that's not something I'm capable of D:\n\nThanks again Lutzburg, it really means a lot!{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}
