I've been keeping track on the issue!\n\nBasically, I agree with what was said. The lore will be modernized as most of Talon's lore and purpose was linked to his 'joining the League to find General Du Couteau', followed by the last Journal of Justice entries (around issue 27), where he effectively investigates the case. Here's a somewhat detailed summary of the conspiracy. [[x]](https://askthebladesshadow.tumblr.com/post/174385763360/and-now-a-picture-of-talons-handwriting)\n\nThe Institute of War is gone, and Noxus has a new setting, the High Command is now the Trifarix and according to the snippet released last year for his lore, he currently takes orders from them. \n\nTalon's loyalty and obsession with his 'cause' are basically the core of his character. Without that, he isn't the champion we know. \n\nHopefully, we will learn more about Du Couteau's fate and his situation before disappearing. I think the powerplay between Swain and LeBlanc will be a key factor in this. Was Du Couteau a friend/supporter of Swain? Or was he somehow sided with LeBlanc? \n\nWe have some quotes about this, Urgot states _\"I hope your father begged when Swain betrayed him.“_ when taunting Katarina.\n\nAnd then Swain going  _\"Do they know who killed your father, or do they still blame me?”_\n\nAnd the most confusing one, Swain to Katarina _\"He asked her to do what she could not. To kill me.”_\n\n\n\nIn summary, my guess is the_ modernization_ of the lore will be something like \"Talon accepting to work for the Trifarix to discover the shadows responsible for Du Couteau's fate.\" Either as a payment for his blades (this would lead him to be a sort of mercenary who gets paid in favors/contacts/information instead of gold. \n\nOr, working for the Trifarix under the conviction he knows he is now serving Noxus in the same way Du Couteau had, to honor his name, finding a new purpose there. This would sort of imply the General's death has been cleared. \n\n\nI honestly prefer the first one. \n\n\n\n\nPS: Lewanor, I know you are in the R/ Talonmains (I'm there too, I remember we went into the Swain AMA asking about this :B)","replies":[{"poster":"Lewanor","date":"2018-06-04T22:54:58.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i created this account for the lore talks here! I was really lucky that Lewanor wasn't taken already. I see you all the time anytime Talon's name drops, i am around now so maybe we'll get some more hints!\n\nAlso i think Swain had nothing to do with General Du Couteau, he probably discovered the Black Rose with a lot of information so he had to be cleaned. Putting the blame on Swain is not a hard thing, if General was a Darkwill supporter before. Maybe he was a supporter of the REAL Darkwill and started to get suspicious about Darkwill (he was corrupted and was mind controlled like Theoden from LotR) and started to do some digging. And he got killed as result. The only problem i have is General Du Couteau is such a powerful figure in the old lore, and him being a angry assassin trainer in the new lore doesn't fit imo. BUT we only saw him by Kat's eyes, maybe General was under influence of other things? We'll see in time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ask Talon","date":"2018-06-05T03:10:37.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lewanor,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=hF3LYAXA,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-06-04T22:54:58.727+0000)\n>\n\n\n\n\nMy thoughts exactly! It would be really cool he found out Darkwill had become a puppet and yes, you know how it went. \n\nTbh, from the Katarina lore, he has some relatively wise teachings for her. I didn't necessarily dislike what we saw of him through Katarina's story. \n\n\n> General Du Couteau pushed her to learn the way of the blade; to cut away the empire’s enemies not with reckless brutality, but deadly precision. He was a harsh teacher with many pupils, and notoriously difficult to impress.\n\n\n---------------\n\n> Katarina’s father himself barely escaped with his life.\n> \n> He was furious beyond words, refusing even to look his daughter in the eye. She had shamed him, and their family name. The greatest assassins do not seek recognition or glory, he reminded her. They do not expect to occupy a place of honor at their master’s right hand.\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n> And failure must have its consequences. She ran her fingers along the raw, deep gash over her left eye, and thought of the price others had paid for her arrogance.\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n\nIn the last part we see her PoV of her father rising others in her place, but as it was mentioned it is a one-sided perspective. Though her dishonor is real, and she is aware of her grave failure. \n\nIt's true the Old Lore General Du Couteau seemed a bit nicer and more compassionate, especially in Cassiopeia's old \"judgment\".","replies":[{"poster":"NotaRobot1006","date":"2018-06-05T04:47:17.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit nicer to Cass, maybe, but not to Talon.
