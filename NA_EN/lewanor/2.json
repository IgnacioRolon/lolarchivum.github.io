FOR THE PLAYERS, ANT. FOR THE PLAYERS.\n\nPlease do!\n\nAlso, could you clarify that \"Eastern Shuriman Jungle / Kumungu\" Situation again? \nWe had quite the discussion going on about At the Edge of the World. My first reaction to someone calling it Kumungu Jungle was linking [this comment](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/t4FtfLzv-should-kumungu-have-gotten-some-more-art?comment=000000000001), where you said it was only the northern part. \nThen we found [this article](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/creative-spotlight/patch-notes-lore-edition-1), which is just as recent and uses Kumungu all over the place, indicating it's the whole jungle.\n\nOur conclusion was that the jungle is named after that area (think NY / NYC), so \"The Kumungu Jungle\" is the whole jungle, while \"Kumungu\" is indeed just the northern part. Kumungu could have its name from the settlement Kumangra, near Zaun. Is that somewhat correct? Did we miss anything or did you just screw up? :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Falrein","date":"2018-12-16T18:42:15.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone mentionned the holy story, and I am summoned. \n\nKalan was nice indeed. I felt bad for him at the end when Syndra traps him in the dreaming pool (even though I don't blame her for that). It's no secret that Syndra's my favourite champion so of course I disagree and read the story for Syndra, but I understand why you liked Kalan so much. I personally think we'll hear of him again. We probably won't see him (I mean, he's imprisoned under a huge amount of rocks), but I don't think his story is over. I've already posted my theory, but I think we'll get to see his children.\n\nThe seer said he had to watch over Syndra in order for his kids to live a long life, even if it meant never seeing them again. My theory is that in order for his children to keep living, Syndra had to be freed at this exact time. Kalan won't even see his children again, as he's trapped in the dreaming pool, but I think somehow Syndra has something to do with his kids' survival. \nI really hope we'll get something about Syndra next year (even though I doubt it). Just to see if my theory's valid (even partially).\n\nBut yeah, great story :p\n\n{{sticker:sg-syndra}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lewanor","date":"2018-12-16T20:34:38.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you liked it, I'm still waiting for my boy Talon :( \n\nDunno about his kids but he sacrifes himself without a second thought for his children.

She's human so a well-aimed bullet can kill her, unlike Xerath for example, she's not invincible :p\n\nNow, this story was just the beginning of her journey. She has a lot of room to evolve and learn. I think she's a really interesting character that could fit not only in the Ionian plot, but in many plots (though that is unlikely). Her being the most powerful (in term of raw power) human would be wasted if she's just here to shake things up in Ionia. I really can't wait to see more!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
