Ghostcrawler said &#039;&#039;multiple releases each month&#039;&#039;. Is this a dream or reality? Will there be months that we won&#039;t get a comic or a month we will get 2-3-4 comics? If we get a comic each month... It sounds unbelievablely good. Too good to be true exact. If this is right exactly, will we have like 20 comics at the end of the year at universe? Which both tells origin stories and makes the lore go forward?\r\n\r\n2.  And did you set a point where you check regularly and see if the comic thing was a failure(I alone will work to prevent this if there is such thing) and stop doing it? \r\n\r\n3. I know the answer but even if I buy the digital version i will still have to buy the pyhsical one right? I hope there is a store in EU so I don&#039;t have to pay +10$ for shipping like i have to do with Blizzard...","replies":[{"poster":"ChunLii","date":"2018-12-05T02:56:42.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyhey your avid comic book reader here. I’ll try to answer the best I can\n\n1. A comic? No they are looking to release multiple comics in one month. Think maybe 4 comics a month with continuation the next month or various one shots. It will properly show up as part of Marvel soliticitations. Here is Marvel’s Feburary solicitations to give you a feel of what it’s like. https://www.newsarama.com/42800-marvel-comics-february-2019-solicitations.html If you ctrl F Star Wars you can see different comics being released for the Star Wars universe. It’s not just about comics happening in the Marvel Universe but any comic Marvel publishes as a whole. Although this is not happening for League in 2019 as every comic will be free and is digital first release only. However, this is their final goal that each month there will also be a physical copy coming out that you can buy.\n\n2. Really not sure what would be considered a failure for League comics as it would have a different metric to their own comics. But IIRC if monthly comics sipped to under 20,000 units a month for DC and 15,000 for Marvel they would cancel it soon in the future. There is also sale of tradebacks and graphic novels that collects all the issues to consider so if a comic series is seeking really well in terms of a collected unit it would still be kept alive for a while. Here is the site you can check how much a comic sold per month http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2018/2018-10.html\n\n3. Yes but some comics have codes that if you buy their physical comic they will give a code to redeem it digitally as well. Personally, I’m a digital buyer most of the time unless I really really love a certain cover and need to have it physically. Or that it’s an important final issue of an event. I’ll like to buy it physical for the nostalgia.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-12-05T15:17:11.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the above!\n\nClarification on #1\nFirst year (2019) it will be one comic issue per month.\n2020 the goal is at least 2 per month— but ideally a new issue everyweek","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-12-05T15:36:09.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean the ashe comic will be the only one in 2019?
