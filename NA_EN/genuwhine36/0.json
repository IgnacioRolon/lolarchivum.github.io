So why even bother if the company doesnt?\r\n\r\nand because this yasuo didnt say a word in his game he wont get banned at all. flopped sums different champs played was silver now 60% win rate feeding hmm. Goes 0-6 and afk&#039;s for over 10 min as well.\r\n\r\nThe only reason this game so shit is because this fucker can waste 4 other peoples times and be a jackass WHILE being allowed to get away with it. Oh and if I DARE say something negative to the kid he could report me and I have a higher chance of being banned rofl. What an absolute joke.

Riot does not use posts to the forums as any evidence against players as its against the forum rules to post that information here (naming and shaming). Support tickets only help in cases where you have screenshot evidence and the game wasn't completed to my knowledg (for example if someone queue dodges). If you report them then they are much more likely to be punished if they are actually doing it and other people are reporting them for it as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Itankyou","date":"2016-08-20T02:03:18.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why was I banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-08-20T01:45:44.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People get banned all the time.

I hear and understand his frustration. What am I as a player supposed to do in the next year or longer that this lawsuit drags on, and what about all the other cheaters out there. \n\nAs an individual player it's getting harder and harder to simply enjoy playing the game.","replies":[]}]}
