Agree to disagree. That is my criteria and you can have you opinion because it's your right.\n\nAlso the system is such that if everyone honors then everyone gets a small bit of honor. If I have a good game and my team honors me but I feel nobody else is deserving for whatever reason then I don't honor anyone. I received honor that game and other people didn't. That is why this system is great and why I think overall play will improve over time because bad players are going to recognize that they are not moving up as fast as they could be if they would put in a little effort. There are rewards. We live in a society where material shit (virtual or otherwise) means things to people for whatever reason. I could care less but I know many do care. \n\nI never talked about flaming anyone, you assumed something that wasn't there. Bad players ruin games especially when they are level 30 and know nothing and never improve. They create a toxic atmosphere by their ignorance and cause people to tilt.

If these players would just look in the mirror they would see that maybe they are the reason they get flamed. A bad player with a brain would understand that and decide whether or not a MOBA is a game they should be playing in the first place or focus on improving their play.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-06T13:57:08.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's make it quick and simple: IT WILL NOT IMPROVE ANYTHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LOSE ANYTHING IF THEY ARE NOT HONORED.\n\n> And you fail to understand that the beauty of the system is It's your choice to honor or not according to your criteria. \n\nI agree with you.

First off, there is no visible indicator of progress, and Riot is hammering everywhere that you don't need to get Honored to climb, that just playing and keeping it quiet is enough, so they won't \"recognize\". Secondly, I repeat, you don't get anything special for grinding up to level 5, so even if they do recognize, they won't care. Thirdly, getting better at this game requires first and foremost consistency, so even if they do care, they won't stay motivated long enough for change to actually happen. Don't expect any improvement from Honor on that side of things.\n\n> I never talked about flaming anyone, you assumed something that wasn't there.\n\nI didn't assumed anything.

SOMEONE must be flaming, or it wouldn't be toxic. Maybe there is a trigger, and maybe that's bad players. But ultimately, they're not doing the flaming themselves.
