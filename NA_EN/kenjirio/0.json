I saw a post before that fixed when they made a thread about it so i&#039;m hoping it would do the same for me also. \n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: So so far nothing happened, the funny thing is on my profile it says i'm 18, but everything else (like if i hover over my name or look at the top right it says i'm 6) I just wanted to make a suggestion about about leaverbuster for matchmaking which i was going to post in Miscellaneous since there isn't a real suggestion sub board\n\nEDIT2: So it eventually updated, I guess a mod can close the thread, thanks again :)","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2015-05-08T22:51:37.242+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kenjirio,\n\nFor future reference, we update your level and other account info every time you vote, comment or post a discussion. If you find you cannot do any of those three things because the Boards think you are too low-level (or the automatic updating is not working) you can submit a Player Support ticket and they will get you fixed up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Beane","date":"2015-05-08T18:48:09.729+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Kenjirio,\n\nI myself had this problem on my old account before leaving ( land later returning to ) the league. In the end I had to contact a support agent by filing a ticket who fixed the issue two or so days later. You can contact a support agent by clicking [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) or by clicking the \"SUPPORT\" icon near the top-right corner of the page. I hope this advice helps you with your problem.\n\nBest regards,\nMr. Beane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cirno Strongest","date":"2015-05-08T18:41:14.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"heard from a red that the boards do not directly sync with the game servers","replies":[]}]}
