I posted it on LAN  because it s the server where I am accustomed to play in, so I got a PBE Account and then it got disabled. I donÂ´t know why because it wasn't an account which had innactivity. It's just exactly the opposite. I tested a lot of stuff DAILY so, I don't know why the \"ban\" or the reason why the account is disabled\r\n\r\nPS: Masha Nyasha is my Nickname at PBE. If possible I want help from a Riot guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-24T22:59:21.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that PBE account was relatively old or hadn't been used in awhile, there's a chance that it was disabled simply because it was inactive. Reach out to our account recovery agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to help you out.","replies":[]}]}
