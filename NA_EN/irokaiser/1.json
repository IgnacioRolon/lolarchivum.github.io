First one was Nasus. I was so used to playing morde that I of course was trash at him, but I had so much fun, but, because I was trash, i was soon back to playing morde every game. Then, at the end of 2017, a friend decide to give me some RP as a late christmas gift. I already had all the morde skins, so I was confused on what i should buy, so I decided to try some champs out before I got skins for them. I tried Yorick and Warwick, and I loved them. I bought a skin for each. I now am consistently playing both of those champs, and I take a look at Morde, and am finally forced to look at what he really is. He is a sad neglected old champ, left in the dust to rot, and I had chosen to rot along with him. sure, I had a decent winrate on him, because I could make up for his shortcomings with skill, but that would only take me so far.\r\n\r\nI still love the old scrap heap, but until he recieves some major love from Riot, i think it may be, for the first time in years, time to take a break from him.","replies":[]}
