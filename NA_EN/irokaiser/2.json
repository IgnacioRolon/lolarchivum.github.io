The only way I can describe this guys is that he is a disgusting person who does not deserve to play this game. As someone who has had far to many rages in game and is trying to get over it, I would like to say one thing.\r\n\r\n**There is no excuse.**\r\n\r\nthere&#039;s no excuse for us the players, and there is no excuse for Riot. We are both to blame, but starting with the players, \r\n\r\nNothing in this Earth could justify the kind of shit us league of legends players pull. Nothing in the damn universe could justify it. We have a reputation of toxic players for a reason, and the reason is us. I dont care if you personally don&#039;t flame or act toxic, but the majority does, and until we fix this, we are ALL to blame. Maybe you weren&#039;t outright toxic, but maybe you&#039;ve been purposefully inflamatory, or maybe you simply havent reported someone, even if it was a friend, when they really deserved it. We can do better. We should do better. I am to some extent ashamed to call myself a player of this game because of how terrible of a community we have. That shouldn&#039;t be the case. Ever.\r\n\r\nNow onto you Riot, now onto you. You have been terrible about dealing with your communities toxicity, claiming to care, and then not doing _shit._ Not only do you have a report sytems that is actively terrible, you also particiapte in blatant sexism. Discrimination against anyone is never, EVER ok.  You should feel ashamed of yourselves. We all should. \r\n\r\nNo more excuses\r\n\r\nNo matter who you are, no matter where you are from, whatever your background is, you are expected to offer other human beings a certain level of respect, and they are expected to do the same to you, but whether or not they do, that does not mean you can then act terrible yourself. There is no reason, EVER, to treat your fellow humans like shit. \r\n\r\nRant Over.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-10-12T05:06:59.788+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would love official stats on this claim of the \"majority of us are toxic\" because I really doubt 50% of the community is toxic.\n\nAs well as this claim of \"Riot not doing shit\". Don't get me wrong, they could do better; but that does not equate to not doing shit. If they weren't doing anything, then no one would be punished.\n\nThey made a mistake trying to over correct an issue that came up. It happens a lot in various ways. Discrimination isn't okay, then we shouldn't be allowed to ban any champions before a match. I realize that could be a long stretch, but the player is intentionally making sure a champ isn't allow to participate. Tsk tsk.\n\nDisagree. I will respect your position, but not you. If my boss is a dimwit, I will respect the fact they are my boss and not them specifically. I will respect the fact you are a fellow game player, but not you yourself. Personal level respect must be earned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olga Rajecka","date":"2018-10-12T00:54:21.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"If you remove toxicity, ranked ladder is dead period.","replies":[{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2018-10-12T14:42:05.748+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you remove toxicity, ranked ladder is cleansed period.","replies":[{"poster":"Olga Rajecka","date":"2018-10-13T02:07:07.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HommeGoujon,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pA4JNXgM,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-10-12T14:42:05.748+0000)\n>\n> If you remove toxicity, ranked ladder is cleansed period.\n\nCleansed from skill you mean.
