There were the requirements listed in your post, but I wanted to take a look at the applications themselves. I went to the application, but saw that you have to answer at least some of the questions to see the next ones. I simply want to know what the application questions are and if I can, know your standards for them so i need to to know if A: I already am up to the standards, or B: I need to improve myself in some way so in the future I can become a Moderator. \r\n{{sticker:garen-swing}}","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-12-01T18:08:54.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I would be happy to go over what we look for in moderators!\n\nTo answer your questions about the application itself, the main things we want to know from the initial application itself are:\n\n* Why do you want the position?\n* How active are you?\n* What would you do to help foster the community?\n* Do you have any experience being a moderator anywhere else?\n* Is there anywhere you believe the current moderators are coming up short?\n* And what challenges do you foresee if you become a moderator?\n\nNow, it is important to realize that these questions do not have specifically \"right\" and \"wrong\" answers. This is just to help us get an initial idea of who you are and why are you applying. The traits we most want to see in a moderator are:\n\n* History of frequent engagement and currently active on the Boards\n* Does not have an excessive history of breaking the Universal Rules or in-game punishments\n* Open to taking constructive direction in moderation and working collaboratively with Riot and other volunteers\n* Thick-skinned and the ability to detach personal feelings from moderation activities (stay calm and diplomatic in any situation)\n\nSo basically, we want you to care about the boards, be open minded, and mature. If you honestly believe that you would make a good moderator, please send in an application. Don't be too worried about little things. We recognize nobody is perfect and everyone makes mistakes, and that this includes moderators. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, the important thing we want is someone who is willing to admit and learn from their mistake.\n\n\nAs for if you already meet the standard, this would be decided later. After we receive the applications, the best applications will be selected to come in for interviews so we can get to know you a little more personally. Who is most qualified will be determined after these interviews.","replies":[{"poster":"Irokaiser","date":"2017-12-01T22:40:45.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by come in for an interview? If chosen for an interview will we personally meet with a riot employee, or discuss things with them in a chat room or such.

If you move on to the interview stage, you will join our discord server and have the choice between voice chat or text chat. There is no set amount of time you have to have played, but we prefer people who are experienced with the boards.

I dont personally feel ready to apply yet.  As a closing question, how often does Riot allow applications to be sent in? (How often are there openings for Moderators?) Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-12-02T00:54:36.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to help!\n\nAs for when the next chance will be, applications aren’t open at a set interval, but rather on an as-needed basis. Meaning applications will open again anytime we feel we need more mods. So I’m afraid I do not have an estimate of when that may be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T17:50:02.017+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, there are some good questions here but the current mods would be much better at discussing this than myself.
