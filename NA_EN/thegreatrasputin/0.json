This is I feel a reflection of his \"Birth of Tragedy\" days where he theorized about the Apollonian and Dionysian dichotomy.\n\n2) The other, is indeed, that there is a bit of self-destructive suffering and anxiety in transcending your limitations. Sort of like in Chuck Palahniuk's \"Diary\" (which is my favorite book of his and I probably associate them because I read him during my Nietzsche phase). Of course the role of suffering is discussed throughout the existentialism movement and so naturally permeates Nietzsche's work.\n\nI really can't wait for Noxus, it represents the aspects of European culture that are very dear to me, and of course the aesthetics appeal to my nostalgia a bit too much. Working on Swain (and the rest of his court) must be a treat.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-11-28T22:05:03.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no chance the rework is on the PBE before you guys go on holiday break is there?","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2017-11-28T22:56:48.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll put it this way.
