I've had more times than i can count where I engage and go into stealth just to immediately auto attack something and lose stealth. Even when mashing S it still is difficult to not auto attack","replies":[{"poster":"Dracocrash","date":"2019-08-09T21:49:35.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because the less viable akali is, the healthier it is for the game :S","replies":[]}]}
