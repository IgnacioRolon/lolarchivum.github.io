It does cost a lot of energy and that would be fine but because of the next point in a second. Also I feel her damage isn&#039;t spread out very well her e does next to no damage so maybe put some of the damage there?\r\n \r\n- W shouldn&#039;t restore energy or instantly at the very least.\r\n  Its a long cd which is fine but when she can just W to get enough energy to keep fighting? \r\n  She shouldn&#039;t be able to spam it on minions then when you go to fight her because she is low on energy she suddenly has enough to fight\r\n\r\n- Passive gives too little energy probably because of W\r\n- 2 basic abilities that completely disengage most melee champs is kinda ridiculous.  If it was possible i would take the E dash away so if her w is down you can actually fight her like old Akali\r\n (side note her q slow also makes it difficult to get to her but she can miss it so i didn&#039;t put it)\r\n- Q Healing reduced on minions\r\n- Something about her ult bothers me but im not entirely sure what it is i don&#039;t really care about the damage so idk.\r\nHere are just some of the things i was thinking. I&#039;d like to hear your thoughts. I&#039;m open to discussion","replies":[]}
