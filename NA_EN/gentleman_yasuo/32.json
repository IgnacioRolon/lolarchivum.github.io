Transcendence requires you to build more than 30% CDR to get the damage. It's late game vs. early game, and some champions really don't need all that CDR. \n\nThat said, I'm absolutely going to be cheesing botlanes with Max CDR Bruiser Kai'Sa. That'll be hilarious. \n\nFleet Footwork + (Triumph, Legend: Alacrity, Last Stand) + (Transcendence, Gathering Storm), rushing Spear of Shojin, then into Black Cleaver, Death's Dance, Guinsoo's, Nashor's Tooth. Bruiser Kai'Sa. All abilities evolved, Transcendence alone giving me 54 AD (72 AD with Ionian Booties). If I can grab a blue buff, that blue buff would give me 18 AD. \n\nEngage with ult, activate Awakened Dragon, and spam out Q's and autos, with the shield, extra health, Triumph, and Death's Dance to keep me alive. It'll be lit. Maybe finish with a Bloodthirster, just for fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-04-20T05:01:10.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inspiration runes (i.e., utility runes) are becoming the standard pick for secondary runes because of how much value they provide. They want people to take other things than Inspiration secondary because free boots and biscuits are non-interactive. \n\nThey're not buffing damage runes specifically, they're just buffing non-Inspiration minor runes across the board while nerfing Magical Footwear, and it just so happens that most non-Inspiration runes are damage runes, lmao. \n\nBone Plating, Conditioning, Celerity, Taste of Blood, Ultimate Hunter, and Relentless Hunter are also getting buffed.","replies":[]}]}
