We recently performed our set in front of hundreds of people at our end-of-the-year showcase, and I thought I would share it here as well!\n\nOur choreography isn&#039;t America&#039;s Best Dance Crew level by any means, but it was really fun to work with these enthusiastic dancers and put together something fun that I hope you all will enjoy :) See if you can spot the little LoL references within the pieces!","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-05-11T20:06:08.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That looks like all kinds of fun :D  Particularly amused by 'Ezreal's attitude, and it's _always_ nice to hear Sona.  \nCongratulations to every one of you - it looks like a lot of hard work!","replies":[{"poster":"HelloKittyKim","date":"2015-05-12T09:59:58.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the kind words! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
