I can, and have successfully changed my password using the email account I used to create the league account in question. However, when I try to log in it gives me the error wrong account name, password, or region. As I can't log into the account to check up on my ticket, how do I know it has been successfully submitted or has been responded to? Will future replies from support be purely back and forth through my email? Looking for resolution.. thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-27T01:56:28.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! I see that ticket in the queue and someone should be answering relatively soon. Even if you can't sign back into the account, you'll still get an email response from the ticket as well that you can check for!","replies":[{"poster":"NerdTears","date":"2017-06-27T03:01:31.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I appreciate the quick response.
