The \"morality police\" i.e. the community don't want to listen to you and some other kid bitching at each other.  That's why you were reported.  Recognize that other people are playing the game, or just do a duo queue and play custom games if you don't want other people's opinions in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-06T18:48:06.104+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"You failed to miss the point, which means you hit it XD","replies":[{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2016-01-06T21:19:50.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^this","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AraMoOse","date":"2016-01-06T19:17:58.270+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fahersom,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vniQbtON,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-06T18:41:36.791+0000)\n>\n> You fail to miss the point.

Don't do no double negatives.\n2. If it looks like I'm stealing something, I shouldn't be surprised that people think I'm stealing. If it looks like you're trash talking someone, you should expect people to assume you're trash talking someone.\n3. Regardless of who you  were talking to, some people in your game decided what you had said was unacceptable. It  is their right to think so, and their right to report it. You should take this as a message that \"while I think this is ok, it bothers people and I should stop out of respect for other humans\"\n4. It's not like it takes only 1 infraction to receive punishment. If you reached the point where disciplinary measures had to be taken, that means you've been getting reported in MANY other games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tru3che","date":"2016-01-07T02:01:14.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being toxic, even in a joking manner, to someone can cause the rest of your team to tilt if there is any misunderstanding that you are joking and/or know the person.

Similarly, what you say into team or all chat is absolutely the business of the other people in your team or game (respectively) - for exactly as long as you're sharing the game.\n\nIf you want to insult your buddy, feel free to say it out loud. Or use a voice program. Or even use a private message to him through the client (they aren't checked by the system, because they aren't part of the game chat). To put that another way, if you want them to stay out of your business, it would be in your best interest to not shove your business in their face.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Top Lane Terry","date":"2016-01-07T19:21:06.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">gets banned for a good reason\n\n\"fix your system riot\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-01-07T02:20:33.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to make it known your in a duo and are having fun, otherwise it looks like bullying or flaming or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shyv","date":"2016-01-06T21:20:31.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean i agree that jokingly flaming your friends is fine (we do it all the time too, no hurt feelings, nobody takes it seriously) but i'm sure you can understand why you were reported. unless you make it clear that you're friends joking around you just look like an asshole","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sythriel Draken","date":"2016-01-06T21:25:36.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Welcome to riots policy on ban first, ask questions later.

I made a mistake with the \"fail to miss the point\". Egg on my face. It was early in the morning, ok?  Secondly, as for the rioter response; BS. I don't randomly call people Salvadorian pricks. I looked at my reform card.  One game was trash talk back and forth between me and the enemy team; if saying \"mad cuz bad\" sarcastically and telling twitch to stop crying in all is really soooooooo terrible, your priorities are out of sorts. I frequently use my friends name- which, of the three games on my reform card, only one was with him in the room, and it was the one I talked to him the least in. As for skype, he refuses to buy a mic- and call him a Salvadorian prick (ooooooh how sinister), and this shows that we know each other. He doesn't give a damn, so why should anyone else? And one game I was ABSOLUTELY toxic in; i deserve to be punished for that one, as I will begrudgingly admit that I agreed to the Summoner's Code or whatever. However, one game of me demanding someone stop being a twat and afking in base is actually my exact point in this. I'm being punished for doing something that is currently happening in this very thread; trash talk. Its harmless. Im not butthurt because people pointed out flaws in my english, or put smite icons in response to a rioter calling me out. But where is the system here? What if I were one of the people who reported me? This forum is toxic in response to me questioning my own toxicity. People literally frequent this forum just to call people out. The system is twisted, and backwards, and is a good representation that Riot is creating a breed of pussies who will instantly jump to the report button in game and then turn into self-righteous jackasses the second they are elsewhere. \"constantly harassing\" as people fire back in the forums.
