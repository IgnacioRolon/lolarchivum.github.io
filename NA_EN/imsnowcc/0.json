The game was low elo and I could handle it well, but not my girl. She was a new player who had just played a few games for months. Yet the Thresh player (ID: **<removed by moderation>**) assaulted her as a girl player with extremely hurtful words. It all started from the champ select phase, my girl friend called sup as her role and locked in Miss Fortune, while **<removed by moderation>** just auto locked in as a Thresh sup. She was confused but also decided to play with it, even though she had never played adc before. Then, this Thresh started his verbal attack which continued for 20 min long. My girlfriend tried to explain she was a new player and never played adc, yet it only made it worse. **<removed by moderation>** started to harass her as a girl player with unbelievable salty words. My girl, thus, left the game, and I could not see any reason to keep playing with players who didn&#039;t know what is respect. This is what happened in that game. I thought League of Legends should be a game for everyone, no matter for trying hard or just for fun, but there are always players assault others and ruin the game. They also said they gonna report us for afk, but tell me, my dear beloved LOL COMMUNITYk, were we really more deserved to be punished rather those disrespectful players? What would you do if you were in my case? I wish RIOT could punish harassment hard, even harder than afk if the case is just like what I&#039;ve been through.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-12-23T06:56:22.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I removed the name and match history from your post, as we do not allow naming and shaming on the boards.

I don't condone flaming or toxicity, but \"for 20 min long\" you never once told your girl to mute him?  What would I do?  I would have told my girl friend to mute the tresh as well as mute him myself.  I would not go into Blind Pick (from the \"called sup\" context) with a level 59 player who obviously can play Normal Draft.\n\nLeaveBuster is an automate system.  Both of you will get dinged whether they reported you or not.  Tell me, do you deserved to be punished for leaving the other 2 teammates who did you no wrong in a 3v5 game because of one toxic player you both can easily mute?  Two wrongs do not make a right.  The other 2 teammate(s) likely already muted the tresh if he \"continued for 20 min long\", but now they get punished on top by having you two afk'd leaving them 3v5.  Do they not deserved some kind of justice?  Can they not asked for the two of you to be punished harder for making the game horrible for them?  What about the other 2 teammate(s) just been through a 3v5 game when they also can mute the toxic tresh?\n\nIn no way am I saying the tresh didn't deserved to be punished, but \"he did it first\" is not an excuse to become toxic yourself (going afk is toxic).  Mute the player should be your first go to action (you being a level 191 player should know this) so there's no reason for the verbal attack to \"continued for 20 min long\" since you cannot see what he is typing.  Ping/emote mute too.\n\np.s. - there is no naming and shaming on this board so you might want to delete the bolded player name before mods have to do it for you.\n\np.s.s. - Looking at your girl friend match histories.  \"She\" seems to be awfully good when playing flex ranked for an Iron tier player against plat/diamond in jungle role, which she doesn't play normally.  Also she always has her Flash on F key when playing support at Iron tier level of performance, but she did extremely well (almost diamond tier level of performance) whenever \"she\" switched to her Flash on D key.\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=cindyss\n\nVery curious..... Where's the justice for those enemy players whose games were grossly unfair when your girl friend magically became diamond-tier level of performance in low tier games?  Where's the respect for fairness of those low tier games?","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-23T02:05:58.801+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are both in the wrong, as is the player who flamed your friend.\n\nFlaming is not okay and is punished.
