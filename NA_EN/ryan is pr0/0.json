If you notice, they will put their little notes during the loading screen that says don't be a leaver... And then that game you will get dropped.  People that work for riot have the ability to watch your game and drop you at oppotune moments... Its not a coincidence, and they will deny it up and down.  The game is designed for control of you.","replies":[{"poster":"XMythrandiaX","date":"2018-02-25T21:36:22.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course there are automated accounts...Chinese Farmers that run the hacks into their code, but it is also people who work for riot, getting money on the side to do this.","replies":[{"poster":"XMythrandiaX","date":"2018-02-25T21:38:45.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Billion Dollar industry... and the money isn't even the best part for them.. Its the control, and the subliminal Champion names, to extract information from your brain also...  The Chinese are masters at hacking and the brain is just a computer, and now that everyone have a wireless device on them at all times...  scary times approach this planet.  The truth is stranger than fiction my friends.

I don't know about a drop hack, as they're an extremely rare situation that comes up.\n\nLet me know if you have any further issues with this.","replies":[]}]}
