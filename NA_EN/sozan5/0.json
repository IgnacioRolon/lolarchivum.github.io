Recently however, the queues got LONG. Like, above 10 minutes at minimum. I'm waiting in a queue while writing this as a matter of fact.\r\n\r\nSo, firstly - I would love to know if anyone else has the issues with long queues in blind pick (preferably on EUNE).\r\n\r\nAnd secondly - I would appreciate any response from Rito (as to why the queues are so long and if you are planning to do anything with them - or maybe even check if it's a problem with my account).\r\n\r\nHere's a queue I was sitting in today (it found game shortly after):\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/0u4fG\r\n\r\nAnd this is the queue I am sitting in right now:\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/UvRsJ\r\n\r\nI find it to be very significant and it only gets worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T23:05:20.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There a number of factors that determine how long your queue times will be, however, the most impactful are your matchmaking rating (Elo) and the time of day you're playing. If you're at the extreme spectrums of matchmaking rating, it will take longer to find players that are a fair match for you. Additionally, if you're playing during a time when players at your skill level aren't as active, it will also affect your queue time.
