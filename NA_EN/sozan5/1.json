I'm sorry, but if Oracles were made any less effective Teemo would become a pick-ban because his Shrooms already offers little counterplay, and the moment one of your squishies step on one they have to back.

There are five traps in the game, and the ones with issues should be solved by adding more counterplay directly to them, not by allowing a cheap item to hard-counter them. This is precisely the kind of situation Riot was trying to avoid when they reworked stealth and prevented Control Wards from disabling short-term invisibility.\n\nThere are currently two types of traps: invisible traps, namely Teemo's, Shaco's and Jhin's, and visible traps, namely Caitlyn's and Nidalee's. Out of the three different invisible traps, Jhin's set a good model for the rest: they don't deal initial damage, offer the player time to react and avoid said damage, and can be detonated \"safely\" by stepping on them and retreating if you know exactly where they are. Captive Audience already has a ton of counterplay without the need to be disabled by another item. That same model could easily be ported to Shaco's Jack In The Box, since those things usually wind up before popping out and scaring people, though he likely deserves much more than just that change, including buffs to his AD playstyle. For Teemo, you could also implement the same counterplay by, say, having mushrooms jump into the air before detonating, which would give a warning without disrupting his waveclear too hard. Honestly, both Teemo and Shaco need larger-scale reworks farther down the line, and those reworks should improve the counterplay to their traps.\n\nAs for visible traps, I think the best solution might just be to give them a set amount of health, or have minions set them off (or both, though Nidalee's traps already detonate on minions). It's silly for Caitlyn to lay down a bunch of traps directly under your tower without you being able to do anything about it, and the solution shouldn't be to buy an item specifically to turn them off. Basically, if traps need additional counterplay, that should be implemented directly onto the traps themselves, not through an exceedingly niche hard-counter effect tacked onto vision denial.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-12-05T01:54:46.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what exactly is the enemy team supposed to do now that 4 of them can't put down wards?","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2016-12-03T18:36:50.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a side note, its still not as bad as Oracles Elixer. 5 people have to be in the same spot and all use them in perfect sequence for an 83% uptime.

Putting shrooms around the Zz'rots would make for the most pleasant feeling as you get to waste their time and potentially get a kill.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen Teemo's go on-hit with frozen mallet, BoRK, etc, relying a lot less on shrooms and more on the fact that nobody can really tank them effectively.
