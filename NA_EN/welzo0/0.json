The ranked borders are for what you ended the season in, although there are a few things that could have disqualified you, as *Lew* mentioned, which I've listed below:\n\n>* **Players with bans or chat restrictions active when the season ends are ineligible for this year’s rewards.**\n* **Players issued a ban of seven days or more in the three months prior to the end of the season (from August 7 on) are ineligible for this year’s rewards.**\n* **Players banned for boosting during the 2016 season remain ineligible for rewards.**\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Welzo0","date":"2017-01-01T13:55:36.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend played on my account and got me a chat ban, will i get the rewards later or never?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-02T21:58:54.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of who incurred the ban, if the ban occurred within the boundaries listed above, the account would be ineligible for end-of-season rewards.\n\nIf you have any other questions about this, I recommend reaching out in a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Welzo0","date":"2017-01-04T11:26:29.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you for the help, btwhe played on my pc xD when he was at my house..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ad Vitam Aeterna","date":"2017-01-02T22:47:46.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't admit to that, think having others play on your account is considered punishable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-12-28T21:57:34.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few [reasons ](http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2016-ranked-season-ends-soon)that an account could be disqualified from getting ranked rewards.
