Even in matches over 20 minutes.\n\nAll surrender vote does is demotivate people, and makes people give up too early.\n\nIf games are basically over by 15 minutes, the meta is the issue (riot) or your team getting massively outplayed or outpicked, in whixh case theres still open mid, which people already do.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-11-24T02:40:31.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be down with a forced minimum threshold.

What?\n\nAlso, turrets have no impact on jungle. \n\nThe only thing turrets offer is a safe spot, vision, and a place to bounce minion waves off of. And gold not in the enemy's hands. \n\n_______________________\n\nThink about it this way: What's stopping me from invading your jungle if your turret is down? Nothing. What's stopping me from invading your jungle if your turret isn't down? Also nothing. Its your top/jungler/mid/bot. Their position farming on the map is the only relevance to this. \n\nIf you're down in turrets, it also means you have a much closer place to bounce minion waves off of and farm safer. The enemy does not get this luxury. They're forced to buy control wards to push up safely. The same for being down an inhibitor. That's extra gold/exp for the team that's -1 inhib, and it will ALWAYS be pushing into them hard, which means the enemy can't freeze it from you. \n\nThis is all assuming the game isn't a stomp, because in that case its the gold that's holding you back...not turrets. \n\nA lot of things that are seen as 'advantages' are actually disadvantageous as opposed to simply denying more exp/gold to the enemy team while absorbing more for yourself if you aren't far enough ahead to roll over them, or aren't taking other objectives off of it. This is provided your team is overall playing correctly in response to losing those objectives, also provided your team scales at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-11-24T03:10:09.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do turrets have to do with anything?\n\nWell, for starters, they're one of the things you *must* destroy to end the game...","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-11-24T03:40:02.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but 5 turrets is the difference between your nexus being completely exposed and still having all 3 inhib turrets. \n\nWhat benchmarks would you set for turrets?
