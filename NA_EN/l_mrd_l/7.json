TP has a much higher cool down, no combat advantage, and now that it cant be cancelled any more it's just not even worth taking. Why would i want to teleport to a fight and not be able to cancel it if the fight goes poorly? That's just another free kill for my opponent. In my opinion the biggest advantage to having TP was being able to dissuade your opponents from continuing a fight that was highly favorable for them by teleporting behind them and the cancelling last second.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAFFEN","date":"2019-01-06T15:53:45.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a nasus main, i win against most of my matchups, if enemy have ignite/conq or is a darius/teemo i just farm under turret the first 10min. eventually with like 200stacks ur able to do some dmg. once u reach like 350-400stacks noone can really 1v1 u (except its a fed vayne/yi) but overall i hate the ignite meta toplane, and i disrespect people who use it, lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"iDarkWind","date":"2019-01-06T14:55:04.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you manage well the minion wave I can't see you losing that bad as you say. Especially if you manage to get the wave to freeze closer to your turrent. Plus, Nasus has a decent sustain through his passive and a massive slow on his W to counter autoattackers such as Tryndamere.\n\nBy the way, Conqueror was created in first place because tanks wouldn't give two fvcks about his lane opponent, and with litlle game knowledge and litlle effort they would stall enough the lane until in the teamfights they would become very useful thanks to their natural kits full of CC and tankiness they provide.\nThe main problem on this community, far I can see, is that they really believe a tank should be able to make mistakes and left unpunished like it was back in the days, because they were a lot harder to kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CascadingDream","date":"2019-01-06T14:39:44.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who plays a lot of top lane (mostly {{champion:516}}  cause he's insane)(White Plasma for reference) as well as being in the same general mmr as OP, I can say that that matchup is definetly winnable and at the very least can be made even. It just takes a bit of brain and maybe some mechanics/champion knowledge. Not to say that you don't have those, or to say that I haven't probably lost that matchup before (tank vs conq-ignite) but I've also most certainly won it as well. \n\nPersonal experience may differ, but that doesn't mean that the possibility isn't there. Example: I used to LOATHE playing vs. {{champion:23}} because it never seemed winnable. Now it is. \n\nAll that to say...get good i guess? Not in the nagging or i guess elitist way, but if you have a friend that can play trynd, play the matchup in a custom.
