Because [Team Builder’s being taken down](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/new-champ-select-replaces-team-builder) when new champ select goes live, those icons will hit the ice box while we find a new home for them. They’ll come back in an earnable form, we just don’t have the details yet. \r\n\r\nThere’s also been a bug preventing the distribution of earned icons over the last two months. Luckily, we can still identify who’s earned the icons and plan on manually distributing all earned icons shortly after the Team Builder queue comes down. So grind out five games on each of the roles that you’d like the icon for before Team Builder comes down on 1/13.\r\n\r\nWe’ll update this thread when we have more details on icon distribution.

You're selecting primary and secondary roles, and you will get the primary more often.\n\nI may have claimed that it's a 50/50 split, but at least I did say that teambuilder GUARANTEES you your role. Okay, you did say we're gonna select between primary and secondary roles, and we will get the primary MORE OFTEN. This is where I think may be worrying to some players that only want to play a certain role and champion. What happens if we don't get the primary role? Because you did say 'MORE OFTEN' which means there may also be a possibility that you will not get that role.\n\nWhat happens if it's in ranked and there's 2 or 3 players that chose mid as their primary role?\n\nTeambuilder is a mode where at least it guarantees a specific role and champion 100% of the time. If it's an out of meta pick, one could just leave and find another team. Sure it might take long but that is the consequences of playing an out of meta pick right? And I for one wouldn't mind waiting just so I could get the exact role and champion that I want to play. \n\nI used to play only MID KATARINA in teambuilder. Nowadays I'm trying and messing out with other champions because I want to bring them to level 5 champion mastery. What if a player like me someday wants to go back to only playing ONE specific champion and role because they're so dedicated to them? I claimed that it was a 50/50 split because there's a primary and secondary role option. \n\nI still need to try the new champion select because I don't know how this thing works yet but I really do hope that you guys would leave teambuilder alone, because to some players this feature really means alot and... it just works. If it's not broken I think you guys should not try to fix it.\n\nThank you, if you do reply.","replies":[{"poster":"ReaganSMAAAAASH","date":"2016-01-09T20:11:29.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Pretty much spot on.

[Sarcastically] Think about an imaginary time when you would queue up into a game and everyone says MID OR FEED, or ADC OR FEED, or something strikingly similar.. Now we have a system were three or four people are going to queue the same primary roll (blame meta).\n\nDoing some quick, rudimentary number crunching in my head, having three people all queuing up for the same roll would equal, roughly 33%, with some change.. SO, how in the hell are you going to tell me that EVERYONE will get their primary roll more often? Oh, did we just design a queue system that gives everyone Mid, or everyone JG?

From my understanding, you will decide the roles you are interested in playing _before_ entering a champion select (like the current Team Builder), and the game will match you with people based on preferred roles (again like Team Builder). It would **assign** you a role, but it would be guaranteed to be one of the two you chose. \n\nHere's an example queue of what I understand it to look like:\nPlayer 1 wants to play top or jungle.\nPlayer 2 wants to play top or mid.\nPlayer 3 wants to play adc or fill.\nPlayer 4 wants to play adc or top.\nPlayer 5 wants to play top or jungle.\n\nThe game would look at these five players' role selections and throw them into a lobby, assigning Player 1 to jungle, Player 2 to mid, Player 3 to support, Player 4 to adc, and Player 5 to top. Everybody gets a lane they want to play, and nobody suffers. \n\nAgain, this is just what I understood when I heard of this new champ select. The whole point of it is to be like a crossover between normal draft pick and team builder, taking the positive aspects of each to make the best possible champion select.\n\nRioters, am I right in this understanding?","replies":[{"poster":"Tuben Tubaralho","date":"2016-01-10T14:44:52.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Here's an example queue of what I understand it to look like:\n> Player 1 wants to play top or jungle.\n> Player 2 wants to play top or mid.\n> Player 3 wants to play adc or fill.\n> Player 4 wants to play adc or top.\n> Player 5 wants to play top or jungle.\n> \n> The game would look at these five players' role selections and throw them into a lobby, assigning Player 1 to jungle, Player 2 to mid, Player 3 to support, Player 4 to adc, and Player 5 to top.

I have one (two including this one) post ever on Riot forum boards and I have been playing for two years. Guess what bud? That is PLENTY of time to make objective observations. Go back and read what I originally said. Not once did I blame Riot for anything other than disregarding what appears to be a majority of people who want and/or like something and don't want to see it go away.\n\nTo address your second part, Team Builder, and UNTIL they release numbers that prove otherwise, is not a queue that is in a declining minority. I have never waited more than a few minutes for a game, and I have rarely played with people I have recognized from games in the past. Also, I imagine if you go back through posts regarding Riot removing the queue, you will find more people upset about it versus people who want it gone or don't care.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, it comes down to this: there is absolutely no reason to even get rid of it in the first place.\n\nAlso, because these things seem to be soooooo important to you: ATT.

We want to let other teams do their work when we can, but if it's causing pain for you or any other player then sometimes we just need to step on some toes to get things done. :P\n\n>Best regards!\n\n>Agent Spoopy\n>Player Behavior & Game Support\n>Candy Collector ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ\n\nSo, to anyone who has not yet received their icons, you might just be able to get your icons.\n\nI'd advise people to send a ticket with any information you may have on the subject, or to be patient for whenever Riot ever decides to award them.\n\nFor myself, a glimmer of faith and hope has been restored.","replies":[]}]}]}
