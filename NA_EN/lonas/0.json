Bizarre visual bug making the game unplayable.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not entirely sure how to describe it so https://youtu.be/KcRKcqnB47E\r\n\r\nThis only happens in fullscreen mode. Borderless works fine but has increased input lag so I'd prefer to figure out how to fix it.

No idea how to fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T23:00:27.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH O_O! Yea that's definitely awkward to try and play with I bet! It looks to me like some of those game texture files are damaged or missing. I'd try running a quick repair and testing it again.","replies":[]}]}
