No worries though, I've got a couple options to get you on the best server for you to play on!\n\nSince you just now created this account, if you haven't spent any money (meaning there's nothing to lose) you're more than welcome to go ahead and create a new account on the server you want to be on. It's also worth noting that each region has it's own list of available Summoner Names, so you can have a NEOXblackgold on NA and EUW/EUN for example. I'm willing to bet you'll be able to get that name on another region as well as NA!\n\nIf you're already pretty attached to this account, I'd suggest going ahead and reaching out to our accounts team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). There might still be a chance for us to move your account where you need to be to play the best.","replies":[{"poster":"88032297DEL1","date":"2017-07-09T01:27:01.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you very much for the quick reply, it did work, I succesfully made a new account :)\n\nI guess I'll have to delete this one now, I was only attached to the name, I'm a very forgetful person :/\n\nthank you for the support :D","replies":[]}]}]}
