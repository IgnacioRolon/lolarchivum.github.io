OH! I was gonna say that you're crazy and there is no bug here, but I wasn't looking close enough at what you actually  posted! You're saying that the rank 1 damage stayed the same (no issues there), but the tooltip for rank 5 damage (200) was correctly updated, while the tooltip for ranks 2/3/4 were NOT updated to the new values! Seems like a valid bug, upvote this post.\n\nHowever, you should put [GAMEPLAY] in the name of this thread... I think Riot ignores any threads that don't have [GAMEPLAY], [CLIENT], or [CRASH] in their name...","replies":[{"poster":"hibernis","date":"2015-04-19T18:52:18.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your comment.
