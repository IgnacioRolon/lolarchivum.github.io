Doing so will make sure that everything is up to date and have necessary products to proceed with the install.  Also, your issue may not necessarily with Visual C++ unless the error specifically says that.  Let me know if you have a different error.","replies":[{"poster":"Lego Quinn","date":"2016-12-22T21:52:29.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a simular error but when i try to install the game it stops working at about 60% ive already gotten in contact with a riot player support memeber but i havent heard back from them in almost 24 hours now. the riot member told me to make sure i had 8 gb of space free for the download so i checked my storage and made sure i had enough space and i did. i stil have this problem and i hope someone can understand and help me out <3.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T22:20:43.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At 60%, your patcher is communicating with the patching servers to download updates.  You can end up with an unspecified error if your connection is too weak to pull those updates.
