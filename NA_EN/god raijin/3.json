Hes strong early, mid, and while his burst damage falls off late game he gets tankier and more dps with stuff like PD and life steal to make up for it, basically making him strong in all stages of the game and good at almost everything. His blind is OP AF which is almost as good having CC. He stays super healthy in the jungle by kiting and can 1 v 1 almost any jungler. He also has a high ban rate and is highly contested even in challenger. \n\nNow I&#039;m not saying he&#039;s OP (he is) but For those who would say he isn&#039;t; How Is he not? and how does he constantly slip by not being nerfed? \n\nNow if you are a graves main, don&#039;t get offended and downvote this to shit, because if I asked you why you play him, the answer would probably be everything I stated in the first paragraph.\n\nOk ranting aside, the ONLY downside I can possibly see about him is that he doesnt have a true Hard CC, but any of your other teammates can make up for it for you {{champion:111}} etc and then you are just peachy in every way possible.","replies":[{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2016-09-20T17:30:04.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can't spam abilities without blue buff, low range, low DPS, because of the ammo system, no hard CC.\nArmor is great vs him, because most of his dmg is burst from the Q + R, but noone buys armor, right...\nIf Jhin was slightly more tankier, he could jungle with no problems and be the same menace.\nThere is no healing in his kit, many champions are too strong, because the masteries are OP.","replies":[{"poster":"HÃ¥ppy","date":"2016-09-20T17:56:16.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ammo system is nulled when you get a phantom dancer and a youmuu's active, consider that he'll be up in your face with Quickdraw, building a bit of HP and getting tanky stats from his True Grit dealing extra damage to you because it's a shotgun, he isn't attacking quite as fast as someone like Ashe or Vayne but he does 2-3 of their auto attacks in one blast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"God Raijin","date":"2016-09-20T20:47:21.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but all things considered, he does get the blue buff early (not that he needs it to kite camps) and can clear fine late just with autos. His Dps is lower but he does more per auto. and if you consider him more of a bruiser, then he is just a bruiser that gets 300ish more range than other bruisers.  Also, obviously you can get warlord's bloodlust right off the bat (particularly top lane graves) which I feel basically lets you **choose** to add LS into his kit since you get it at the start of the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-09-20T09:21:01.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They make kits \"unreliable\" so they can give them dumb numbers. In his case it's that his shots can be blocked, like that one video where he can't kill a 100 health Viktor for a straight 20 seconds because he keeps getting body blocked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"planters","date":"2016-09-21T00:55:59.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they actually have a nerf to his defensive bonus on pbe right now...","replies":[{"poster":"God Raijin","date":"2016-09-21T01:28:13.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, Ive been saying they should lower it for a while, I can't believe they are actually doing it","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2016-09-23T00:51:36.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can its stupidly high for no good reason.  For all the damage he had the first nerfs he should have had were to his tankiness imo.  My only problem is that I think they are gonna balance him too heavily on defensives and not enough on damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T07:53:57.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a large reason why is the fact that the mechanics that are used in him is just a more difficult thing to balance, more or less it's a player efficient type of thing when playing graves, not exactly sure how i can explain that in great detail without being confusing. His kit would be a hard to balance type of thing because each of his 3 shots per one auto have their own damage which can add up. Also more or less, you can just walk out of his W or side step it easily.\n\nI think if they were to try and nerf... maybe make it where minions aren't pushed back anymore... or just take the grit off his E so he cant become that tanky while fighting someone. As far as everything else seems to be going i think it's more of the items that make him stronger than normal. he basically builds every damage reduction item so he can end up beefy in fights along with getting flat pen.","replies":[{"poster":"God Raijin","date":"2016-09-20T07:59:20.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, I mostly just like the idea of lowering the scaling on his armor/mr on his dash personally. I feel like he would become less of a stat check while hes drain tanking kids. maybe like 90armor/Mr at max rank rather than 120 (at max stacks) also making his late game worse would make sense as him being strong early and mid game rather than all stages","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T19:44:11.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would make sense, but you have to remember, even though he's played in the jungle... he's still an adc. you can't drop his damage too far off just because people decided to move him elsewhere and give him a finicky build, the armor/mr capping at 90, i 100% agree on though.","replies":[{"poster":"God Raijin","date":"2016-09-20T21:23:05.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I mean, it really would make no sense to nerf his damage because then, it would just make him bad at doing what he was intended to do, What i meant by late game scaling was just in terms of tankiness.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zbeater","date":"2016-09-20T08:43:41.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"They nerfed the crap outta him they took his cigar","replies":[{"poster":"xBushx","date":"2016-09-20T13:55:25.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He vapes bro and shit is cannon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lirik","date":"2016-09-20T14:02:28.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol riot is on the auto-destruction track and its going fast","replies":[]}]}
