Now with that out of the way; I&#039;ve reported some serious bad-eggs before, received messages saying that a player I reported has been punished. However, I&#039;ve literally never seen someone have any back-lash for leaving a game, rage quitting etc and it made me think &quot;Why is that?&quot;\r\n\r\nHonestly, in my opinion, leaving a game is the worst thing you can do aside from running into the tower and feeding type thing. Think about it, someone can talk shit in chat all they want, you can mute them, and you can still win/play the game, but if someone leaves, its a 99.9% chance loss. 4 players lose the game, and the other 5 players are denied satisfaction that they won fair and square.\r\n\r\nSo, why are leavers so easily forgiven? Well it got me thinking; It&#039;s all about plausible deniability. I mean, think about it: real life happens. Sometimes you get DC&#039;d and can&#039;t reconnect, the power goes out, someone shows up at your house unannounced, your cats on fire. So when a player leaves, the leave is taken as &quot;the player had no choice but to leave&quot;: We don&#039;t know the reason WHY they left, but we&#039;ve got to give them the benefit of the doubt. Innocent until proven guilty right?\r\n\r\n&quot;We here at Riot don&#039;t want to be the bad guys and demonize or punish our loyal players when the situation was out of their hands, so, feel free to leave the game whenever you don&#039;t feel like playing anymore. As long as you don&#039;t leave too many in a row or &#039;2 many/10&#039;- we totally understand.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo my issue is this; I&#039;m going to give a scenario: let&#039;s say league had a total player base of 10 players, so every game of league had the same 10 people playing each match. IF a player could leave once every 50 games without a punishment, that would seem pretty reasonable right? But now what if EACH of the 10 players took that liberty to leave one in 50 games. We&#039;ll say that 50 total games were played and each player took their one liberty to leave one game each. 10/50 (or 20%) those games would be 4v5&#039;s.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know about you, but having 20% of games be 4 v 5&#039;s seems pretty damn high to me. I&#039;m NOT saying that&#039;s what the leave rate ACTUALLY IS. (I&#039;m sure it&#039;s lower than that for ranked at least.) But I&#039;m saying: even allowing players to leave as often as 1 in 50 games could potentially make that the case (it&#039;s sure felt like that to me in my recent games lol) Especially for normal games because players KNOW they can get away with leaving, and it&#039;s not like they are losing LP, so who the fuck cares right?\r\n\r\nTo sum up: Can something be done about leavers? Or can their be something to promote people not leaving games: rewards etc? Maybe a badge or something like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;[{V}]&gt; Virtuous Badge: This player has played 50 games in a row without leaving and receives: 10% increased IP and 10% increased Key fragment drop rate.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that would have to be done is if Riot could make a system that &quot;Shows them&quot; if you are trying to reconnect to a game when the problem is on their part.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-19T18:44:51.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Took me just 4 dc's in a row to get a leave buster, and that was at a bots match.","replies":[{"poster":"God Raijin","date":"2017-03-19T18:57:31.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That should probably be changed, because in bots matches it will remove one of the bots (sends them to fountain) if someone on your team DC's, which makes the game still fine for the other players on your team.

You dont want to flat out ban these people (as that would be the only other punished we can give them) because too many people would be innocently ban. Then of course you seem to be under the impression that is only reason people leave is of a fault of their own. Riot has been known to have messed up servers. We have bugsplat errors, people cannot connect into their games. Why should someone get punished when they were not the reason for leaving? At least when someone leaves on their own, they know why they left and accept the consequences of leaving. Whereas if the fault isnt on you, why should you accept it?","replies":[{"poster":"God Raijin","date":"2017-03-19T18:14:47.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as Riot goes, It would be their responsibility to know not punish you when it's on their part, I mean, when their servers go down they typically give a loss forgiven type thing.

I think it makes more sense to incentivize players to stay in game rather than possibly punish people who didn't really deserve it. \n\nBut to answer you question: \"why should we reward people for playing a game the willing opted into playing?\"\n\nIt's no different than a perfect attendance award at school or (maybe) work. I think every school or employer knows that their students/employees aren't going to come in every single day for one reason or another. Just like how most players aren't going to stay in every single game they play even if they only leave 1/300 games. \n\nSo for those with excellent \"attendance\" in games it would make sense to give them something extra","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-19T22:43:47.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct me if Im wrong\nyou get ip for staying in games\nand no ip for leaving(unless in the last 6 seconds )\nPersonal experience may not be true for everyone\nIn my league career  outside of season 1 when my internet was buggy\nI've never left a game.

It's not like they are deep into the game yet to begin with; I mean, how much IP do you really get for playing 9 minutes worth? like 20ish? throwing away that 20 ip that they have earned up to that point isn't really much of a loss. \n\nAlso the person leaving thinks that they are going to lose that game anyway; In their mind they wouldn't be getting a key whether they quit or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-20T03:57:00.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell me how the difference appears?\nBetween dcing because rage quit and dcing due to some unforseen circumstance?\nIn both cases a user left game\n\n\"Leavers are quite common\"\nIN my view leavers are almost nonexistent\nSo we're disagreeing about views\n\n\"So since they can't tell who is a RQ'r and who had a good reason for leaving.\"\n\nRight here\nIncentives are you don't get LPQ and potential punishment for leaving games\nthat is a huge + \n\n\nMy question to you is still the same\n\"So since they can't tell who is a RQ'r and who had a good reason for leaving.

Especially if you have opted into games OVER AND OVER and never left one of them. YES, yes you should get rewarded. \n\nIt's like how stores have point cards for being loyal customers, if you get enough points you get rewarded. If you **don't** shop there commonly, your point card will never get filled out and expire as well. \n\nThe IDEA here would be to reward players for **consistency**, not JUST for the half of random individual games that they didn't decide to leave.\n\nI mean think about this, If you have a job in real life , yes you get rewarded for coming in each day and doing your job (paycheck) and if you skip work too often you get fired (leaver buster) but if you are a vigilant employee, don't skip work and do a decent job you get **promoted **\n\nYou see even, in real life people actually do get rewarded for their consistency. It just makes sense that: \n\n1. The common leavers get banned \n2. The occasional  leavers get smaller rewards\n3. The consistent players get bigger rewards \n\nSo im asking you this: hypothetically, If you had a $100 dollar bill, a $50 and a $1. and you **HAD** to give a bill to each player, the common leaver, the occasional leaver and the consistent player, who would deserve the $100? the $50? the $1?","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-21T18:27:49.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fine lets give everyone a point card system\nLets call it IP\nif you stay in the game you get IP\nnow if you leave the game you don't get IP\nIf you collect enough of this IP\nyou can purchase from the company store\n\nEven in a job setting you can be passed over for promotions regardless of it you did a decent job and showed up 24/7\n\n\nTo respond to your hypothetical\nNone, why are you paying users to play riots game......","replies":[{"poster":"God Raijin","date":"2017-03-21T20:03:57.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"none\" wasn't an option in the hypothetical question.

Sure we already get IP, but you know what?
