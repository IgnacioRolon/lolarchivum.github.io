This made the game a 4v5 which we easily would have won had it been a a 5v5. Losing that game was quite frustrating, could you look into it?

I was wondering if you could look into this very similar connection bug that's happening. Basically in the loading screen it states there is 0 ping and 0% for everyone. (The blue loading gif still works though.) Then after a long time of being like that everyone suddenly starts loading rapidly. I thought everyone was seeing the same thing but I was recently let known that it's just me.\n\nI made a thread about it here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/sPjI2En5-0-ping-with-0-on-everyone-in-loading-screen and also found an old thread about it a few months ago through google: https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-reports-eu/zcfgpbi0-0-ping-at-loading-screen-and-0-for-everyone-and-then-dc\n\nGame link if you need it: https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2805101981/201696587?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-13T21:39:50.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looked at logs of that game and didn't see anything out of the ordinary.

The bug is something new and was not present before patch 8.11. During the beginning of patch 8.11 my games constantly crashed at the start whenever this happened, my original post on this matter was addressing one of such crashes. After a week or so into patch 8.11 the crashes stopped but the symptoms the patch had brought were not gone. This is why I fear it's a bug that was only partially crushed. From what I have experienced so far the waiting time increased drastically after patch 8.12 but the crash has yet to return. (Though I do fear that it might.) I also tried the practice tool on the PBE where the same thing was happening and the wait time is even worse on there than on 8.12 live.\n\nEDIT: I was not running anything other than League on my PC so I don't believe the problem lays there.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ataraxas","date":"2018-06-05T22:59:17.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Afic,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=47snFW6H,comment-id=0003000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-06-05T22:15:43.130+0000)\n>\n> Did you have the option to remake that game?
