And the big question I would ask is \"Why isn't AP Ekko viable Right now?\" (it might be meta, given that many Assassins arn't that good right now) I don't think his Q, has enough damage on it to act as a mage ability. (Magier aspects would encourage a glass cannon AP build.) Does his utility disproportionately encourage His Tankier builds? (This can actually be remedied without removing the utility. As a Utility Assassin, you scale it with AP like you would a Utility mage) \n\nThe last problem with the potential builds.

In my opinion ap assasin ekko would still be somewhat viable (like ad jarvan) but unless his dmg becomes more reliable, specifically his Q, he will always tends towards tankier builds that let him get his dmg off.
