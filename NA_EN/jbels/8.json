I love the concept, and when you actually manage to land a long distance ult once every 10 tries, it&#039;s hilarious and rewarding.\r\n\r\nQ: I really don&#039;t like the feel of this ability. Often it conflicts way too heavily with my movement commands. I&#039;ve had instances where I&#039;m right on top of somebody but it takes 5 seconds to actually get my Q off successfully because my movement commands constantly override my usage of the Q. Smooth this out, and I think the ability will be fine\r\n\r\nW: This is probably the worst offender. Why does my movement speed go in and out of being faster when I&#039;m following a blood trail? It&#039;s super inconsistent. I could be following the same Blood trail exactly as it&#039;s laid out in front of me, and my movement speed boost will cut in and out. It feels awful and takes away from the fantasy you&#039;re supposed to get when playing Warwick (chasing that idiot who cut themselves on something and watching them run in terror because you&#039;re the big beastie).\r\n\r\nOther than that, it also feels really weird when last hitting to go from Attack Speed boost to normal attack speed because the minions got really low. I think adding the functionality for minions was unneeded, to be honest.\r\n\r\nE: Pretty solid, actually. Not a bad ability at all.\r\n\r\nR: Probably the most fun and most aggravating ability in the game, in equal shares. Landing this ability feels fucking amazing. But that&#039;s if you land it. I feel like Warwick&#039;s hitbox for this ability needs to be widened just a smidge, to prevent those cases when it looks like you touched them, but you still fly right past them. (btw props to whoever came up with the skidding on the floor mechanic when you miss, that is pretty funny). \r\n\r\nThis champion concept is super cool, and if these small things get ironed out, I could see Warwick being a solid pick for new and veteran players","replies":[{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2017-01-29T12:11:35.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to play the old WW:\n\nAttack Speed Runes, Fervor Keystone, Bloodrazor->BorK, Sorceror Shoes\nHard Farm Jungle, Solo Dragon, use your ult to lock down targets, use your W to buff team\n\nHow to play the new WW:\nAD Runes or M.pen Runes, CD runes, Thunderlords Keystone, Warrior->Hydra, Swifty Shoes (maybe sorc)\nonly hunt low health targets, anyone who is healthy is off limits, save your ult for after you close distance\n\nSo basically the things Warwick was known for mechanically are gone.  It's been sacrificed for (albeit a very cool) visual and fun play.\n\nWarwick does not heal from his passive while above half health, so he cannot sustain tank anymore.  When his health gets below half, the enemy team will burst him (and his sustain will not bring him above half health, so he will remain burstable).  Junglers generally don't want to be walking around with less than half health all the time either (you just never know when a juicy target will present itself and you don't want to be the one running in with less than half health or the one getting jumped on because he is less than half health).  This makes Warwick's new passive healing mostly useless.  The idea that Warwick has fast movement is deceptive, because he loses that movespeed after he engages the target.  This is why he needs Swifty boots.  The new ult isn't as reliable for initiating a fight, which means Warwick prefers to use it after starting the fight - not before.\n\nThe result is that Warwick is kind of like a less effective Nocturne.  Nocturne's ult is far more reliable as an engage tool, Nocturne can do well with Bloodrazor.  Nocturne can fear his target.  Nocturne has a move speed buff.  Nocturne has sustain on his auto attacks (even when he is above half health).  Nocturne doesn't need to build Tiamat to do AoE damage with his autos.  When you think about it, Warwick's reliable suppression and heavy sustain were cornerstones of his gameplay and both of these aspects of his kit got the nerf bat.\n\nPlayers in general haven't adapted to the new Warwick.  They are running the old runes and old masteries and trying to make Bloodrazor work.  The smarter ones have switched to Cinderhulk and tank items in an effort to stack enough health that Warwick's passive can become useful again (adopting a more Volibear playstyle, except that Volibear does that better) and picking up the Tiamat so that Warwick can pretend to clear the jungle well.  If more players adapt, we should see a small rise in jungle Warwick win rate, but I don't think the play will be satisfactory for WW mains (except maybe the AP WW mains).  I don't play Warwick in the top lane, but from what I see there, he's a horrible pick.  You would probably be better off taking him as a support than taking him top lane.\n\nTL;DR Warwick no longer does as well some of the things he was known for, but he does have really awesome new visuals and is actually good at chasing down low health targets now (which he relies on his teammates to create for him).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thistlemin","date":"2017-01-28T18:24:45.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd kick new WW's butt with old WW kit.  \n\nNew Q - Wonky\nNew W - Attack speed doesn't kick in when you want it.  You generally want your abilities at the beginning of fights, not at the end, so it's a bad mechanic skill.  They made his new kit way too conditional.  He can only charge in when enemies are low, when his W buff will activate, if it isn't WW is a sitting duck bringing a knife to a gun fight.  \n\n-The loss of Attack Speed ally buffing his actually the biggest detractor to his new kit.  Warwick's main \"win condition\" was solo dragon early to get team ahead and later after your team won a team fight, to buff your survivors in tower pushing mid lane victories down enemy throat in a rush.\n\nNew E - Pretty good. Would be better if it could double tap E in rapid succession like Lee sin can on his abilities to trigger their bonus effect (fear in this case, exactly when you want/need it).\n\nNew R - Is pretty lousy from a competitive functionality and reliable skill.  \n\nIn this game, a major part of kits power are put into a champions Ultimate ability.  If the ultimate doesn't function well, the champ is severely handicapped.  Currently enemies can side-step, walk away, flash out, banshee's veil, and body block his ultimate.  It's also poorly designed from a hit-box standpoint.  You miss even when you land right on top of enemies at any distance.  \n\nThe ability doesn't keep pace competitively when you compare it to other jungler's ultimates.  I don't understand how this can be overlooked.  Riot just dumpster fired Warwick competitively and put him into the Normal's only mode.  It's too easy to lose games when you miss your ultimate in a key mid/late game team fight on any champion.  Warwick's current success rate on distance jumps is way too unreliable.\n\nWhy would anyone pick Warwick over champions like Vi, Lee Sin, 20 others who have better kits to control dragon, gank, etc.?  \n\n-He's no longer a fast jungler without his attack speed buff.  \n-He's no longer able to safely/reliably be chosen as jungler to secure early-mid-late dragon's (solo or rushed with team)\n-He still has no AOE for team fights\n-He's clearly less sturdy without his passive ability healing\n-His base move speed has been reduced when the meta and jungle changes are forcing everyone to take high mobility ganking junglers.\n-He doesn't have an ally team Attack Speed buff any longer for team fights or tower pushing.\n\nHe gave up a lot of his old, subtle, utility to gain an improved chase ability, the current revamped E (which is good but not a standout ability), and a longer radius leap/lockdown ultimate but without any reliability.  His old ultimate always hit unless they had an item to duck it.  \n\nHis new ability wouldn't be so garbage if he yo yo'd back to his old position on miss attempts.  But when he misses, and he misses often as it isn't a well designed/programmed ability yet, he serves no purpose for your team and puts himself in a really vulnerable position.\n\nI love WW from over the years, but it feels bad to use him now.\n\nI think players that never used WW much before might not see the issues with him as much as people who used to log games on WW's old kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lancerblader","date":"2017-01-29T14:07:01.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for me id say his q doesnt feel clunky to that extent, altho i do remember when i first started playing him, doing the dash behind the target thing felt like it didnt work a few times.\n\nthe issue i have with the w is that sometimes it flat out doesnt trigger at all, an enemy can be below 25% and they're not hunted.   it feels like it may be tied somewhat to warwick respawning as that is where i have noticed the issue the most.  i respawn and champs that should be hunted are not hunted,   until they've taken a single bit of damage from any source to trigger it again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-28T17:05:34.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, his Q feels smooth to me.\n\nHis W i'd say is fair for what it does....
