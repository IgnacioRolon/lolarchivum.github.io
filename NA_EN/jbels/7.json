It just sits there in shop, doing nothing. Tanks don&#039;t need it because they get tanky enough to just eat tower shots. Mages don&#039;t get it because it isn&#039;t worth the build deviation and most mages don&#039;t have to walk that far under tower to kill somebody hugging it. Supports won&#039;t take it because it&#039;s not generally useful past the point where tanks just tank the tower.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the point of not touching this item? Nobody builds it (unless to joke around) and you guys never seem to want to make something out of it.

If you build a team that can only deal damage through attack damage items, then armor isn't broken, you just picked a bad team. \nSame thing applies to banner: pre-fix banner was hard on mages but was useless against AD's, and so it had a purpose, and did it's job to what was required of it.

People dont like to think, they just want to bash their heads against the enemy over and over again. Perhaps if they didnt make mages almost useless or maybe just maybe, didnt keep nerfing towers then this whole Banner problem wouldnt be considered as the buzzword \"toxic\".\n\nBut does Riot want to actually balance it? No, they would just rather take it away rather than keep tweaking it. Meanwhile Zzrot and Ohm is still around doing a whole lot of nothing. Nah lets take out Zephyr instead. Remember that little cool item? Sure back then it didnt see a lot of use but a lot of things changed so whats preventing them from even attempting to bring it back?
