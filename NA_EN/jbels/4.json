I know the mission statement of the tank update was to &quot;Make tanks tankier while taking away damage from them&quot;, but where exactly is the tankier part? I don&#039;t feel any tankier?

I keep thinking to myself, I just need to get to this item and then I&#039;ll be a threat, until I realize I&#039;m full build and still not a threat, still dying quickly, and not even being able to leave a mark in the health bars of any squishies because I do so little damage now. Thank GOD none of you got the idea in your heads that Sion should be updated too. \n\nSpeaking of Sion, I was almost full build with him and decided to engage a teamfight. I went in with ult, hit the mid laner, and activated Stoneplate while I was at max health so I could apply my CC without dying. I got off one CC before I was half health WITH THE ITEM ACTIVE. What gives? Tankier? When?\n\nAs for the jungle, Cinderhulk feels terrible. It&#039;s awful.

His new ult specifically, it can yield bigger rewards, but now it makes his kit even clunkier and more predictible, you have to land his E, which basically flashed the opponent that it is coming. (still easily usable and great the E rocks.) Then his R used to work really well, because it gave multipl blobs on multi hit, then it disrupted from the middle pushing some back and some forward. The new way that he ult works makes his E jump into the enemy and if you miss it his ult is nearly useless unless you want it to have 1/100 th of its old effect and his q is great in theory, but you also made it clunkier, you wanted all his moves to have massive amounts of counter play, but you just added too much counter play, to where Zac is hit or miss, and using his moves is a huge gamble. Going in has to be guarinteed and someone else has to lock them down first, zac can't really engage and his ult can't disengage, just bring back his old ult for the love of jeez, because thats why his win-rate went down so much to 37 percent. I looked at the rework originally and I was like they ruined him, but if you wanna keep his new ult it needs like a 0 cast time to be close to as useful, because the old ult bounced multiple times and each was a knock-up if the enemy was not hit yet. This made it a powerful peeling tool and engaging tool. Now Zac can only engage and he cannot do that very well, because people are almost always out of the fight by that time unless he lands his e first in which case it is likely flashed which is good I guess, but makes you look silly. Overall his ult even with a 0 second time on it would be close to the same usefulness as his old ult. Personally, I think his ult needs reverting, and if you want you can keep his old q or revert it too, but his ult is a massive downgrade. I loved Zac for his old ult utility and play making his new ult just does one thing, and I feel like his old ult was what gave zac the feel he had and made him truly who he was his new ult feels like a knock-off of his fromer self. The bouncing multiple times sending blobs everywhere and his chaotic unstable nature. Flash push towards your team was awesome, but r disengage was also amazing especially with the speed boost you could engage or save, but now you can dive balls deep into the enemy team, with weaker stats, less damage and be almost guarenteed to fail what you are doing with giant windup times.
