I know it's not exactly brand new anymore, but there's still barely anything on my laptop and I used to be able to run League at max specs at like 80fps. I put it down to lowest specs, have volumes muted, and capped at 60 fps ages ago. It's always been fine at 60fps and ping based on connection (40-80ms lately). \n\nI've already done all the stuff in the FAQ you posted before even reading it. Suddenly, over the last couple patches, my frames have dropped from 60 to like 40-50 max, spending most of the time in the 30s. Teamfights or really more than a few units on my screen kills it down to the teens. Nothing's changed on my end. It's incredibly frustrating to have a machine that was running max specs at 60fps run lowest specs at 15. \n\nMy graphics drivers are incapable of being updated, but I have some beta legacy support drivers that seem to work fine for everything else (and I've had these drivers when I was still running at 60fps). The problem is recent and seems persistent. Is there really anything else that can be done other than buying a new machine? The new client was even performing pretty well after a recent performance tweak (according to the patch notes), but is also back to first-day quality and I can barely see champ select. Can you confirm this is not a widespread issue on your end? I can't imagine what's wrong with my machine. \n\nThanks","replies":[]}]}]}
