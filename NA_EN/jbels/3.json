I feel like his kit offers something really cool to the game, and the interaction with the E and Q feels super rewarding. His ultimate is a game changer if used properly, and with the fear added in (as well as the W proccability) it offers up new and innovative ways to use his ult. Maybe adding an interaction with his Q and W (Or just a new skin ples rito ples) would be the greatest.
