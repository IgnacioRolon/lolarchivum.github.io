I&#039;m asking you guys for one more chance, I will show teamwork, and great team effort and feedback, and communicate as positive as I possibly can, I just came out of the hospital as a new man except the fact that I have MS and I may not be around very long or move certain parts of my body, I was hoping this is a case you could look into and maybe solve out of generosity. I have proof all medical papers, Diagnoses, Etc All I&#039;m asking is for another shot at enjoying the game on my Main account I&#039;ve spent 4-5 years playing on I&#039;d love to purchase some new skins but not on another account.
