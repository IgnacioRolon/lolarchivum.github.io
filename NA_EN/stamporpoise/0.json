I get mid and pick Annie and everything seems really good and no  one was angry. We get into the game and I go to sit in the bush from red side.  All of  the sudden my game screen went black and wasn't responding. I decide to  restart the computer and I'm back into the game about a minute and a half later. When  I get in, I see a surrender option and the team has voted to remake. I lose 18 lp even though I already reconnected to the game. I think that if the remake has been agreed upon but then the person connects it should not still happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T16:53:38.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A sudden black screen while in-game is a really weird issue!  Are you still able to hear any sounds, like maybe the monitor shut off?  Did you receive any error messages, or were you able to  task out?  Let me know, and I'd be happy to help get this resolved so it doesn't happen again!","replies":[{"poster":"Stamporpoise","date":"2016-08-20T04:05:14.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I couldn't hear a thing it was like the game glitched the computer. I couldn't task manager or even just alt f4. Was very weird.","replies":[]}]}]}
