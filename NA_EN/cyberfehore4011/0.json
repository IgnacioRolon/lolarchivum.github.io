But FYI! even i have bad games, and just think for a second Dummby :) if i keep getting feeders of course my win rate is less then 50% Haha that math should have been obv :)\n\nIm not talking about 1 game. Im talking about overall performance\n\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Cyberfehore4011\n\nLook to the left champion list. \n\nYou have 64 games on Gragas, 36% winrate and KDA of 1.94:1. Average score 6.3/8.2/9.6. \nYou have 39 games on Viktor, 49% winrate and KDA of 1.79:1. Average score 7.1/8.8/8.7\nYou have 30 games on Riven, 37% winrate and KDA of 1.49:1. Average score 6.6/8.4/5.9 \n\nThat means with your 3 main champions, MOST of your games you have negative score\n\nNow look at your CS score in recent history (note that average CS per 10 mins of a Gold player is 6.5). Your CS scores per 10 mins:\n\n5, 4.4, 5.4, 3.8, 3.4, 5, 5.2, 4.4, 3, 4.6, 4.2, 5, 4.6, 2.9, 5, 3.9, 4.4, 4.1, 4.5, 4.4, 4.9, 3.8 and so on and on and on \n\nThats YOUR personal performance. In your last 50+ games you passed 6 CS per 10 minutes mark ONLY ONCE\n\nAnother extremely important part of personal performance is warding. As a laner you should place 1 ward per 2 minutes on average. And around 5-6 Control wards in 20 + mins game. Lets see your stats: \n\n6 wards in 25 mins. Thats less than a half of what you should have placed\n6 wards in 27 mins. Same as above.\n14 wards in 44 mins. Again very low\n11 wards in 31 min. A bit better but still low\n10 wards in 32 min\n7 wards in 20 min\n\nANd so on. Again, your warding count is extremely low and u are barely even buying control wards. \n\nSo if we just look at your personal performance we get this: Negative score in most games, low CS, low warding.\n\nSo yes, while some games of yours are lost due to your teammates,  your PERSONAL performance in vast majority of your games is extremely low(for someone who claims that he was gold). I am not saying that u are worst in your games, you are not obviously, but u are exactly where you belong with your stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyberfehore4011","date":"2017-06-13T14:57:06.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Cyberfehore4011","date":"2017-06-13T14:58:41.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Also, i dont think warding it that important in bronze :) isave my wards for when they are running  into a bush so i have VISION, something u would know ;) Also i can handle ganks well, ik when to 2v1 or to run.
