Black screen issues are usually caused by connection problems failing to load assets, and independent of what client version you're using.  Not trying to give you a bullshit answer, but you'll want to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide in case anything with your network is causing issues.  I know you've been at this for a bit but I want to help!  I don't have a magicwand, so these steps help rule out possibilities.
