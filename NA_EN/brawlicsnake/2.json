Now I have to wait 5 minutes for a glitch that happened because of the client, not my fault. I don't mind waiting 5 minutes, however I do not like that I'm being punished for something I did not do wrong. Can someone please take this timer away from me?\n\nThanks\ntsnakejake\n\nEdit: Now I'm getting a black screen when I go to the loading screen.
