Whenever they win lane they zone me from cs and either freeze the lane so I can&#039;t do anything or push to my tower and roam or eventually take it down. \r\n\r\nMy question is, what do I do if something like this happens but my jungler can&#039;t help? Whether they got executed, invaded,  busy helping other lanes, or they just refuse to help because they need farm, what do I do in a situation like this?\r\n\r\nMost champions I get put against in mid/top can punish you heavily for attempting to cs, sometimes even under tower. Some examples would be {{champion:69}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:112}} \r\n\r\nBut as you can see, those are **A LOT** of champions that I have this problem with when going mid/top. The main ones are the champions with strong poke, or champions that will delete you the moment you get in range of their combo. Assassins like Akali or Fizz would definitely need to be fed to deny you from getting cs, because they are known to having a weak laning phase pre-6.\r\n\r\nSo in a losing lane, what do I do? I could just avoid being poked to death by losing almost all of my cs to my laner, or risk being poked to death by attempting to cs. If I roam to other lanes to attempt to help them they would push my turret, or roam to whichever lane I went to. Of course the average response would probably be: &quot;Just prioritise to avoid dying and late game you can help in teamfights because your enemy laner won&#039;t be fed.&quot; I would agree with this except for the fact that I will be useless because I have gotten no gold. So it is a lose-lose scenario.\r\n\r\nTL;Dr: If I am losing a lane against a champion that can easily deny me cs, **and my jungler can&#039;t gank for whatever reason** what would be the best thing to do? I would appreciate supportive answers instead of just &quot;Don&#039;t lose lane and you won&#039;t have this problem.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn case this helps, my go-to picks would be {{champion:157}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:85}} and sometimes {{champion:69}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2016-11-03T01:44:30.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your against someone who's AP (Who is basically most of those people) build {{item:3060}}  and laugh as they can't combo the Minion down. \n\nand it really isn't all that bad.

Most champions can't poke you without minions fucking them up if you are just in experience range. \n\nTry to get any cs you can when possible/safe.

Just because Black Cleaver is core on Illaoi, doesn't mean you can't rush Spirit Visage against Kennen and kick his ass because he can't kill you.\n\nIf your lane opponent roams, call the mia and ping danger, then shove as hard as you can.

If you don't scale, roam bot or top looking for gank kills. Ward your side of the jungle as best you can. Build some defense such as {{item:3001}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3152}}. These items help a lot, especially against assassins since the health and passives counter a lot of champion's burst combos. If they heal a lot get {{item:3165}}. You are the Mid laner, so you are fully allowed to KS. If you simply cant for whatever reason get a kill and live (basically canon fodder), avoid kills altogether because you are worth significantly less when on a death streak if killed (sometimes as low as like 30 gold or so). Split push maybe with a {{item:3060}} if you are against a lot of magic dealers.\n\nBest way to get back in the game is to get kills AND live. However, a trade 1 for 1 is still in your benefit somewhat, especially if you snowball, like with {{champion:84}} {{champion:105}} and {{champion:7}}, from the smallest of leads.\n\nBut if the enemy team is smart, they wont let you get any gold (shutting you down and out of the game basically) if possible. If that happens, try to be useful any way possible. Warding, objective stealing, split pushing, etc... Nothing too risky and nothing to put your team at a significant disadvantage (blatantly feeding and such).","replies":[{"poster":"RISE Shlack123","date":"2016-11-03T11:21:17.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That wasn't so hard, now was it?

You'll then be able to survive a little longer in the lane, get free pushing power, gold and can then roam to help other areas on the map. I'm not even kidding. zzrot first item rush on any champion is broken. You also get to lane faster because of hte movement speed near towers, it helps you dodge skillshots while csing under tower (if that ever happens) and the resistances will benefit you moving forward throughout the game. try it, dont trade so much early game while you're building defenses though, just work at CSing everything you can to get that item first.

This means killing their minions fast enough to push it to tower and force a reset.  The trick is, however, doing this without getting womped by your opponent who is currently ahead of you.  Fizz and Kennen are both terrible at this because they have no wave clear, even though Fizz can get the backline minions and Trickster to safety.  Yasuo has so much mobility that it really doesn't matter - clear the wave and consider getting a Shiv to help push if you're in that situation.\n\nAlso, once you've managed to break the freeze, don't auto push the wave.  Save your AAs for last hits, and use cooldowns only if the minion is low and you're not going to damage surrounding minions.  The best bet is to try not to lose lane early (durr, i know) but it happens, and when it does, play like you're behind.  And be sure to stay in experience range at the very least.  If they come in for a trade while you're that close, then just back off.  They'll likely start taking minion aggro and they'll sacrifice farm in doing so, so try to make it as costly for them as you can.  \n\nIf you can make it to mid game without feeding more than 2-3 kills, you've done all you can.","replies":[]}]}
