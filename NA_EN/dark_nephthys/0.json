I was bored and took some time and counted it up and this is what I counted.\r\n\r\nTo buy All the Runes in the game it would cost about 388,089 IP\r\nTo buy All the Rune pages (Ex: Buying 18 rune pages) would cost about 113,400\r\nTo buy All the champions in the game would cost about 518,850\r\n\r\nSo if you wanted to get everything in the game with only IP then it'll cost you 1,020,339 IP. I think the amount of IP you get is way way to low for newer players and probably should be increased or if they reduced the prices of the runes when they do something about them later in the year should be fine. I'm not suggesting this for me since I am close to having all the runes and I have all the champions and 20 rune pages, but I've been playing since like pre-season in season 3 and I spent a lot of money on the game over the years.\r\n\r\nJust suggesting this to help out all the newer players.","replies":[{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-03-15T01:08:08.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tier 2 runes are 1 ip. \nYes it sounds like a lot, but you don't need everything to play.

Though more rune pages would really help the newer members since while you can get away with 1 or 2 rune pages, having more is starting to be almost required with all the auto-fill going on. I guess 3 is all you would need at least (AD, AP, and Tank) so having the default amount of rune pages should probably be 3 and not 2, or allow us to edit rune pages in champion select.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-15T00:57:25.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is well aware of how absurd runes are, and are planning to eventually remove them from the game or rework them significantly.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-03-15T01:11:02.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=MOFAM3R2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-15T00:57:25.517+0000)\n>\n> Riot is well aware of how absurd runes are, and are planning to eventually remove them from the game or rework them significantly.\n\nI could see them reworking them, or reducing their prices or adding future ways to get them for people who don't have them. I don't see them removing them since they would have to either increase the base stats of all the champions or reduce the stats on the jungle camps (or buff the starting jungle items etc) and some times the runes are really needed to make champions just feel better in the early game like how some champions base attack speed is so low, or some supports might really need mana regeneration runes to help them.\n\nThough I think what they mentioned before is making runes feel a bit more interactive, though I could be wrong on that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Around999People","date":"2017-03-15T01:09:52.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's why you can't do ranked til lvl 30.
