So after I restarted my computer my mouse finally started to work.. So I thought everything was fine, till I tried to log into the game. As soon as I push the icon to start up the game my mouse stops working. The only way for my mouse to start working again is if I bring up task manager, and use my keyboard to close down League, only then does my mouse start to work again....\r\nHas anyone experienced this before? Can anyone help me fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-18T03:11:11.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm I wonder if League's config files somehow lost their settings for your mouse, which won't be picked up by the game if it can't read the inputs. Let's try giving those files a quick reset using the steps below, but don't hesitate to let me know if that doesn't work!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Hínátá","date":"2017-08-18T09:41:21.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um..\nThat's sort of the main issue.. I can't open the game client without my mouse cutting off. \nWhen I have my headset plugged in my mouse stops working when I click the game client. If I unplug my headset then my mouse works.. \nIts all a huge mess.. I think my computer doesn't have enough power to run a keyboard, two monitors, a mouse, and a headset on top of everything else.. I need help! :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T00:54:18.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait wait wait.....so like....your mouse stops working ENTIRELY if League is running? I was apparently mistaken, as I thought you meant your mouse just wouldn't work WITH League. Yea so if that mouse just completely dies on League opening that's something else entirely.....\n\nYou mentioned being able to use your mouse when your headset is unplugged? I'd honestly try running it without your headset a few times to see if that is the main source of the problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
