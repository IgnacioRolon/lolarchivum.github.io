I will be posting the chat later because I don&#039;t have LoL on this computer... Anyways, i&#039;ll admit I used some homophobic slurs yeah like twice lol. And was raging at our 0/37 kog &quot;being toxic.&quot; My other account was perma banned and that one was WAY more toxic I went through all the chat bans to perma bans on that account even though one game I had 36 homophobic slurs but apparently the 2 I used rn were much worse. I would be happy if a rioter reviewed this case because an instant perma ban for this?? that is way too far.  Secondly, at the end of that game, it showed I got honours.  Riot games  should really check my logs again and in 2 years this is the first time I have been toxic lol and i get perma banned.. Yeah and i used barely any homophobic slurs","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-12T02:39:11.403+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Logs or gtfo.
