You should go over the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to help fix that up.  We can't alter game stats or [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ), but happy to help troubleshoot.  HAving a queue for that long suggests a history of leaves so it's really important to get that fixed.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
