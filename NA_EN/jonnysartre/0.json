This happens to be my issue, as I am player level 30 but some unknown (to me) low level in boards. I would also like to see some sort of support link or thread \"up-top\" (how else should I phrase it?) so that those new to the forums can get help without having to make new discussions every time, and just post in an official discussion. I ask this because I certainly don't see one of those when I look around on the boards, and other gaming forums have stuff like that to increase efficiency. Thank you Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T03:13:48.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your Boards profile synced up with your Summoner profile, as you're level 30 now. As for the rest of your post, it seems that this may belong more on the [**Boards Feedback**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback) section, so I recommend reposting the second half of this post there.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
