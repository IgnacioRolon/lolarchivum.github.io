That teleport of his should ping danger for the enemy team just like Tham&#039;s ult does. \r\nIt makes the border of the game flash for his allies but enemies don&#039;t get any warning if they are not paying attention on the ground of the game. There should be something.\r\nI know that this may sound stupid, and may sound like I am just like a salty kid but is annoying af when  a wild ryze appear from nowhere to tear your poor nexus apart, because a ping or sign on the map would be too mainstream.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-14T20:12:14.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think TK's ult pings warning for the enemy.  If you're seeing that, it's probably one of your allies pinging.","replies":[]}]}
