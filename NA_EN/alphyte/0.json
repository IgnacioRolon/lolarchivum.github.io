No seriously, I've reinstalled league like 8 times, but every time it gives a bad image. I'm not sure why, but if there is someone who can find me a solution, it would be greatly appreciated. I've tried doing everything, even changing the dll files for some I got from dllme, but I can't seem to do anything. This does not have anything to do with the account, this has to do with the software. I have bad images for zlib.dll, libssl.dll, libcurl.dll, v8.dll, icui18n.dll.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T00:32:55.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those bad images can pop up if the game was never properly installed, most of the time it's due to a hiccup in your connection or firewalls blocking the installer. \n\nGive the steps in the image below a try first, but if that doesn't work then go ahead and try reinstalling again, but this time do so with admin privileges and be sure to turn off any firewalls while it's installing.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/fbe5976243158ecce7efef172951e219.png","replies":[{"poster":"Alphyte","date":"2017-10-05T01:49:46.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, will try, I think its because I was playing {{champion:254}} a lot.\n\nP.S.
