I don't like the arcade aesthetic, and would like to turn it off. I see the option to turn off the map accents in video, but not the minions or game music. Would appreciate knowing how to do so.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T01:19:24.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! We anticipated that some players prefer the good ol' times, so with this event we included a way to disable the new Arcade Assets on SR. Take a quick look at the screenshot and you should be able to turn that off!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/40ee4f659908eabd4208137e26b35778.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shay Aiden","date":"2017-08-12T23:21:00.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk bout the minions but the music can be changed... access the settings go to sounds i think, then i reckon u should scroll down till u see this theme music thingy and it would say \"updated\", click it then switch to wutever u want.... i'll screenshot if i can sry for the low detail explanation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mendingwall","date":"2017-08-11T22:05:37.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump, the minions and music are still different with the \"disable arcade map accents\" box checked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mendingwall","date":"2017-08-11T03:00:43.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, but this doesn't change the minions or music. Have that feature turned off already. The map changes only partway. So I'm not sure if it is a bug or oversight, but its basically half old half new with that option selected.","replies":[]}]}
