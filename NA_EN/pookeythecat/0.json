Well, jk, about the AD part.\n\nBut really it would be really cool if had this grand master of dome type of magic.. and she would be an elderly woman. It would add some depth to the game as in.. league lore does mention from time to time that there was some elder X, who taught the champion we have now the basics of something. So maybe RIOT could release a champion that would be just like that.. except he/she didn&#039;t have an apprentice.\n\nIt all comes down to that while champions do feel unique gameplay wise, it would be great if they would be more unique design wise - having champions all young and all kind of ruins the atmosphere.

Literally every single character is just a random shoe-in based off of a list of random ability sets/concept arts that Riot has hanging up on a wall (This is a metaphor, but it could be true for all I know). They pick whatever feels or looks coolest, flesh it out, do a whole thing for them beforehand (such as with this Camille champion's comic), and then release the champion.\n\nCamille is pretty good example of my counterargument to your idea of \"organic process\" to adding champions. There's no precedent for a cyborg knife-leg woman from Piltover. It's just a cool idea. Same goes for every other champion in the League.","replies":[{"poster":"Bobo113","date":"2016-11-20T00:30:44.148+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take my word on this. . .

Though it may not make sense to the average player, the process is highly &quot;organic.&quot;\n\nOkay, maybe I summarized the process wherein a champion is created. What I meant was that they could add in an old lady champion to have an old lady champion and it would still fit perfectly fine. I made my point with the assumption that, literally no matter what champion idea they had (they could add a sentient rabbit ffs), the amount of work that goes into the creation of a champion and just the way that the process works makes it so that any character could fit in the lore and world of League of Legends. Creating a kit, passive, abilities and all, isn't \"organic\". It's mechanical. They balance it out until it works and then they balance it some more. I never said their methods were random. Making a character recognizable is basic character design, and yeah it's impressive but they do it literally all the time and considering the setting they have to work in, a game with 10 players playing 10 avatars in 2 teams, doing so is easy. The environment is conducive to the creation of unique characters, no matter what. None of their champions could ever be \"Random Soldier #2\"\n\nRegardless, if they added another swordswoman champion, no matter how it ended up, it'd fit perfectly fine in the League. If they made an old lady, they wouldn't just generate a random idea and throw it in. I never said that they _didn't_ take time creating a champion. Of course they do. I wouldn't bother trying to make fan characters for this game if they didn't. But they could add literally any character archetype and it'd fit in League _because_ of the work they do to make sure they fit and the work they've put into the lore. They could create an \"old lady\" just to have an old lady, because there's no real precedent set for the type of champions that are and aren't allowed in League of Legends aside from them fitting in the pre-existing lore and not stepping on any other character's theme. There's no precedent set for Camille, a cyborg lady with knife legs. Of course they went and made sure that Camille fit in the lore, but you could essentially boil it down to them adding a cyborg just to have a cyborg. It's obviously more in depth than that.\n\nI hope my point here is clear. I'm not trying to discount the work that Riot puts into creating characters. I'm trying to emphasize the fact that no matter what champion they create, it'd fit into League perfectly fine because of the work they do put in. They'd never just throw in a champion, but they're fully able to create a champion for the sake of having the character archetype in the League.","replies":[{"poster":"Bobo113","date":"2016-11-20T05:19:31.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Food for thought. . .

We're clearly communicating on two different wavelength's here, because everything you're saying is very clearly riffing with me. In my initial comment, I summarized the process in which they make champions which was a bad move on my part. \n\nHowever, you're not communicating with me here. I'm saying that Riot CAN add an archetype for the sake of adding an archetype and they WOULD make it fit BECAUSE they put in the work to do so. There's nothing about adding an archetype that necessarily suggests that their moveset would be bland and their design wouldn't be unique.When I say this, I mean narrative-wise, as in how they would fit into the lore and setting of League of Legends, because that's what I'm mostly interested in. Also, literally every character fits into an archetype because that's what an archetype is. \n\nExample: All of the ninjas are archetypes of ninjas. That's what an archetype is. They _fit_ into the archetype of _ninja_. \n\nI'd also argue that the reasons why some of these champions were added are _because_ they were dragons, or talking trees, or burly (maybe not, I thought his accent was some sort of Northern European) Russian guys. It's because of how unique their kits were or how unique their designs were that spurred the process behind their creation. There isn't a single champion in League whose kit could be slapped onto another character and that's _because_ they're archetypes. Sure, they're all unique spins on their respective archetypes, but they still fulfill certain archetypal character roles.\n\nI can also kinda take a guess as to why the Yasuo sword thing was a problem, but I'm not gonna. I understand that the process of animation is difficult, I did some research projects on it in high school because I wanted to get into a career in animation but I kinda fell out of interest but that's not the point. I also... never brought up those technical problems that create setbacks in champion development because that was never the point of the discussion.\n\nBasically, as I said before, Riot _could_ add an old lady archetype (angry old grandma, wise and wizened old sorceress are good examples) for the sake of having one and no matter what direction they took the character in they would fit in seamlessly with the game because of the amount of work they put into making sure their characters do.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FloRaider42","date":"2016-11-20T00:23:00.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Osamu Tezuka,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=oWrGHyLT,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-11-19T23:57:39.747+0000)There has literally never been an instance in LoL where Riot added in a champion \"organically\".\n\nMaybe you understand something completly different under organic than me, but so far every recent champion seemed well crafted and coherent and there is a lot of work and creativity involved in their creation.\n\nEdit: Thanks BOBO113 for taking the time to explain how champions are really made","replies":[{"poster":"Bobo113","date":"2016-11-20T02:32:17.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol no problem!\n\nIt's stunning to me that people don't understand that working on games is still \"work\" - no matter how enjoyable it is at times.

I don't think 'League doesn't have one' is a sufficient argument by itself though, for any concept. League doesn't have a harpy for example, a classic monster from myth and other fantasy settings. That doesn't mean we should necessarily make one though. Whether or not a harpy allows us to tell new stories, offer new gameplay, create a different personality, show a distinct visual silhouette etc better than other concepts is what we're interested in. We'll always have more concepts than we'll be able to make, so comparing what an idea lets us do is really important.\n> \n> As far as old lady goes I think there's a lot that piece of background goes well with. If a character's physically old, but still able to compete with other champions, there's got to be something else impressive about them. That could be a wealth of knowledge and training, or massive willpower and resilience built up over a lifetime. They might move differently to many other champions, much more controlled, precise motions for example, rather than the more flashy speed/strength based combat of others. They'll almost certainly have a pretty different outlook on things from characters who are still pretty early on in their lives, who are still mastering their powers or figuring out their place in the world.\n> \n> Age by itself though isn't a justification for making a character.
