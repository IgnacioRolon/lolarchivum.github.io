Thoughts?\n\nIt's not awful, not sure why you're getting so many downvotes.\n\nThat said - it's really important to consider Nasus's archetype and overall roll with such a change:\n\n----------\n\nNasus is a fighter/tank, tanky DPS. Which is one of the 4 main damage rolls in LoL (fighter, assassin, marksman, mage).\n\nassassins, mages, and marksman get the mobility, range, or some mix of both to survive long enough to do their job.\nTanky DPS champions don't. Tanky DPS usually don't even get much defense to survive long enough to do their job - they're completly reliant on building their defensive mechanic (actual defense) to properly do their job.\n\nWhich causes a wierd interaction with items: both tank and damage are things everyone can itemize for, but itemization for mobility and range is pretty much non-existant.\nSo fighter/tanks tend to get a lot of damage for free in their kit, allowing them to deal DPS while building full-tank. A lot of fighters aren't that different from Nasus in terms of DPS, and many can beat him in post-game stats.\n\nThe most important thing to look at in regards to Nasus is tower-DPS capabilities though:\n{{champion:2}} has an 80 AD and 80% AS steroid.\n{{champion:77}} has tiger stance\n{{champion:60}} (essentially tanky DPS) has a 120% AS steroid with spiderlings\n{{champion:36}} has a 100~200 AD steroid\nAnd even tanks have serious anti-tower damage capabilities:\n{{champion:33}} has his armor to AD steroid and his ult damages towers.\n{{champion:53}} has a solid 62% AS steroid\n{{champion:12}} has a 90 AD steroid\n{{champion:44}} has a 70 AD steroid\n\n-----------\n\nAlso - keep in mind all assassins, marksman, and light fighters get to build near glass-cannon, causing them to deal substantial damage to structures with their auto-attacks alone, with no reliance on abilities in any capacity to demolish towers.\nAnd even mages can do a solid number to towers - damage vs. structures is 100% of your base AD plus the higher of 100% of your bonus AD or 40% of your total AP. With solid AP values you can chunk towers reasonably fast with AP champions, and most AP champions will make shorter work of minions than any other class. AP/AS champions can actually surpass AD champions in tower-demolishing capabilities.\n\n--------------\n\nWhile Nasus can get an impressive AD steroid through his ultimate, it requires damaging enemy champions to grant him any AD.\nNasus's only damage vs. structures is his Q damage, which doesn't do much for the first half of the game.\n\nAnd even with a solid number of stacks, about half his late-game Q damage is from bases and trinity force rather than his stacks (up to 396 from bases+{{item:3078}} ), meaning even with 132 CS resulting in Q farm, or 396 stacks, a ranged champion like Corkie with no other damage items besides Tri Force could do essentially the same damage to a tower with 2 shots (and as a ranged champion he just has to step up ~150 distance rather than 700 distance to reach the tower - allowing a realistic scinario where he does fit 2 attacks into the space Nasus can fit 1).\n\n-------\n\nLastly - it's important to note most champions with abilities that don't damage towers ({{champion:107}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:157}} ) don't exactly lack damage itemization in their builds, which will often allow them to match Nasus's DPS potential.\n\n-------------\n\nTLDR:\n\nNasus is supposed to be a damage roll like marksman, mages, and assassins.\nNasus doesn't get to build damage like marksman, mages, and assassins.\nNasus's Q damage is the only thing he really has vs. towers while marksman, mages, and assassins have a lot of damage items.\nOther tanky DPS fighters have solid damage capabilities vs. towers to come close to Nasus's potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-03-28T23:48:01.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see the point of such a change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-03-28T17:23:26.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with that in a way.
