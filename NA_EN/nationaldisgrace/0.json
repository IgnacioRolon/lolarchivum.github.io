Is there no system for LoL to tell if its their stuff messing you and your team up??","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T21:56:33.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The very essence of a disconnection is the server suddenly not receiving information from your client, so, unfortunately, no, there is no way for the server to differentiate reasons for disconnecting. Corrupt data messages often pop up if your installation is pretty darn mucked up, so I recommend completing a clean reinstallation of League using our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367). \n\nSimply open the app, check both boxes for *Reinstall* and *Clean uninstall*, then let it do its thing. After the Reinstall has finished, launch League to finish patching. Let me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
