It's one thing if the player leaves intentionally, and it's another if they get disconnected thanks to the client's spaghetti coding. Right now I'm sitting in low priority queue for 20 minutes for my next 5 games, possibly longer. I tried the Alt+Enter \"quick fix,\" but that only seems to have made it worse :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JanglingJack","date":"2017-01-12T20:17:09.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, porocles.\n\nAs I said, patch 7.1 already fixed the problem. Just was wondering if there was a way to get me out of leaverbuster, because it's seriously annoying have to wait 20min+ queue, since I didnt leave the matchs on purpose.\n\nI reported the problem when it happened: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/z6TxNfRJ-not-going-to-loading-screen","replies":[]}]}
