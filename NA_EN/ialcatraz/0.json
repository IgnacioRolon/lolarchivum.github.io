Even does it in the middle of games.\r\n\r\nI've tried uninstalling LoL, hasn't fixed the issue. I've googled the issue on here and haven't really seen anything related to this topic as of recent.\r\n\r\nHas caused me to leave two games in the past two days.\r\n\r\nJust wondering if i can get some help with this issue\r\n\r\n, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-13T20:58:05.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes random and sudden PC shutoffs can be traced back to [**overheating**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684#wq7), which is definitely not good.
