In the Lore it talks about him making all sorts of cool bioweapons. going in game I though Singed was going to be like the Forsaken from World of Warcraft where he can call down super high damaging chemicals. instead i just got a guy who runs around laugh spamming. I dont like how Singed is just focused around becoming a ball of stats through his ult and passive and then being a annoying as hell guy. In teamfights youd think  that singed could use his chemicals to close off escape routes or turn a big area into gas chamber. instead he just makes a straight b-line for the ADC trying to throw them and usually he succeeds thanks to 300 armor and 4k HP. Singed while fun to play coulda def be better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-01-20T17:34:16.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wwlGhjOE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-01-20T03:50:20.505+0000)\n>\n> We don't have any plans to make significant changes to Singed (almost certainly balance adjustments at some point, but none currently planned).

When I play Singed I never know when the right time to use it is, because it slows down people who are chasing me but the cast time just means they catch up faster anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mephistophilis","date":"2016-01-20T10:39:16.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wwlGhjOE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-01-20T03:50:20.505+0000)\n>\n> I'm not personally convinced the root from the Fling/Mega Adhesive combo's sufficiently relevant to justify its existence on the kit, could imagine a world in which we took that out and replaced it with something a bit less niche.

I think Singed is fair in terms of power, but if changes are needed, I would like something that allows me to be more useful when I'm behind without buffing him in other cases. I personally struggle hard when I lose lane because I need some items to tank well and be relevant in teamfights mid game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Voids Call","date":"2016-01-20T07:13:10.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the Fling/MA combo, what if you made fling into a targeted similar to viktor E or rumble ult?

Not that it's horrible. It's just boring af. Bogs down his build some where you're kinda just forced to build {{item:3110}} or {{item:3025}} and {{item:3027}}. I mean, they're good items, and good on Singed anyway cause, stats. But, just the 'yay free hp, cause..' isn't interactive at all.\n\nI'd rather him lose the free hp, and gain something like a short shield or burst to his stats under certain circumstances. Maybe something like, if Singed is in combat with 2 or more champions for 8 seconds, he gains (stats? a shield? movespeed? ap? small amounts of everything?) every 2 seconds for the next 12 seconds. (+ a cooldown on the effect, so he can't just gain free stats forever).\nBut it'd be kinda interesting, Singed having an ideal window of combat being 8-20 seconds, then after that he'd either want to escape or make sure everyone is dead. Wouldn't deal well with short bursts, wouldn't deal well with extremely long fights like mundo, gnar, maokai, etc. But right in the middle he could wreak havoc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bootleg Gay","date":"2016-01-20T03:11:58.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't really need one, and his kit, whole a bit dull, is still unique.

I find myself using it to self gank top lane all the time. run out of sight, pop ult or ghost run into lane between other champ and his tower throw down a sticky field to slow his retreat and flip him back towards center of lane.

Its not really useful given the way that he is suppose to be itemized.
