Eventually around min 10, my internet dced itself and it took me 10mins to come back. I played this game to the end and surprisingly won due to team effort but i got my lp taken away and lost my eligibility to loots. I never have any afk reports before. So in this case, what do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-03T00:19:50.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks that you were able to come back and win, but still lost the LP due to being AFK for 10 min. It does kind of suck, but once you're marked as being AFK for long enough you're not going to get the rewards for winning, including LP. Basically it's like this, if this system wasn't in place, you could go AFK at the start of the match, never come back, and still get all the LP and such if your team manages to pull through and win. As you can guess, this would make afkers and bots much more rampant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"100 KDA ADC","date":"2017-11-02T08:11:32.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here's the game im talking about\nhttps://ibb.co/hgReLw","replies":[]}]}
