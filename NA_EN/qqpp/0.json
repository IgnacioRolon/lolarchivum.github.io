So, I decided to redownload it.\r\nAfter a day of redownloading, it has finished and told me that the download has failed. I have been running league on this computer since I first joined last year and it has been working perfectly well. \r\nI am getting a new computer soon though, but in the meantime I would like to be able to play.\r\nWhat are some fixes?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T21:18:44.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something might be blocking your network from reaching the patching servers, or an unstable connection that's not grabbing necessary files.
