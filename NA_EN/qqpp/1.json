I didn't send a report because I impulsively clicked \"don't send\" so I would return to the champ select, but it just restarted my launcher and told me that I had dodged and was returned to the launcher.\r\nWhen the launcher rebooted, I also noticed that I had lost all of the IP from my last game (79, putting me at 3805 IP). It wasn't that much IP, but there is nothing I hate more than saving up so could I have it back?\r\nAlong with the IP, can my queue timer be lifted? I didn't dodge purposefully, and my wifi is perfectly fine at the moment.\r\n\r\nNote- I put this in Help and Support because in the \"Report A Bug\" section one of the pinned threads said to put leaverbuster bugs here.\r\nNote 2- This has happened to me before when loading into a game. Right as the client closed to open the game the little ziggs artwork appeared.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T22:54:07.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Selecting don't send wouldn't return you to a game, as a bugsplat indicates a critical fail of the game that failed to load properly.
