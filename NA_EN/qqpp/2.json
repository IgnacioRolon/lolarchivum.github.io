I would just like some more with some art and I have two questions.\nWould I be able to submit for IP or would it only be for RP? Getting 50 RP wouldn't let my buy anything because I only have 30 right now, so I don't have any need for it.\nWhere would I submit the art? I don't know if I should bother them with a support ticket since I'm sure they have other important things to get to with support tickets.\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-11-20T10:31:16.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say they miiiiiiiight take it.... but I believe the one-per-lifetime rule would still apply to it, otherwise it would cause spam of trading in art for IP which is not healthy for the game.\n\nI would still say to submit a ticket asking about it or hope that the guy who runs through help and support sweeps by soon again and gives you a heads up about it.","replies":[{"poster":"qqpp","date":"2016-11-20T23:01:49.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much, I will wait to send a ticket just in the off chance that this gets checked and I get other directions.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T03:50:57.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, IP isn't part of the RP Art tradition, so it's not something we can offer. However, if you play a bunch of ARAMs, you can farm IP pretty damn easily, especially if you end up with champs like Vlad, Hecarim, Lux, Katarina or Malphite. ^.^\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
