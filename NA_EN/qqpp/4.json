I talked to them about it and they showed me what happens, but I have no idea what to do so I am asking here. \r\nThey are on a mac and have gotten the mac software. The first time they downloaded it, an error message appeared and said the computer wont allow the directory. The second time they downloaded it, whenever they opened it the starting icon appeared and after one second and then closed without opening the client. \r\nWhat should they do? Please help. \r\nI posted this in the wrong forum before","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T23:28:48.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your friend's client is unable to properly reaching our patching servers to finish patching and log in.
