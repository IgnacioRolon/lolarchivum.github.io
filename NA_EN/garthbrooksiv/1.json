There are a number of network factors both locally and along your ISP routing that could influence this. My recommendation is to work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), which goes over the most frequent fixes for this issue.\n\nLet me know if you still have issues with this after working through that guide.","replies":[]}]}
