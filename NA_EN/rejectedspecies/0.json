The players intentionally do not use abilities, and use them last moment just to take kills. This has been a constant issue, and gold is not being evenly distributed. First question, does anyone agree with me, that kill tapping is an issue in this game? Second question, if you agree with the first question, should gold be distributed properly?  This is where the player who does the highest amount of damage, receives the larger amount.\r\n\r\nBy doing this, it promotes players to be constantly active, throughout the whole game or match.  Every player will HAVE to be a key player in any team they play with.  Doesn&#039;t everyone want that?  From my point of view, I would easily say yes.  This would solve a large amount of issue in this game, where people aren&#039;t being constantly active.\r\n_______\r\n\r\nSimple, non-complex equation:  A player does 75% percent of the damage, he or she will only reap 75% of the profits. A person comes in last moment to take the kill.  I think this amount should be extremely scrutinized, and damage reflects the EXACT amount they obtain.\r\n_______\r\n\r\nThis equation gives a precise breakdown, if the numbers are scrutinized or properly distributed.  This equation will be used on every creature, bot, or players that is killed.  As the gold increases, of course, the gold distribution will be divided even greater.\r\n\r\nIf on player does 95% of the damage, and the other player only does 5% of the damage, and there is 300 gold per that kills. That player who only done 5% of the damage, will only get 3 gold.  The other person would get 297 gold, because they&#039;ve done 95% of the damage.\r\n________\r\n\r\n**Post your comments, suggestion, points of view, etc. Do not post any negative comments, that will go against the board forums rules and posting guidelines.**","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-13T20:35:17.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure this is call Kill stealing not tapping but its only an issue in norms and maybe low elo ranked.  I would say this isnt an issue.  Kill stealing is pretty much only a problem in normals, in ranked its just called kill securing.\n\nIn ranked games I couldn't care less who gets the kill.  Obviously I would prefer it go to me or someone else in a carry role but at the end of the day kills themselves don't mean much, its the objectives like baron, dragon, inhibs and towers that you can now get due to that kill that matters.\n\nAlso this presents a problem especially in lower elos where there are 50-70 kills happening a game that anyone who plays high damage champions like aoe mages or assassins are going to be reaching full build way faster than everyone else and then simply wasting all of that gold they get extra.","replies":[{"poster":"Rejectedspecies","date":"2016-05-13T20:48:02.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does touch on that subject, but the main subject is, \"distribution of gold.\"","replies":[{"poster":"KillerKell","date":"2016-05-13T21:51:55.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rejectedspecies,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PHAHTI7q,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-05-13T20:48:02.021+0000)\n>\n> This does touch on that subject, but the main subject is, &quot;distribution of gold.&quot;\n\nSo the Healer deserves no Gold?

Last hit on kills, being kill tapping or kill stealing.  They are one in the same, and both mean the same things.\n\nGood idea support/heal helping and receiving gold.  Now, this idea cannot work on all supports, where they aren't assisting the players.  If they are not an ACTIVE player in that area, they get nothing.  If they are a last second healer, they will be treated the same, as a last minute hitter, player killer, etc (which term you prefer), they will get barley anything, or nothing at all.  The player who does the most damage, would still receive the higher amount.  As for the support/healing class, which all characters should be put in categories, who helped, they will receive 1/2 to 3/4ths of the amount.\n\nNow, I'm not trying to make a new game, or re-wright the games history, since 2009!  I'm just trying to improve the gold distribution system properly.  Yes, one last minute kills are a problem.  Yes, other classes that aren't being a main focus damage character and not receiving gold is an issue.  So, with all that info, in an off manner, shows that people do want the system revamped or fixed.\n\nAm I making an assumption with the information provided?  Yes, I am.  Is this a possible fact?  Yes, it is.  So, please the input coming everyone.  Again, post your comments, suggestions, points of view, etc.  Do no post any negative comments, that will go against the board forums rules, and posting guidelines.\n ____\n\nJust as a side note, my proposal isn't that the whole team gets gold.  Inactive players should get what inactive players have worked for.   Which is nothing at this current time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rejectedspecies","date":"2016-05-13T21:24:32.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played.
