I killed the ward the same time thresh threw out his hook.

Any skill shots or traps can hit it. Its the worst for Teemos. Ward debris will destroy his mushrooms. \nHe's video proof of the Thresh hook you're talking about (for other people)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLsT3BNZ7mY","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-23T22:34:11.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
