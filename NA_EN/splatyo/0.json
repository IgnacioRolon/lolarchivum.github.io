So in the current system, you get reported maybe 3 games of being toxic, and then you get a punishment and they tell you what you did wrong. it&#039;s fine but I think that it&#039;s easy for a person to play three games in a row and be toxic without really realizing that they are harassing others and that it could result in a punishment. So if they got a message that they were reported, they would be able to keep themselves in check and not harass people in the next games, preventing them from being punished in the first place.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Would this be useful to prevent players from getting punished? Do you even want to help toxic players prevent their punishments? leave a comment below!\n\nEdit: shout out yo YerroFever for his idea, that instead of getting notified when you get reported, you get notified about the game 1 and or game 2 instead of never being notified and suddenly getting punished for GAME 1, GAME 2, GAME 3\nif they told you about GAME 1 and GAME 2, it would help you correct your ways before being punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-09-02T23:26:08.848+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"You used to get a notification if you were reported too frequently, but it was removed because it felt bad for players whether they actually did something wrong or not because you can get reported a lot for behavior that isn't punishable, or reported for no reason at all.

For example: Played  a bit on aram with a friend who is a total noob so the only thing i typed was hi team , some  tips in flemish for him and in the first game at some rages to just chill because he was new and still learning. First game toxic premade slandered us in allchat and got the other team to also report us (i gave to few fucks about an aram game to defend myself) , couple of games later we played vs a 5 man premade that just found it fun to all report the guy who had smashed them (was really on fire that game). After that i got a warning for harrasment while i litterally hadnt typed a word more than what i previously mentionned for the last 5 à 6 games. A solution t remedy this would be to only send warnings for genuin reports but then you just get a lot of people who game the system instead of actually reforming.       \nSo yeah great idea on paper, doesnt work live.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AuraCreed","date":"2017-09-03T07:39:11.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say if you got the same report twice in two different games to get a notifcation, so there wouldn't be 4 man spamming or something.\n\nThough I definitely see where they're coming from with people feeling bad over things that might not even lead to consequences.","replies":[]},{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2017-09-03T08:20:19.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=k6F71eRF,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-09-02T23:26:08.848+0000)\n>\n> You used to get a notification if you were reported too frequently, but it was removed because it felt bad for players whether they actually did something wrong or not because you can get reported a lot for behavior that isn&#x27;t punishable, or reported for no reason at all.

I was a very nice guy, but after the introduction of the worst feature ever (Tribunal) a lot of cancerous players dedicated their lives to troll others and get them banned.\n\nSadly I fell far to many times on their clutches, I became toxic af, gotta admit I stopped playing right after my perma ban. Came back like 1 year later, and started to play again the way I was before, like a chill dude. Well, then the \"notifications\" were introduced and I became toxic again, I was reported for verbal abuse and stuff like that for trying to teach others how to play, for calling shots, etc.\n\nEvery single time I played good, carried etc without being toxic, I remember getting hella pissed whenever I got a notification saying I was reported, or when I was chat restricted, I was like \"WTF? Are you for real?\" Then I started to get tilted and adopted a troll behavior all that because I got discouraged due to people being able to report you for whatever reason, even for just being good at the game.\n\nWell, I stopped playing again and came back, and trust me I've learned the hard way that, having those features did more harm than anything. So I went back to my old self, of course I get mad if we are losing because of trolls, but I learned that even when people is trolling, if you don't become negative about it, nothing happens.
