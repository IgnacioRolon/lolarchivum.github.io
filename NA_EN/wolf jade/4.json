I'm not a Vayne player, but I could see it working. \n\nIt would require a VERY different play style, .. but it could work. \n\nIt would be more of a Engage > Burst > Disengage > Reset, opposed to just pure All In. \n\nIdk, maybe you should actually try it again, but change your build to match. \n\nMaybe something more like Rapidfire or Statikk. You could still go for Blade of the Ruined King and rely more on the active to provide you more burst. Otherwise Lethality is probably the better way to go, Duskblade is more burst, but Youmuu's active gives her the movement speed to engage / disengage. \n\nIf you're able to get far enough ahead that your burst chunks the enemy down enough that you can follow up with the kill, you can return back to the All In playstyle, but early on you will be missing out on a lot of pressure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi im Rizzuto","date":"2018-12-27T16:43:48.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know what i realise looking at your game profile, cs. practise your cs and you will climb / cs = free gold = free dmg . work on that, good luck :)","replies":[{"poster":"wolf jade","date":"2018-12-27T16:50:02.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most of my games have 6 cs per game for a champ i didnt play for the longest time and still 6cs per min on most games... i know that you need to cs  (my main champs on this acount would have better cs but i played on them long time ago and didnt know how to cs so its still only 6 per, (ty but i know about cs)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2018-12-27T16:05:13.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"46% winrate\n\nI wish I didnâ€™t have a 26% winrate lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2018-12-27T14:31:04.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"false reports are not counted against you\n\nif you were truly playing to win, you have nothing to worry about","replies":[{"poster":"wolf jade","date":"2018-12-27T14:32:26.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was, ty for the infro","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aladoron","date":"2018-12-27T16:48:08.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That looks just a simple bad game to me, as you have told yourself too.\n\nDo not worry about it, they do not ban even obvious trolls, you are safe ;) False reports do nothing, tho.","replies":[]}]}
