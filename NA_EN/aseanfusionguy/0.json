Anyways after I login it says loading like always but here's the problem it doesn't stop loading I let it load for like 3h but it still doesn't work I also tried to restart my computer 2 times but there's still no difference.\r\nI also cannot access the settings(well I can open it before I log in but everything is just black and there are no buttons what so ever apart from the done button). Idk if I should reinstall league now  or if any other people experienced the same issue and got it solved(sorry if this question was already answered somewhere else on the forum but I looked everywhere and coulden't find it) Sadly I don't think there is any way of implanting photos into this post so I can't show you how exactly it looks like","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T00:31:43.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could either be that your version of the client is corrupted or possibly an intermittent connection issue that's keeping your client from grabbing any of the information it needs to display.
