LOL good joke...","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have read many times that he is slated for a major update and until that is finished he won&#039;t get any skins. He was already re-worked and even if that is not the &quot;major&quot; one they refer to why do they refuse to make a skin for him? I don&#039;t understand how a champion who hasn&#039;t had a skin since 2012 doesn&#039;t get any love, but other champs get like 4 skins a year. As I write this post both blitzcrank and amumu are getting yet another skin on pbe (sewn chaos). There are champions that were released years after swain&#039;s last skin that have more then him today (thresh, braum, gnar, and lucian come to mind, but I don&#039;t care to find them all). Riot clearly has favorites, Swain not being one of them.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-01-17T16:33:39.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason for not giving him a skin now is because they'd have to redo it once his big update comes out.\nAnd when  we talk about big update we don't mean \"one of his skills gets slightly changed\",no thats merely a bandaid for the time between the mage update and his big update.\nWe talk about an update that is comparable to {{champion:44}} {{champion:19}} or {{champion:14}}\n\nI mean,imagine if they release a new skin for swain,that comes with an ultracool demon-bird-form.\nAnd then comes the rework and they remove the demonbird-form entirely.\nIn that case everyone who liked that skin for its demonbirdform would suddenly loose what they liked about the skin in the first place.\n\nSo it is kind of a loose-loose situations.\nPlayers would get a skin that they might not like anymore once the update comes out and Riot would need to make the skin twice.","replies":[{"poster":"LÃ¹men","date":"2017-01-17T19:54:50.356+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No matter what, people will always find an excuse to complain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LunSeiSleidee","date":"2017-01-17T21:39:29.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Yhm3pkha,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-17T16:33:39.939+0000)\n>\n> The reason for not giving him a skin now is because they&#x27;d have to redo it once his big update comes out.\n> And when  we talk about big update we don&#x27;t mean &quot;one of his skills gets slightly changed&quot;,no thats merely a bandaid for the time between the mage update and his big update.\n> We talk about an update that is comparable to {{champion:44}} {{champion:19}} or {{champion:14}}\n> \n> I mean,imagine if they release a new skin for swain,that comes with an ultracool demon-bird-form.\n> And then comes the rework and they remove the demonbird-form entirely.\n> In that case everyone who liked that skin for its demonbirdform would suddenly loose what they liked about the skin in the first place.\n> \n> So it is kind of a loose-loose situations.\n> Players would get a skin that they might not like anymore once the update comes out and Riot would need to make the skin twice.\n\n\nI understand this, but Swain's visual update is likely to be ONE YEAR from now, AT LAST....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-17T14:29:52.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whatever champs have more overall highlight time get skins more, more favs, more moneyyy","replies":[]}]}
