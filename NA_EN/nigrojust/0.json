Around level 10-11 I decided enough was enough and i'll reset my new router (NBN). Shortly after I realised this was a terrible terrible idea, as I struggled big time getting it back online. 10 minutes had passed and my angry and annoyed self finally got connected, however when loading up league it came up with a disconnect issue and once more I had troubles coming back into the game. It than went pear shaped again, with me needing to reset my computer as I would click league, the icon would appear in the middle of the screen, but disappearing shortly after and nothing continuing from that. \r\n\r\nDue to this I discovered I got a matching penalty of 20 minutes before finding a game, which I believe can be fair. However I do feel a little upset due to me trying really hard to get back online and not let my teammates down with no success. I was just wondering if there is a place to contact a riot employee / helper to maybe discuss it a little more? \r\n\r\nI'm really not sure, I just thought i'd give it a crack. :) :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T21:58:19.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's frustrating trying to get back into a match when your connection just won't work with you, but being afk from a match still puts your other teammates at a disadvantage. You shouldn't have too many games to play through though if this is your first time with this issue!\n\nThose major ping spikes concerned me a bit, so I'd like to go ahead and check for packet loss if you'd like. Hit up our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and let it scan the network logs from that game with the 1500 ping. Post a screenshot of it here so I can go over it with you!","replies":[]}]}
