This champion has a lot of cc and also does tons of damage. In late game, this champion is not only unkillable but literally can 1v9 the whole game as a tank. I believe that this is not fair for the champions that actually require skill to succeed in late game. Hopefully you can look into some game where people play Nautalis and see for yourself if this champion needs a big nerf on his scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"Harden Stepback","date":"2018-01-29T05:50:20.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naut top needs buffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghazter","date":"2018-01-29T05:14:27.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nSure Nautilus is tanky, but damage? No. CC? Yeah, sure, but look at most supports. If he's gonna do damage, he's probably not going to be a good tank and vice versa. He also sucks up mana like crazy, have you ever tried playing him?","replies":[{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2018-01-29T05:32:51.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he does go through mana quite quickly but i like the change they did to his q a bit ago","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-29T05:25:59.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you fail to spell Nautilus in so many ways, but still think you are familiar enough with the champ to judge balance?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nosnide","date":"2018-01-29T04:28:37.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The E is his main source of damage honestly.
