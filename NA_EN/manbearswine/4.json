On that same note, I believe Orianna's base movespeed is abysmal when you consider her spell range, and should be increased by 5 to allow her to get out of the rage of other, longer range mages with the same movespeed.

No. Both their win rates are higher than Thresh, too, and Leon's damage is significantly higher while still being a crazy CC machine like Thresh, and has better innate tankiness. \n\n> I didn't say everyone believes it,I said it's idiotic,and it is definetly so,if you think thresh with 0 damage would be even viable,I suggest you get your head checked(Though I seriously doubt anyone is stupid enough to believe that,they do however like to chant it though).\n\nThey are invoking hyperbole; obviously doing nothing but moving players around isn't viable. The point is that he doesn't deal nearly as much damage as some of the higher DPS supports (Leona, Morgana, Sona) already, so nerfing his damage more would gimp him too hard. \n\n> So now practicing a champion for a while should make elo rain freely on me? Why can't I get free elo from mastering sona,or nami? High skillcap doesn't justify being overpowered,definitely not for so long. \n\n \nPractice DOES make ELO rain freely on you, with any champ, really. I always advocated Nami when I mained support, but people didn't pick her up for a long time. Sona is just as strong. Look at those winrates. Even though you're having so much trouble with Thresh, 53% of teams seem to be just fine dealing with him.\n\n> 10% more is now SIGNIFICANTLY?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance\n\n> I don't care for winrates really,It's just because a lot of bad players pick him cause lcsbigplays,my point was that him having low damage output compared to other supports is a myth,and these stats support that.\n \nFallacy: you argue he's OP, but the stats don't add up. You say he does too much damage: he **does** deal less than most supports (Blitz, Leona, Morg, Annie, Zyra, Sona), about the same as Braum, and more than Nami/Janna **who historically play different roles than Thresh.** You say he's OP, but his winrate is literally lower than **every other support**. You say lots of bad players pick him up, but that's the same with **every** champ in the game, so the winrates of every champ already account for that fact. Winrates are averages, so more play means more noobs and more pros, statistically. \n\n> About myths regarding thresh? like low damage output and him being able to maintain viablity even with 0 damage.\n\nAgain, hyperbole, but it's honestly a moot point since you are saying he's OP when he clearly is not. You just personally don't like having to deal with him because you are tired of seeing him. That's not the fault of the character design, it's just your personal preference/annoyance. You are essentially arguing that popular champs should be nerfed simply to make them less popular, not because they are overpowered.
