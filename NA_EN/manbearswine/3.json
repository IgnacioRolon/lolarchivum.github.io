The highest amount of crit chance you can have with only one item is 30%, that becomes 60% with Yasuo's passive.

My argument about his healing and no mana was one argument which you made into two. \nLow mobile champions get relaid and have cc because their low mobile.

You said 10% crib runes aren't very good right now, that sounds entirely opinion based. He can get 100% crib so easily.

It's predictable yes, still so strong. \n\nHis passiv is hard to pop if your melee. Talon for example has low range and no escape. Popping the shield will give Yas time to attsck back and win the trade. He has dashes too so trying to escape after losing the trade is no easy task either. \n\nThese points I made were to explain how he's broken yet Riot doesn't nerf him. Many people play him, like you (You posted this to reassure yourself your good st Yas and League. Not that Yas is just broken in general) and due to no nerfs, brokenness, large fan base, etc. I was saying how he's a Riot Favorite. \n\nTip: Insults do not = an argument.

He can get 100% crib so easily. With infinity edge you do 240% your AD and heal off it with WarLords\n\nEvery judgement made by anyone is an opinion. My opinion is probably right tho, because you don't need anymore crit runes to get 100% crit chance on Yasuo, because {{item:3087}} and {{item:3031}} have been reworked and now give 30% and 20% crit chance. 2 (30% + 20%) = 100%. Using crit chance runes is a waste of stats and makes your early game weaker. In fact, pro players started playing Yasuo with {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} and {{item:3078}} because they didn't want to have a weaker early game by picking crit runes (Trinity is also easier to build than Infinity and gives a better mid game powerspike, but that's just a side fact).\n\n>With infinity edge you do 240% your AD and heal off it with WarLords\n\nNo, you don't. You have 10% less crit damage because of your passive, therefore your crits with Infinity Edge deal 225% of your total AD, instead of 250%.\n\n>His passiv is hard to pop if your melee. Talon for example has low range and no escape. Popping the shield will give Yas time to attsck back and win the trade. He has dashes too so trying to escape after losing the trade is no easy task either.\n\nLet's use your example: if you pick Q at level 1 with Talon and you auto, then Q Yasuo, you're going to outdamage him.\nIf you pick W, you can avoid Yasuo's retaliation and damage him for free. If he gets in melee range and you've already hit him with your W, his shield is down and you deal bonus damage to him with autos because he's slowed. Plus, using W allows you to push the wave faster to get level 2 before him.\n\n>Many people play him, like you.\n\nIncorrect assumption. I don't play Yasuo, at all. I'm a main jungler and whenever I see Yasuo on the enemy team I'm happy as fuck, because I know he's free kills whenever he overextends to push the lane.\n\n>Tip: Insults do not = an argument.

Pretty sure any melee that has some capacity for stickiness and getting to her in the first place isn't hard countered.\n\n>Yes,the tank/bruiser is killing you,not the melee adc,sure thing mate.\n\nYes, because the melee ADC probably isn't in melee with you.  If he is he probably deserves to kill you even if he doesn't have a Windwall.\n\n>If you break his windwall you'll be aware of it,dashs like vayne q can be small,assuming the player is high and isn't aware of what he is doing makes no sense.\n\nNot quite sure what you are trying to say about Vayne's dash here, but it is quite obvious when your dash is blocked by Poppy since you get knocked up.  For Yasuo's Windwall it isn't as obvious because the only visual effect would be a projectile disappeared and that isn't very good because plenty of projectiles (auto attacks especially) are not super obvious.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DIRU","date":"2016-01-10T07:41:28.012+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=manbearswine,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=An43eY03,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-01-09T20:36:13.333+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> Or you know,kalista could just,not dash?\n> And sure she can escape her with flash,why wouldn't she?\n\nkalista dies if she can't dash, so if poppy just comes near here she's locked down for 2.5 seconds. flash? she can just move forward with the MS boost.\n> \n> Are you serious right now?\n> You want squishy mages to start dancing around the cast point of something made by a melee adc?\n\nthat's called: a counter. and if you can't use the counterplay against them, you're kinda countered here.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2016-01-10T13:29:11.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OppaiDragon,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=An43eY03,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2016-01-10T07:41:28.012+0000)\n>\n> kalista dies if she can't dash,\n\nShe doesn't do that more than any other squishy adc or mage.\n\n>so if poppy just comes near here she's locked down for 2.5 seconds. flash? she can just move forward with the MS boost.\n\nWhy is it that every other adc can just wait it out but kalista can't.\nShe can wait for her autos to end then move,just like everyone else,it's just harder and less effective for her.\n \n> that's called: a counter. and if you can't use the counterplay against them, you're kinda countered here.\n\nSo it's fine for yasuo/kalista to counter 20% of the roster but if poor kalista struggles against poppy it's time to call the cops?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
