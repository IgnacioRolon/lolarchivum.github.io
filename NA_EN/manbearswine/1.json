It's nice to see Zyra's getting some attention.A few suggestions for buffs to her:\n\nHow about making her less clunky and slow in her kit across the board? Zyra's Q has a .625 delay which is noticeably longer than other mages, even those with spells similar in function and purpose. Her E's travel speed is pretty slow at 1150. Zyra's ultimate has a delay of 2 seconds for a 1 second knockup at the end, and there's no slow or soft CC or anything like that to keep enemies inside it. Now, maybe not decreasing slowness or delay on ALL her abilities, but it's something to consider, but specifically her Ult and E.\n\nReducing mana costs. Like others have said, Zyra's mana costs are significantly higher than other mages'. 75-95 on her Q. 70-90 on her E. 100-140 on her ultimate. Reducing her ult's mana costs to 100 at all ranks would be standard, and as for her basic abilities specifically her Q has quite a high mana cost for a basic harass spell. I highly doubt something like, say, 60-80 would break her. Her E's mana cost isn't so bad considering it's power, but it's there to consider as well.\n\nI know this isn't the way Riot likes to buff champions, but Zyra's base stats are bad. Like, REALLY bad. It's not warranted considering her current state. (Which isn't awful, mind you, but somewhat weak) Smallish mana pool- one of the worst armor and health base and growth stats in the game. She's in the slowest class in the game with 325 movespeed.\n\nNow of course you guys might just do Riot things and come up with something that hasn't come to mind to us. (Like the Lissandra heal buff on PBE, for example) We have faith.\n\nThanks for responding on this thread.

I think her mana costs are absolutely fine, so please don't reduce them as a \"buff\" because thats not what she needs, Im sure you understand that though. If the animation speed on her E was increased _slightly _ along with her flat ap scaling and base movement speed increased by 10-15 that would really make a big difference in her play. My current build path on her is Codex - Guise - Boots - Morello - Liandrys - Sorc shoes as the first three items. I really feel like having her ap scaling increased would allow me to switch out Liandrys, an item I really don't like, for an item like Zhonyas. Her need for Magic Pen due to her scalings makes her weaker than she should be. Her level 1-6 in laning is pretty strong, since the laners are fairly even, but because the other laner can go straight for flat ap and you have to build magic pen items first so that your ap items can do damage puts you at a disadvantage even if you get an early kill or two. 4th, 5th and 6th item right now on her for me is Rylais, Rabadons and Zhonyas, which means she doesn't get damage until I finish Rylais. \n\nI may be completely wrong with what I'm saying because I don't entirely understand the calculations in game, but If I understand as I'm led to believe, then what I'm saying is fairly correct. \n\nTLDR, Zyra would be far, far better off with a slightly buffed base movement speed and flat ap scalings, along with the potential of a very slightly increased animation speed on her E.

Though I want to say that while Zyra _CAN_ Support, she _IS_ a Mid Laner and was originally designed as a Mid Laner. This will be a long post so I've highlighted some parts in the post.\n---\n**One of Zyra's biggest issues right now is mana.**Her mana costs are colossal, for a Mid Laner or a Support.\n\n**Deadly Bloom** (Q ): 95 Mana\n**Grasping Roots** (E): 90 Mana\n**Stranglethorns** (R): 140 Mana\n\nZyra's mana costs are huge. Not only does Zyra have to rush a mana item to prevent her from going out-of-mana, but her mana costs can still be an issue. She isn't necessarily a spamming Mage, **but she is extremely reliant on using abilities to even access her plants.** In comparison to another popular Mid Laner who is also a Minion Mancer, which is what Zyra is. Azir who is one of the most popular Mid Laners in pro player right now's mana costs are:\n\n**Conquering Sands** (Q) : 70 Mana\n**Arise** (W) : 40 Mana\n**Shifting Sands** (E) : 60 Mana\n**Emperor's Divide** (R) : 100 Mana\n\nAzir and Zyra are both Minion Mancers, Mages who use others to fight for them. Similar to Malzahar with his Voidlings, they both use others to fight for them for a large amount and on Zyra and Azir's case, most of their power. While Zyra and Azir are both hugely different in their own ways, Azir is the closest champion I feel to Zyra. Both being AP Mid Laners. Azir however, is played more commonly in the LCS and one of the most popular picks. Zyra hasn't been picked since Season 3 I believe.\n\n---\n\n**Zyra is one of the most unreliable Mid Laners**. I don't think people realize how easy it is to dodge her abilities. Unreliability isn't something that's easy to hide and forgive on a champion. If they can't hit their abilities, then what's the point of playing them? In Zyra's case, there's almost no reason to ever be hit by her Q or E during the laning phase and against a competent Mid Laner, It can be extremely frustrating as they will always stay out of range which Zyra doesn't have much of in comparison to popular Mid Laners again like Azir or others who are almost entirely different in every way to Zyra like Viktor or Varus. Zyra doesn't have the range to match up for the delays or poor travel times/widths on her abilities.\n\n**Rise of the Thorns** (Passive) : 2 Second Delay Time + 1900 Travel Time\n**Deadly Bloom** (Q) :  .625 Second Delay Time\n**Grasping Roots** (E) : 1150 Travel Time\n**Stranglethorns** (R) : 2 Second Delay Time\n\nThese may not seem like much, however Zyra's Q and E are her main damage aside from her plants. To compare how poor Zyra's reliability is and how easy it is to simply walk out of all of Zyra's abilities I want to compare her Q and E to other abilities.\n\nCassiopeia's Noxious Blast (Q) has a .400 Second Delay Time. Cassiopeia saw competitive play and was actually nerfed not too long ago because of it. Her ability is pretty similar, and the range is pretty similar too. In a target location, after a delay time, the ability activates and does damage to whoever stands in it. Cassiopeia's Q is significantly easier to hit with over a .2 second difference, **this may not seem like much but in gaming time it can mean losing lane and feeding or winning lane and getting fed.**\n\nEzrea's Mystic Shot (Q) is a good example of how poor Zyra's E Travel Time is. Ezreal's Q travels at 2000 while Zyra's travels at 1150. **This difference is noticeable and significant. **I apologize for not being able to find a more similar ability on a different champion, though this was the best I got. Ezreal isn't necessarily the best champion in the game, but he is no where near the worst and with his Q he can poke people down hard and make room for an all-in. Zyra doesn't have this luxury, not only is Ezreal's Q significantly higher in range, but it also costs less mana. Zyra cannot afford to constantly miss her abilities or she WILL go out of mana very quickly like I previously stated. Another thing is that Zyra's passive, while having almost the same speed as Ezreal's Q, **has a 2 second delay on top of a terrible projectile width.** For dealing up to 440 damage at level 18, while being true damage, it is very minor and will barely scratch tanks. Actually most of the time I've killed someone with my passive is due to them simply forgetting. **Zyra's passive has long been considered one of the worst passives in the game due to It's unreliability and actually only being relevant when she dies.**\n\nAs for Zyra's Ultimate, Stranglethorns (R) I think a 2 second delay would simply mean that if you are movement impaired, you get hit by the knockup, if you're not, then you can freely walk out of it without being in danger of being knocked up. A 2 second delay time is significant, especially without any Crowd Control, **It's so easy for a person to simply walk out of the knockup**. Though I will however say, the damage is instant if they stand in it, but the knockup can be extremely difficult to hit against competent enemies.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention, though I believe this is more of a bug than an internal balance issue, is that **her plants are extremely buggy**. They will often not focus enemy champions, and if they leave their range they will focus minions if they are nearby. This on top of them have a very small delay after being activated, makes Zyra's plants extremely unreliable.\n\n\n\n---\n\nI apologize for the long post, though I wanted to make a clear statement on my beliefs on why Zyra cannot be viable. In my opinion, her damage is fine and she definitely has the ability to become a strong, balanced champion. Though currently I would in all honesty, consider her one of the worst if not the worst mid laners. Even Kassadin I find stronger simply due to him being more reliable, more mobile, and more tanky.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2015-08-17T14:11:00.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think making her cast time on Q the same as Syndra's would be good for one change","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-08-17T14:20:25.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if they just buffed her reliability on her Q, Zyra's winrate would probably go up significantly.

If you hit 3 enemies with QWWER thats gonna chunk them for probably over half their health and if your team is slightly coordinated you should win that fight. \n\nBut the only way you can make that happen is by farming incredibly well (literally afk farming in lane.

You also need to build 2 magic pen items and a morello  before you even touch zhonyas/rylais/rabadons (for a mid lane build).\n\nNow, when you play her support and take away most of her gold and xp because its a shared lane and your adc obviously gets 99% of the farm, theres a slight issue.

Her build variations somewhat hurt her and you have to be playing very on point to get anywhere with her.

Thresh is a mid laner? Janna is a mid laner? Blitz is a midlaner?\nCause these are the most popular supports right now(according to champion.gg,I'm guessing some differences in the lower elos).\nWhy would mid laners going bot lane even reduce variety to begin with?\nNot only is this just false,it also makes no sense whatsoever.\n\n>There are plenty of supports to choose from,\n\nNot as many as there are mid laners,or top laners,or junglers.\n\n>Thresh is the current flavor of the month until he's eventually nerfed to the ground.\n\nThresh is the current flavor since release/flavor of the years/flavor of the game,he is favored by riot,if he is ever nerfed too hard he will be buffed a split second after.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zavern","date":"2015-08-17T01:17:52.769+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Zyra first came out on the PBE, she was so freaking fun.
