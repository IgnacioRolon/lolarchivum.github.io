This was tons of fun, thanks for all of the great questions. We're heading back to making music (well...the rest of the team is going to make music, I'm going to listen to them make music), but we'll pop in throughout the day and try to answer a few more questions.*\n\nHey guys,\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that it’s been a busy week for music in the League of Legends universe. With that, we thought it’d be a good idea to round up a few of the Rioters behind the documentary Frequencies, the music video “The Curse of the Sad Mummy,” and The Music of League of Legends album for a little Q&A. \n\nIf you’ve got any burning questions about our latest music releases, share them below and settle in for a behind-the-music chat with these Rioters:\n\n•\tChristian “Praeco” Linke\n•\tAlexander “Scherzophrenia” Temple\n•\tSebastien “Chemicalseb” Najand\n•\tDan “marignak” Negovan\n•\tEugene “kyugene” Kang\n•\tJason “ProtoShredanoid” Willey\n•\tLisa “Saiyaka” Thorn\n•\tTyler “Wenceslaus” Eltringham\n\nYou can check out all the new stuff here:\n\n[The Music of League of Legends – Volume 1\n](http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/music-of-league/)\n[The Curse of the Sad Mummy](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/curse-sad-mummy)\n[Frequencies](http://frequencies.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/frequencies/)","replies":[{"poster":"SeexydVanessa","date":"2015-01-29T20:05:22.918+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"How was it to work with all these amazing composers?","replies":[{"poster":"kyugene","date":"2015-01-29T20:15:29.022+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine a world filled with rainbows, explosions, and unicorns.

Is there any chance to get the instrumental of 'Curse of the mummy'?** ( Don't get me wrong, I really like how the full song ended up, I just really like instrumentals as well depending on the mood (: )\n*3. How long does one project take on average? (I am aware that it pretty much differs, most likely)*\n**4. How different is it to work for Riot than to where you worked before? (Other than the 'more freedom' part mentioned in 'Frequencies')**\n\n**Edit asks who was in charge of the Freljord theme?**\n\nOnce again real great work of you all and thank you so much for creating so awesome and fitting music for many different themes.\nAlso  that cellist playing on the Amumu song, it was so great, I can't even word how I felt.

I'd say the most consistent type of project for us is login screens, where we typically spend one to two weeks depending on what else is going on. Things like Pentakill and the soundtrack tend to be a little more open-ended, since they aren't tied in the schedules of other departments in the same way. This often means that these type of projects end up taking as much time is available :) I can't speak for everyone here, but I find that even if I finish the bulk of a project fairly quickly, I have a tendency to get really nitpicky and obsessive over that last 10% of the details, to the point where the finishing touches end up taking the same amount of time as the rest of the project.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SeexydVanessa","date":"2015-01-29T20:33:34.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the most 'emotional' part of the music video for Amumu in your opinion?","replies":[{"poster":"Praeco","date":"2015-01-29T21:00:48.037+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, the most emotional part for me obviously would be when I scream my lungs out. ;) It's when Amumu loses full control.\n\nMy favorite part though actually is the violin solo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Domineerer","date":"2015-01-29T20:54:10.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where do most of your musicians originate from?","replies":[{"poster":"Chemicalseb","date":"2015-01-29T21:07:57.305+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Los Angeles","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nightsharks","date":"2015-01-29T20:25:20.561+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"-How much of the process is actually writing and recording the music and how much is just fiddling around and trying to find something that sounds good?\n-How do you start?

Tiny Masterpiece of Evil took Alex quite a while and brought him close to mental insanity, so some pieces demand more than others. Recording is usually the last of the creative phase, which we then weave into the rest of our song.\n\nSometimes, we start based on a musical demand that another project has or would like to see, like a certain scoring to a trailer or something. Other times, we are just inspired by something (like Amumu or Jinx). Usually, there is some sort of inspiration though before we start hitting keyboard keys, no matter where it comes from.\n\nYeah, our plan is to keep releasing these album volumes, consisting of previous music and some new material, kinda a healthy mix of both. Obviously, it takes some time to produce these, but our goal is to keep these coming, so eventually, our players have a bunch of volumes that include all of the important musical work of our game. We are currently starting on the second one, which will obviously also take some time to produce, but as we say in German, \"Gut Ding braucht Weile\" (good things need time).\n\nIn terms of how to land a job as a composer, it's honestly hard for me to say, since we all came from very random directions to our positions at Riot. In general, I think it's about having a certain style or artistic creative mind that adds something to our musical world. Musical education of course is important, in order to be able to produce and prepare your music, but it's harder to find composers these days that don't just follow formulaic big epic patterns. We ARE actually going to look for another composer within the next few months to add to our team of vagabonds, which we will add to the job offerings on riotgames.com, so to those interested, keep an eye on that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cheryl The Goat","date":"2015-01-29T20:25:39.168+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did any song surprise you at the end?
