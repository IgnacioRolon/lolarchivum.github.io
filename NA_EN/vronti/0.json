It started 1 or  2 monts ago. I have no idea what happened, but all of a sudden, my fps from the usual standard 80 fps (capped; uncapped it was jumping between 100-110). However at a certain point, something must've happened that it made my fps extremely unstable, in teamfights I it drops to 10-12 fps, and in normal situation it gets to 50 if I'm lucky. I think that I tried everything I could find on forums, yet nothing fixed my problem. (Did a lot of reinstalling, graphic card drivers/ complete League client / tried to see whether I can change some settings, and other stuff that I cant remember anymore) None of the things I did worked out. I am completely lost and actually desperate, please could anyone help me?? :3 Even running on lower graphic settings than I used to, even if a choose the lowest settings, the problem still persists. \r\nSo for the info, do not have a top machine, but it used to run league rather decent. 8GB ram, commutable graphic amd hd 8730/ intel 4000. windows 10. 64 bit, tho weirdly when I look in the task manager it showing running on 32 bits (reading on different threads confused me whether this can be a problem or not)\r\nIf anyone would have any suggestion please do right it down, even tho you may think i did it, I might've not just done it. \r\nP.S. Am really desperate to recover the performance I had before this occurred. Whatsoever thank you for any good intention.
