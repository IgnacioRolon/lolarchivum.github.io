First and foremost, it's **impossible** to earn a 5-game Leaverbuster penalty for a single disconnection, as it takes a *trend* of frequent disconnections to occur before you see such a penalty.\n\nIf you're experiencing other technical issues other than this one internet outage, please let me know so we can troubleshoot and resolve the issue. Unfortunately, we cannot modify or remove penalties though, as the system is designed that way to prevent abuse. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamuy","date":"2016-11-30T21:44:24.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally 10 mins ago, it froze again, and I got 5 leaver buster on top of the one I just received today... so pretty much every game I have to wait 20 minutes because of all the low queue...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T00:01:02.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This definitely sounds like it's caused by your client disconnecting from the game platform service. Since this is often related to a poor or unstable connection to the servers, I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as your next step. I recommend testing any changes in a custom match to avoid further penalty.\n\nLet me know if this guide resolved the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamuy","date":"2016-12-01T18:31:17.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!

Today was the last game I needed to get rid of leaver buster, while I was in game with Yasuo the screen froze, I log out and back in, but when I was trying to login it had the error thing. I checked my internet (was fine), I even exit league a couple of times to make sure then I finally restarted the computer, and of course when I log back into league (which finally worked) The game ended, and instead of losing the leaver buster I gain another 5... even though I didn't even do anything. Also I get leaver buster every time I disconnect for some reason.","replies":[]}]}]}
