Most importantly was that, even though the bonuses were small, the points spent on them felt good and worthwhile: +movement speed, 5% cooldown reduction, tenacity, biscuits, summoners spell cooldowns, while small bonuses all, they were cheap to acquire and they felt good for their cost - I never felt like I \"wasted\" points going for something, and I had masteries split across the 3 trees for multiple champs. In other cases I devoted all or almost all of the points into a single tree for certain applications (like the Taric super tank block, or my Hybrid damage tree), and fiddling with the nodes was very fun for me.\n\nThe current nodes you put points into are split into 5 point nodes and endpoints, but the 5 pointers are completely unsatisfying; they're balanced entirely around putting all 5 points into them, and they each provide very small bonuses for their point value far worse than in the old tree. Everything in the first 2 tiers is almost completely ignorable and there's no way to just do a \"small dip\" into a tree to pick something you like, you have to invest a minimum of 6 points, because putting one point into any of the skills is total crap. The current mastery trees are simply \"pick one of the top 9 masteries you feel is best and fill out the often undestirable prerequisites in order to acquire it\" followed by investing points into stuff you absolutely don't want. And the masteries that are available just feel so pigeonholey - like a tank would not want both health regen AND armor or tenacity AND resistances; and I don't even know how to do certain things in the tree like make a hybrid path (that is a path for a hybrid build, not a even split between two trees, although the way they're set up requiring point expenditures in multiples of 6 screws that up also.\n\nEven within those end cap masteries, I will admit I've not tested them all yet, but the only ones I've really _felt_ the impact of are Warlords Bloodlust and Grasp of the Undying.\n\nYou know I like you.

It feels like for each champion I make two or three important mastery decisions, whereas before it felt like I was making a bunch of almost insigificant decisions. Im still not sure about the keystone masteries. They are cool, but it seems like some are clearly better than others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-11-12T07:53:21.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Dumbed them down and took away unique choices? That's...the opposite of what happened. Masteries now require you to make choices, rather than being a buffet of free stats. A or B is a choice.

Then to make matters worse (in some cases) you have to choose between only two choice, and maybe you do not want either of those.
