Have you ever went inside a pre-game lobby only to find ADC called and guess what, you see an Ashe icon already locked in by some random &quot;noob&quot; who choose to say nothing more once he/she locks in? And have you ever went into a game and got fed, but only to lose a game because of a really really poorly played Ashe? \r\n\r\nWell, this has been the case for many of us try-hards, and after a 5 game losing streak due to a certain champ, I have decided to make this, so hopefully riot can take some action to this. \r\n\r\nThe idea some people have is extreme and unfair, such as banning out the champ completely, I do not think this would be do-able because as I said there is professional Ashes&#039; in the world and I think It would be a shame to stop them just for us. However, the other idea I had was in my opinion very do-able, simply price up the champ to 3150 IP, it is no so expensive that it  requires a long grind, but it provides time for new players who are looking for her to rethink their decision while playing games with other champions. \r\n\r\nAnd finally I know that this thread would most likely not get noticed by riot, but if any of you readers who share similar situations, please up vote this post, and hopefully Riot could rework Ashe and thus fix a problem for the low elo/ unranked community. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-09-04T03:50:04.536+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see any reason not to do this, but I would argue that we'd have to make another ADC cheaper in exchange. As a new player, my goal was to buy as many champions as possible, so what I did is I bought all the 450 IP champions, then the 1350 IP, etc. I would hate to see new players who want to use an ADC, but have used Sivir and don't like her whatsoever, thus having to grind until they had enough IP to purchase the ADC that they actually wanted. \n\nMaybe make Caitlyn 450 IP to purchase alongside Sivir? Sivir is low range and farm oriented, and Caitlyn's entire kit is long-ranged, so I would argue they are different enough from each other that if someone didn't like one, they'd like the other.","replies":[{"poster":"DoggyDoggy","date":"2016-09-04T03:56:30.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I like this exchange thing.

Exceptions are extremely rare. It is definitely not a problem with her kit, which is quite strong and easy to use.","replies":[{"poster":"DoggyDoggy","date":"2016-09-04T03:56:53.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man you are god damn right!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ast√¥lfo","date":"2016-09-04T16:19:09.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lolno.","replies":[]}]}
