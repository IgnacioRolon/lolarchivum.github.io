I'd like you to run a traceroute log during a period of time you're experiencing the increased latency in-game. Additionally, I'd like you to use a networking app called [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to run this traceroute. After loading up the app, simply paste **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After 5 minutes has gone by, export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you ran into any issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VTG Meme Machine","date":"2017-01-31T19:58:06.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=JQ0kp3mi,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-30T04:00:38.178+0000)\n>\n> Are you noticing this change, depending on when you&#x27;re playing or what type of match it is?
