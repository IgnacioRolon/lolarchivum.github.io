Nothing else on my computer lags this much. It's impossible to play PvP games because I'm only able to feed or just stay away in the jungle. Is this happening to anyone else? Does anyone more tech savvy than I know how to fix this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T17:56:09.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a number of factors that could cause low FPS or fluctuations.
