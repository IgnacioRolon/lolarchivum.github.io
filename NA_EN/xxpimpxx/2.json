It looks great but unfortunately it does not work great. It looks modern, yet the looks seem to overload everything and cause HUGE lag when I even open the client. The client, while inactive runs me around 60% of my CPU. When I am in champ select it lags so hard, that I am unable to ban, nor pick a champion which can potentially put me on leavebusters when it wasn't even my fault to begin in.\n\nThe game worked fine before the updated rolled out and in my opinion I'd rather get a working client over a client that only higher-end users can use. I do not have a strong computer but my computer is strong and good enough to be able to run the game at a steady 40ish fps. It rarely lags, but the client absolutely eats my computer alive. I can barely get into the game....\n\nI don't know how to fix this problem, any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"rekted360","date":"2016-11-16T23:40:18.243+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot when i open the client it wouldnt even let me login and its annoying because i really what to play league bot the username and password thing wont appear","replies":[{"poster":"Ferrari000000000","date":"2016-11-20T22:55:24.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem bro i cant even log in after the update..... i dont know what to do be honest","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slayax72","date":"2016-11-17T01:01:10.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rekted360,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=3U4qT39V,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-16T23:40:18.243+0000)\n>\n> Riot when i open the client it wouldnt even let me login and its annoying because i really what to play league bot the username and password thing wont appear\n\nSame here please help","replies":[{"poster":"Lelouch ψ Zero","date":"2016-12-15T17:11:42.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ME TOO if you gota any anwser tell e please","replies":[]},{"poster":"icekid23","date":"2016-11-17T02:38:07.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem.

First off I never liked it so I used the legacy client then it started bugging and I can't see my summoner icon or check my profile nor anyone else's. Then I started to use the new one and it is so buggy. I've been using it for maybe about 20 hours so far and I've dodged in ranked matches because the screen either froze or was reconnecting. Now I will try to get in my promos for the 3rd time because of the constant dodging.
