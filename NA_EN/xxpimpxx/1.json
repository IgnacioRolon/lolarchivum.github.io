(Of course I did other stuff between playing a game and sleeping) but today I open my laptop to a few weird things regarding league. \r\n\r\nFirst thing I noticed was that I couldn't find it on my desktop, and when I find the launcher the file didn't have the logo and rather looked like an empty exe with the name League of Legends. I was like \"Okay, not sure what's going on, but lemme just delete it and reinstall.\" So I did, the files were deleted from my computer via the control panel. Then I reinstalled league, it went by quickly and smoothly. Launcher opened and updated... But then I began having even more troubles.\r\n\r\nWhen this appears\r\n\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/b629db566cfb6acc50dce3bf85d2e104.png\r\n\r\nI press launch and that's it. The game simply disappears and nothing happens. I'm free to open it again and try again. I've never encountered this issue before, my computer was able to handle league so it's not an issue here. I just don't know what's going on exactly. This is my first time re-installing since the update and it's worrying me. \r\n\r\nSome help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T02:29:36.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straaaaange. It almost seems like League was deleted somehow while your pc was asleep. Now that you've uninstalled and are trying to reinstall, it seems like you're running into problems with your OS not allowing the update to run the way it should. Double check that your OS has the right [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) settings for League to scan its files.","replies":[{"poster":"XxPimpxX","date":"2017-07-15T12:15:55.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have checked all the permissions, which I have.
