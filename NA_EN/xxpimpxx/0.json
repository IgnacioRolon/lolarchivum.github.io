I have made it run in low-spec mode which didn't seem to change anything. It still lags me to beyond all hell - I always lag to the extreme in champ select and cannot ban/pick. Resulting in me getting leaver busters. I've also crashed a few times when I've gotten into the game itself while using this client, while the legacy client doesn't do anything like this ...\r\n\r\nWith three days left till the update can someone help me to figure this out so I can actually not stop playing because my computer can't run a CLIENT which for some reason is harder to run than the game itself?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T18:39:28.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you say crash, what's happening exactly?  Are there error messages?  The game itself is independent from the client, so having issues in both areas mind indicate a bigger problem.  Let me know, and we'll try to figure this out together.  Don't give up!","replies":[{"poster":"XxPimpxX","date":"2017-04-21T20:19:46.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe it's something to do with bugsplat - as that's what comes up afterwards. I always noticed that it's the EXACT same leadup to the crash. First I disconnect randomly when my internet is stable and working, and then I crash around 5 minutes later. This doesn't happen when I use the legacy client, as that's what I use primarily. Yet has happened whenever I used the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T20:26:54.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info, that helps a lot!  It sounds like you might have some bad game files or something else that's failing to render your game properly, which would result in errors like bugsplat.  Go over the steps in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to help fix this up.
