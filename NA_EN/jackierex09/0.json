They don&#x27;t care and they&#x27;ve shown it a million times. And it&#x27;s unbelievably stupid.\n\nBlatant inters are banned almost instantly (in comparison to soft inting anyway). It's the soft inters that's running into issues, especially if the said inter has said nothing in the actual match, which is very hard for the automated system to determine if the person is actually inting or just being very bad at the game. \n\nYou can say that \"why not just manually review the match?\" The problem is that Riot has hundreds of thousands matches, if not more, played daily. There is no way for any company to finish watching all of the match recordings if they wanna do it manually. Not to mention, even if they do have the man-power to actually keep up with it, a person looking at soft inting is just as confused as an AI would if there is no definite tale-tell signs, that they really don't know if the person is actually inting or just plain bad. \n\nEither way, statistical behaviour analysis will be necessary in both methods of reviewing either way, and such analysis needs time to build the suspect's profile and then analyse it. It's not very efficient, but what else can one do?\n\nAlso, the system is acute enough to at the very least be capable of detecting intentional last-minute throwing. There have been a couple players getting banned without seeming any problem in the human eyes, which the player argued big time for a ban appeal, until a Rioter stepped in and destroyed it by stating that the person actually had a history of intentional and subtle throwing at the last minute of a match. So it's not like Riot doesn't try, just that soft inting can get extremely hard to identify, as it really is.","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2018-07-31T11:36:24.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Ye, eventually once is a year is \"instantly\" compared to never, you are right xDDD\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KfwOalM#eugT0xy\nYe, for example this guy would have been really hard to catch ;) Also i've seen a Nunu with 100+ games winning less than 5 of those, not getting punished, so ye, tell us more how hard it is, and how they care about it ;)","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-07-31T11:46:36.633+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ph03n1xb1rd,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=k9ZcjFlU,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2018-07-31T11:36:24.189+0000)\n>\n> Ye, eventually once is a year is &quot;instantly&quot; compared to never, you are right xDDD\n> \n> https://imgur.com/a/KfwOalM#eugT0xy\n> Ye, for example this guy would have been really hard to catch ;) Also i&#x27;ve seen a Nunu with 100+ games winning less than 5 of those, not getting punished, so ye, tell us more how hard it is, and how they care about it ;)\n\nThat is not inting, that's soft afk, which is a totally different bag of worms.\n\nUnless you believe dying 0 times and literally don't play the match can still be classified as inting by default, which in that case you're insane.","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2018-07-31T12:08:17.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Yes, this is not inting, this is simply trolling.

I bet you would, because that's what the likes of you always do. Remember, the challenge is not the ban hammer part of the ordeal, the challenge exists at the part where Riot considers who to NOT ban; if Riot really just wanted the harshest system available which you seem to desire but not really because fuck knows why, implementing it would be an absolute breeze, because they just equate report = ban and call it a day.\n\nBut then again, you're just like those vermin who find increasing contrived ways to dodge laws to their own sickening sense of self gratification in supposedly proving the society wrong and that they don't care, even though it's precisely that the society cares that they don't jail and kill everything out of spite. Even more hilariously, when some really had enough and tighten up the laws, you will then come out crying about \"censorship\" or whatever buzzwords, even though that was what you'd precisely asked for.\n\nYou set it up as a no-winning scenario where you can never lose in the argument, or so you think with your tiny brains.

You refuse to look at any nuanced aspects of the punishment system.\n\nMuch like the aim bot NPC in CoD's veteran difficulty is vastly easier to code than their lower difficulty options, a reasonable system is vastly harder to code than a draconian system.\n\nAim-bots are vastly easier to code, because human-like bots needed to be coded simulated reaction times, human-like reflex, human-like aiming skill, simulated human-like decision making, realistic depths of perception, etc etc etc, whereas aim-bots don't need any of that and it's just a spinning laser tag. \n\nSimilarly, a draconian system will have a very high success rate in banning trolls and whatever, and is VERY easy to code, but it would also have an equally high failure rate because it would falsely ban just as much. A reasonable system on the other hand, will not be anywhere as efficient in weeding out the guilty suspects, but the overall success rate is much higher due to the eliminated amount of false bans.\n\nThe challenge is not banning, but pardoning. It's precisely because the system is designed to try and accurately narrow down someone to be absolutely guilty before taking action, that makes grey areas very hard to touch. A person intentionally feeding can end up having the exact same play pattern and score as someone having a bad day and playing absolutely shite; the same goes for other \"passive\" form of trolling/griefing. Unless there are psychic working at Riot who can directly read the minds of players, they often will NOT be distinguishable to an observer sometimes in the long-term **much like how without any other external procedures and evidences, most police would find most criminals to be no different to everyday people just from observing their public activities. But that is the kind of restraint Riot is restricted to, and there is a fundamental limit on how much it can achieve.**\n\nYou don't just go \"ban trolls, or you're bad\". That's the kind of demand your stupid and clearly uneducated boss would make to their technical experts who actually know and do the damn thing; they don't understand how anything is made and how any system developments work, they just think \"if it's not exactly what I wanted AND perfect, it's bad\". Do you want to be that guy?","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2018-07-31T13:11:44.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"The current system is not \"not perfect\", it's just total shit.\n\nAnd false positives did not really bother Rito in chat punishments, just like 2 days ago was a false chat ban because someone was baited to say \"kys\" without directing at anybody or knowing the meaning. So ye, there might be SOME fake positives, happens, write to support, problem solved. Also the punishment should not be very harsh at start (just to solve the fake positive problem), if you have a bad day and you suck and get falsely caught in the punishment system, go play PvE until you win 3 games, it makes you chill and maybe play your next game better. If \"you have a bad day\" CONSISTENTLY, you can reach the permanent bans. Also, if they suck at detection, they could rely more on player reports. We always hear that flamers are punished because the community wants so, but they dont give a shit when players (the community) report someone for trolling.\n\nSo there are a lot of ways to improve this, yet they are just saying: \"It'S hArD tO dEtEcT\" and do fckin nothing.
