Two skins, three icons, one gamemode, done. Oh and old content being sold (amazing, right?) Does anyone remember when Riot cared? They used to do Map Skins, changed potions to candies, made exclusive runes, but now it's just the same old pattern. If you want anything new at all, better cough up enough bones to pay for it because Riot doesn't do anything more than the bare minimum now a days which is sad. This \"Event\" has nothing to do with actual gameplay, so what's the point? The last event of this kind didn't either. Nor the last before that. So on and so forth. There's no point to these events where the best part of it is the video trailer.\r\n\r\nWho else is sick of this garbage?","replies":[]}
