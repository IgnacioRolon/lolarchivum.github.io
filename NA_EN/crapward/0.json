For example being able to add gold at the beginning if someone wanted to test a build or if they wanted a handicap in a 1v1. Also i think a free for all mode with 10 or 20 players would also be fun. It would be on dominion except there wouldn&#039;t be bushes or walls and the last person alive wins.","replies":[]}
