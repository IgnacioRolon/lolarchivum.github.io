When you join champion select, the server groups everyone together but you're getting left behind.  Your brother may have his setting configured to play without issues, but you could have a wonky configuration or even hardware problem.  The best way to really know for sure is to go through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  Follow each step, and this should get fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"SaneShadow","date":"2016-08-31T22:34:09.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \n\nThanks for the quick answer. The thing is that I don't have this issue while playing alone. It only occurs when we queue together for a game.\n\nKind regards, \n\nSaneShadow","replies":[]}]}]}
