I get pissed off in-chat, and while doing so I never directly attack anyone on my team and never use any slurs (mostly stuff like \"stop f***ing blaming me, that could have been a good play\" or \"ok, if you think i'm saying that i never make mistakes you're right. let's go with that.\"). I get reported by our team's Sona. The following game I get hit with a chat restriction.\n\nReally now, Riot? I'm ready to see the chat logs prepared, because I literally do not understand how the hell I said anything remotely bad in the past few days except for that match.","replies":[]}
