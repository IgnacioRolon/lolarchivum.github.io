His job isn't to secure kills for himself, it's to assist the team and he buffs allies with shields and provides invisibility via bushes.

They will complain about a non support, (mage support) in the duo lane, and does well. meanwhile people also complain about supports in any other position, except in the gold starved bot lane position. (Thus having more than one support on a team.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-03-29T22:02:42.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes basically a jungling support tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-03-29T22:10:29.927+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ivern is straight up broken","replies":[]},{"poster":"TNHA Baritone","date":"2017-03-30T18:17:05.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ivern: yeah\nLulu: not so much; just strong for meta","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sadistic Veigar","date":"2017-03-30T03:18:59.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-03-29T22:13:32.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ivern is disgusting right now.
