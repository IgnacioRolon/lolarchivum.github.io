Xayah's more focused into controlling set space around her and defending herself in that way. Half of Trist's self peel is also a massive offense boon if she gets resets, making her just generally powerful, and thus Riot guts her if she ever gets powerful (especially since she as an extremely low margin of error due to having no skill shots).\n\nThen again, this is an issue I have with a lot of older champs. Older designs don't hold up with the game's current vision and direction, but people BEG to keep them around. Tristana's rework gave her one new move and new visuals. It wasn't enough to really fix the character. Same with Sona. Same with Kayle. Same with Garen. So on and so forth, and yet I can't convince anyone that this is a pattern that keeps happening.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PermabannedGaren","date":"2017-04-08T03:18:23.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's probably going to be cancer yeah.
