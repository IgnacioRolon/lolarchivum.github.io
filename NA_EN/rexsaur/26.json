It's ridiculous.\n\nI like Zyra's theme, but she's part of what I call the \"Heimerdinger series\" (Champions that function similarly to Heimerdinger by spawning semi-autonomous/autonomous zones of control; list includes: {{champion:74}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:268}} ), and one of the rules of that is that you're not allowed to be more obnoxious than Heimerdinger, which I think Zyra currently is.\n\nHeimer actually kinda cares if you disable turrets effectively.
