We&#039;re starting with tests in NA and TR on January 13. If everything goes well, we&#039;ll continue to roll out new champ select in other territories over the following days. A few key details of the system are listed below; make sure to head back to the 2016 Season Update site for an in-depth overview.\nWhen new champ select launches, devs will be on the boards to gather feedback and track known issues. Let us know what you think!\n\nPOSITION SELECT\nTeammates each select two positions they&#039;d like to play (top, jungle, mid, bottom, support, fill) in the lobby\n\nPOSITION ASSIGNMENT\nOnce a match is found, new champ select assigns each teammate a position\n\nPICK INTENT\nTeammates have an opportunity to highlight the champion they want to play before picks and bans\n\nBANS\nTeammates assigned to third, fourth and fifth pick will each ban one champion\n\nLOCK IT IN\nBans and picks must be locked in. Hovering doesn&#039;t count! Failing to lock in a ban or pick will result in a dodge with a time penalty.\nLastly, the launch of new champ select marks Team Builder&#039;s retirement. New champ select is a better answer to many of the problems we were trying to solve with Team Builder, so we&#039;re opting to replace Team Builder rather than having both queues exist together.\n\nGOODNIGHT SWEET PRINCE\nWhen new champ select launches, Team Builder will be retired\n\n2016 RANKED SEASON\nThe 2016 ranked season commences this patch! Keep an eye out for more information! Back to top\n\n\nCHAMPIONS\n\nBARD ~ootay~\nSometimes you&#039;d chuck a cute lil&#039; meep on over at an evildoer and their pal, only to find you didn&#039;t hit both (even if it looked like it visually). So we adjusted it. Bard Buffs\nMeeps now additionally hit in a 150 radius around the primary target (in addition to the cone damage) once Bard unlocks the cone attack Meep upgrade\n\nBRAND\nPretty obvious that this wasn&#039;t working as intended. For all of you who&#039;ve been double killed by Brand&#039;s ultimate while standing inside a minion wave, #bigsorry.\nFixed a bug where Pyroclasm would always prioritize enemy champions unless it killed its target\n\nCAITLYN\nLess weirdness around using Headshot.\nCaitlyn seems to have landed in a good spot post-update, but there&#039;s still some awkwardness to clean up around the usability of her new-and-improved Headshot.\nFixed a bug where Caitlyn would walk toward her empowered Headshot target if they were less than 650 range of her\nFixed a bug where Caitlyn&#039;s next basic attack would sometimes be delayed more than normal after an empowered Headshot\nFixed a bug where Caitlyn would sometimes take longer than intended before firing an empowered Headshot when swapping targets\nTrap now is slightly better at catching small champions (like yordles)\n\nFIDDLESTICKS\nDark Wind mana cost down.\nLet&#039;s be clear, this is a small buff. We&#039;re fairly certain that Runic Echoes will benefit Fiddlesticks, but we also wanted to give this old-school kit (with those massive mana costs) a small bump in the right direction. This will probably help out Middlesticks or Supportlesticks (we stretched for that one) more than Junglesticks, but at least this offers an alternative leveling path for those who want to bounce around.\nDARK WIND COST 50/70/90/110/130 mana &rArr; 50/60/70/80/90 mana\n\nGANGPLANK\nPassive ratio down, duration increased.\nAs history would imply, Gangplank is a hard man to keep down. Despite chipping away at his explosive area-of-effect damage, GP remains above the curve in the laning phase thanks to Trial by Fire&#039;s incredible damage output (especially when reset with Powder Kegs). With Gangplank&#039;s hyper-scaling potential, it didn&#039;t make much sense for him to also shove opponents out of lane like he owned the place. So we&#039;re adjusting.\nPASSIVE DURATION 1.5 seconds &rArr; 2.5 seconds\nTICKS 6 &rArr; 10 (damage per tick reduced; total damage unchanged)\nRATIO 1.2 bonus attack damage &rArr; 1.0 bonus attack damage\n\nJINX\nBugfixes!\nFixed a bug where Jinx was getting more than one passive stack after killing an inhibitor\nFixed a bug where Jinx was able to cast rockets for free when out of mana\nFixed a bug where Jinx was receiving less attack speed than intended from Get Excited! when using Fishbones, the Rocket Launcher\nSwitcheroo! can no longer be cast while disabled\n\nKALISTA\nE&#039;s less mana-efficient when rending single targets.\nBack with a spear of vengeance, Kalista&#039;s been slowly working her way up the list of must-answer threats in today&#039;s state of the game. This should come as no surprise with professionals evaluating her highly back at the World Championships, but even preseason&#039;s goodies for casters and crit-wielding marksmen were enough to keep her down. This patch we&#039;re exploring ways to reduce Kalista&#039;s mana efficiency without negatively impacting the feel or skill required to uphold the oath. You&#039;ll break even when rending entire waves per usual, but singleton last-hits and one-off-trades will see Kalista&#039;s mana bar emptier than her tolerance for betrayers.\nFixed a bug where Kalista sometimes continued autoattacking through a few loss-of-control states (ex. Guardian Angel, Lulu&#039;s W - Polymorph)\nREND COST 40 mana &rArr; 30 mana\nREFUND ON SINGLE KILL 20 mana &rArr; 0\nREFUND ON MULTI-KILL 40 mana &rArr; 30 mana\n\nKHA&#039;ZIX\nPassive attack comes out faster. W&#039;s explosive radius is up. E range up.\nWith the removal of Ranger&#039;s Trailblazer, Brutalizer, and the old Last Whisper, Kha&#039;Zix lost a lot in the transition to 2016. Our previous attempts to restore some of his former glory were well intentioned, but weren&#039;t enough to bring the bug back. 6.1&#039;s all about helping Kha&#039;Zix achieve successful isolation without needing to increase the isolation range itself. Highlighting and enabling Kha&#039;Zix&#039;s ability to capitalize on the missteps of his prey fits perfectly with KZ&#039;s own motto: evolve, and overcome.\nPassive speed increased to match Kha&#039;Zix&#039;s basic attack animation\nVOID SPIKE EXPLOSION RADIUS 225 &rArr; 275\nLEAP RANGE 600 &rArr; 700\nEVOLVED RANGE Unchanged (thought you should know)\n\nLEBLANC\nE and mimic&#039;d E&#039;s missile speed up.\nFlashy and tricky, successive nerfs to Leblanc have her feeling less-than-responsive recently. With immobile mages still on top, we&#039;re taking the opportunity return some snappiness to keep LeBlanc&#039;s foes on their toes.\nETHEREAL CHAINS MISSILE SPEED 1600 &rArr; 1750 MIMIC: ETHEREAL CHAINS MISSILE SPEED 1600 &rArr; 1750\n\nMISS FORTUNE\nPassive ratio down. E damage down.\nThe bottom line is this: Miss Fortune&#039;s doing too much damage. While most of it is warranted (especially when aided by allies to combo some amazing Bullet Times), Make It Rain&#039;s increased range and synergy with Thunderlord&#039;s Decree have turned it from an area control spell to just another way to bully her opponents. That said, MF&#039;s not far off from where we&#039;d like her laning phase to sit, so we&#039;ll be watching her this patch to make sure she hasn&#039;t walked the plank entirely.\nPASSIVE RATIO 0.6 - 1.0 total attack damage (at levels 1-18) &rArr; 0.5 - 1.0 total attack damage (at levels 1-18)\nMAKE IT RAIN DAMAGE 90/145/200/255/310 &rArr; 80/115/150/185/220\n\nMORDEKAISER\nShield takes longer to decay. W is not castable on minions. R gives Mordekaiser&#039;s attack damage, and does more damage over time.\nFollowing up our changes in 5.23, these are similarly focused on cementing Mordekaiser&#039;s pattern as a slow but terrifying Juggernaut (capital J). Weakening ability power builds in favor of more hybrid ones is the name of the game, favoring sustained threat over time instead of &#039;1-shot comboing your soul into pieces.&#039; Reverting some of his shield decay and W&#039;s ally-target functionality, Mordekaiser should find himself able to pick fights while solo or duo to keep on shredding.\nIRON MAN DELAY ON SHIELD DECAY 1 second &rArr; 1.5 seconds\nHARVESTERS OF SORROW Can now be cast on allied minions (melee and caster minions have smaller rings)\nTEMPORARY HARVESTERS Effect now ends if Mordekaiser or his ally dies\nGHOST BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE 10/20/50 attack damage &rArr; 1.0 of Mordekaiser&#039;s bonus attack damage\nDAMAGE SPLIT 50% on-cast + 50% over 10 seconds &rArr; 25% on-cast + 75% over 10 seconds (total damage unchanged)\n\nRIVEN\nPassive ratio increased.\nAnother patch, another Riven buff (I&#039;ll take words we never thought we&#039;d type for 500, Meddler). Not much has changed since the last time we met - itemization isn&#039;t great for champions like Riven, and while her health regen increase showed promise, it didn&#039;t exactly move her as much as we&#039;d like. Handing back some early-game strength should let her work where she shines most - without contributing to her endgame combo potential.\nRUNIC BLADE RATIO 0.2 - 0.5 total attack damage (from levels 1-18) &rArr; 0.25 - 0.5 total attack damage (from levels 1-18)\n\nRUMBLE\nQ range and tick rate increased. Rumble&#039;s body is now smaller.\nPiloting a literal junkyard, you almost expect Rumble to feel clunky. Alas, you can have too much of a good thing, often leading Rumble to feel like he&#039;s better left for the scrap heap than in top lane. Adjusting Rumble&#039;s specs for maneuvering in minions while upping the consistency of Flamespitter means he can focus on the complexities that really matter, like not entirely missing his Equalizer.\nCOLLISION RADIUS 50 &rArr; 35\nFLAMESPITTER RANGE 550 &rArr; 600\nTICK RATE 0.5 seconds &rArr; 0.25 seconds\n\nTEEMO\nAttack damage up. R range increased. Passive stealths while moving in brush.\nAnother champion that&#039;s been struggling in 2016, Teemo&#039;s woes have not gone unnoticed. The prevalence of Farsight Totem has hurt his ability to play hide-and-seek with Camouflage, while losing out on the bonus attack damage from the old masteries means he&#039;s having a harder time in lane. Tuning these while adding a bit of range to Noxious Trap go a long way toward improving his strategic ability to scout - as well as feed into his natural prey of fighters and juggernauts.\nWhile the below changes might look like a buff and a nerf to Camouflage, the double stealth mechanic wasn&#039;t necessary (as you will now be entering stealth the moment you walk in instead of needing to stop), so you take about the same time to stealth but can also stealth while running. Now that&#039;s sneaky.\nBASE ATTACK DAMAGE 47.54 &rArr; 49.54\nTeemo can now stealth while moving in brush (combat still resets the delay)\nTeemo no longer stealths twice as fast while in brush\nNOXIOUS TRAP CAST RANGE 300/600/900 &rArr; 400/650/900\n\nTRUNDLE\nQ no longer works on towers. Pillar&#039;s cost up. R&#039;s cooldown and cost increased.\nWhat a difference 50 attack range makes. Every year there&#039;s a champion that perfectly benefits from most of the season&#039;s changes, and in 2016 (with better itemization and a higher importance on skirmishing), it&#039;s Trundle. We&#039;re taxing the troll&#039;s mana pool to curb some of that non-stop aggression. Quick call out on that Q nerf: with turrets being weaker this season we felt this was a good middle-ground instead of outright dulling those teeth.\nCHOMP No longer affects turrets\nPILLAR OF ICE COST 60 mana &rArr; 75 mana\nFixed a bug where Trundle&#039;s Pillar was granting too much vision for the duration\nSUBJUGATE COOLDOWN 80/70/60 seconds &rArr; 110/90/70 seconds\nCOST 75 mana &rArr; 100 mana\n\nELISE\nRappel won&#039;t randomly drop you on enemies you didn&#039;t want to land on.\nFixed a bug where Elise would quickly drop onto a nearby enemy when self-casting Rappel\n\nPOPPY\nQ is more usable after charging.\nJust some usability to keep the Keeper of the Hammer keep on keepin&#039; on.\nIf Poppy casts Hammer Shock immediately after Heroic Charge, Hammer Shock will cast toward her target\n\nTHRESH\nSouls are more likely to do what you think they do.\nFixed a visual bug where, upon despawning, uncollected souls appeared to fly to Thresh instead of vanishing\n\nYASUO\nWind Wall works as intended.\nNow all of those videos of Gold Card going through Wind Wall can be laid to rest.\nFixed a bug where certain targeted abilities (such as Twisted Fate&#039;s Pick-A-Card) would pass through Wind Wall as it spawned\nURGOT\nSo dark, so secret.\nFixed a bug where Noxian Corrosive Charge was granting too much vision for the duration.\n\nHEIMERDINGER\nToo bright for his own good.\nFixed a bug where Heimerdinger&#039;s grenade was granting too much vision for the duration.\n\nMINIONS\n\nJust some bugfixes for minions and their wacky behavior.\nThe only one that&#039;s worth calling out is the last one on the list - this was actually implemented in 5.22, and primarily helps melee vs ranged matchups with respect to basic attacks. Simply put, the &#039;call for help&#039; used to be around yourself and not the enemy, meaning that when they&#039;d harass you off the wave, your minions would often &#039;pretend&#039; not to notice as they went about their business. Now minions are more courageous and will actively watch for enemy harassment.\nMinions no longer freeze or awkwardly lock eyes with other minions\nMinions now display how much bonus damage or damage reduction they have from the pushing changes implemented in 5.23\nMinions no longer acquire new targets that are in the river or jungle, and if they enter the river or jungle they&#039;ll refuse to acquire any target until they leave. (Implemented in 5.22 but undocumented)\nNow additionally calls for help in a ring around your opponent when attacked near minions (implemented in 5.22 but undocumented)\n\nJUNGLE\n\nENCHANTMENT: RUNIC ECHOES\nRunic Echoes is a cheaper Luden&#039;s Echo for junglers. While it has less ability power and base damage, it restores a large portion of your missing mana on hitting a Large Monster - in addition to dealing bonus damage!\nIt&#039;s context time.\nWhen we introduced the Runeglaive enchantment in Season 5 it, like the incredible Zoot Suit, was specifically tailored for its time. In development, we took a hard look at all of the existing AP junglers and tried to deliver a finely-tuned item that would enable them beyond &quot;bundle of stats&quot; (with Fiddlesticks as an accepted casualty. Sorry Fiddle.). At that point, our view of AP junglers was fairly narrow and our goal was definitely &quot;solve for the present.&quot;\nThis season, we can take a more future-facing look at Runeglaive (now Runic Echoes). The introduction of Hunter&#039;s Talisman means we can solidify spell-casting as a core part of an AP jungler&#039;s rotation, so it makes more sense that Runic Echoes is an extension of that. Echoes should be a flat upgrade (or sidegrade, at worst) for most champions, to the point where we&#039;ll probably need to keep a close eye on the balance of that movement speed bonus. One additional issue we wanted to solve was to allow for late game scaling on an AP jungle item - something Runeglaive lacked due to its lower ratio in comparison to Lich Bane.\nOn the point of, &quot;Why not both?&quot; we&#039;ll go back to the discussion we had when we replaced Magus. Specifically, if the goal of Runic Echoes is to serve all AP junglers equivalently or better than Runeglaive, then Runeglaive either becomes another Ohmwrecker (sorry) or it&#039;s an &quot;alternative&quot; choice for a smaller subset of AP junglers that skews their balance on yet another axis. The question we asked was, &quot;What do we gain by keeping Runeglaive?&quot; and while the diversity option for a few champions was nice, we trade a lot of clarity in balance to keep two items that should functionally serve the same class.\nBUILD PATH Tier 2 Jungle Item + Amplifying Tome + Aether Wisp + 340 gold\nTOTAL COST 2625\nABILITY POWER 60\nMOVEMENT SPEED 10%\nUNIQUE PASSIVE\nEcho - Gain charges upon moving or casting. At full charges, the next spell hit expends all charges to deal 80 (+0.10 ability power) magic damage to up to 4 targets. This effect deals 250% damage to Large Monsters. Hitting a Large Monster with this effect will restore 18% of your missing mana.\n\nSMITE\nNo longer triggers spell effects.\nSmite&#039;s been through an interesting transformation. Once one of League&#039;s more &#039;vanilla&#039; spells, it&#039;s turned into a multi-charge, multi-augmented ability that provides tons of utility. While Smite&#039;s slowly crept up in strength, it was the introduction of Runic Echoes interaction with Smite where we finally needed to draw the line. Having an instant high-damage nuke is probably not in anyone&#039;s best interests.\nNo longer triggers spell effects (such as Spell Vamp or Rylai&#039;s Crystal Scepter)\n\nTIER 2 JUNGLE ITEMS\nCost down.\nJust some slight tuning to make these a bit more attractive/easy to upgrade compared to just buying the component of your enchantment (Caulfields, Aether Wisp, etc).\nCOST 1050 gold &rArr; 1000 gold\nMANA REGENERATION IN JUNGLE 150% &rArr; 180%\n\nRIFT HERALD\nDamage down.\nContinuing Rift Herald&#039;s welcome to the League by nudging his dream-crushing power down, bit by bit. It&#039;s a potent tool for pushing advantages, but so often the health cost for taking it is so high that teams still aren&#039;t sure when to go for it.\nBASE DAMAGE 105 &rArr; 95\n\n&#039;RAZOR SHARP&#039; RAPTOR BUFF\nRaptor&#039;s vision buff is more forgiving.\n\n2016 saw a change in the vision range of different types of wards, but not the trigger range of Razor Sharp (or for those of y&#039;all that don&#039;t read, the &#039;Raptor Vision Buff&#039;). Functionally this meant you could &lsquo;proc&rsquo; the ward-spotting buff without the ward even seeing you (leading to even more confusion when hunting down that pesky ward). No more! If it sees you, you should see it, and vice versa.\nFixed several bugs with Razor Sharp where it would not go off if the nearest enemy object was not a ward\nChanged trigger range from 1250 to 900 to better sync with the range of wards\nChanged trigger range for blue trinket wards from 1250 to 500 to better sync with the range of wards\n\nITEMS\n\nWARDING TOTEM\nCooldown lowered.\nOnce the staple trinket, Warding Totem&#039;s found itself feeling pretty mediocre compared to the Farsight Alteration. As we seek to adjust the balance between the two, dropping the lategame cooldown significantly ensures teams can access more consistent vision with a Warding Totem in their inventory.\nCOOLDOWN 180 seconds - 120 seconds (at levels 1-18) &rArr; 180 seconds - 90 seconds (at levels 1-18)\n\nFARSIGHT ALTERATION\nCooldown up.\nBy contrast, Farsight&#039;s dominance tends to warp the strategic game - putting more weight on its spot use as an in-fight or pre-fight reveal, but offering very little in the way of long-term vision to control objectives or jungle corridors. Farsight&#039;s effect is powerful enough that we&#039;re confident it&#039;ll still see use for what it does, but it shouldn&#039;t feel like your default option in 100% of games.\nACTIVE COOLDOWN 76 seconds - 60 seconds &rArr; 92 seconds - 60 seconds\n\nELIXIRS\nCan drink elixirs while dead.\nIf you&#039;re like us, you may have found it frustrating to respawn at a tense moment, delaying your battle charge by having to double-click an Elixir. Considering Elixirs are items too, we&#039;ve now made it so you purchase them while dead to get to your battle faster. Important note: if you buy an elixir while dead, it&#039;ll begin ticking down instantly, but the amount of time you have left to respawn will be added to the duration - so your elixirs always last the correct amount. Don&#039;t freak out!\nCan now be purchased while dead if your inventory is full (duration is increased by the amount left on your respawn timer)\n\nEYE OF THE OASIS\nMana regen down, CDR up.\nIf you&#039;re a support in 2016, mana regeneration&#039;s just about everywhere you look when it comes to full item builds. In the interest of providing supports with a different stat (while still keeping these items focused on spellcasting), we&#039;re trying out cooldown reduction to make them fit as smoothly as their Tier 3 brethren (Talisman of Ascension and Frost Queen&#039;s Claim, respectively).\nMANA REGENERATION 150% &rArr; 100%\nCOOLDOWN REDUCTION 0% &rArr; 10%\n\nEYE OF THE WATCHERS\nMana regen down, CDR up.\nIf you&#039;ve been watching for the context here, turn your eyes above.\nMANA REGENERATION 150% &rArr; 100%\nCOOLDOWN REDUCTION 0% &rArr; 10%\nFROST QUEEN&#039;S CLAIM\nLess mana regen. Slow now scales with distance.\nAh, Frost Queen&#039;s Claim. Even if you&#039;ve never bought it, you&#039;ve seen it - and the army of ghosts slowing you from across the universe. While potent as a form of vision control and a playmaker for spellcasting supports, this raw stat efficiency combined with crowd control made it far more ubiquitous than is healthy (when you start to see champions like Tank Maokai buying this, you know something&#039;s up). Cutting FQC&#039;s efficiency and impairing its use as a close-range sticking/peeling tool requires more pre-meditation on the part of it&#039;s user to get the same level of crowd control. We&#039;ll continue assessing if we need to tone down that spooky.\n\nMANA REGENERATION 150% &rArr; 100%\nSlow duration now scales between 2 and 5 seconds based on distance traveled\nGhosts get progressively more spooky as they travel\n\nSUNFIRE CAPE\nBring me my cape of suns.\nSunfire&#039;s often the odd-man out when compared to its cousins: Randuin&#039;s Omen and Dead Man&#039;s Plate. We&#039;re giving it a bump to feel like a real contender when shopping for physical protection.\nARMOR 45 &rArr; 50\nGUINSOO&#039;S RAGEBLADE\n\nBugfixes!\nRanged champions no longer activate Guinsoo&#039;s Rage on the same basic attack that grants them their eighth stack.\n\nPHANTOM DANCER\nShifted movement speed from Spectral Waltz to base movement speed.\nPhantom Dancer&#039;s intended niche as an item that enables you to seek out and duel champions is betrayed by losing Zeal&#039;s movement speed upon upgrading it. We&#039;d still like it to stay on the lower end when not hunting down dance partners, but giving back some strategic movement speed should keep it more than just a phantom.\nMOVEMENT SPEED 0% &rArr; 5%\nBONUS MOVEMENT SPEED NEAR ENEMIES 12% &rArr; 7%\n\nSTATIKK SHIV\nMore damage to minions.\nWhile trying to keep the relative balance between Zeal&#039;s upgrades, we decided Shiv was lagging behind as a waveclear option. No longer!\nBONUS DAMAGE TO MINIONS 75% &rArr; 120%\n\nRUNAAN&#039;S HURRICANE\nMore movement speed.\nSimilar to Statikk Shiv, Hurricane&#039;s getting a power boost to keep Zeal&#039;s upgrades close enough that you can use their unique effects (waveclear, teamfighting, kiting, or dueling) as the selling point, not their stats.\nMOVEMENT SPEED 5% &rArr; 7%\nAttack range from hitbox center &rArr; edge\n\nRAPID FIRECANNON\nSliiiiiightly less movement speed.\nThe last Zeal item to be touched, Rapid Firecannon is performing about as well as we&#039;d expect. As we were doing our unification pass to balance the four, we saw that 8% is higher than 7%, and that simply won&#039;t do.\nMOVEMENT SPEED 8% &rArr; 7%\nCan now be found in the item shop by searching &#039;RFC&#039;\n\nLORD DOMINIK&#039;S REGARDS\nMore bonus armor penetration!\nLast Whisper&#039;s upgrades don&#039;t have enough of a payoff, even when you&#039;d find their unique effects useful. Now investing gold into either the Giant Slayer or Executioner&#039;s upgrade will have a little more &#039;oomph&#039;.\nBONUS ARMOR PENETRATION 40% &rArr; 45%\n\nMORTAL REMINDER\nAlso more bonus armor penetration!\nYou can read the context for this directly above, just a reminder. A mortal reminder.\nBONUS ARMOR PENETRATION 40% &rArr; 45%\n\nTIAMAT\nCost down.\nCOMBINE COST 225 &rArr; 175\nTOTAL COST 1250 gold &rArr; 1200 gold\n\nRAVENOUS HYDRA\nCost down.\nThe Hydras are doing well once purchased, but often feel like they take forever to get completed. Along Tiamat&#039;s cost being shaved, a reduction in Ravenous Hydra should make them easier to complete.\nCOMBINE COST 1100 gold &rArr; 1050 gold\nTOTAL COST 3600 gold &rArr; 3500 gold\nTITANIC HYDRA Cost down.\nThis is the same context, only more Titanic.\nCOMBINE COST 750 gold &rArr; 700 gold\nTOTAL COST 3600 gold &rArr; 3500 gold\n\nDEATH&#039;S DANCE\nCost, attack damage, physical healing, damage reduction (and bleed damage taken) all increased.\nDeath&#039;s Dance is a truly unique effect that provides an even more unique fantasy: someone marked for death, doing everything they can to keep going beyond their final moments. As awesome as that sounds, DD&#039;s stat efficiency doesn&#039;t exactly set it up to support the champions and builds you&#039;d want it to. Sizing it up to better deliver on expectations.\nCOMBINE COST 525 gold &rArr; 625 gold\nATTACK DAMAGE 65 &rArr; 75\nHEALING 12% physical damage dealt &rArr; 15% physical damage dealt\nDAMAGE TO BLEED 12% &rArr; 15%\nMORE DANCE PARTNERS Fixed a bug where the heal wouldn&#039;t occur with some on-hit effects, such as Aatrox&#039;s W - Blood Price, Blade of the Ruined King, or the Hydras.\n\nMASTERIES\n\nFerocity and Stormraider&#039;s buffed, Precision nerfed.\nIf you&#039;ve played even a handful of games on patch 5.24, you probably learned the same thing we did - 8-10 Thunderlord&#039;s Decree per game is probably too many. Yet, no Thunderlord&#039;s changes. What gives?\nWhile Thunderlord&#039;s Decree is the go-to mastery when you&#039;re looking to dominate your lane, we&#039;re leaving it as-is for a few reasons. First, we&#039;re looking to it as a &#039;goalpost&#039; from which we balance the other keystones around. It&#039;s something you can easily play around, has a good amount of impact, and synergizes well with certain champion kits. Additionally, we&#039;re avoiding playing &#039;whack-a-mole&#039; with the Keystones (ie: just nerfing whichever is best at any given moment). By recognizing TD&#039;s strength and matching others to it, we build a better ecosystem for Keystones where you&#039;re free to adapt your builds, rather than just playing champions that abuse the best mastery.\nSo how are we tipping the scales? Injecting some strength back into Ferocity&#039;s Keystones while reverting buffs to Precision should help balance things out, no matter how you seek to deal your damage. Toss in a pretty spicy update to Stormraider&#039;s Surge and you have a wealth of options at your disposal. It&#039;s still possible that Thunderlords is over-tuned after all this, but bringing the others more in line with the leader should help us gauge how big the discrepancy is, rather than just cutting down the top over and over again.\n\nWARLORD&#039;S BLOODLUST\nLess healing early, but more early later. Attack speed up.\nHEAL ON CRITICAL STRIKE 15% of the damage dealt &rArr; 5-25% of the damage dealt (at levels 1-18)\nATTACK SPEED 20% &rArr; 30%\n\nFERVOR OF BATTLE\nDamage on-hit increased, stacks decreased.\nDAMAGE ON-HIT 1-8 (at levels 1-18) &rArr; 1-14 (at levels 1-18)\nMAXIMUM STACKS 10 &rArr; 8\n\nDEATHFIRE TOUCH\nAbility power and attack damage ratios increased.\nAD RATIO 0.5 bonus attack damage &rArr; 0.6 bonus attack damage\nAP RATIO 0.2 ability power &rArr; 0.25 ability power\n\nSTORMRAIDER&#039;S SURGE\nSpeed and window to activate increased. Now gives slow resistance.\nDAMAGE WINDOW 2 seconds &rArr; 2.5 seconds\nMOVEMENT SPEED 35% &rArr; 40%\nGain 75% slow resistance during Stormraider&#039;s Surge\n\nPRECISION\nArmor pen down.\nBASE ARMOR PENETRATION 5 &rArr; 3\nARMOR PENETRATION PER LEVEL 0.5 &rArr; 0.3\n\nSTRENGTH OF THE AGES\nHealth restore changed to percent maximum health.\nRestore 100 health &rArr; 6% of your maximum health when a nearby siege minion or large monster dies\n\nBOND OF STONE\nDamage reduction increased, but no longer doubles.\nDAMAGE REDUCTION 3% &rArr; 4%\nDamage reduction no longer doubles when near an ally\n\n\nTENACITY Now reduces the duration of disarms.\nFor those not in the loop, &#039;disarms&#039; are abilities that remove a player&#039;s ability to basic attack. While most cc does this (because you can&#039;t move period), Lulu&#039;s Whimsy and Amumu&#039;s Curse of the Sad Mummy are unique in that they either let you still move (in Lulu&#039;s case), or they let you cast spells (in Amumu&#039;s).\nSo we&#039;re calling them disarms. And now they&#039;re affected by Tenacity. The following abilities are affected by Tenacity:\nAMUMU - Curse of the Sad Mummy LULU - Whimsy\n\nHOWLING ABYSS\n\nVISION FIXES\nBack in 5.22, we did a large sweep and cleanup to how the terrain of Summoner&#039;s Rift impacted vision along their edges. Now it&#039;s been done for Howling Abyss! A little late for the holidays, but we bet the poros appreciate it anyways.\nGaining vision inside brush on Howling Abyss better reflects the reality of what is inside that brush.\nFixed the visuals of the brush on Howling Abyss to better reflect the boundaries of said brush. Back to top\n\nBUGFIXES\n\nSummoner names in the end of game screen have been reverted to white without glow effects\nFixed a bug where summoner names in the end of game screen weren&#039;t consistently graying out as players left the lobby\nFixed a bug where Ekko&#039;s Q - Timewinder sometimes dealt no damage on the way out at high levels of cooldown reduction\nQuinn&#039;s Q - Blinding Assault no longer causes several empowered basic attacks to miss\nJayce&#039;s buff from swapping to R - Mercury Cannon is no longer consumed without dealing damage when using W - Hyper Charge to attack a structure\nKassadin no longer gains E - Force Pulse stacks from the active of Frost Queen&#039;s Claim\nOrianna&#039;s E - Command: Protect bonus resistances are now properly multiplied by Windspeaker&#039;s Blessing\nFixed a bug where splitting mastery points between Piercing Thoughts and Battering Blows granted the incorrect amount of stats\nFixed a few cases of champions with Sated Devourer damaging themselves when using empowered basic attacks (ex. Ekko&#039;s E - Phase Dive or Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s Q - Queen&#039;s Wrath)\nLuden&#039;s Echo now procs if an ability cast at max stacks damages a target after its caster dies\nLiandry&#039;s Torment now properly deals increased damage to enemies affected by Ahri&#039;s E - Charm, Rammus&#039;s E - Puncturing Taunt and Shen&#039;s E - Shadow Dash\nSerrated Dirk&#039;s buff no longer occasionally consumes itself when granted by an empowered basic attack\nCinderhulk&#039;s burn effect now has an on-hover range indicator\nZz&#039;Rot Portal, Zeke&#039;s Herald and Face of the Mountain are now properly searchable by typing &quot;Active&quot; in the item shop\nMejai&#039;s Soulstealer has been added to the Mana tab of the item shop\nRestored custom flame tail particles on Foxfire Ahri\n\nUPCOMING SKINS\nTo commemorate the start of the 2016 season, Challenger Nidalee will be released later this patch!","replies":[]}
