Besides hourglass counters everything and cannot be an argument, oh and hell zed ult has 30s less cd than hourglass.\n\nCan we gut zed yet?Absolutely obnoxious to play against both in lane and out unless you have a janna on your team, oh but yeah the bronzies are too busy complaining about fizz whos not even nearly as broken.","replies":[]}
