It doesn't make them right but you can't discount it just because it is the popular complaint. They certainly shouldn't cater to every popular idea, but in this instance they dismissed the nature of the complaints and purposefully went in the opposite direction of the popular opinion. This change shows a sort of reverse bandwagon fallacy where because the popular opinion was one way, they went the other. \n\nAlso the caps isn't helping you make an argument any more.

Usually these go hand in hand, the distinct strengths a champion possesses will usually be attached to and based on that champions unique mechanics (as these tend to be what Riot balances around - typically these abilities are tuned very highly to make them impactful and rewarding).  I feel like there are two distinct problems here:\n1 - players complain about the distinct skills not because they are unique and they want champions homogenising, but because these skills are the most likely to be over-tuned. Relatedly, I feel like Riot's balance is philosophy is leaning towards ever more exaggerated high points / strengths - new champions and remakes tend to push things to the extreme in terms of what is acceptable balance wise, so many end up getting nerfed. Riot have talked about the arms race in top lane before but I feel like it's going on pretty much all the time, which is why we get new champions who come out and just dominate, then have to be nerfed significantly (Azir, Tahm, Kalista and Gnar being recent examples).\n2 - Riot are MUCH better at scoring distinct strengths than weaknesses or even distinct weaknesses. Take the juggernauts - they came out and most of them had to be nerfed because they had no real weakness, Azir was similar, low HP didn't really meaningfully stop him doing what he was capable of doing. While champions don't feel as overloaded as they did in the past - Irelia - instead they feel like their strengths overall cover their weaknesses too well, so while play is more fun as those champions counterplay is flatter (Fiora). So when you can't substantially counter those champions and then they hit you with their strength points you get frustrated. That's my take on things anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneakyy XD","date":"2015-12-13T21:43:25.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rW1mIRr9,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-13T01:49:48.510+0000)\n>\n> People tend to complain about the most distinctive things a champion does.

That's not the same though as believing that whatever a lot of people are saying is necessarily the right thing to do though.\n\nWhen you (Riot) nerf things like you did with Tahm, you end up completely destroying the champion (though in the case of Tahm, I'm fine with it) because you're going to end up nerfing his damage and durability anyway without reverting what you already did. Right now, the movement bonus he got meant nothing. Removing it did not reduce his power at all. When he inevitably receives changes to not have 200% health or a passive 44% damage reduction, that movement speed would have meant something, and he's not going to have it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lerazzo","date":"2015-12-13T21:26:29.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't Tahm's purpose to save allies though?
