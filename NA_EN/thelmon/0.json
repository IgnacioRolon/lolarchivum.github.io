This basically affects whether she becomes a bruiser or a marksman. \nSo if you don't level up skills, you basically have a champ that would only increase in, maybe, Mana per level.\n\nMina San - Gun-Fu Master\n\nLook: Young School Girl in Uniform (think Battle Royal) carying two handguns. The Handguns have blades on the top that extend past the tip of the gun (Red). \n\nWhen attacking beyond melee range, she attacks using bullets. When in melee range, she switches to hitting enemies with the blades on her guns.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Passive 1: Augmented Stance** - When attacking with ranged attacks, gains %AS\n\n**Passive 2: Augmented Stance** - When attacking with melee attacks, gains %AD\n\n**Q1: Fading Shot** - Shoot Twice at target while dashing backwards.\n\n      *Note:* Once a skill point goes into this path, passive 1 is chosen.\n\n**Q2: Strike Back** - (melee range) Attacks target twice and knocks them back a short distance.\n\n       *Note:* Once a skill point goes into this path, passive 2 is chosen.\n\n**W1: Target Vitals** - Shill shot that slows enemy champion for 3/4/5 seconds and deals XX damage. Upon landing the skillshot on an enemy champion, Mina gains a movement speed bonus for the duration of the slow.\n\n**W2: *Name* -** (Melee Range) Stuns target for one second while dealing XX damage. Mina cartwheels to behind the target.\n\n**E1: Bullet Time** - Does a Round off to back handspring to double back flip towards target location (Too much?). Dodges incoming projectiles and reduces damage from skills by 30%. After landing, has an attack speed boost for X seconds.\n\n**E2: Closing the Gap** - Runs towards target at great speeds. During run, incoming damage is reduced by 50%. Immune to stuns but vulnerable to slows and knock-ups, silence does not stop skill. (Can be canceled by inputting commands)\n\n**R1: Magic Bullets** - Infuses bullets with magic. Auto attacks deal XX (ad scaling) extra magic damage for 5/7/9 seconds\n\n**R2: Quick Blows** - (Melee Range) Hits target 2 times in rapid succession and finishes off with a knock-up dealing XX Physical Damage.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAs for stats and skill numbers, I'm up for suggestions. I'm not too good at that part. But base stats should probably be in the Marksmen Range (or a bit lower). And then skill paths could provide a set skill bonus plus per level skill bonuses to make up the difference. So basically you'd have a weaker than normal champ for the first three levels, but there's lots of champs that are weak for their first few levels, so it shouldn't be a problem as she would be caught up by level 3 (almost there by level 2 even). Some feedback would be great!\n\nPassives, not the greatest, but something that shows the duality of the champ.\n\nI'm thinking Q should affect the damage and Health Stats. W would affect AS. And E would affect Defense and Magic Resist. Maybe the Ults should give a little boost as well?\n\nMana or Energy, not sure which would be good. Probably mana, since energy may be op bot lane. Both have to run off the same thing though.\n\nAlso as for lore, I don't know anything. I just like trying to come up with champions and skills that would look/feel cool. If someone else wants to take this on, let me know and I will give you my blessing (I doubt a Japanese School Girl would fit into Runeterra, lol).","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-07-10T19:08:41.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is her name \"Everyone\"?\n\nDoes she have a cat named Nemo?","replies":[{"poster":"Thelmon","date":"2014-07-10T19:39:00.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, who knows.

They're just straight-up stat boosters; I feel like you could do something so much cooler with them. Additionally, her melee ult feels a lot like Xin's q.\n\nI'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how I would level up my skills right now, but depending on the tuning, it seems like one of two things would happen:\n\n- When picking skills, one would always be stronger than the other, regardless of whether you're building melee or ranged. I'm specifically thinking of W here: depending on how strong the slow/MS buff are, it might just always be better to get W1.\n- When picking skills, you'll always take the 2's if you're building melee and the 1's if you're building ranged.\n\nThis isn't bad, necessarily. Here's what I'm more concerned about: *you're probably making this choice in champ select.* If you're taking her to the adc role, you're probably going to build and skill as a marksman. If you're taking her jg, you'll probably build/skill as a bruiser. She could go either, in top, and I doubt she'd go mid in this meta. The fact remains: *even when you have a choice, you've probably decided in champ select.* It's not a choice like, \"Go bruiser if you're losing lane, carry if you're winning.\" So, that begs the question: **If you're going to choose your skill path and build in champ select, why not just split her into two separate champs?** My suggestion:\n\n>Each time Mina levels up a skill, she can choose whether to put it in the first or second path. Previous points in the ability are converted to the path that most recently received points. *Ex: Mina has a rank 2 Q1. She levels up, and puts a point in Q2. She now has a rank 3 Q2.*\n\nThis way, she can actually adapt to the circumstances and fill either role more or less on demand.\n\nMy final concern is that her melee kit seems really binary, like she'll almost always run the exact same combo: E2 to gapclose, W2 to get behind them, Q2 to knock them back towards your team. I could see the knockback being used defensively, occasionally, but that's about it.\n\nAs an aside, E1, *Bullet Time,* has the same name as Miss Fortune's ult.\n\nAlso, Frozen Mallet seems like it'd be *really* strong on Mina.\n\n---\n\nNow that I've given my criticism, let me say that I *love* [duality](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/VJv9QEEA-champion-concept-eclipse-the-true-heretic-reworked) in champs, that this concept seems really cool, and has the potential for tons of different builds (which I also love - AD bruiser Karma FTW!) and that I'd love to see where it continues to go.\n\nBest of luck,  \nHyrum Graff","replies":[{"poster":"Thelmon","date":"2014-07-10T15:29:07.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I threw the champ together more to get the idea/concept out than actually the champ. Although I do love the idea of Gun-Fu/Gun-Kata which seemed to work really well with this.\n\nThat would be neat to be able to switch back and forth between skill paths, however; it would be a bit confusing and potentially chaotic, especially since (done my way) the skills are supposed to be what provide your champions stats and per level stats.\n\nMy vision was this:\n\n * ADC, you would want to go path 1 on all skills because each skill would provide higher boosts in AD and AS with minor health and defense (sort of like a passive on all skills that increases stats, but since the character has no natural stat scaling, it would even out).\n \n\n * Bruiser would want to build all path 2 because all those skills would provide higher boosts in health and defense with minor boosts in AD and AS\n\n\nSo to be able to switch between a bruiser role and a marsmen role halfway through the game (stats and all) could be quite a shock to both yours and the enemy team.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat being said, the reason I posted on the other board for not chosing to make two characters was this. In champion select, you and your team knows how you will build the character, but the other team will not. And since this character would have to potentiall to go to almost three different places and be viable, it would keep the enemy team guessing and allow you to still counter pick them even when they try to counter pick you.\n\n----------------\n\nAs for your idea of being able to switch skills, that may be more handy on a Mage with this concept. Having one set of skills be more CC oriented while the other set is more damage oriented. Or even the same skills, but with different ratios depending on what the team needs, longer cc or more damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-07-10T15:40:23.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">swapping between roles mid-game is a shock -snip-\n\nWell, kind of. For one, it'll take you 4 levels to switch all your skills - that's a considerable amount of time. For another, your items will stay the same, so you hopefully it won't be *that* drastic of a change.\n\n>Champ select options -snip-\n\nOk, this is a fair point. I just think it'd be cooler to have things you can do in-game with such an awesome concept, too.\n\n>Mage\n\nI'd love to see a mage with skill paths, too!","replies":[{"poster":"Thelmon","date":"2014-07-10T15:56:33.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, one idea I had thought of, actually because of this/people messing up skills.\n\nBeing able to refund skill points if skills are still only level 1. This way if you accidentally put a skill point into one skill you could change your choice. This would give some flexibility up until around level 4-5.\n\nOnly thing would be switching between skills while fighting/to take advantage of early cooldowns. To solve this, after switching skills, all skills go on cooldown or at least half cooldown.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Thelmon","date":"2014-07-09T23:07:31.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hereby release all rights to this idea to Riot.

Assuming the roles are complete opposites though, one wants AS and AD and the other wants health and defense, it shouldn't be too much of an issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrueShrike","date":"2014-07-10T10:14:21.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swordchucks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thelmon","date":"2014-07-09T17:07:43.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it bad?
