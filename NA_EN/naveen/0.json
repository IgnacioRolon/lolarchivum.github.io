It started off as slight drops that were pretty noticeable to me (120 - 90/100) and ive been trying to fix it since.  I tried reinstalling/redownloading it but that didnt help.  I thought it could be a driver issue with a security update from windows from 2 days ago so I did a clean install of windows 10 but, that is what made it turn into this single fps situation.  I have already disabled the XBOX DVR, and the only thing i have installed since the clean install is chrome and league.  \r\n\r\nIm guessing something happened to my CPU as now after the clean install it has caused league to take up 100% cpu.  Or something with the 7.1 patch is causing it.\r\n\r\nI have a 1060 6GB and an i5 6100 and my gpu is up to date in drivers.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T04:44:43.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're having issues with both your framerate and CPU usage, I suspect there may be some issues with your system drivers or windows power settings. I'd recommend updating all your drivers (not just display) and running all available windows updates before working through our [**FPS Troubleshooting Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to address the most common solutions.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
