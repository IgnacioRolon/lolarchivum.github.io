Right now i'm covering mid lane but im an EUW player, so my ping is not ideal. I'd be taking a coach role assuming we got the 2 players we need as i am a platinum/diamond EUW player who also casts, so what i lack in mechanics i make up for in game knowledge. We would basically be looking for just players but if you do shotcall, feel free to give it a shot (no pun intended)\r\n\r\nRight now we have a duo bot lane consisting of hi lm DC and Dekroth, who have played together for a very very long time and are a great duo. The ADC typically plays graves and caitlyn right now and the support prefers morgana and braum but can branch out to thresh and leona easily.\r\nThe Jungler is Phantom, he is an avid Vi player who has pretty decent shotcalling right now, he is a very calm player and help maintain a friendly attitude that is pretty vital to the team.\r\n\r\nI'll say it now, if you have the tendancy to flame, this team isn't for you. Whilst we enter tourneys that give RP and real money in cases and scrim a lot (We are fairly serious) we dont condone flaming and we do not want it to be a part of our teams ethos. \r\n\r\nIf you match this criteria, please feel free to comment below and write your application in this format!\r\n\r\nFirst Name:\r\nIn game name:\r\nPosition:\r\nRank Season 4:\r\nCurrent rank:\r\nHave you played in a team before? if yes, why did you end up leaving:\r\nDo you have Skype?

I just lacked the fact of having teamates that were dedicated enough, did not tilt, and were just almost unwilling to learn. So then nothing was improving I had to end up kicking most everybody and switch out the roster to search for potential but every time I came up empty handed. Its not because of the fact that \"My team is just so bad\" or anything related to that. But they just were not able to either stay level headed or tilt when things are going bad, improve communication at all, and were too stubborn to learn.\nDo you have Skype?
