Nerf her damage, she has too much of it. And give her q half mana back. I love when Annie has +50 cs because she can literally spam q on a minion to make sure she gets it. No to mention, haven&rsquo;t you noticed way more Rank 7 Annies? Yeah. Surprised riot hasn&rsquo;t done anything about this crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Warpes","date":"2016-08-13T13:25:52.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zen Winds,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v4AlwViE,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-08-13T12:05:25.853+0000)\n> \n>Last time I checked there was counterplay against a burst mage but Annie literally walks up to you and 1 shots you with no counterplay.\n\n{{item:1057}} {{item:3155}} {{item:3029}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3105}}\n\nIs this really so difficult for kids to figure out?...\n\n\n>No to mention, haven’t you noticed way more Rank 7 Annies?

She's always been a bitch to deal with. I don't really fully agree with your points though.\n\nShe is easily able to farm with her q, but she is unable to zone as effectively due to her lack of stun being up constantly. If she is bullying you away from your minion wave, harass her and farm under turret. Her stun is easily visible; the counter play is knowing that she is able to stun and that she cannot push the lane well while trying to pick you off. I know that's not much of a consolation, but hey, it's about as much as gettin bursted by any other Mage because they landed a single skill shot (lux anyone?)","replies":[]}]}
