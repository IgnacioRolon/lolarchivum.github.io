I tried every solution out there. I think it might have to do with an app called Covenant Eyes. Does Covenant Eyes prevent my chat service from logging in? Or is there another solution out there?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T23:44:49.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This problem can usually be caused by a network issue that's failing to reach the chat servers.  I'm not familiar with the app, so I couldn't say if it was the culprit for sure.  The best way to find out would be to disable it.  I also recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, which provides some great steps towards getting this fixed up.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
