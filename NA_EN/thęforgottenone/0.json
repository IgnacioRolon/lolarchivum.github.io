All of his attacking quotes are gone with the exception of maybe two. All movement quotes are still present. Any game I enter with this skin, he does not talk in combat.\n\n1. Attack minions, champions or anything with basic attacks or abilities.\n2. Blood Lord Vladimir does not speak.\n\nI&#039;ve played two games with this skin after Patch 7.2 came out, and this has happened each time. \n\nI just got this skin and this is ruining it. Please, fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-30T21:53:29.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi hi! \n\nThanks for the report! Off the top of my head, I can't think of something that would haven broken it, but I checked it out in game, and I'm also not hearing the quotes. I'll poke around this week and see what's going on! :)","replies":[{"poster":"ThęForgottenOne","date":"2017-01-31T05:17:33.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there an estimate as to when this bug will be fixed?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-31T17:13:13.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately not. We generally don't give ETAs because things could change internally. I logged the issue yesterday, and will be speaking to an audio engineer today.

We would also need to do testing around the issue to ensure the fix works and that nothing else broke. For example, we would test the same audio for all Vlad skins. I say not in 7.3 because we're already packaging everything up, and we wouldn't submit changes this late.","replies":[{"poster":"ThęForgottenOne","date":"2017-02-04T03:34:02.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you please, please find a way to make it into the next patch? This is a legendary skin that I needed twenty dollars worth of RP just to buy. It's an old legendary skin and isn't even completely worth that price due to it not having many of the features that a modern legendary would have. I buy this and it is now bugged and wont be fixed for more than a patch. It isn't fair, I waited so long to get this skin. I don't want to have to wait that long to be able to use the skin again. This bug really ruins the skin and I really don't want to use it till it is fixed. Please, at least by next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-02-06T17:39:54.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, but it won't be in the next patch.

We only patch out things mid patch that are disrupting gameplay, such as an exploit.\n\nAs I've mentioned, there is an audio engineer looking into the issue, and it may appear that there are long pauses at the end of each line, causing them not to play frequently. \n\nThis is similar to someone with VO processing like Reaper Soraka; if you try to spam her emotes, you may get the animation, but not the VO line, because the initial line hasn't finished playing/trailing off. \n\nThat said, we need to discuss with all regions what they'd like to do, as VO issues like this generally affect all languages, not just English, because it would mean editing the files, as opposed to simply hooking them up again. \n\nAs it stands right now, we do not have a fix that we're comfortable with/has been implemented.
