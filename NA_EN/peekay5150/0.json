I just wanted to share how insanely easy it is to get banned in today&rsquo;s age of crying kids who were told they were snowflakes their entire life and can&rsquo;t take anything negative happening in their safety bubble. \r\n\r\nWhat&rsquo;s in the text? Sarcastic passive aggressive dick I guess would be the worst thing I can muster, in addition to a teammate saying GJ were applicable and communicating game information. You might not agree with me, but I&rsquo;d like someone human to read the text below (taken from behavior card) and tell me from their heart it&rsquo;s worth a PERMANENT ban. \r\n\r\nNo cursing, no &quot;kill yourself&quot; or ridiculous comments similar to that, no AFKing in base buying tears, no intentional dying running down mid...literally me telling the mid-laner to stop AFK CSing and roam and then at different times trying to communicate things like &quot;DOINT LET THEM BACK - GPO IS TROPING&quot; which obviously has typos as I&#039;m trying to WIN the game so typing at the same time is hard. Communicating our Gangplank had Teleported to their bot lane nexus turrets for backdoor and we were skirmishing with them mid so of course wanted to stop their backs to let GP win. We won btw, feel free to look at the OP.GG and I was 6/12/10 doing my best to peel for the Jhin/Corki because I was the closest thing we had to a &quot;tank&quot; as Vi so obviously it&#039;s a more prone death job then sitting back and tossing an ability or split pushing.  Enjoy, you won&rsquo;t see me on the Rift and are now safe from my evil psychopath tendencies clearly displayed in the text to follow.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nGodBless5150: afkj corki nice\r\nGodBless5150:
