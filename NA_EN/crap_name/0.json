His q gives him good early attack speed versus camps. His spellshield allows him to enter a lane and requires more than 1 cc to delay him. If you manage to fear a target in lane you almost have a certain successful gank.\n{{champion:120}} Has very good jungle clear with two AoE abilities. Can use his charge to get across the map faster or to force a gank. Generally if the enemy is pushed up and you charge, you can still catch them even through wards. Though you can be cc'ed when charging in, and you knock somebody back that you hit instead of completely disabling them.\n\nThe short of that, they both can get through the jungle without a ton of trouble and have decent ganks.\n\nThe champions ultimate abilities are what really differentiate them.\n\n{{champion:56}} Can dive an opponent from far away or jump past the enemy frontline when in a teamfight, attempting to assassinate a high priority target.\n\n{{champion:120}} Dashes into the enemy team and fearing them. He can potentially interrupt an entire team, which gives him the ability to completely turn a team fight much like an ult from {{champion:1}}  or {{champion:61}} .\n\nThese abilities also reflect how the champions are generally built, with nocturne building some damage to take out a target and have a little defense while hecarim generally builds decently tanky so that he can initiate the fights.\n\nSo, do you want to be an assassin that can take out a high priority target? Nocturne is a good choice. Do you want to potentially turn an entire teamfight with one well placed ability? Try hecarim. \n\nNocturne is an assassin and duelist at heart, while hecarim is an AoE teamfighter.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"crap name","date":"2015-02-15T14:19:17.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx alot for the clear explanation on the differences on their play style, really helped me out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DoraTheBrown","date":"2015-02-14T15:37:00.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their both easy, but I would choose hec since he has better presence early.
