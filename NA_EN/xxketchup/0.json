I looked it up before to see if anyone else had the same problem and it said something about Xbox game bar limiting it and having to turn it off to let it go free, so I tried to log into that to try and get rid of it. But it  won't let me log on to it, it kept saying \"We can't sign you in right now\"  and I tried everything I knew and possibly could. What should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Man In Sky","date":"2017-03-19T22:36:30.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's the game bar through the Xbox app. That fixed it for me when it happened","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-19T21:57:31.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like you're getting this locked FPS due to the Windows 10 game bar update.
