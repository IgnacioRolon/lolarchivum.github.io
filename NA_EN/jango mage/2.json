I agree AD tends to be favored over AP but I feel that from general things like runes it has to be tilted that way. not everyone can use ap but everyone can use ad. Now mages are in need of more keystones, it just has to be something impactful but not giving burst damage or sustained damage or else other roles will use it better. Comet works because it does neither but instead does moderate aoe damage that has lower cd for landing abilities. Try to think of this if you ever try and make a mage only keystone. Also it has to be ranged or else it just becomes and ambient tank rune kind of how it is now in some cases top lane.\nAlso if you want to I have a post from a couple month ago you can read about how itemization did the same thing.
