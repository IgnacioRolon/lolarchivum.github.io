Been playing for about 4 months now(?), give or take a month since I only play maybe once a week (twice if I have the time). For anyone that is curious, yes I do have a life, no I&#039;m not living with my parents. I have a full time job and working for my career so games are only a luxury for me and I prefer not to waste my time with a game that is not only filled with children but also punishes you for giving criticism. \r\n\r\nThis is probably the only game I&#039;ve played that punishes you for the smallest of things; the censorship is off the scales. Believe me, I&#039;ve been around online games for a loooong time, think back to Silkroad Online days when it was actually good and free of botting. I&#039;m going to post my &quot;3 game offense&quot; that landed me a 2 week suspension. Nice job riot, guess I&#039;ll be dropping this game which is a shame since the game play is simply phenomenal. Unfortunately the community is filled with nasty people that intentionally throw games to get a reaction. \r\n\r\nI know I know, I&#039;m familiar with the &quot;maybe they are just bad players and are not intentionally feeding.&quot; Unless you call running down mid 7 times in less than 5 minutes, afking in the fountain while being a keyboard warrior, and constantly spamming taunt/laugh/jokes next to team mates for the majority of the game is just &quot;bad at the game&quot; then I truly did make the right decision to leave this game. Here is my &quot;offense log&quot;, I&#039;m level 20:\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPlastic Tier 4: i got\r\nPlastic Tier 4: its ok\r\nPlastic Tier 4: how did you not get him\r\nPlastic Tier 4: and?\r\nPlastic

you dont have any team play\r\nPlastic Tier 4: i didnt make any bad plays\r\nPlastic Tier 4: you didnt even get jump lvl 2\r\nPlastic Tier 4: idk why\r\nPlastic Tier 4: that is trist&#039;s main

dunno how you&#039;re gonna report me for your feeding\r\nPlastic Tier 4: in addition im not gonna lane with someone that doesnt help and doesnt know how to put points into abilities\r\nPlastic Tier

pointed out the fact you dont have more kills than me\r\nPlastic Tier 4: better than you doing nothing\r\nPlastic Tier 4: and you are playing the actual adc role\r\nPlastic Tier 4: so stop afking in fountain\r\n\r\nGame 3\r\nPlastic Tier 4: why do you guys keep coming to the lane im in?\r\nPlastic Tier 4: made me get so behind\r\nPlastic Tier 4: no mid cause you screwed me\r\nPlastic Tier 4: by making me go bot\r\nPlastic Tier 4: and taking my cs\r\nPlastic Tier 4: yeah i did\r\nPlastic Tier 4: and i was up 15 cs\r\nPlastic Tier 4: easy\r\nPlastic Tier 4: then you 2 came to my lane and screwed me over\r\nPlastic Tier 4: gl with report\r\nPlastic Tier 4: bot lane screwed me so hard\r\nPlastic Tier 4: no\r\nPlastic Tier 4: bot lane took over my lane\r\nPlastic Tier 4: and took all my cs\r\nPlastic Tier 4: no\r\nPlastic Tier 4: YOU made it hard\r\nPlastic Tier 4: you died to jax\r\nPlastic Tier 4: in his jungle\r\nPlastic Tier 4: you snowballed him\r\nPlastic Tier 4: you tried to solo invade with no wards\r\nPlastic Tier 4: and died for it\r\nPlastic Tier 4: gj eve\r\nPlastic Tier 4: says the eve that fed my lane\r\nPlastic Tier 4: you ran into morg 3 times\r\nPlastic Tier 4: eve your autolock lost us the game\r\nPlastic Tier 4: dont play a role you&#039;re not familiar with\r\nPlastic Tier 4: you, kog, and ali can enjoy your report\r\nPlastic Tier 4: gl\r\nPlastic Tier 4:

complain\r\n\r\nGo ahead, call me an idiot, bitch, retard, anything you want for typing &quot;ff&quot; and &quot;gl with report&quot; multiple times. I&#039;m familiar with the terms &amp; agreement and am fully aware you **can** be punished for saying those 2 phrases specifically, however, **it is not an automatic offense**, something that most people fail to understand. From what I read from in the past, people who have been pardoned from punishment _even though they broke the terms &amp; agreement_ were pardoned due to being provoked. I guess riot doesn&#039;t care anymore and punishes regardless? Someone can enlighten me on that.\r\n\r\nBut yes, 2 week ban and this is my one and only offense. Call this a rant or me being a whiny little bitch, I can take it xD This is more of a record for myself and reference for anyone that is curious how Riot handles censorship. As my title suggest, from this &quot;offense&quot; alone, I think it&#039;s safe to say the only way to skirt by the system without landing a punishment is to say as little as possible and must be positive connotation. Must not be able to be interpreted negatively so I&#039;d stay away from neutral statements, too much of a risk. The only things I recommend people new to this game to say are &quot;good game well played (gg wp)&quot; &quot;good luck have fun (gl hf)&quot; &quot;good job (gj)&quot; &quot;nice&quot; and calling out summoner spells/objectives such as &quot;Janna flash (janna f)&quot; &quot;Malphite teleport (malph t)&quot; &quot;dragon up in 1m&quot; etc.\r\n\r\nWell, I wish everyone luck with this game. It&#039;s unfortunate how negative the community is, but even more so, tragic how censored the game has become. Onwards to Overwatch for me.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-07-14T23:31:30.186+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The punishment system works based off the percentage of reports you gets.\n\nYou're right, absolutely everyone has been toxic in at least one game. But you need to be consistently negative, getting reported in at least half your games,  to get a punishment. \n\nIf you don't want to reform your behavior and try to be respectful in game, go ahead, stop playing.

After you explain, please elaborate on why it is a 2 week suspension especially since this is a first offense. If a rioter on this forum would like to confirm that, be my guest I have nothing to hide. In addition, according to what you just said \"we don't need that kind of negativity in our games\" and \"absolutely everyone has been toxic in at least one game\" then everyone should be punished. There is no indication and no information that backs up your statement of \"getting reported in at least half your games, to get punishment.\" Please provide a link for your source. If you can't provide a link then you are displaying negativity by falsely accusing me of \"displaying negative behavior\" in \"at least half\" of my games. An easily reportable offense according to the Terms & Agreement. I'm glad to leave if this is the hositlity that I suspected, thank you for confirming that.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-07-15T00:56:48.955+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a support article about the Instant Feedback system. Sorry for not linking it earlier, I sometimes forget people have no reason to believe me.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286\n\nFrom the first sentence, \"The League of Legends community is empowered to report players they believe have violated the Summoner's Code and **consistently** created a negative experience in games.\"\n\n50% is a guessed minimum. Riot will never tell us the exact % of reports you need to get punished, because they don't want players gaming the report system. The end goal is to eradicate toxicity, not have it in only a certain % of games. Considering only 5% of the population ever get so much as a chat restriction, it is safe to say that number is quite high.\n\nAnyway, as the support article says, you can be escalated to a 2 week ban if you're particularly offensive. Which happened in this case. I think you know very well what's toxic about what you said, but to give a clean definition: If the intention of the line of chat was to harass, coerce, threaten, or mock any player, it was against the summoner's code. \n\nI think it's worth saying, reforming isn't that difficult once you get used to it. You do have the general idea: keep communication neutral or positive, and you'll be fine. If you like the game, you totally should try to be less inflammatory. Just like the community doesn't need negativity, it needs good community members too.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Plastic Tier 4","date":"2016-07-15T01:28:19.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you very much for the reply and I greatly appreciate the linked source. I find it disturbing how censored this game is if what I surmised is true (which you have just confirmed as well with the whole neutral/positive communication). Does this censorship not bother you? I fail to understand how my words in those 3 games were displaying negative behavior and deserved a 2 week ban, however, if my definition of negative behavior is not the same as riot's then it's possible I'll commit the same mistakes in the future without even realizing. Perhaps my decision to leave is the right one then?\n\nJust to give more information, no I do not know anything about how I was toxic since I had no intention of provocation or harassment. I merely pointed out what happened, for example, the trist that I was supporting had initiated an all in on the enemy adc and I collapsed on her. While trist was preoccupied with the enemy support I managed to chunk out the enemy adc down to 23 hp. Trist had more than half hp (I forgot exact amount sorry) and continued to attack the enemy support instead of the adc (trist was right next to her no more than 3 creeps away). Enemy adc flashed away and I turned my eyes to trist waiting for her to jump to get the kill. Absolutely nothing... thus I made note of it and I was met with \"stfu idiot\" and a slew of keyboard-warrior esque lines.\n\nThat's just one example but if you can please explain to me how I was toxic and why this chat log = 2 week ban. This is a first offense and I'm only lvl 20. If you truly believe that riot was right in giving me this 2 week ban then I'm definitely leaving this game for good. No sane person would stay and leash themselves to \"reform\" (hardly reformation, just censoring); that's just masochistic. The first line of yoru last paragraph concerns me, \"reforming isn't that difficult once you get used to it.\" That alone should scream red flag, by definition that is conditioning. I don't know what it means to be \"less inflammatory\" which is why I keep asking people on this thread what I did wrong. This is how I am in every other game that I've played and yet this is the only game to not only be punished for it, but to be given a **harsh** punishment (imo).","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-07-15T01:40:20.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, the ban was just.

No need to passive aggressively point out how they fucked up. another way you could have said this, if you wanted to say anything at all, is \"you should wait until we have vision on the enemy jg before you counter jungle in the future.\" Or something along those lines. Actually give constructive criticism and advice on how to improve if you feel the need to say anything rather than just calling them out.\n\n> Plastic Tier 4: says the eve that fed my lane\n> Plastic Tier 4: you ran into morg 3 times\n> Plastic Tier 4: eve your autolock lost us the game\n\nIt didn't. They made some bad plays, but they hardly lost the game. Rather than blame them, ask yourself \"how could I have done this better?\" It's possible to win games even when behind in lane. \n\n> Plastic Tier 4: dont play a role you&amp;#039;re not familiar with\n\nHow do you want them to ever get familiar with a role if they don't play it? \n\n> Plastic Tier 4: you, kog, and ali can enjoy your report\n\nFor what, exactly? Having a bad game? Read what each report is actually for.\n\n> Plastic Tier 4: gl\n> Plastic Tier 4: gg wp\n> Plastic Tier 4: you&amp;#039;re welcome that eve trolled\n> Plastic Tier 4: auto lock\n\nAgain, calling out your team mates. It's not helping anyone and only serves to make them feel worse.\n\n\nI hope this helps you realize how the things you say are rude or toxic. Maybe you can work on improving your attitude in game, and being more positive in the future, or just not saying anything at all if you want to say something negative.

You've merely confirmed the toxicity of the LoL community which gives me more leverage to show potentially new players to stay away from this game. I guess it's true that meeting a new player in the lower levels is practically a myth now. Is it all just made up of the same players on smurf accounts?\n\nYou also brought up my skill level which I'm confused by. I have a 50% win rate, albeit, I'm only lvl 20 with a little over 70 games played with at least a quarter of those losses due to intentional trolling.

You cannot buy a \"new car\" with cash in this day and age. They only do it by credit card and in monthly payments **if** your credit score checks out (note this is for factory new cars). I would know since I'm currently leasing a Honda CR-V. So you are either bsing hardcore, the car is actually a used car (which you can do with cash) either from a used cars dealer or craigslist, or you were played by the salesmen into believing your car is new in which case... my condolences. \n\nAs for your age, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt even though your level of language is not exactly of that age group. But that could be attributed to a negative personality regardless of age thus my judgement. And you've been with your gf for years now? I'll call bull, but in the case that's true... dude wtf are you doing? Grow some balls and get serious already. You _should_ be finacially secured already if your statement of 5 years working is true so what could be holding you back? You insecure at age 28?

I have no desire to get married, nor does my girlfriend of 4 years (we celebrated our anniversary back in May). I am completely financially secure, but have no desire to marry or have children. We have a mutually beneficial and loving relationship, and feel no need to have our names on a piece of paper to validate what we already know. The only reason I brought up your skill level is this- Might you have trolls on your team? Sure. Might you have leavers? Sure. Might you have ragers? Sure. But even if someone leaves, level 20 is easy to win 4 v 5 if you know what you're doing. Everyone was new to the game once, so I'm not blaming you for that. I'm simply saying that, instead of spending so much time typing, telling your team mates what they did wrong, you should learn to establish vision, how to properly cs, manage a wave, orb walk. Until you get to diamond or higher, there's too many things that you as an individual player need to work on. So much, that nothing about your team mate's actions affect the game as much as yours do. I have a level 12 account that I would gladly play with you on. I'd even show you a thing or two if you were interested. But your logs WERE toxic. And no, I have no desire to go through line by line and cite anything. I don't need to. You haven't had a single player defend you on this post. That's not because WE'RE toxic.

You got played, hard. I respect your private life so I wont make any comment regarding it, I wish you and your gf a happy life. Moving on to your other comments, you are correct in thinking a 4v5 is easy to win. In fact the last game I played had my orianna leave at 23 minutes in (she was 5/12/10 anyways so she wasn't much help to begin with). However, the main difference you failed to make note of is that in order to win a 4v5, all 4 players **must want to win** which in my orianna game, was true. Not in the games listed here though so I'm sorry but your point is only valid a very specific scenario. If anyone one of the 4 players decides to give up and do whatever (which is exactly what happened in 2 of these 3 games) then you can kiss your chance of winning good bye. No amount of skill will win you a 3v6.\n\nI linked my op.gg game so that should lay to rest your speculation about my play style. Even though this is my one and only account and I've only been playing for 4 months, this game is so easy. I have enough confidence (and my scores in my match history shows it) to easily beat platinum players at minimum. I'm being arrogant I know, but you were speaking out of arrogance as well thinking you're better than me and thus know more than me. That is not your fault though since you didn't have my match history in front of you.\n\nYou didn't explain how my logs were toxic so please elaborate. If the whole world says the earth is Flat and you say the Earth is round are you going to change your mind and agree with them? History has concrete proof that the minority can, and often is, right.

You need to take your own advice and practice what you preach; you're being very hypocritical and downright ignorant.\n\nSad that a season 2 veteran is getting schooled by a first timer who hasn't even been playing for a half a year. You can't teach an old dog new tricks huh?\n\nOh yeah, btw I brought up the issue with riot and they apologized profusely about the suspension.

Honestly its a judgement call depending on how the laning phase is going and you really shouldn't have been that much of an ass about it.  The fact that you bring it up over and over and over doesn't do anyone any good.  The only reason you did it was to piss your allies off.  You really shouldn't be flaming people regarding optimal builds/abilities/runes/masteries because you've only been playing the game a couple months and still don't know that much about the game.  Instead of berating the Trist for not having jump you should have been telling your jungler that bot lane doesn't have flash and they are an easy gank.  Then you could have picked up a pink ward to make sure they didn't ward river and guarantee a double kill when their bot lane pushed up (which they would do since everyone mindlessly pushes lanes.)\n\nGame 2\nBerating people for not paying attention.  No real point to do it.  Did you even ping them?\nSaying someone is \"intentionally feeding\" when they are 0/1/0 is pretty absurd.  \nIt is not uncommon for a support lux to do better than the ADC, especially in the early game.  If you had some decent game knowledge you would know that.  The whole reason why ADC's need supports early game is they are really fragile early game but scale incredibly well.  This is especially true on late game carries like Jinx and Tristana.\n\nGame 3\nWhy did bot lane come mid?  Did they take their tower?  If so then that is the right call.  They should come mid after taking their tower to knock down mid tower so you can snowball the gold lead.  Tower gold is much, much more than a few CS.\nInvading as Eve is usually a good idea level 2 (or later.)  A decent amount of the time she can pick up first blood and really put their jungler behind.  So what if she messed up?  You're playing in NORMAL games the whole point of NORMAL games is to learn champions.  People are going to mess up and do stupid stuff.  If you can't just laugh it off and have fun then you should quit now.  How'd you like it if I berated you anytime you tried a new champ or made a mistake?\n\nClosing thoughts\nYou are new to this game.  You need to accept the fact that you don't know everything about the game.  Since you don't know everything about the game you shouldn't berate people for making questionable choices.  Most of the stuff you raged at people over were perfectly reasonable calls.  No decision in league is 100% right 100% of the time.  Just because someone makes a call and it doesn't work out doesn't mean it wasn't the right call.  Sometimes its worth the risk if the reward is great enough.\n\nHonestly you need to just chill out.  You're acting like you're diamond when you are brand new to the game  Nothing you said was of value to your team.  It was just you whining and complaining.  What would you do if someone at work never contributed anything positive to the discussion and just whined and complained all the time.  You'd probably ostracize that bastard and if you were his boss you'd look for an excuse to fire him.  That's what league is doing to you now.  Unless you have something useful or productive to say then you shouldn't type anything at all.  If you were in my games I would have muted you and reported you.  Not because you \"hurt my feelings\" or because \"I'm a child\" (actually I'm 30) but because you're acting like an ass and I really don't like putting up with that.  Video games are a luxury for me too.  I deal with enough assholes in real life, I don't need them when I'm trying to relax and play video games as well.\n\nITS A FREAKING GAME.  Laugh and have fun.  If your allies do stupid stuff laugh it off or give them useful advice rather than just berating them.  If you can't do that then find a new game to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2016-07-15T06:11:43.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're so toxic that you're even delusional enough to not see it","replies":[]}]}
