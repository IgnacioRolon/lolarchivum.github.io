We were hitting the blue and he started pinging me with the exclamation sign. I didn't really got what he meant, I guessed he was worried about me getting the last hit, which of course I wouldn't do. I continued leashing and he just went away and left the blue hit me. Then he came to bot lane and managed to get every CS with his skills. As and adc  I couldn't get much cs which led to lose the lane.\r\n\r\nBefore the game ends he started insulting me and typing in ALL chat. I reported him but I don't think it will be enough so here I put the evidence so a moderator can ban him or something.\r\n\r\ngreetings","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T01:06:53.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't manually take reports from the boards since the game that it happened in isn't linked in any way.
