I have recently been trying to to focus on rankeds to get to diamond by the end of this season. I have won about 70% of my last 20 games and hit plat 1. I have just ended my last game and there is an issue. I am only getting 16-17 LP for win and loose 21 lp per loss. What is going on? Im playing with people that are high plat or diamond. Why is my MMR getting lower as i am climbing up? Will this stop eventually or will i have to have 60% winrate from now on to even climb ever so slightly? Yesterday i was getting standard 21 LP per win. What heppened!?\nPlease help. :(\n{{champion:254}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T00:20:12.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At higher ranks, it can be normal to gain less LP than you lose. The point is that you've reached the near-perfect placement for where your skill level is currently, so winning matches will still push you up slightly. \n\nFor example: if you are perfectly placed with people of your own skill, you should theoretically have about a 50-50 win rate. If you keep winning, that means your skill level is actually higher than we thought so you steadily move up. If you keep losing, it means your skill level is significantly lower than what the system thought it was, so it drops you quicker to try and place you where you *should* be based on recent play.","replies":[]}]}
