Like Riot is a big company, it it really that hard for them to bite the bullet and maybe give some c List champs a legendary skin, just to see what will happen.\n\n\nHonestly if this is Pyke its just another tick on the mounting pool of evidence that this year is Riot's year of damage control because Daddy Tencent is not happy with last years profits. Events that are basically underwhelming reskins of each other with the same buy in prize pass, with all the extra bells and whistles dropped. A new Gamemode chasing the Autochess craze that is replacing RGM, while conveniently having something those other games lack, a gambling monetization system (While of course being clearly incomplete with how much arbitrary obscuring of knowledge occurs in it) . Every skin like getting a overpriced Chroma that is sold as some sort of valuable thing and the unprecedented amount of bias that is being thrown towards their popular champs, Kaisai getting a skin every 6 months. Pyke with a skin every 6 months now. The Skin vote going to Tristana instead of a more obscure champion, Lux and Ez double dipping on a Anime Motif since they cant quite do Star Guardians 2, yet. Yasuo getting his yearly skin of course, cant quite fit him in, that's fine just shove him into Battle Boss. Jhin got his legendary because of the eternal tragedy of being on break for a year. Shoot even the fact that most champions release skins now are part of a skin line seems to indicate a slight desperation to make them sell. Even the champs releases this year feel kinda arbitrarily safe. With Sylas,Qiyana and Yuumi kinda not being super interesting (Prisoner chained and starved, still comes out more chiseled then his gauntlets. Princess heralding a new culture, so naturally just kinda aesthetically looks like a supermodel with no real aesthetic distinction for other factions except like, white hair, and Yuumi is well, she is a cat, with a book, i sorta wished that she was a new Yordle.)\n\n\nOverall its sorta why i didn't want them to revisit these lines this year, because i wanted to see events with these lines (Arcade,Project,Star Guardian) not the same god damm \"buy the pass\" Sales pitch that has been every bloody '''''event''''' this year.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-07-14T16:10:32.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Yes but its called having at least a little respect for your audience and at least pretending you care about trying to spread out skin releases\n\nIf they did that, then Ivern for example could have had a far better skin then Dunkmaster.

Azir was pretty much left in the gutter cause of pro play but still got skins alongside that which were still pretty nicely done.

I mean, considering the champion list of promised skins this year was Zilean, Nunu, Shaco and Ivern, we could kind of already tell there were going to be a high volume of popular skins coming.

Every popular champ grabbing skins left and right, everyone else left forgotten or with half arsed inclusions. I mean FFS basically all the champs revealed for project have literally gone less then a year before getting this shit, annual skins for some champs was already a problem, but this, this is a joke. Riot just needs to cut out the middle man and outright say they are going to be focusing more on new or popular champs for skin lines. At least then we all know the pretense.\n\n\nCant wait for Star Guardian 2019 with \n\nStar Guardian Kai Sai (With prestige because hey she already triple dips skins so may aswell double dip prestige)\nStar Guardian Riven\nStar Guardian Lux 2\nStar Guardian Irelia\nand \nStar Guardian Vayne","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-07-15T01:33:15.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say that Star Guardian is more than likely to have Zoe and Annie cause those are two popular picks we have yet to see this year.

Annie maybe but Annie's issue is they can bank on her in LCS either and she lacks the standard flashyness of other champs, and i think even Riot realised that no one likes Zoe so they may give her the Azir treatment and ignore her, its hard to tell wether her Pool party skin was a indication of a annual skin, or more of a one off thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-07-15T04:46:56.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to realize they planned out all of the champions that get skins months in advance (generally a year).  Kai'sa had her K/DA in November then Arcade in June, which were also almost 7 months apart and aren't in the same year. They also planned on having two skins for Pyke, that's why he got one in Blood Moon and is getting a Project next.  So it's not like they are gonna suddenly pump out another one just cause. They only plan a certain amount, and Irelia has yet to actually make that cut of receiving multiple in a year. Very few champions have actually seen two in a year. Pyke and Yi being the only ones I can think of. So, it could happen but I doubt it. Especially two popular skinlines for the SAME champ, in the SAME year.\n\nGeneral skin popularity isn't based around LCS. It's based around the game as a WHOLE. The community.  The most popular champion in the game is Yasuo, it's why he had an Arcade skin, after having an Odyssey skin a year ago.  Annie, already has 11 skins (last being in 2017), so she's still in the popular group. I highly doubt she's gonna suddenly get dropped like the champs that got butchered from proplay and same for Zoe.\n\nZoe's pool party skin was a pretty clear indication of her popularity.

She came out in November of 2017, to then get her first skin by August of 2018 where most of the newer champions before her have either waited at least two years or are STILL waiting.\n\nAgain its the fundamental question of why these champions get constant consideration for planning when other champs have gone in excess of 2 years for their own. Yes Kai Sai was not in the same year, that should not matter though, the fact is she was getting skins every 6 months and that is not even factoring in her E Sports skin (It requires resources to develop, and its still a skin so im counting it), and again why is Pyke being considered eligible for skins when his already gained one with Bloodmoon. Yes its all planned in advanced by as mentioned at the end of the day, these champs are getting a huge concentration of skins in comparison and for all we know they do already have more Kai Sai and Pyke skins in the pipeline.\n\nThe issue is the fact these champs are considered for skins so soon after their last ones in the first place, it raises the questions of \"If Riot is okay with them getting skins this quick, then how many other skin discussion were they part of, how many other eligible champs were pushed out because \"Kai Sai has shown to sell well according to last years metrics\", again its the issue of if they are okay with 2 a year, why not 3, if the champ sells well and how long until this bleeds over, how long until we start seeing the other popular champs filling in 2 roles within half a year\"\n\nI cited not annie mainly because she lacks the flash, as mentioned and it seems at least currently Riot is trying to double down on profiting off the flashey champs, Yes Annie is popular, but is she as popular as Akali or other equivalent champs that have more ''''exciting'''' gameplay. Believe me i would not Mind Annie, if nothing else despite her saturation she still lacks a decent Legendary and heaven knows she can use a skin that gives her more then 10 voicelines.\n\nMy Point about Zoe is more that Riot seems to be generally ignoring her, they may give her a skin since unlike Annie she does have that flasheyness to it, but its sorta unclear wether they are going to push her more like Yasuo, or back off on her like Azir, especially since Akali is feeding the 'Busted CertT champ that sells skins' quite nicely for them. So we may have to see, if she does get a Skin this year, then she is probably in that Annual Skin boat, if she does not, they may just be trying to hide her.\n\n\nMy point is more about the pretense of the situation, that the fact champs are considered for multiple skins within half a year sets up the idea that this can become a more constant thing and that champs who used to do the annual rounds will now start taking up more slots that could reasonably be used on other champs, causing stuff like these team skinlines to start being taken up by not just a popular frontliner but also then other popular champs aswell. I mentioned in another thread this whole notion of 'popular champ tax' where every skinline can start being taxed by having multiply entries being taken up by one or more of this Bi Yearly champs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sag3","date":"2019-07-13T21:02:09.759+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"*kaisa has entered the chat*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Svveeney Todd","date":"2019-07-13T21:16:51.178+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pyke has a 48% winrate....overbuffed is probably the farthest thing from how one should describe that champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Macoy","date":"2019-07-13T20:53:55.339+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pyke always overbuffed? xd They recently killed him as a sololaner hahaha and as supp rn he's actually not that great..","replies":[]},{"poster":"SumWeebSiht","date":"2019-07-14T18:08:11.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that Pyke literally just had all his roles besides support gutted, and he has 3 skins with the addition of this one?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KrakenChum","date":"2019-07-14T13:40:57.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boi they nerfed Pyke from ever solo laning by removing any wave clear potential.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2019-07-13T19:06:17.818+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"I know I will probably get hate for saying this but I would rather see someone else get PROJECT skins this year.

Imagine Urgot executing someone by pulling them into a black hole that's inside his stomach, for example.\n\nOr how about Battle Boss Yasuo, who instead of looking like a menacing, inhuman being that looks like it somehow walked out of straight out of an arcade machine like all the others in the line, he just looks like some human guy in a weird blue/purple suit. Pretty sure champs like Vel'koz and Xerath with their devastating, long range aoe abilities combined with their already otherworldly appearances could've worked much better for the arcade boss theme.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nekorus","date":"2019-07-13T19:51:27.576+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darn i really wish i got to see an project {{champion:91}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-07-13T22:18:11.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's much more in need and far more fitting for the theme.

That's about as soon as it possibly could be - rarely do they come out in a shorter amount of time that this. Meanwhile champions like Zilean, Bard and Skarner haven't had a skin in 3+ years.
