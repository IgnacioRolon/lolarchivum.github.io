People can't just pick her up and go 20/1 anymore, unless you're facing apes.\nFizz's rework was bad.\nTalon is arguably the same as before in terms of play rate and win rate.\nLeblanc is... Still leblanc except there's more of her on the map now\nShaco is still shaco\nZed basically had no changes\nAnd they definitely screwed with Akali. Her passive is worse, her ult deals less damage, and that little jump on her W really wasn't worth all those nerfs.\n\nIdk. The rework was good, since it added counterplay to these assassins, but it is bad because it screwed with the assassins logic of: Kill them in one shot, get out or die.","replies":[{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2017-01-28T00:07:57.898+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're wrong about akali\nthe problem with her ult isn't the damage, it's the static cooldown","replies":[{"poster":"The 14th Angel","date":"2017-01-28T00:32:02.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"your right, the cd is absolute shit, 2 seconds? how am i to use 3 stacks in 6 seconds? how the fuck am i to live for 6 seconds? your so right man. +1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The 14th Angel","date":"2017-01-28T00:31:13.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And they definitely screwed with Akali.
