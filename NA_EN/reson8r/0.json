I make my own music but haven&rsquo;t done any games work.\r\n\r\nI live in the UK and currently looking at universities. If the office in London does sound it would be awesome to have a look round!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot PizzaNinja","date":"2018-07-02T17:36:15.873+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, all of our in house sound design occurs at our LAX campus.
