I'm wondering if, for the most part, it's internet congestion in my area, LoL server overload, or a combination of both? Our home internet connection is with Cox Cable and is very fast. Also, it's worth mentioning that the gaming pc is even directly connected via ethernet.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T01:13:42.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that's happening *every* day around the same times, it does make me think that your ISP might be doing regular resets around that time. If you can, go ahead and check up with your ISP asking if there's anything going on around those times and let me know!\n\nEdit: Just had a thought, I wonder if maybe your pc has scheduled updates/restarts around that time? If that starts up or does a scan each day, that could be causing the freezes too.","replies":[]}]}
