Stuff happens.\n\nTry starting a custom game-- there's definitely no AFK penalty there. See if the game runs there when you're checking to see if any changes you made are working.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-11-15T23:59:58.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds very frustrating to me too; hate it when that happens. For starters, when the game stopped working, did you get any error messages at all? Common ones we see when things like this happen are 'LoL is not Responding' or getting bugsplat errors. The first one indicates connection issues, and can be troubleshot with these steps [**over here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac). You could also see that connection could be interrupted if the load wheel in Loading Screen was frozen.\n\nBugsplats on the other hand can be caused by a lot of different things, but we have a similar guide for them [**over here**](http://riot.com/1Fa5J8l).\n\nIf the guides don't help, or if you saw something completely different, just let me know!","replies":[]}]}
