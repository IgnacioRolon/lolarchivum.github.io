They take away other components and just throw CDR on it instead. I mean why does Righteous Glory Adaptive Helm and Abyssal Mask need CDR? The latter two are great defensive items vs mages but on champions that buy BC, TF, IBG, SV, DD as part of their core can get locked out of other items like the ones above or FH Warmogs for example. There are 178 item on the rift and 48 of them have CDR on them. More than 25% of the item in the game. This number included things like trinkets, potions and champion specific item like Viktors Hextech Core. Sorry too lazy to go through and take those items out. \r\n\r\nFor certain classes CDR makes sense on the items those specialized champs will buy. Juggernauts, Skirmishers and Supports are the big ones that come to mind. They need the CDR in order to duel or protect their carries. However Assassins, ADC&#039;s, Tanks and Burst/Sustain Damage mages can all pretty much get 40% CDR these days allowing everyone to have extraordinary amounts of up time on their power through abilities. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to remove CDR on items that it doesn&#039;t make sense on or tone down the available amount on items that don&#039;t need it. Cool down timers are supposed to window how much CC and burst certain champions can do but with so much CDR floating around the CC and burst can be up several times in a team fight. \r\n\r\nI also miss more items having the split damage of AP and AD. IBG and TF lost this component and it hurts on champions who do mixed damage but do not make good use of Gunblade or Guinso&#039;s. Both of these sheen items lost the AP component for more CDR. Which made them better on specific champion and less general on multiple other champions. \r\n\r\nTL:DR- CDR is too abundant lately and it makes building certain items inefficient if the amount of CDR goes beyond the 40-45% cap. Many items could stand to be reverted or be given better defensive stats instead of CDR overall. \r\n\r\nWhat does everyone else think?","replies":[{"poster":"Kynin","date":"2017-07-20T13:26:43.995+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"A rune was announced for next season that converts extra CDR into stats.

Ability cooldowns reduced by 8% per rank. (13% on ults). Or even a global per-level reduction.\nPoint is: if almost everyone is getting to the CDR cap, and riot is still adding it to *more* items, then CDR no longer has a purpose. It's just something everyone gets natually as the game progresses.","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2017-07-20T20:26:10.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not everyone gets 40% for free.

And in fact, the last few items which do have hybrid stats only have them for balancing purpose, not because they are targeted at hybrid champs.\n\n* Omnivamp on Gunblade is dangerous, just for the same reasons Spellvamp was, and got removed from the item system. So they put some AD on Gunblade to deter Mages who would abuse the healing from buying this item. On the other hand, if they want Gunblade to be viable on a given champion, they can just add/buff their AD ratios.\n* The double on-hit effect of Guinsoo has proven many times it could be broken, when it was still on old Devourer. Now you need to stack Guinsoo before having the effect, but in case that's not enough, they also added some AP on the item to deter all auto-attack-based champs from buying it, especially all standard ADC. On the other hand, if they want Guinsoo to be viable on a given Champ, they can just add some AP ratios. They actually did that to Nocturne and Shyvana a few months ago, with mixed success, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenous Howls","date":"2017-07-20T13:53:19.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant a small amount of AP on items like IBG and TF were beneficial b/c champs that used that item typically did 60/40 physical and magic damage. Nasus, Yorick, Trundle are goods examples who have some small AP ratio's in their kits but can not get any AP in an organic fashion through items. I am not asking that items have a truck ton of AD and AP on them like Gunblade or Guinso's but was more of an example of hybrid items. Sorry if I did not make that clear.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-20T14:00:48.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You were clear, and I do understand, but I disagree. Jinx or Braum have some small AP ratios too, and yet they never used Triforce or IBG. Those ratios are simply not meant to be used, that's all. And having hybrid items make the items not efficient for the vast majority of the roster, and force the rare hybrid champs to be specifically tuned around those items, which is not good on the long term.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2017-07-20T15:19:40.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I'm pretty sure Braum and Jinx didn't use those items, not because the ap was bad, but because those champions get no benefit from the effects of the items.  No one is buying triforce that can't proc the spelblade effect consistently no matter WHAT the stats on the item are.  A support doesn't care about damage stats and braum can't utilize the spell blade, and neither can jinx.\n\nHeck, even before they removed the ap from the item champions with NO ap ratios were buying it that could utilize the proc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2017-07-20T15:16:03.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Um, I think you have it completely wrong/backwards.  Spellvamp wasn't removed from the game because it was a problem, they removed spellvamp from the game because NO ONE was buying.  Only a handful of champions cared about the spellvamp items and it was by far the weakest stat in the game.  Spellvamp itself still very much exists in the game, but the items that used to have spellvamp on them were bad items and removed because they were too weak, not too powerful.\n\nAdditionally Guinsoo's already had the AP and attackspeed based components for a long time, they just added the additional attack to guinsoo's instead of the jungle item, because SOOOO many people were starting to take smite to get that item, now the choice is an active one and it fits better on the hybrid item.","replies":[]}]}]}
