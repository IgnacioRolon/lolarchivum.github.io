Something I would never have said in the past seasons.\r\nBefore I start enumerating the reasons, let me make two things clear...\r\n\r\n1. I absolutely LOVE the support role.\r\n2. What I am saying here is subjective so don&#039;t get your panties in a bunch please.\r\n\r\n**1. I feel like I have no control over vision.**\r\n- A trinket that doesn&#039;t last long enough to keep vision on an area 100% of the time.\r\n- A pink ward that is more useful to keep vision on the Tri-bush or River than to deny the enemy vision. At least in the laning phase.\r\n- Forced to rush a Sightstone because Green Wards are a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n**2. I am always underleveled**\r\n- Because of the masteries changes.\r\n- I&#039;m in a duo lane for christ sake, I am forced to get less XP, but being 2-3 levels behind a solo lane is simply unacceptable...\r\n- I have to roam and ward, giving me even less XP...\r\n\r\n**3. I have no gold**\r\n- And that is fine with me, except that the difference in gold, while not much different than previous seasons, is much more visible in this season where everyone can just kill you by looking at you.\r\n- With the few gold I can manage to gather, I am forced to build support items, making me an easier target to take down with a complete lack of damage to retaliate or fight back.\r\n- If I play a tank champion, well... bruisers are tankier than me because I can&#039;t even buy tank items. I need support items and I can barely afford them in the first place.\r\n\r\n**4. The snowball**\r\n- This just make the 3 previous points even worse. The game is so snowbally right now that I am not allowed a SINGLE MISTAKE without fear of getting erased from the game instantly by the 5/0/0 on the other side.\r\n- The bot lane is almost always decided on the first kill in the lane, usually caused by a jungle ganking, which brings me to point 5...\r\n\r\n**5. Dealing with ganks**\r\n- 2 words: The Package ... There are more and more ways for people to literally jump over multiple walls and gank from almost anywhere... Why did they increase Zac&#039;s Slingshot range? Why did they give The Package to Corki? Why is the new upcoming champion capable of flying across half the map and dropping a freaking star on your head? I shiver to think what may happen with the mage update.\r\n- This problem is just the cumulation of every other problem I mentioned above... Having less control over vision means it&#039;s easier to get ganked. Being lower level make it easier to die and less capable of fighting back against a gank. Same for the gold... less gold, easier to kill. And finally, snowballing means that a 3/0/0 Top can just teleport and instagib the bottom lane.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion... I find myself feeling bad for playing Sona, Karma, Zyra or Nami now. Because if I don&#039;t play Janna, Alistar, Leona or Nautilus, I have to rely on the rest of my team to... support me.","replies":[{"poster":"Reep Daggle","date":"2016-03-21T04:11:00.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":28,"body":"So if you are struggling with those problems in the support role my recommendation is to be a jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"Heckin Support","date":"2016-03-21T05:19:48.269+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"But I can't play the champs I love in the jungle. \nAnd we can't play them mid lane, because god forbid a support champion gets play and is viable in the mid lane riot whips out that nerf hammer. \n*cough*{{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} *cough*","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2016-03-21T05:25:52.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":16,"body":"Sona and Soraka work averagely in mid now.

Used to get on for FWOTD, now I don't even bother with that most days. I have to say, despite the changes, I find myself still winning the very high vast majority my games, but it is still frustrating nonetheless. \n\nSo many problems with supporting right now and you pretty much hit it on the head. \n\nParticularly the warding change is what has me frustrated the most. Between spooky ghost to help with face checking, a pink ward, and only three wards on the sightstones, it feels like I never have enough wards for vision on the map. \n\n\nTo the above about Nocturne/Pantheon/TF, all their gap closers have one thing in common: you at the very least have about two seconds to react to their gap closers, which in most cases for a support, is more then enough time. Corki's Package almost rarely gives enough time to react, Zac I'm not too bothered by as you can at least ward his gap closer sufficiently. Corki's Package, I've seen go over two fucking walls, from Red buff to the tower turret. \n\nLeast Nocturne/TF/Pantheon's kit is properly power-budgeted to include their gap closer into it. \n\nNocturne sacrifices quite a large amount of early game pressure due to needing to hard farm to six.\nTF maintains a weak early game and his teleport ganks will only work in high coordination with other members on the teammate until late game when he can solo pick off anyone.\nPantheon is the inverse of TF, his level 6 man-drop gank is his strongest, but falls off at games goes on. \nCorki's? His is just a giant middle finger on top of massive damage at every stage of the game and ANOTHER gap closer which resets after using package. Pantheon has two gap closers, but of his four abilities, they take two of his ability slots. Not one. \n\nI am a terrible, lemme repeat, TERRIBLE mid-laner, I played a game the other day in which somehow I got mid-lane when I wanted to play Jungle, I picked Corki, went 4-1-4 and finished ahead of their mid-laner in CS, they ended up forfeiting at the 20 minute mark. This is not OK. \n\nAnd with all due respect mate, looking at all your comments, I can see you do not really have a proper grasp on the problem with supporting right now. \n\nWarding is a team game? Lol sure maybe in coordinated teams, but even before the changes to warding, it was always a team game in coordinated game-play, going solo? Well you're shit out of luck now.\n\nSupports are under-level because of a critical mastery that at least allowed them to stay close to the rest of the team in terms of level, its not about striking a balance, supports WILL be severely under-leveled in the process of doing their job in comparison to the rest of their teams. \n\nLack of gold, again, this has been an issue and plight of support its not about last hitting and trying to participate in every kill, my games end with me around 70% - 80% kill participation, and most solid support mains will have higher, but they will always be gold starved, no matter what, unless they're killing stealing, most support will be several thousand gold behind the rest of the team, which generally is always accepted.\n\nThe problem is now item snowballing is so bad now, if someone on the other team is up a thousand gold on on their lane opponent, that means they're up several thousand on the opposing team's support, this means if they even so much look at their support, they pretty much will die. All I can say is that it feelsbadman. \n\nSnowballing - Dude have you watched the LCS? Every game now is a dance around each other because one kill will most likely lead to game over now. This is pretty reflective in regular game matches too, while yes, not every game resulting in first blood will result in team winning, the vast number of game is decided now within the first 10 minutes, regardless of whether it is ranked or normal. \n\nDon't believe me? Perfect example from a game today: C9 vs TL, watch it, TL got first blood off tower dive/mistake by Balls, and the lead snowballed incredibly far out of control because of it. All because of one mistake. And no, this isn't one match, I can pull up MANY more in which the game is decided in this manner.

There is definitely room for improvement in terms of supplying supports with wards in cooler ways. Although I kind of like the Health you get from Sightstone but I can see where you're coming from. \n\nBut I also think that rushing Sightstone as a very first item is not really mandatory up to a certain elo. Maybe you are Diamond+ and this doesn't apply to you, but lower divisions don't require the instant Sightstone IMO. \n\nDepending on how the game is going and how confident I feel in winning, I sometimes upgrade my first support item ({{item:3092}} {{item:3097}} {{item:3096}} ) and/or finish my tier 2 boots first. But that's the furthest I would go. I am actually quite excited for the Sightstone as I can assist my team with more than just my abilities from then on. It allows me to do so much more than just trading/peeling/engaging. It kinda feels like a powerspike. \n\nJust like mana/ mana regen feels great on champions who really need it.

I feel like I have no control over vision.\n\n-Well, vision control is now a team mechanic. 5 players weren't equipped with a trinket just so they could press another button.\n\n-Yes, there are ideal areas to drop ur pink ward but you obviously don't want to drop it in an area you can't readily defend. That's 75 gold down the drain. There is a right time and place for everything.\n\n2. I am always underleveled\n\n-While it is true that supports generally fall behind harder in levels now, it is your responsibility to strike a balance between roaming and sitting in a lane for a minute or two to soak exp. Remember that you can always go with your ally to a lane to soak the exp as they quickly clear the wave then immediately roam afterwards. In the mid-late game, you can hang around your allies as they clear a jungle camp to soak up some of that exp as well. If other support players are able to adapt to the game's changes, then theres no reason you can't as well.\n\n3. I have no gold \n\n-Since goal is more scarce this season, you need to learn to salvage it wherever it is possible. This means last hitting minions when your adc isn't in lane (sometimes, even getting the last hits on cs your adc will miss due to their autoattack cooldown). Being near turrets as they die to receive the local gold. Making sure you're utilizing {{item:3303}}   and {{item:3302}}  to their maximize capacity as well as the \"Bandit\" mastery (which is a pretty important mastery for supports). Also, you should always try to participate in every kill so you can get gold from assists. this means shielding/healing/using some type of buff on an ally that kills an enemy or simply attacking the enemy. \n\n4. The snowball\n\n-It is NOT true that the 1st kill in the lane decides the laning phase. Different match-ups have different powerspikes at specific levels. Certain champions have advantages in poke wars/range/all-in potential/wave clear. The enemy can make mistakes on which , if you're competent, you can punish them. Then you have other possibilities like your allies ganking your lane or the enemy does a horrible job with minion wave control/csing (leading to huge cs gaps between the enemy and your adc). \n\n5. Dealing with ganks\n\n-You have a problem with zac/corki having immense range on their gap closers but what about nocturne, pantheon, and twisted fate who have been in the game (with subtle changes to their \"globals\") for longer? The enemy could easily plant a ward behind you for the potential of 1-2 TPs from their allies. How would you play against any of these differently?  If you don't know where the enemy is and you have a strong belief that they could be nearby, then PLAY like that. \n-And yes, less vision means you need to play smarter and safer. There is no reason to play stupidly aggressive when the enemy has globals, is competent, and proven that they will target your lane. \n\nThe meta of supports has sadly been crippled to a few select tanks/utility supports.

I'm stuck to go the same path all the time using the same champions and having to deal with the same exact problems all the time.\nI'm sorry if it wasn't clear in my OP, but I wasn't really looking for advice or anything. I adapted to the meta. But in the end, I still have less control on vision, I can't stop other lanes from snowballing, I will be lower level with less gold no matter what (Excluding the rare snowballing Sona games I have) and there are ganks that are simply impossible to deal with without having the right champion for the job or if the rest of our team doesn't answer.\n\nNo matter how smart and safe you play, you still need to be in range of the minions for XP and you still need to allow your ADC to last hit. Else you are effectively losing. And with how weak towers are, it's not rare that we are powerless as support to do anything when getting zoned because we got counter picked.\nHad an enemy Ezreal bitch after a game to his Nautilus that he suck. Told him that it's not the Nautilus fault that I was the last pick and counter picked Alistar to make Nautilus completely useless. No matter what the Nautilus would have bought for items, no matter how he played, he was pretty much screwed because he was bound to lose his lane and once that happens, he was way too behind to do anything against the rest of my team.","replies":[{"poster":"Pürple","date":"2016-03-23T04:42:27.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But in the end, I still have less control on vision - As someone else stated, it's now a team mechanic.

To take it on a realistic approach, for someone who doesn't farm, it is only natural that they get *less EXP and gold than their teammates do*. I mean you can also use some basic reasoning: 4 sources of gold/exp, 5 people. One person will have less. Unfortunately, it's just a thought that they can't get across.\n\n> and there are ganks that are simply impossible to deal with without having the right champion for the job or if the rest of our team doesn't answer. - That's why you learn how to _counterpick_ instead of just choosing a champion you like to play.

To put it bluntly, people need to remember that they have to think. Not all ganks are escapable, even if you're something like Janna. But not all ganks are un-escapable either if they know how to anticipate or even, just have map awareness. All lanes are not pushing except botlane and enemy jungler hasn't shown up in a while? Someone's probably coming down bot. Messy 2v2, and enemy top and/or mid has teleport? Someone's probably coming. And this isn't botlane exclusive either.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Loli Lulu","date":"2016-03-21T02:12:14.183+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lulu Support Main here~\n1) Vision is much harder to keep than previous season, but I think that was Riot's intention. They didn't want the game to be a farmfest. Although the early levels are much more dangerous since you only have 2 trinket wards on a relatively long duration to rely on. Having to recharge Sightstone a lot is also a pain (tying into #2 a bit)\n\n2) I don't think it's changed all that much, or at least not how I play Support (never did go with the old EXP mastery). We've always been behind, and our kits in general were kind of built around that. However with how much more snowbally things are, the gap rises very quickly, especially for an already starved support.\n\n3) This isn't too bad now with the combination of support items being generally a tiny bit cheaper, and the dedicated Support starter items. No Green Wards to spam also allows for gold in other areas.\n\n4-5) Enemy jungler ganking, or simply losing in lane due to a minor mistake is more snowbally this season for sure. Lack of vision (#1) early contributes to this. Ganks and deaths lead to lower EXP/level (#2) and less gold (#3). With current meta of strong laners/bullies near-unavoidable ganks and tanky-dives, early kills are very punishing.\n\nUnfortunately, squishy-poke/utility supports are a little weaker in the current meta, which favors more tanky-utility or pure-utility/disengage supports.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoisauceCCH","date":"2016-03-22T03:36:06.330+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how the support main brings up viable grievances, such as how vision is completely useless right now because you can't actually buy wards, and how snowbally the game is, and everybody's reaction is \"play mid or jungle\".\n\nYeah that's now how that shit is supposed to work.

Very simple, very obvious warding system that gives the best of both worlds. You can't really complain about too much, or too little vision in DOTA because you get adequate tools either way. Now in league it's like \"yeah now the only real vision is coming from your support, who may or may not even buy a sightstone let alone use it regularly enough\".

Yes, {{item:2049}} was OP for how much you have to spend on it, but on a support's budget you NEED the item. Dropping from 4 charges to 3 really hurt the item and the role overall. This was the first time I felt like I got nerfed as a player. The {{item:3340}} {{item:3363}} also hurt. It doesn't matter at what point of the game, it never feels like I can get enough vision anywhere. You guys want to know why {{champion:12}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} are the OP support picks right now? because everyone else feels so much weaker/ineffective. \n\nWhy is everyone else weaker and ineffective? Because of the support's budget and experience penalty for being a support. Everyone else needs the XP to get the utility they need to be effective. I keep hearing you need to play tanky supports to make an impact in the game (as a {{champion:267}} main, I can tell you, you can make an impact with any support), but for tanky supports not named {{champion:12}} , you need items too. \n\nIt feels bad being a support nowadays because unless someone on your team gets fed, you can't be effective. This is also assuming you're playing a easy to play champ too, if you're playing a high skill cap champ like {{champion:267}} or {{champion:412}} you don't get rewarded with carrying potential like other higher skill cap champs like {{champion:157}} or  {{champion:268}} . As a main of one of these 'high skill cap supports', you just have to work harder to end up with the same problems with everyone else. Low income, low experience, low carrying potential unless someone on your team is already fed. \n\nWhat makes it worse is games nowadays also feel harder to come back from. I know that games have the same come back potential as before but it feels like games are won or lost by the 20 min and it's just a matter of ending. If you're a support on the 'losing' team. It doesn't feel like there's much you can do to turn it around and if you're on the winning team, it doesn't feel like you can stop your team from throwing. Again, I'm talking about the 'feel' of support, not what can actually happen.\n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir, but damn.
