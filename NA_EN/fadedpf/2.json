The current version is great and healthy but all because of the old one Warwick was nerfed hard. Directly and indirectly.\n\nHis ult cd and damage was nerfed HEAVILY which makes him horrible not being able to fight unless his ult is up. \n\nHis clears are weak with the 6 second W. Tanks have better clears than him with cinderhulk and just having aoe in general.\n\nAnd to top it all off Devourer was made basically useless compaired to the amount of raw damage the other jungle enchantments do.\n\nPlus another factor of him being gutted so hard is that the jungle was impossible during the preseason. Warwick and Fiddlesticks were the only ones that could stay alive. Its sad seeing as how Warwicks kit is designed for the jungle but he gets out classed and limited by all of the nerfs he had. Theres also the fact that he is Warwick, which has plenty of counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-05-03T13:39:10.343+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Warwick is garbage currently and anyone trying to say otherwise or they try to shoe horn him somewhere into some working state are just blinding themselves, his Pre 6 ganks were non existent before, but with reliable post 6 ganks, and thanks to the nerf to the CDR on his ult now he can gank even less. And thanks to the damage cut on his ult not only does his ganks come up even less, they stopped being as reliable now.\n\nThe people who think \"Oh he sustains well in the jungle, he is fine\" can go fuck themselves, he clears slow as hell in comparison to TANK JUNGLERS right now. Any of the fighter junglers, Any jungler that survives clearing can clear faster then him right now.\n\n So the hell what if he can stay healthy, his mana goes to shit early on when he uses his abilities sparingly at all, and by the time you finish clearing all the camps the enemy jungler has gone back and gotten his item and done his gank already. \n\nSo what do you do as Warwick? You farm until level 6, get off a not so reliable gank, then wait literally 2 minutes until you can go gank again. By the time you have a second gank ready the friggin mid game is about to start up and you had no jungle presence the entire time. \n\nWow he is just SOOOO good right now.\n\nMid game starts, and you think \"Well I spent most of the time farming my {{item:3710}} up maybe I can do something.\" You couldn't be more wrong if you pulled a door that said push.

Now only did the W nerf stomp on his ability to help a team out better, but it made it far more difficult for him to just be that, a drain tank. The point of sustaining through a hell fire of damage that Warwick mains remember is that his W used to have reasonable cooldowns and durations, Now when your W ends your attack speed plummets to shit and you get killed because you can't attack fast enough to make use of the sustain you have.\n\nI seriously friggin doubt anyone who actually plays Warwick on a somewhat regular basis actually thinks he is in a state right now where he doesn't need some changes, he is not fine and hasn't been even before he got his ass nerfed, the Feral Flare 2.0 should have been made to know Warwick was going to abuse it, it happened the first time around. \n\nIt isn't better for us when you find out that his rework was shelved and hasn't even made it past the brainstorming stage, along with Riot having no comments whether they want to give Warwick some help.\n\n-Edited in spots for better clarity and grammar.","replies":[{"poster":"Heckin Support","date":"2015-05-03T19:49:19.388+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silents429,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xFGuUrdq,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-05-03T13:39:10.343+0000)\n>\n> Warwick is garbage currently and anyone trying to say otherwise or shoe horn him into some working state is just blinding themselves, his Pre 6 ganks were non existent before, and thanks to the nerf to the CDR on his ult now he can gank even less. \n> \n> His ult had a big cut down on it's base damage making you rely further on your team to respond in a gank, or requiring you to build more damage then before.\n> \n> The people who think \"Oh he sustains well in the jungle, he is fine\" can go fuck themselves, he clears slow as hell in comparison to TANK JUNGLERS right now.

Its alot less common than you would think. (This is in Silver, Gold and Plat).\n\nAlso - BORK damage wasn't what i was talking about. The \"8% Damage based on enemies health\" was changed so THAT effect now leeches life. In any given game my healing done is about 50% of the damage taken (and usually im #1 in damage taken by champions as i'm tanking).

You seem to be the type of warwick that doesnt secure objectives early and often, so i can understand why you think he's weak. As for 1v3ing its relatively easy. Of course ignite screws it up, but now a days one person has ignite in most games (APC) and rarely someone from bot lane. I also seem to score higher gold than most other people in my games so im not sure why you believe he clears jungle slower than anyone else, or has issues with farming in general. Again, i'm not trying to be confrontational here but it seems like you have a few things to learn about warwick. Now you can continue to try and bash me, and say im lying or wrong, or you could attempt to improve your play.

With no cc until lvl 6 (110 secs cd on this ult) all he can do is poke the enemy with his Q (if he can reach them). In teamfight, useless if his ult is on cd. If he was good in 2009-2010, he is the worst jungle now imo, every champ are getting upgraded but him...\n","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-04T14:57:33.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you people act like the price of a champion has ANYTHING to do with reworks/viability/ etc.\n\nThis is proven wrong time and time again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-05-03T12:22:47.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a big fan of the fact that WW has to be built almost off-tank now in order to be relevant, as opposed to when I first picked him up where he was borderline glass cannon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lB2kGRlc8y","date":"2015-05-03T08:44:41.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've seen, they only revert when its to nerf a champion, like blitz","replies":[]},{"poster":"arcinex","date":"2015-05-03T04:35:27.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Warwick is useless now.","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-05-03T21:59:35.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=arcinex,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xFGuUrdq,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-03T04:35:27.487+0000)\n>\n> Warwick is useless now.\n\nAgreed . ww isn't a threat . he is made to ult and that's it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Totalis","date":"2015-05-03T06:18:00.696+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"As someone who hates warwick and his stupid goddamn ult, Im very content with never seeing him.

If the game lasts more than 40 mins, sell boots and buy Zephyr.\n\nRunes: ASPD/Armor per lev/Mres per lev (You dont come out of the jungle till 6.)\nMasteries: Standard jungle masteries\n\nIf your top, start Gromp. Clear gromp-->blue-->wolves-->Dragon then walk back up and clear the whole jungle (gromp wil ave respawned by the time you finish dragon). Thisll put you at level 5 with 1300 gold on your first back (And ahead of the enemy jungler despite you soloing dragon).\n\nIf your bot, start krug-->Red-->Wraiths-->Dragon. B, buy upgraded jungle item, clear as normal from top to bottom. \n\nBoth starts: you'll get 6 with about 1-1:30 to spare for the second dragon, usually you can sneak this second dragon in before the enemy support has a sight stone. Do it.\n\nBy 20:00 you should have upgraded devourer, boots of swiftness and BORK. If your ADC is fed, duo baron when it spawns.\n\nBy 26:00 you should have your first armor item.\n\nBy 32:00 you should have the second\n\nBy 36:00 you should have all 6 items.\n\nBy 40:00 (if it lasts this long), zephyr. Get elixir of wrath. With this item setup if everyone focuses you.. YOU WANT TO HIT THE ENEMY TANK.  NEW BORK = huge drains when you're on someone with alot of HP. You will out sustain almost any teams damage if you are hitting the tank provided you BORK and Q on cooldown. Your team will mop up the carries, you will -decimate- the tank (And peel incidentally)\n\nThe key to warwick (and really any successfull jungler) IS OBJECTIVE CONTROL!\n\nEdit: Why blue smite/Boots of Swiftness? Enemies will misjudge your movement speed and try to kite/flee. They cant. Its literally impossible with this setup and blood scent. (Unless its like hecarim or something. lol)\n\nBlue smite also enables you to prevent enemies from escaping after a gank (especially early) by smiting them. They may flash away but they will be far to slow to get anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-05-04T00:21:03.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldnt rush Bork over Wits End.
