Please don't hate me, I just wanna state my view.\n**\n\nIf people are wondering, her current changes (as of now) are:(Credit to [Surrender at 20](http://www.surrenderat20.net/) for info)\n\n* Double Up (Q)\n  * [New Effect] If the first target is killed, the second hit will deal 150% damage instead.\n\n* Impure Shots (W)\n * Cooldown lowered to 12 seconds from 16 seconds \nGrevious Wounds removed.\nGrants Strut when activated.\n\n* Make It Rain (E)\n * Duration lowered to 2 seconds from 3 seconds\nSlow increased to  40/45/50/55/60% from 25/35/45/55/65%\n\nSo what this means is that with the current changes at lvl 3, MF will have a 40% slow at rank one, a slightly better Q, and a lower cooldown W. Now I'm not an MF player, I'm planning on buying her to check out how she is right now. But from a viewer's perspective, it looks like this:\n\nHer Q: Looks like a good buff, can't really disagree with more damage. (If it procs off minion to champ too, bonus harass!)\n\nHer W: This is the bad part, obviously. It looks like it'll help her chase potential a bit and having the attack speed more often should help in trades/wave clear, but without the big attack speed buff to make up for removing grevious wounds, I don't know how this will go, it just sounds like she'll be rendered useless in trades since you have to max her q and some champs (ex. Draven, Vayne?) will just bulldoze her. \n\nHer E: Escape/Chase potential, but that's it.\n\ntl:dr From a non-MF player's perspective, her w seems way too weak now, and while 50% does seem a bit overkill at rank one, giving her 30%-40% would probably help her quite a bit without making her too broken.

These are from me playing her both AD Mid and AD Bot against a lot of different matchups.\n\nAs for the changes to her Attack Speed reverted, personally I don't even know why they gave her such an enormous buff to it. A lane bully has a 12 second cooldown (that only lasts 6 seconds if you include the duration if I remember correctly), 50% Attack Speed buff at level 1 or 2, that also grants her bonus damage to her auto attacks, and also reactivates her passive. This seems a bit overboard. She's really underestimated which is both annoying and saddening, but after playing almost every ADC in the game extensively, I see plenty of power Miss Fortune holds over others. She isn't the best at everything obviously, however she is far from the worst.\n\nAnd I know people are going to say \"Oh you're Silver, you're trash, you have no idea what you're talking about\". Actually, my elo doesn't effect my opinion or statistics about a champion, and if I'm THAT bad why am I doing SO well with a champion that is \"Trash tier\", especially against people who are Gold and Platinum or just people noticeably above my Rank.\n\nA good argument to this would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-07-10T23:07:38.975+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hate to be that guy but it's because you're Silver 5. MF preforms best at lower ranks as she doesn't have a complicated kit and is strong early game. She easily get a lead and can hold it. This is something she has to do to compare to other ADC's. This is because of how a lot of her kit works. R is like asking to get dived/CCd later in the game. Mobility isn't rare so people generally can get out of easily. What makes her stronger early is her mixed damage and her Q. She can front load a lot of damage fairly well. But it's risky to do so. Something that can more easily be gotten away with in bot lane than a dragon fight. I guess the easiest way to put is is that she's an amazing duelist with a teamfighting R. I'd say on par with Vayne in terms of 1v1 damage. But Vayne has way more mobility/self peel. \n\nThis is usually where the \"bronzie\" argument comes from. And holds true as long as someone doesn't take it too far(as such when they cannot explain something other than it's because of their rank). \n\nOverall. You're playing at a lower level. But you are good with MF. So you end up preforming well on her. Even if you lose the game. \nI'd suggest learning other rolls/champions if you want to improve. It's probably your understanding of the game as a whole that is holding you back. A pro would beat your MF with any champion likely, because they understand the game a whole.

But she can very easily fall behind if she doesn't do well early. Going by your score you can handle this hurdle. She's an early game duelist who has to hold her lead to be of use to the team. ADC's are about the late game. Every other ADC is more likely to out preform her late game. Unless you're one of those odd balls who consider Quinn an ADC still. Despite having strong dueling powers and a strong teamfight AoE she's actually weak past lanning phase. Because those qualities all have drawbacks that come to light once lanning phase is over. \n\nRiven actually preforms better the higher you go. Becuase she has some huge hurdles to pass over. Someone in diamond will very likely know those and is able to preform these things that a bronze player cannot. She can do well in bronze as well because her kit is very simple and easy at it's core.

But ADC's in general are all strong late game. Because of how they build. But in terms of this, MF is in the bottom of the pool. \n\nMF is good at early game. But there are enough champions who also are good early game and can bring more to the team past lanning. Jinx does almost everything she does but better. Better poke, better CC, better AoE. Even vs MF's ult Jinx will out damage it with 2-3 AA(depending on crits) and her ulti. All while being able to move between attacks. Main thing MF has over her is better base range, her Q can bounce further(Jinx needs a few Q ranks to match this) and her CC is instant. \n\nThere's also Lucian and Graves. Who provide strong early games but are much stronger late game and even mid game than MF. MF will come out slightly ahead in sustained single target damage. But despite what ADC haters say, it takes more than right clicking to be a good ADC. And after she uses R, MF mainly only has her right clicking. Even Vayne has more interaction outside of her AA's. \n\nI think a lot of how this will change will depend on this W change applying Strut. Does it give the full MS? Does she get to keep it up for a duration even if she gets hit right after hitting W? If these two can happen her ability to R a teamfight then go back to a duelist will make her much safer to play and a little less reliant on her early game. Or say W gives her Strut, but it has to scale up. And it cannot be forced off until it's maxed. Her late game still wont be amazing.

Instead of \"Varus and MF both have an AoE slow, why can't MF have %hp damage too?\" type of thing we see on the boards once in a while. MF's selling point is her early game. She has to carry this with her all game to make up for what she lacks. Her R does help but it has a lot of counterplay.

She can outduel a lot, but not all ADCs, and she can have a much better teamfight than most, but not all ADCs.\n\nShe's like if you threw someone like Sivir and Vayne together but lessened their core strengths so she wouldn't just be the best ADC in every way...aside from infinite dashes which Riot definitely wouldn't allow to happen *Cough*Kalista*Cough*.\n\nEven if you're not fed, remember that people like Sivir, Lucian, or Twitch won't be doing much damage either unless they're at full build. This pretty much is the same with every ADC except Vayne or Kalista if played properly.\n\nMiss Fortune is a pretty interesting ADC, she isn't the best at anything, but she can do it all at the same time. Due to this she has relatively no hard counters, and just last night where I got my fourth pentakill I was actually up against Quinn, arguably Miss Fortune's biggest counter. She synergizes in or against any team comp, and her early - mid game is insanely good. I would confidently say her early game is the best, especially now, of any ADC and I think her mid game is arguably one of the best of any ADCs too.\n\nSure, Vayne can outduel a Miss Fortune, and sure Sivir or Twitch can have better teamfighting. But Vayne's teamfighting? Unless you're Gosu with perfect mechanics, which I guess applies for mostly any champion, you're not going to be the best in teamfighting. Sivir in a duel? If you dodge her boomerang the only thing she has damage-wise is her auto attack resets, but even then Miss Fortune's auto attack resets do damage and have a much lower cooldown, Vayne's auto attack resets are on a 1 second cooldown and allow her to tumble.\n\nI think a lot of ADCs have more defined strengths and weaknesses, but Miss Fortune's identity is being much more flexible. If you need an ADC that can teamfight really well, but also hold her ground more than well enough, she's a great pick and I'm quite surprised she isn't played more often considering she statistically does better than most ADCs.

If not, I won't be useful until late game. I think this is fine, I would actually think it would be quite overpowering if her late game was just as strong as her early or mid game, since she would then have no hard fall offs. I think It's obvious that she does poorly late game until full build where basically everyone is viable in one way or another.\n\nI think you should try Miss Fortune out, personally I thought she was terrible when I first started playing her, eventually after a month of buying her I played her again and started to get fed for a few games in a row. I think the misconception that she is strong is largely due to her unpopularity and simply due to the fact Humans are just sheep, we're made to believe what others , especially people like the pros, think in certain aspects like this. I think a lot of champions are improperly judged like this. Zed? Even before his nerfs I don't think he was a huge problem and never had many against him if I played well. Elise? She's not the best and I think they Olaf'ed her, however she isn't unviable and is great for picking out high priority targets for your team.\n\nOne thing about shutting Miss Fortune down, it's almost impossible early - mid game due to her having so much damage output, but due to how terrible she does late game there's a huge window of opportunity which I think is totally fair.","replies":[{"poster":"NeoJusteBelmont","date":"2015-07-11T00:34:40.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 'Humans are just sheep' statement, I feel like this whole community really is like this, they only base things on what is hype and then adapt it as the 'great one'.

Because my duo and I ran bot lane MF to the point of carrying ourselves to high gold elo (may not be much but hear me out); At this point, it was pretty much mandatory to switch to another adc, not because we lost bot lane, but because the advantage we created for ourselves in lane didn't match up to the scaling of other adcs if the games dragged out. Jinx with less items could win trades or duels simply because of her insane AS steroid in switcheroo and her ulti to wrap it up with a bow on top. That's not even talking about lucian shenanigans with his passive or draven's 85% free AD for each axe he throws at you.\n\nI think that viability is important for a champion to be experienced in a fun way. MF's ulti is really fun to use and she's my favorite adc, but it's frustrating to see how she's getting nerfed AGAIN after the Black cleaver  wombo combo shenanigans, given that item was reworked and now is no longer worth it for her. \n\nAll other adcs whose kit has been changed have gotten considerably more games afterwards, mainly because they were buffed and added fun mechanics to their kits. For Miss Fortune, it looks like they're not even trying to make her kit cohesive like they did for Tristana and Ashe.\n\nAnd there's talk that they're going to look at Lucian and Ezreal because their performance as adc has become subpar, lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NapaIm","date":"2015-07-11T06:25:44.875+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ILoveTyranny,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qvm7rwgF,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-07-10T22:42:34.117+0000)\n>\n> I don't see why everyone keeps calling her a trash-tier ADC.

These are from me playing her both AD Mid and AD Bot against a lot of different matchups.\n> \n> As for the changes to her Attack Speed reverted, personally I don't even know why they gave her such an enormous buff to it. A lane bully has a 12 second cooldown (that only lasts 6 seconds if you include the duration if I remember correctly), 50% Attack Speed buff at level 1 or 2, that also grants her bonus damage to her auto attacks, and also reactivates her passive. This seems a bit overboard. She's really underestimated which is both annoying and saddening, but after playing almost every ADC in the game extensively, I see plenty of power Miss Fortune holds over others. She isn't the best at everything obviously, however she is far from the worst.\n> \n> And I know people are going to say \"Oh you're Silver, you're trash, you have no idea what you're talking about\".

I was fine without the GW. The attack speed buffs more than compensated. Now the only real buff she got was to her q.
