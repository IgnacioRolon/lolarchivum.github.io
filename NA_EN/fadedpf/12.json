No glaring numbers like Brands play rate/win rate..\n\nNerfing HP when he is a primary team fight engager that needs to damage soak. \n\nAnd giving crappy compensation by giving his E the ability to ignore units.\n\nIf Hecarim cant have his passive remain why can {{champion:105}} ? He has a near instant dash and 2 hops that make him untargetable. Plenty of mobility and escape to deal with anything he wants... AND all Fizz has to do is get 30 to 40% cdr and have those 2 Hops and Dash on a constant 5 second cooldown while Hecarims charge ACTUALLY has a cooldown restraint...","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-12-01T21:08:35.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"My two guesses:\n\nFirst reason: he's got incredibly good harass in the lane, he can move through the minions, Q several times on enemy laner and sustain most of the hit back with W from minions. Q also does not draw minion aggro as well meaning he can move in and out of minion waves without the laners fighting back.\n\nRight now he has a double whammy when it comes to minion: he can move through them and he's capable of solid harass without worrying about the minions drawing aggro onto him.\n\nSo while minion pathing has been atrocious, Hecarim has an even larger advantage in the lane now because of pathing issues that he does not suffer from. \n\nThe second guess is that Hecarim was always designated to be a jungler and I'm pretty sure Riot has been trying to nudge him back into that role, or at least make it more appealing to play him in that role. \n\nThis would be the most ideal mean of making jungle Hecarim much more appealing. Hecarim is my most played jungler this preseason, I'm not going to feel any impact whatsoever from this nerf. Since his ability to avoid minion pathing is now tied to E and Jung Hec always E's into lane on a gank, it makes no difference.

They are nerfing him, since he's not Yasuo/Lee/Riven/Vayne or any other of riot's favourites champs, yeah, jokes aside, they are nerfing him because he is supposedly doing his job (a laner/jungler bully) like they do with all champs who're not in the above list. It's just riot's favoritism back again (hate me, downvote me, but it's just how things are, riot has a long story of favoritism towards some champs and total hate towards others, and from when I started playing, I've seen more nerfs than buffs to the pony).","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-12-01T21:36:03.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do you feel no impact? Now your ganks are way worse because the enemy laner can kite through minions, your clears are way worse since you have lower scaling HP, and you lose 500 gold worth of stats from the nerf. 500 gold of stats is gigantic.\n\nAlso, most meta top laners destroy him right now because they're manaless/low mana costs/autoattackers while Hecarim burns mana doing literally anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-12-01T21:14:12.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only play him jungle to good success.. but losing HP is going to hurt a lot and without E the great wall of china aka minions might screw me over. Nerfing his passive because it is an advantage with the horrible minion blocking is a joke. It would all be dandy if it was back to regular minions before the preseason.
