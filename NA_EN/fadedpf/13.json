It already gives him bonus armor passively. BECAUSE HE&#039;S A ROCK. This guy already has mana problems like none other. Wanna use your Q and E to harass or farm? That&#039;s gonna cost you. He has mana problems by just wanting to farm, unless he is just waddling around waiting to ult, it sucks going oom by just farming. Making his W free to cast would be amazing for him.","replies":[{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2015-06-15T20:55:35.140+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 25 mana cost is pretty negligible.  His full combo costs a ton of mana as does harassing with his q, but he's not gonna be spamming w unless the enemy laner is trying to push him under tower.  I don't think making w free would really help.  They could lower the cost of his q or increase his mana pool/regen","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azteryz","date":"2015-06-15T22:57:38.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"then he will become a gragas situation where they made his new w have no manacost but it was just too spamable and there wasnt a bad time to use it giving it a small mana cost will separate the good malphite players to the bad trigger happy ones","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-06-16T09:32:57.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not entirely.... Gragas W was a lot worse... why? Because spamming it was actually a good thing... why wouldn't you just use a free ability whenever you could if it also healed you (gragas passive)\n\nAnd I hardly think it matters much as it is malphites cheapest ability (and he needs to be in melee range and get of a couple of auto attacks for it to really do much)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2015-06-15T20:24:55.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Coming from a man who loves to Q spam and poke the enemy laner, I would agree somewhat. But this is mostly an issue of conserving mana. Good melee champs, regardless of damage kits, know how to CS with basic attacks. Malphite is no different, especially since his W makes him a great AD Offtank in terms of limited burst.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-06-16T12:30:24.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}} : I hurt myself to be faster in combat.\n{{champion:24}} : Buffed my muscle for 100 mana, whuts ur argument -_-","replies":[]},{"poster":"R110","date":"2015-06-16T12:27:18.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose that's a reasonable change considering Tristana's Q and Kog'Maw's W were changed to be free.
