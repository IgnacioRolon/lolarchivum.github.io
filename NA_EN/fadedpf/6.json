Split pushing is already an insanely effective strategy add a Rageblade to that and it is a sure fire way to draw the enemies or leave their base destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt feels unfair as hell to win or lose when someone builds it and stomps like it is an absolute breeze.\r\n\r\nAnd you cant ban every rageblade user as there are way more than 6 of them as well as risking leaving other top banned champions open.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love playing this game but when I see this item in my games it disgusts me and makes the whole experience of winning/losing with a team effort/high skill level involved get thrown out the window as it is so broken and abused.\r\n\r\nI dont want to win or lose anymore games because of this stupid item.","replies":[{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-11-28T22:50:36.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't beat 'em join 'em.","replies":[{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-11-28T22:51:55.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have used it once and I won without much trouble.

Give it some time. It's not the only thing that's gotten out of hand since the semi-game-changing pre-season started.\n\nI will admit though: I just played against a sated rageblade Aatrox. Sure, that didn't work out, but seriously... what the heck...\n\nCome to think of it, probably half the problem is caused by Riot making this a cheap aoe item while nerfing the other aoe fighter build routes (titanic, ravenous). That was a mistake. Might not hurt to bring those items down to their original costs to help non-hybrid champs face their competition. Hydra too big of a damage spike? Well, fine then Riot, add some level-scaling to its passives. Wouldn't be the first items you used that tactic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-11-28T23:02:16.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/yYBm9rXq-i-honestly-love-the-changes-placed-in-however-i-as-well-as-many-have-a-few-suggestions\n\n12 would fix the issues with rageblade atm","replies":[]}]}
