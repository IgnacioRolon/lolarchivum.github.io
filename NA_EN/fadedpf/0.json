I can deal with his mobility, cc and damage. But unless Ekko falls asleep there is no punishing him after long fights. I would have expected 100 and upwards to 150 mana cost on an ult like this but nope it costs nothing. Because fuck it all. Currently Ekko builds 0 mana items and just spams Q and W all day and if things go bad just R. Maybe if his ult wasn&#039;t an aoe tactical nuke it could cost 0 mana but I am not seeing the downsides to his ult at all. Which is the counterplay when you are an Assassin.

In the vast majority of fights it's going to be used the same way, under the same contexts.  If the spell needs a downside (not saying it does) giving it a mana cost isn't going to solve that.\n\nThat said, from a design standpoint I do agree that there is something to the idea of \"he's been spamming spells and is out of mana, now is my chance to strike.\"  His ult not having a cost directly avoids the minor gameplay idea of \"characters are weak when they're OOM.\"  My bad on that one.  We'll be fixing it for 5.12 by upping the cost to 100 (from 0).  There were localization things that prevented it getting in for 5.11. \n\nAs a side note, adding higher mana costs across Ekko's kit (we're also upping W cost to 50 from 30 in 5.11) helps mitigate burst in an indirect manner.  Higher costs means he has a harder time farming and may want to invest in more mana/regen itemization.

Avoid it... that's another \"tip\" I've been using that has let me easily go up against Ekko. Also, his ult's damage makes up for most of his damage as a champ, and he still has less damage than a lot of other assassins. Lowering the damage on this skill wouldn't solve anything.\n\nLearn how a champion works... adapt. Learn how the champion differs from other champs.

Diana 100% must hit her q's, you 100% see it coming, you have plenty of time to to react and actually avoid it, if it does hit you you, diana is in it to win it, if your support is on the ball or your team has some shields to buffer you that is it she is now stuck in the middle of your team. Diana is the prototype of what is an acceptable assassin. Diana also has a built in delay for reactivating her second ult which is her full combo. Also diana has to wait to see if her q hits before she can use her ult and get a reset (if you ult too soon you actually can beat your Q to the target and lose the reset even if it hits). Once her combo is done she is done, she doesnt get some cheap free safety to throw her back on the outside to wait 6 seconds to run her combo again. Diana is also incredibly weak until about level 9 because she has an incredibly small mana pool 1 full combo will clear her mana bar, and pre 6 she is epically bad, and she is always vulnerable as her gap closer is done right aka it can only be used to hop to enemy players or ENEMY minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-06-09T15:08:15.547+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vegas Dad,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8xUnvn0G,comment-id=001b000200000001000000000001,timestamp=2015-06-09T13:33:14.478+0000)\n>\n>(if you ult too soon you actually can beat your Q to the target and lose the reset even if it hits).\n\nThis is false. If you hit your Q up to .5 seconds after your R (ie, if you casted Q first), your R will reset. I believe this is also why the R does not reset instantly -- it doesn't check for moonlight right away.

I'm just venting my frustration from everyone complaining about EVERY new champion (except Bard). Sorry if I sounded a little rude up there.\n\nIf you wanna learn Morde, just play him non-stop for awhile. He's actually a very simple champion, and pretty easy to learn. One of the biggest things to learn about him if you're using quickcast, which you should be doing, is the range of his E. If you can learn the range of that, then you can poke an enemy in lane and last hit specific minions without pushing your lane too quickly. Most of the time, you'll be pushing your lane without even trying though, so always ward up. Upgrade your trinket ASAP. Mordekaiser is weak against ganks, so get that trinket whenever you can, and always, even if you think you need that gold, buy wards. WARDS! Ok? Ok :D \n\nBesides that, Mordekaiser doesn't scale as well as most Mages with AP, because his ratios aren't that great. \n\nGet that Hextech first > get some boots early > if you're against someone squishy, and you're doing well, get Luden's. Funny thing about Luden's with Mordekaiser that has secured me manyyyyyy kills when they run away (this may not work since they nerfed Luden's). When you ult someone, and they manage to use all of their mobility/CC and whatever to get away, spin in circles, YES CIRCLES, and spam your skills randomly into the air (DON'T HIT ANYTHING WITH THESE SKILLS). This will charge up Luden's, and each time it hits 100, Luden's will proc from anywhere on the map from whoever was ulted and hurt them even more. It works, and it's an amazing way to counter that evil potion they drink.\n\nBesides that, my normal build ends up: {{item:3152}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3001}} (if against AP team or mid) {{item:3157}} (if their AD champs are bugging you) {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}}  and if you ever get a huge lead and get fed, get {{item:3089}}.

In the vast majority of fights it's going to be used the same way, under the same contexts.  If the spell needs a downside (not saying it does) giving it a mana cost isn't going to solve that.\n> \n> That said, from a design standpoint I do agree that there is something to the idea of \"he's been spamming spells and is out of mana, now is my chance to strike.\"  His ult not having a cost directly avoids the minor gameplay idea of \"characters are weak when they're OOM.\"  My bad on that one.  We'll be fixing it for 5.12 by upping the cost to 100 (from 0).  There were localization things that prevented it getting in for 5.11. \n> \n> As a side note, adding higher mana costs across Ekko's kit (we're also upping W cost to 50 from 30 in 5.11) helps mitigate burst in an indirect manner.  Higher costs means he has a harder time farming and may want to invest in more mana/regen itemization. More gold spent on mana + less gold overall = lower AP totals at X point in the game.\n\nYay you finally addressed the issue, I can now copy and paste this on to all the Ekko OP QQ threads.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KazaLyn Shao","date":"2015-06-08T17:00:15.996+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":7,"body":"Riot should really just remove the damage from Ekko's ult.
