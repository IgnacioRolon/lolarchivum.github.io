In fact I believe reaching 40% CDR allows you to shoot off 5 homing acid hunters per noxian corrosive charge.\n\nPhage is a touch cheaper, and provides some interesting stuff at the cost of something like 5 AD and the CDR. Alternatively you could pick up kindlegem if the CDR is what you're concerned about. I'm almost considering completing cleaver before LW unless there are some majorly tanky people on the other team.","replies":[]}]}
