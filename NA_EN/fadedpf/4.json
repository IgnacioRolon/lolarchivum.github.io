Her ult only scales so hard because it hit multiple times; however, if you move out of the short range it does 0 dmg.  She needs the GW on her ult to be able to get a kill on a low heath target.  It is up to you too not get caught out of position.\n\nA champion based on resets should not be dependent on a 210 second CD to kill someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-06-17T21:35:46.869+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"Then attach it to her shunpo","replies":[{"poster":"Kazaashi","date":"2015-06-17T21:58:51.683+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThatAtheist,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y6OIXzol,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-17T21:35:46.869+0000)\n>\n> Then attach it to her shunpo\n\nThat could be a thing, but she is supposed to punish people for bad positioning.
