I was an Azir main all through s4, and I still play him in this season when there is a favorable match up.\n\nHis kit -IS- overloaded, but parts of it such as the turret passive are largely only useful in a niche situation.  The attack speed from CDR he absolutely needs because without it he wouldn't do any damage considering Nashors is literally the only item to grant both attack speed and AP for him.  The fact that he has some strengths in multiple areas doesn't make him OP because he also doesn't excel at any of those areas right now.  He's moderately good at all of them, but not actually doing better than any other champion.\n\nOverall his win rate is sitting at 6th lowest in the game (under urgot).  Even between platinum and diamond level he resides around 44-45% winrate.  Azir sees play in LCS because those are premade teams who know their roles and work together everyday.  So, they can do things like plan to pick Nunu and Azir to combo out.  You can never do that in soloQ, and if you could there are plenty of other combo oriented champions (like yas and any knock up for example).\n\nI just can't even believe anyone is still talking about nerfs for him.  He's been nothing but nerfed since release.  Azir was easily twice as strong on release than he is right now.  His range, damage, damage on his w to turrets and so on have all been nerfed more than once.\n\nThe biggest issue I see with Azir is a flat out misunderstanding of who he is as a champion and how he works.  For example, he doesn't actually shred tanks, it's just that many tanks don't build up as much innate MR and Azir has sustained damage.  So, for example, a Maokai will usually build rod of ages first, but is not likely to build any extra MR until later into the game.\n\nHis high skill cap and all that has nothing to do with his actual winrates or how much power he should have.  Rather he gets a little bit more power from his soldiers because of the level of micromanagement involved.  In other words instead of being an ADC and right clicking on your enemy Azir has to Q to said enemy line up his soldiers and start trying to auto them while keeping them in that circle.  \n\nWhy is this even a thread and how did it get so many upvotes?

Where is the league community?\n\n\nI would upvote for this alone, but you made a lot of good points as well.\n\nAzir's \"poke\" and \"burst\" is still oriented around his management of his soldiers, which is also the source of his sustained damage. I just don't see any necessary nerfs to be made, even if we all agreed his poke and burst needed to be nerfed. The vast majority of his damage are already on his soldiers; I suppose Q has decent damage too, but not nearly as much as pretty much any burst-y mage you can think of. Azir has no \"rotation\" so while Q might hurt, it's not like an Ahri Q or a Leblanc....anything. They have a rotation to follow up on that initial damage. Azir does not have that, he relies on enemies remaining in the range of his soldiers (through various means--ally CC, Q movement, etc) for a long while, to deal damage over time. And that's exactly the definition of sustained damage. \n\nPlus he's got a pretty high skill cap so it's hard for me to say any nerfs are justified; most nerfs would just punish skill players, it's not like he's freelo for people who don't play him.","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-07-06T17:44:25.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to concede that Azir is far from freelo.  If you take a look on champion.gg, even players who are Plat+ still have a low winrate in ranked games with Azir, until they play about 50 or more.  At that point its slightly above average (which would be expected for any champion that somebody plays consistently and repeatedly).  \n\nAlso, your main statement here gave me a lot to reflect on.  I never really thought that over; \"Azir does not have a rotation.\".  I still firmly believe his poke is a bit too strong, but that leaves me a lot to think about in why I enjoy Azir.","replies":[{"poster":"DirkTarTar","date":"2015-07-07T15:24:38.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you can consider is potential bullying in the beginning of the game as strong poke, however that is easily dealt with by buying an early set of boots.\n\nHe has 0 burst without items and it is usually a bad idea to run ignite on him. Which means that you can duel someone, come out on top, but have to capability to force that person to stay in lane other than threatening their tower.\n\nI love Azir. When he was released I was so sad because he was so amazing but was held back by glaringly HUGE bugs. Now that some of the bugs are gone, he has been nerfed suuuuper hard because he can be quite punishing to players for making mistakes.\n\nNow he is barely at 50% his normal strength, has an incredibly low winrate, and is needing advertisement on the homepage as an effort from Riot to say \"look! Azir is totally viable!\" just like they did with Viktor not too long ago to try to spike his pick rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-07-08T00:11:43.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His low win rate is the result of his rather large play rate.

His Q and W allow him to poke somebody substantially, his E gives him some mobility (which can become very high mobility if used correctly), and his R can completely change the landscape of a fight.  His passive is simply an AA steroid (one that is made to work with Azir's itemization) plus the turret active (which is cool af).  Right now if played correctly (which fortunately takes a fairly decent amount of time to learn how) he can respond to just about every situation.\n\nAzir intended niche is a mage who specializes in control, sustained magic damage, and safety.  I would define safety as strong waveclear, decent (but properly gated) mobility, and a CC that gives you a chance at redemption from a bad situation.  The very nature of his kit gives him lane bullying because of his W, but that spell is so integral to Azir that it probably cannot be modified much if at all.   Azir should be strong at killing tanks much like an ADC, and through his Ult and placement/movement of his soldiers he can control the pace of a fight and how it plays out if the player is adept at Azir.  What Azir shouldn't be doing is taking most of a champion's HP with just a Q -> AA once he has a Deathcap.\n\nThe solution to this?  Well, Azir has a lot of multipliers throughout his kit.  Sustained damage generally scales through these multipliers.  For Azir, these multipliers are attack speed, CDR, AP, and magic penetration.  Additionally, striking enemy champions with more than one soldier with Q or an auto-attack makes the second strike deal reduced damage (but still acts as a damage multiplier).  \n\nA good solution (without being too drastic) could be reducing the AP ratio of his Q further (maybe down to 30%?), lowering the AP Ratio on his W (down to 50%), and then increasing his base attack speed from .625 to something more commonly found on an ADC (.658 is common).  If needed, they could also increase the attack speed he receives from his passive.  This would encourage item builds, runes, and masteries to include some source of bonus attack speed outside of his passive.  You can still easily achieve high levels of AP without a Luden's Echo and the AP item changes on PBE will also be a catalyst for this.  \n\nPersonally, I never build Luden's on him (unless stupidly fed).  I prefer to purchase a Stinger after building Morellonomicon -> T2 Boots -> Deathcap.  I then proceed with a normal build until my final item (where I would finish Stinger into Nashor's Tooth).  I generally end up with 1.5-ish attack speed, 720 AP or more, and 40% CDR (over-capped by 5% because of masteries).  I may not be able to poke as hard (keep in mind, your poke is still EXTREMELY potent), but in teamfights I'm feared by tanks and squishies alike.  It also just feels more natural, more how I feel Azir should play (and thus became my preference).\n\nAlso, they could remove the tower-damaging active from Azir's W if they wanted.  It feels like unnecessary power in my opinion, and doesn't really contribute too much to Azir's theme.","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2015-07-06T18:04:03.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-07-06T18:22:31.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree that at times Azir's E may feel a bit over the top for the fact that Azir's wall is already impassable (barring Fizz E and Vlad W, as well as the few blinks in this game).

I feel as though it could feel a bit wonky at times, but we'd have to see first.\n\nThere's honestly a lot of power that could be shaved from Azir and then dispersed throughout his kit in more fitting ways, its just identifying everything.  A few things such as his W being able to damage towers for magic damage (when targeting an enemy tower), or his Ult knocking you back if you dash into it after it has been placed (like, if the initial cast is already over and an enemy dash into the wall as it stands still they will be knocked back again).\n\nIf any balance changes toward Azir were to be focused on changing his damage, I'd strongly encourage they focus on making him the premier DPS mage (second only to Cassiopeia, who is supposed to be a poison mage.

The point it to make it impassible by all *possible* means. If they use a standard wall, people will simply dash through it (see Anivia).\n If they use a stun or a root (see Vieger), the people would have to be allowed through after the CC or become permanently CC'ed.

Have you tried playing him and learning his strengths and weaknesses?  The best counter for any character is knowing how to play them, and against them.\n\nI'm still a newb, but the characters I have the easiest time winning against are the ones I play regularly.  If I get stomped by a character, I add them to my list of characters to try, so I can understand them better and maybe beat them in the future.\n\nLike with Azir, if he spawns two soldiers, chances are you should go in once the first one vanishes.  He can summon at most 1 more while you are fighting him, and he will probably have to use it to escape, and it will burn some mana.  Or, if he throws his soldiers at you with Q, get between him and the soldiers before he uses E.  He will do some damage and get a shield, but if you have him outside of his soldiers aa range and his E is down, you can probably solo him.\n\nYou could also try characters that have long range poke.  I bet he'd have a heck of a time against a lux, ezreal, velkoz, or kogmaw.  I wouldn't want to be a melee champ against an experienced azir tho.  I got my butt kicked by yasuo in my 2nd game with azir, but I can see how he would typically destroy in the scenario.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2015-07-06T10:59:48.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Eh, since his last round of nerfs, Azir is on a weak spot, tbh.

There's a reason he's a top pick in competitive play all the time now. The issue is that he has a high skill cap, so people just keep defending him, despite how insanely overloaded he currently is. He suffers from a similar problem Orianna had a few seasons ago, where she was clearly overloaded, but it took a very long time for her to get tapped, simply because of everyone defending her for her high skill cap.","replies":[]}]}
