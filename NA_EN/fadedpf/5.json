They resourceless, high damage, insane mobility champions and are broken how they are. They need less mobility, less damage or not to be resourceless, maybe a bit of everything in between.\n\n\"They need less mobility, less damage or not to be resourceless\"\n\nYou agreed that a Lee Sin with less damage but keeping his resourceless mobility is fine.

You might be able to call it \"almost nonexistently-resource dependent\" but no matter what you call it it's broken.\n\nI put \"semi\", because strictly speaking he uses energy. I put \"**(**semi**)**\" because I am aware that he's effectively resourceless.

Champions kits are balanced as a kit or a whole, not singled out parts of them and then thrown together. Resourceless mobility combined with high damage output isn't a balanced kit.\n\nEven if resourceless mobility did exist by itself, it would still be broken.

You might be able to call it \"almost nonexistently-resource dependent\" but no matter what you call it it's broken.\n\n> Again, what has that got to do with anything?
