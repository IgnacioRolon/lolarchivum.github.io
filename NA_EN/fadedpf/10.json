Like most who get Frozen Heart get it not because it's better than Deadman's, but because 15% AS slow, 20% CDR, and mana is a whole lot of awesomeness. Randuin's Omen was given more power by reducing crit damage on top of reducing AS. While it's armor and health are low, that actually fits the meta now incredibly. Ninja Tabi+Randuin's=ADC's crying in a corner because their late game base AD was nerfed and all their items got AD nerfs. Lots of AD loss and since they usually get 50% crit after this patch, you can count every 1 AD loss as 1.75 AD. (Crits are 2.5, chance is .5). That's a lot of AD being lost there from just IE losing 15, BT losing 5, BotRK losing 2% current health, each ADC losing about 10ish AD base late game, plus LW doesn't affect base armor while most tanks have 85ish-100ish armor base at max level. Scary stuff.\n\nAlso, the 15% is on champs who have 500 more health than you. Any champ who has a RoA, Cleaver, Rylai's, or really anything with health on it at all will give that bonus, not just tanks.\n\nThe new item is a bit overkill though. 40% heal reduction on every AA just seems a little overly powerful. It's one thing for a champ to counter healing, but it's a whole new story when one item does it without much of a loss of stats. 15% is sort of a lot, but it's not that much of a loss when you compare it to how much less damage you'll have to put out against a drain tank, like Aatrox and WW, or hyper regen based tank, like Mundo and Voli.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proelium","date":"2015-11-04T09:08:40.309+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FadedPaperFigure,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hgL1fKhK,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-11-04T02:13:16.009+0000)\n>\n> Why even play a tank then?

In a general sense, grievous wounds is more of a laning stat than a teamfight stat; by the time a given marksman is going to confront a mundo or vlad it's already past the laning phase, and if they're not problematic by that point (i.e. they got trashed) I would spend my gold on other stuff.\n\nIf there is a swain going around wrecking our team then yes, I would consider giant slayer, but in the case of the other 2, I think I'd rather try and break through their giant HP pool while being more awesome against the other members of their team then try and negate their slower healing mechanics.\n\nIf I was playing Riven or Talon top though...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2015-11-04T11:50:54.600+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only has to implement one change to it: \n\n\n#Only gives grievous wounds when the target is below the 40% Health\n\n{{item:3165}} BAM","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2015-11-04T07:01:56.086+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Is this still an issue? Okay, here's the thing. No ADC is going to give up 15% bonus damage to get Grievous Wounds unless a heal tank is carrying the enemy team hard. Why? They lost AD and attack speed. Yes, they gained crit, but their overall DPS has been reduced if they're not using Giant Slayer (and because they basically never build health, almost everyone will qualify for the bonus damage). It is much more feasible for a mage to apply GW anyway, since it's less likely to interfere with their damage. So ADCs are mostly out for this one, unless you are directly wrecking their face as Vlad or Aatrox. Not just winning, but totally dominating them. In an other situation, taking Mortal Reminder over Lord Dominik's Regards is a net loss for them in terms of effective damage output. ADCs probably won't even use GW to fight each other because they'll blow each other up no matter what, and it's a loss when fighting anyone else.\n\nNow, bruisers. They're not likely to be able to use Giant Slayer against most people, so they COULD grab Mortal Reminder. But, see, they're not going to give up 300 health, 20% CDR, 15 more AD, Rage passive, and TOTAL armor shred to get bonus armor penetration and GW. And since LW and its upgrades are now bonus armor pen, having Black Cleaver stacks on a target makes Last Whisper next to useless. Bruisers aren't going to build both of them. It's not happening. Executioner's Calling being tied to Last Whisper is what will keep it as a niche item that is only bought to counter someone with high healing when they are getting out of control, just to have a fighting chance. It's not a nail in the coffin of any of those champions you listed. It's going to be fine.\n\nAnd the reason it's not \"hidden power\" here is because it's an item everyone has access to. Everyone who builds it knows why, and everyone who fears it knows to look for it. That's pretty different from Miss Fortune just happening to have it when most people played her for other reasons. At the times when it proved useful, most people probably weren't even aware of why she won a fight. Yes, there WERE some people who SPECIFICALLY looked to MF to provide Grievous Wounds against a sustain lane, but those were relatively few, and now all of those people have the option of buying an early Executioner's Calling if they really want to (like if they're against bot lane Kindred, or Cait is getting too many Bloodlust crits). And see, that's going to cost them gold that could be better spent on other things, so if you're forcing them to buy it, you're doing pretty well.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2015-11-04T08:26:52.438+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Grievous Wounds on an entire team is still beneficial since it completely removes summoner heal from an equation and beats their ADC who is more or less a drain tank with absurd damage attached to it.

(or was it the previous?) I would, however, agree that in his case, something needs to be done. His ult is often integral in his effect on a team fight, and by being so easily able to apply GW (and regardless of his current level of HP), this is a massive nerf to the doctor. \n\nNasus is still absurd...unless specifically countering him and paying above average attention to him (i.e., camping him), which a good nasus almost necessitates, he can spike HARD mid game and take 2-3 towers easily in a single push. Not to mention if you can stack Q competently, he can single-handedly win team fights mid-game. HIS life stealing is almost oppressive against many top-laners, as it leaves them unable to harass him, while he out scales many of them and can potentially influence the map to a  much greater degree.\n\nI agree aatrox needs help. This, however, goes beyond GW.\n\nWarwick im not so sure...he isn't very popular, like most of these champs, but I've seen good ones carry. Take map control by skirmishing and 1v1ing, and also completely shutting down main enemy carries with a good timed ult. However, in this case, i would agree the constant GW will gut him. His life steal_ specifically_ is what makes him powerful, unlike some of these others. He will need compensation I am sure. Perhaps an active that immunizes him to GW? That way there are windows of counter play on both sides.\n\nAnd lastly Fiddle, ahhh fiddle, my man. As crazy as it sounds, i don't see this change significantly affecting him. Yes, it will absolutely hurt him when he tries to drain tank an ADC, and for that, he may perhaps need help. However, imo, fiddle doesn't rely on his W to win fights and the game. He will almost assassinate squishes with his R E Q W combo. The majority of the time during this scenario, an ADC will be either silenced, feared, or running for their lives. The W is icing on the cake, but often is unnecessary to kill the ADC. They simply cannot withstand his ult without proper peel, something a good fiddle will have planned for and positioned for properly.\n...\nThese views are me trying to be unbiased. I regularly play {{champion:36}} {{champion:9}} and {{champion:75}} . Additionally, ADC is my worst and least favorite role. Im just not convinced these changes are as cataclysmic as many people are suggesting. Let's wait and see shall we? I understand not every champion receives equal treatment (*cough* {{champion:103}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:82}} ), but with such a huge roster, it's asking a lot. Not everyone will always be happy, but given that Taric and Poppy are the next reworks, at least i think we can say Riot is trying. It's only a matter of time before the likes of{{champion:266}} {{champion:83}} are addressed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorae42","date":"2015-11-04T06:47:55.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To anyone saying that by taking the GW item the ADC is missing out on 15% dmg against anyone with more than 500 max hp than them.\n\nYou realize that if you're up against a sustain support/ADC that neither of them will have significantly more HP than you and will both lose every trade since you've made it a 2v1? Especially since you get to reduce any lifesteal the opposing ADC bought as well. And since the new meta is looking like ADCs are going to be insane, I think it'd be better to be able to duel/take out ADCs (and any mages who hate themselves enough to try and play early next season) than deal extra dmg to tanks/bruisers.\n\nIt also says \"whenever you deal physical damage\". Haven't tried it, but doesn't that mean Varus and Caitlyn will get it on their Q and champions like Zed will get it on all of their abilities (should they decide to get one...) ?
