No matter what I do to make it show up I just cant see it. I know its there because if I move my mouse over something it lights up to click on it. I tried searching it up and cant find anything saying how to see it in the newest version. I am new at playing and don't know how to do this.

See if resetting your config might help for this case:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nIf you're on a 4k, you'll want to scale your in-game and native resolution down to 1920x1080 at most.","replies":[{"poster":"Trix2198","date":"2017-11-10T17:41:50.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do I find my in-game and native resolution to turn it down?","replies":[]}]}]}
