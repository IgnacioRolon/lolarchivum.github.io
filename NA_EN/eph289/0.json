I specifically chose not to include Akali because her scaling is weird due to her passive.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\nI considered Lich Bane as the second non-boots item that these champions bought\n\nThe champions are level 16. \n\nAssumed 40 AP from runes, masteries, and a Doran's Ring, which is ballpark close. \n\nYou take Arcane Blade on all of these champions\n\nI included the proposed ratio buffs for Fizz and TF for the new Lich Bane values\n\nThis forum doesn't support tables, so ask if you don't understand.\n\n{{champion:105}}  **Fizz** \nTotal AP: (40+120 (Zhonya's) + 80 (Lich Bane) = 240\n\nOld Lich Bane (2 procs): 484 damage\n\nNew Lich Bane (2 procs): 416 damage\n\nQWER with Old Lich Bane (2 procs): 2005\n\nQWER with New Lich Bane (2 procs): 1961\n\nIf Fizz bought Deathcap instead of Lich Bane: 1663\n\n{{champion:10}}  **Kayle** \nTotal AP: (40 + 60 (Nashor's Tooth) + 80 (Lich Bane) = 180\n\nOld Lich Bane (2 procs): 338\n\nNew Lich Bane (2 procs): 272\n\nQEEE with Old Lich Bane (2 procs): 1255\n\nQEEE with New Lich Bane (2 procs): 1189\n\nIf Kayle bought Deathcap instead of Lich Bane: 1171\n\n{{champion:4}}  **Twisted Fate** \nTotal AP: (40+120 (Zhonya's) + 80 (Lich Bane) = 240\n\nOld Lich Bane (2 procs): 484\n\nNew Lich Bane (2 procs): 413\n\nQWE with Old Lich Bane (2 procs): 1241\n\nQWE with New Lich Bane (2 procs): 1194\nIf TF bought Deathcap instead of Lich Bane: 986\n\n{{champion:115}}  **Ziggs** \nTotal AP: (40 + 60 (Athene's) + 80 (Lich Bane) = 180\n\nOld Lich Bane (2 procs): 388\n\nNew Lich Bane (2 procs): 349\n\nQ(P)WERQ(P) with Old Lich Bane (2 procs): 2650\n\nQ(P)WERQ(P) with New Lich Bane (2 procs): 2611\nIf Ziggs bought Deathcap instead of Lich Bane: 2661\n\n**Let's look at the competitive pick/ban rates for these champions as well:**\n\n{{champion:105}}  **Fizz**\n\nNA LCS:  3.6% pick/ban\n\nEU LCS:  6.7% pick/ban\n\nGPL: 15.2% pick/ban\n\nOGN Masters: 0% pick/ban\n\nLNL (China): 6.3% pick/ban\n\n{{champion:10}} **Kayle**\n\nNA LCS: 44.6% pick/ban rate\n\nEU LCS:  70% pick/ban rate\n\nGPL:  18.2% pick/ban rate\n\nOGN Masters: 0% pick/ban rate\n\nLNL (China): 18.8% pick/ban rate\n\n{{champion:4}} **Twisted Fate**\n\nNA LCS: 0%\n\nEU LCS: 0%\n\nGPL: 3%\n\nOGN Masters: 0%\n\nLNL (China): 0%\n\n{{champion:115}}  **Ziggs**\n\nNA LCS: 28.6%\n\nEU LCS: 51.7%\n\nGPL: 54.5%\n\nOGN Masters: 60%\n\nLNL (China): 87.5%\n\nOut of the 4 champions studied, both Kayle and Ziggs are the only ones who could potentially be problematic in competitive play. Both were already recently nerfed, and that nerf's impact has yet to be fully realized. However, **even if Kayle and Ziggs were the intended targets of this nerf, the nerf barely affects them** while it does significant damage to Fizz and TF, who are competitive non-factors.\n\nAll right, enough exposition. I have questions for Riot:\n\n1) Is this nerf targeted at Kayle/Ziggs?\n\n2) If so, are you aware that all this does is remove Lich Bane from their build path or at worst delay it without changing their damage? This only affects their 6-item case, as both will get equal mileage out of Deathcap. Kayle can itemize DFG instead of Lich Bane and keep bursting and Ziggs doesn't really need it either. \n\n3) Are you aware that TF and Fizz get hit far worse by this nerf than the 2 competitive Lich Bane users (Akali is a competitive niche pick atm)?\n\n4) The only impact this would is removing some tower-pushing capability from Ziggs and Kayle as well as making them slower, at the cost of nerfing anyone else who might have picked up this item. Kayle's recent mana buffs to her ult mean she barely values the stat, and Ziggs will build Athene's. 80 AP is nice but obtainable elsewhere. Does that seem like a reasonable conclusion?\n\n5) I don't understand these changes. What is their purpose, Riot?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nThe Lich Bane nerfs disproportionately affect Twisted Fate and Fizz, neither of whom are dominating competitive play, over Kayle and Ziggs\n\nEven if Kayle and Ziggs were in need of more nerfing (debate that as you please), all this does is remove or delay their purchase of Lich Bane. They get the same champion damage spike (or better in Ziggs' case) from buying Deathcap instead. \n\nLich Bane is not a dominant competitive item, and nerfing it will only marginalize its niche as the \"sustained damage mage item\" further compared to DFG, Zhonya's, and Rabadon's.\n\nEDIT: Apparently bulleted lists aren't working, so the formatting looks like crap.

Kayle's Q already got nerfed so one shotting with Q + Lich Bane Nashor's E is harder, and Lulu is mainly a support, if Riot doesn't like the amount of damage and lane bullyness that Lulu brings then nerf her base damages or AP ratios instead of nerfing an item that affects other non picked in LCS but picked in solo queue champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-02-28T23:13:48.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i doubt these are the final numbers for it since a patch came out this week. your numbers and reasoning make some solid points no doubt but id wait and watch before making to many judgement calls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-02-28T23:02:12.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also has the disadvantage of nerfing Ap Sona and AP Ezreal!\n\nI may be their only player, but dammit it's fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luner Hunter","date":"2014-02-28T22:06:46.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey look riots looking at nerfing another item just because...

If they're out to get Kayle and Ziggs, this nerf won't do it. They have alternate itemization choices that allow them to keep up in damage until the 6-item case.

Not sure on Lulu tbh, but if it's just Lulu, why target Lich Bane when the buffs to TF and Fizz don't remotely make up for that.","replies":[]}]}]}
