I would love to sit in jail for 1-2 years if it means I still get to keep all the houses me and my family own because I stole money or used it for my own gains.\n\nhell even stupid people on tv, religion cult addicts are stealing money from people with lies, people are weak and would believe everything. and every day I keep asking myself why the hell im not doing the same?, this stupid ugly woman on tv started a cult out of nothing, people actually gave her so much money, it sounds ridicules to me because some of those people were **DOCTORS **AND **Lawyers**!!!, people who &quot;should&quot; be smart. now she&#039;s rich as hell and even tho she should be in jail she&#039;s free.\n\nthere is no karma, there&#039;s nothing, I don&#039;t believe in god or even being good to others. and I know im smarter than those rich idiots and you&#039;ve seen the people who vote. many are more educated than me, yet they are mind blowing stupid because they are weak and would believe anything they are told, because it&#039;s easier not to think for yourself. not a single one of them died by an angry mob, so why the hell am I not doing the same?. \n\nim stupid, and so are you, for working long hard hours, when you could be just talking, selling lies and then leave the country go live somewhere else as a rich man (incase you&#039;re worried someone will try to find you). I just wished it would bother me more to a point where I would do something about it, but it&#039;s not, im to brain washed to be fair a kind to others..\n\np.s.\n\n**how do you think Banks work?, they use your money to in rich themselves, do you know of a single human being who had a lot of power and did not abuse it?, humanity it seems can&#039;t handle power..**","replies":[]}
