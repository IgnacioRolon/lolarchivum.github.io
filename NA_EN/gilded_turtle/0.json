Or at least, that&#039;s what is supposed to happen. Currently, whenever she throws the dagger up, it spazzes out and jerks around in the air before finally coming down for Katarina to catch it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-03T18:32:26.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report! Looks like the animation was re-exported, which may have caused the animation to become compressed. D: I can follow up with the team and see if we can get this re-exported again properly, which should resolve the issue. :)","replies":[]}]}
