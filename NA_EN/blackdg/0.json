Just curious because ive been looking at some of your replies to others. Just wanted your opinion on something. Youve said earlier and i quote \"People don't get banned for curse words or vulgar language. Shit, shit, fuck.\" and in the riot summoners code it states under section 4 Titled 'Enjoy Yourself, but not at Anyone Else's Expense', \"Remember, taking a jab at your friend in the middle of the game is a lot different than making a gib remark at a complete stranger.\"\n\nI'd like you to look at my case, because this account was permabanned over two of my last games. In which i was using vulgar language with my brother in game. Tribunal obviously did not consider that. Meaning i was wrongfully banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunda","date":"2018-03-11T04:37:28.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/ITzM132h-perma-banned-for-swearing-at-my-little-brother","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2018-02-26T22:54:15.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"reset your pw","replies":[{"poster":"blackdg","date":"2018-02-26T22:58:33.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is what i get and thanks for your help\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/2f57658cdc4ccf78f0bbf2b33b94ae6f","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-02-26T23:01:17.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackdg","date":"2018-02-26T22:57:47.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is what i get when i try to reset password\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/2f57658cdc4ccf78f0bbf2b33b94ae6f","replies":[]}]}
