You spam ping the living hell up there to tell him the enemy jungler is there. The top laner ignores the pings, gets ganked, dies. \r\n-The top laner then decides to overextend, you ping for him to get back, he gets 1v3 ganked, he dies again.\r\n-You tell the top laner to play safe and stop engaging, they want to 1v1 all in the enemy 2 lvls above him with 1.5k gold than them, then dies.\r\n-You tell bot lane to ward because theyre both sitting on 2 vision score 15 minutes into the game, bot lane refuses to, then dies to the enemy jungler gank.\r\n\r\nWhy is it you can punish those who say &quot;stop dying and play safe&quot;, but you cant punish those who intentionally lose the game for everyone else. Look at my previous games, I try my hardest to win, I try to tell people to just ward and play safe but they dont listen and just throw. This game is 100% team game based now, and refusing to communicate is so annoying because it pretty much guarentees a loss.\r\n\r\nIm not saying punish them with a chat ban, just put them in lower priority queue or something. Somewhere where everyone can goof off and not give two shits about winning for 5 games.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-04-06T06:39:15.651+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The punishment for contributing less to a team's chance of winning than the average player from the pool that you're currently in, is losing games more often.\n\nWhen someone loses games more often, their MMR gets reduced.\n\nPeople with low MMR are placed in games with other people who have low MMR.\n------------------------\nIf you contribute more to a team's chance of winning than the average player from the pool that you're currently in, you will win more games.\n\nWhen you win more games, your MMR will rise.\n\nWith a higher MMR, you will be placed in games with other people who have higher MMR.\n---------------------------\nIf you placed a diamond 5 player in bronze, they'd win more often than they lose because they contribute more to a team than the average bronze player.\n\nIf you placed a diamond 5 player on stage in World's, they'd lose more often than they win because they contribute less to a team than the average professional player.\n--------------------------\nWith that as a given, some introspection could be useful. If the players that are matched with you have obvious flaws, perhaps you too have an obvious flaw, or several minor flaws that work together to hinder you.\n\nImproving yourself is much easier than improving your teammates. You are in contact with yourself for much more time than a single match. It's also more rewarding, as improving other people doesn't generally benefit you personally and learning how to improve yourself in a single instance can be applied to many other areas in your life down the road.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonlytee","date":"2018-04-06T06:48:54.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this isn't the point of your beautifully written post, but how did you make those amazing looking line separations?\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-04-06T07:21:19.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A set of three or more dashes or underscores  ( --- or ___ ) on a line with no other text.\n___\n---\n\nSometimes clicking on \"quote\" underneath a post will show you the raw input required to, for example [link](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) to the support site.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BainTheBanned","date":"2018-04-06T04:36:16.881+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even if your framing of this is right, who says you deserve to be listened to?\n\nEver heard of the \"boy who cried wolf\"\n\nOver pinging is an issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venompaw","date":"2018-04-06T11:54:07.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because I don't trust your sense of tactics.
