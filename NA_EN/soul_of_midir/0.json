I haven't lost any rp for it yet and my friend hasn't been on yet to confirm if she's gotten it so i can't say completely.\nContinuing to attempt gifting it results in the same error over and over, yet i can gift others fine.\nThanks for the swift reply though it is appreciated. \nP.S we've been friends for awhile and requirements are met","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-08T16:08:44.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!
