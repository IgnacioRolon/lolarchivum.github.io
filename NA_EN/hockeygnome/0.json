At one point I was able to join the website using a VPN and sent an application, however now the VPN isn't resolving error 505. I've also tried different browsers and computers but nothing is working. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T22:40:47.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an issue we've been looking into, and VPN has been a solid workaround.  If the VPN isn't working and clearing your [cache and cookies](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies) isn't working, there isn't much else we can do until the issue is resolved.  My suggestion would be to keep tinkering around with VPN for now.
