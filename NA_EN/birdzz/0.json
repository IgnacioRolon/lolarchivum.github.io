Galio, not sure what to think.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, this new Galio is like a hyped up mix of Poppy, Gragas, Rammas and Pantheon with all of their tankyness combined.. today i watched a Galio support manage to kill my ADC ( a 10-4 Lucian ) Through a Braum, and an Aniva.. Stuns and all, this cat still managed to kill my ADC.. I mean, of course the Lucian could have kited better, but I mean He just jumped back onto him.. By the end of this 3v1 fight.. I was just about dead The Anivia and flashed out and my Lucian was dead.. Im not complaining about balance, I&#039;m sure theres some sort of logic and scaling and way to counter this, I just have half a clue what it is.. I mean Im bronze after all.. I&#039;m just curious what the counter play is to to a hyper tank that can burst you for 75% and has rediculous mobility... Like.. really.. Someone tell me and ill try it, cause Im out of Idea&#039;s here, even hard CC isnt working at this point. It doesnt last long enough for us to kill him, Unless you chain CC&#039;d him with all of your teams CC. IDK man..  Suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-01T19:58:35.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing matters in bronze except which team gets leeroy jenkins, and how many of them they get.\nMatchups do not matter, neither does scaling or strategy. Everything is eclipsed by the blinding light of sheer stupidity and inexperienced players.\n\nThings nobody does in bronze: \n Buy {{item:3140}} (looking at you, Lucian)\n Buy any armor/mr item unless it is a core part of their build, in which case they build it regardless of matchups.\n Buy any form of armor pen/magic pen, except by accident.\n Buy wards; boots are also optional.\n Remember that the enemy team is potentially anywhere on the map until they are observed, instead of nonexistent until observed.\n Remember that a defending team typically has a huge advantage in teamfights.\n Figure out that if something did not work (in exactly the same way) _three times_, it also wont work the fourth time.","replies":[]}]}
