You're 30 now.\n\nAlso, I have seen this concept floating around. I love the idea of a Chinese dragon skin, but overall I think Shyv herself look waaay too different - it doesn't *look like Shyvana* to me. It could certainly take a similar direction, but her human form would need to look more like \"Shyvana visits Hong Kong\" and less \"Random anime girl with dragon fists\"","replies":[{"poster":"Hinata Rabbit","date":"2015-09-12T07:58:50.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I Agree with it being a bit out of her character, but what i mainly want from this skin is the hair style shes wearing, some sort of Chinese inspired dress and the look of the dragon in the above image.\n\nI particularly like the Gold/White/Cyan colors here","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krataros","date":"2015-09-24T00:19:51.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"judging by the artwork she seems smaller and skinnier than Shyvana and seems like she could be Shyvana's little sister almost, witch in itself would also be awesome.
