{"poster":"Ikiimoni","date":"2014-09-27T21:50:15.402+0000","title":"3 Teams, 1 Map","subforum":"Maps & Modes","up_votes":176,"down_votes":8,"body":"**2.0! New Questions Added! Improved Format!**\n\nI don't know exactly what this map would be called, but it would focus around the fact that there are 3 teams in the game, rather than 2. The map would be circular, and have four jungles, like any other classic game mode. I present this idea because I feel there should be a dynamic map, where everything can be hectic, and rather than the game feeling like a battle, it feels like a war. In order to format how I feel the information should be presented, the following lines will be a Q&A, on what I could expect to be asked to me. A diagram of the map for this arena is attached.\n---------------------------\n\nhttp://imgur.com/8dJEMpe\n\n------------------------------\n**Q:** There are usually only two teams, what would the third team be called?\n**A:** The teams would be called Blue, Red and Yellow, named for the primary colors.\n\n**Q:** What happens to the people in 3rd or 2nd place after defeat?\n**A:** Both would have their placements shown in match history and after being defeated, rather than defeat. Also, 2nd place would get about 90% IP/XP of what a winner in a summoners rift match would get, but the 3rd place would only get 50%. Since there are three teams, the team that gets 1st place would get far more IP/XP than usual, since they had a lower chance of success.\n\n**Q:** When a nexus is destroyed, what happens to it, as well as any other remaining structures?\n**A:** Minions would continue marching clockwise/counterclockwise as if nothing happened, but with a different path. Inhibitors for the 3rd place team would lose the benefits to the team that destroyed them, and turrets for the 3rd place team would crumble. Notice the path that leads between the team jungles and the central jungle. Minions would start marching down those paths, saving time and distance, so they don't have to make a lap around the entire map.\n\n**Q:** What is the difference between the team jungles and the center jungle?\n**A:** The team jungles would carry buffs similar to blue/red in summoners rift, and they would have lower level monsters, and basic buffs. The mid-jungle would be much more rewarding, with stronger and more rewarding monsters as well as a boss monster similar to Nashor, possibly even stronger due to the amount of summoners.\n\n**Q:** Why are there no bushes on the image below? How are we supposed to hide?\n**A:** I made the diagram in MS Paint. Don't expect me to put bushes all over the place with that. I trust Riot to place bushes wisely, as well as abundantly enough to make Summoners feel at home.\n\n**Q:** What would the Stats Overview track for this map?\n**A:** Assuming this was filed under Classic Mode, the same things. If this was its own game mode entirely, probably amount of times in 1st Place,  Takedowns, and Minion/Monster kills.\n\n**Q:** Assuming there was ranked, how would people gain and lose ranks?\n**A:** 3rd place would lose points, 2nd place would stay still, and 1st place would gain points towards the next rank.\n\n**Q:** How large would teams be?\n**A:** I think that there could be 3-5 players on each team. There would need to be at least one person in each lane, as well as a maximum of two junglers. If there were 5 players, I would suggest two people in each lane and one jungler.\n\n**Q:** What about global effects and spells, like Karthus' ult?\n**A:** Items and champions are always tweaked from map to map. Assuming that Karthus can't specifically choose one team to attack, it would either be a completely different move, or have even less damage.\n\n**Q:** Would a Decakill be possible?\n**A:** Assuming there 5 players on each team, of course. There would be in ascending order, a kill, a double kill, a triple kill, Quadrakill, Pentakill, Hexakill, Septakill, Octakill, Novakill, and finally Decakill.\n\n**Q:** If a member of Team A got a kill on a member of Team B, is it possible for a member of Team C to get credit for an assist?\n**A:** Yes, although the XP and gold gained would be slightly less.\n\n**Q:** How would the lobby work for the team that places 3rd?\n**A:** The team in 3rd place would have an option to either spectate, or go straight to a lobby, where they would give honors as well as report people as usual.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{{item:3067}}**HOT TOPIC!!!**\n**Q:** What about 2v1?!!?!?! \n**A:** So. Many. People. Commented. Let's put this in a description of how the game could work. Team A can't privately request that Team B helps them with Team C. There is only team chat, and all chat available, no chat for specific teams to see and not see. Also, Team A and Team B couldn't all go in one lane together, having 10 players in one lane. If Team A went to the Team B-C lane, they'd have to deal with twice as many turrets shooting at them, as well as both team's minions and champions dealing splash or AoE damage. Team C would have enough protection from a gang-up in order to stay safe, and deal with all the foes effectively. A team is supposed to have an even amount of champions in the clockwise and counterclockwise lanes, any leftover champions in the jungle. A Decakill should only be possible if the enemy is pulling a dumb move and trying to swarm one lane, or if every single champion is in the jungle. Deserting a lane in order to push on a specific team is completely stupid, and again, two teams have no way to communicate without the third team seeing as well.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease leave feedback, as well as any questions below! I'll make sure to try and respond to them, as well as add them to the above lines.\n\n** I am aware that by posting this idea, I am giving Riot permission to use my idea, as well as alter it without telling me, and I accept that fact.**","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-09-28T22:31:44.896+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":1,"body":"In order to address the 2v1 problem that's being brought up quite a bit, I would recommend taking a page out of the (most recent) Civilization board game.\nIn that board game, if a player takes the capital city of another player, that player wins the game.

Think WoW raid hard. It would be something that could quite easily take 5 minutes to kill, and would no doubt require the effort of all the teams to wittle down it's health bit by bit, and as it gets nearer to it's death, the focus would shift from taking it's health down to making sure the other teams don't kill it for themselves. Also, the thing would be extremely powerful and would no doubt do lots of damage so to address this there would be health packs scattered around the map to help sustain you for the duration of the fight. And the creature wouldn't just stand in one spot like Baron or Vilemaw, it would actually move across the map as the battle rages on, adding a new element that the players would have to address to take it down. Finally, while the fight would probably take like 3-5 minutes, that would still make for too short a game, so to address that to win your team will have had to deal the killing blow to the creature a total of at least 3 times, that way games last long enough to be fun. Like I said, this is just something my mind randomly came up with, spur of the moment, so sorry if this sounds reallyy stupid.

They all revive after the last monster is killed)... they will all gain full health they will still roam the same path but will aggressively attack any enemy champion in their vision, granting gold per hit to the person who smited them.\n\nI'm assuming the best place for a roaming buff like this would be the center jg since it will have the highest stakes. this would introduce cool gameplay, like if your team is disadvantaged and another team is trying to take the epic baron like monster, the jungler could take this camp. This means that hoarding up until your second stack of smite can give you huge steal potential. Also since the whole group wont revive and become allied until the last unit is killed, you can sorta \"trap\" the camp. Use smite on the chief and kill him and two of his subordinates, but leave the last one alive. Now if someone goes to clear that last monster, then the whole camp will respawn and fight for you. Also it would put a pressure to find that camp and kill it before someone can either \"trap\" it or clear it later and use it to steal a buff. It makes timing of taking the epic monster even more crucial.\n\nNow again this would be a camp similar to the power and stature of raptors, so its not like its going to make the game too hectic, and also the camp will still roam its same path, so one could avoid it and not get crushed in the central jg. It just seems like a really cool way to make a lot of plays happen if a jg knows how to use it.\n\njust sounds kinda cool\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n_**Day and night**_\n\nSimply every like 8 minutes is either sunset or sunrise, have a night time and day time. It would be cool\nmaybe have some bio luminescent creatures in the jungle and have torches or magic glow effects\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------\n_**Altars and Offerings**_\nsimilar to twisted tree line, there are altars in each of the three outer jungles. These altars can be captured by standing in them for a long enough period of time. However their effects are based on whether it is day or night and the last unit attacked (if multiple champions are in the zone, you can receive multiple effects). It locks when taken just like any other altar. Also _altar bonuses stack with each other_, meaning that invading the enemy jungle for an altar could be worth it. Team collaboration and jg control can be the difference between getting one barely noticeable effect and having practically a baron buff equivalent (if your team captures each altar with at least three different last hits, there will be icons that appear above the altar when you are capturing it that will show what all buffs you will be receiving)    \n\n**Day**\n-lane minion- Reckoning\nevery allied unit receives an additional 10% of their armor and magic resists as a bonus (yes this includes minions and tribe camp if allied )\n\n-Jungle monster- Wisdom\nevery thirty seconds your team grants vision of two random jungle camps on the map for 5 seconds\n\n-champion- Vengeance\nOn champion kills and assist, your entire team regenerates 5% of their missing health and mana over 10 seconds\n\n**Night**\n-lane minion- Rending\nbasic attacks deal additional true damage equal to champion level.
