However, because they were a squad of 3, I was reported and my account was then perma banned....\r\n\r\nI have been playing LoL since Season 2 and Had over 45 Legacy skins and thousands and thousands of dollars worth of skins and champions. Sadly, it seems like there is nothing I can do about this and I think it is ridiculous being that I was only reported because I got in a argument with people INT feeding on my team in Solo/Duo\r\n\r\n Is there anything I can to get the account I have played on for the past 7 years? My account with skins and champions I spent basically all of my money on? I do not feel like the things I said should have gotten me banned and I truly believe I was banned because of a 3 man Squad trolling and reporting me.\r\n\r\nThe worst thing I said was &quot;trash, im reporting for INT&quot;. I admit I shouldn&#039;t have said this, but is this really fair? 3v1 on reports when they were all feeding on purpose. My veigar support, 1-10 cho top, 1-14 mid lisandra? Why does this have to happen to me... It is the only game I play and this account is something I have worked hard on for the past 7 years even if I am not too good.\r\n\r\nIs there any hope anymore?","replies":[]}
