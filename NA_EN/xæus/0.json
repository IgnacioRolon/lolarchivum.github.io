For example when you play Rengar and you want to keep your Ferocity that means, you want to stay in combat, and activate tiamat/Ravenous Hydra active your stacks will run out. I don't think it's inteded to be this way so i just wanted to make the statement that it's in the game like that.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-04-23T00:24:35.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it doesn't hit anything, it shouldn't.

It sounds 100% working as intended that casting arbitrary spells at nothing as you move across the map isn't considered combat.","replies":[]}]}
