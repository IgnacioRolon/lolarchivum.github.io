Why will they always play?\r\nBecause they have put their identity and existence into this game, the community, and thrown their lot in with Riot no matter what Riot does. That to me is dangerous only because they flood the forums, defending Riot, instead of criticizing Riot where they need it. \r\nIf I criticize Riot, one of these people will start by telling me that I am wrong for not liking Riot's bad decisions, and furthermore, will get their friends, to jump in on the discussion to agree with them and insult me, because my identity as a person isn't hinging on this community or the game, or Riot itself, so by me insulting Riot, I am insulting all of their attached identity with it. \r\n\r\nThis is wrong actually, I am not insulting people who have made this their complete identity, I am telling the company and the players what is bad about the game, objectively and subjectively.\r\nThe fact you guys take offense is by your own doing, because this all means so much to you, and you seek that acceptance through this. \r\n\r\nSo to be clear I am not here to threaten your identity as a League player, or Streamer, or tell you its bad to blindly love Riot, I am saying that if I voice a concern about what Riot is doing wrong, you don't need to defend it from the perspective that I am attempting to debase the whole nerd society that identifies with being a LOL player, or that being a nerd who plays LOL is bad. \r\n\r\nYou are not the game, and you are not Riot. \r\nI am not stopping you from doing what you do, I am trying to get people to understand why the game is bad in certain ways, and want it to improve. \r\nThis is my motive ok. \r\n\r\nDrop your Sir Lancelot White Knight Shield for Riot guys, I am not here for your heads. \r\nI am actually your ally in the sense I want the game to be better, like everyone should want if they play this game.\r\n\r\nAs for Anime tropes and other things, I don't hate anime, but I am tired of the Tropes you nerds. Also SJW agenda nonsense should also go away, its annoying. These things are less important to me than the overall message, and that is stop feuding with me as if I am attacking you, I am not. \r\n\r\nOh, and I think there is a 4th group, and they are people who come here to read and post, and aren't angry players, or aren't Fanboys or Mods, but just come in the hang and read, and have fun. I just wanted to talk about those main 3, so lay off me on the grouping, thanks ya nerds.","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2019-08-29T23:29:48.185+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"So your point is we are either mindless drones or hate the game.
