The game is seriously unplayable now and unless you gain quite a bit of LP from wins, you will find yourself as frustrated as me. I am consistent in every match and do well, but it feels as though I am matched with really toxic players and AFKers. Why does Riot allow this kind of toxicity in their game? I was Gold 1 in Season 4 and don't remember this much toxicity and people going afk; unless you were in Bronze. Riot should ban players from ranked if they AFK too many games or troll their team. Why drive out the decent players that enjoy playing ranked because of trolls? I don't get it. Make the punishment harsher to steer people from trolling please.","replies":[{"poster":"PekiCodex","date":"2020-03-01T12:09:11.070+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">Why does Riot allow this kind of toxicity in their game?\n\nThey don't? Last I checked players are still not allowed to be toxic and intentionally sabotage their team.

Last I checked players are still not allowed to be toxic and intentionally sabotage their team. Of course other than that, nothing's stopping them from doing it.\n\nHaving a rule without reasonable enforcement is akin to not having a rule.\n\nI've had two teammates in just the last week who were actually troll accounts. They were throwing matches intentionally, with usernames like \"LPFeederRiotSux\" and a match history with a 15% win rate over months of games where their personal scores were 1-11, 2-19, 0-7, 0-12, 3-11 etc. In game, the griefing was more evident. Using flash in spawn, using heal the second a teammate that they could have saved dies and throwing up an emote, not buying items remotely related to their champion/position, playing Tahm Kench and eating teammates to either inhibit farm or reposition them into the enemy team, etc.\n\nIt's pretty insane that people who aren't even _trying_ to hide troll behavior can have **months** of this consistent match history. You have to imagine they've been reported dozens of games by perhaps hundreds of players. And no action.","replies":[{"poster":"CursiveX","date":"2020-03-01T15:37:02.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I've had about 6-7 games today where people die twice and just leave the game.

Please don't say this erroneous line anymore. Simply can not blame others behavior for your rank climbing ability, unless the truth of it is that you're instigating the bad behavior.\n\nYou may have been unlucky, but in reality, if you don't do this, the fact that others do is actually A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE for you. 5/9 probability is the enemy is getting afk/troll/feeder and 4/9 your team does.\n\nNow regarding the rest...\n\nAFK punishments are roughly where there must be. They've gone back and forth on it; any harsher and legitimate players get pissed for unfair punishment, any more lenient and more afks will happen. \n\nThe idea of banning for AFK would outright result in fury: imagine having an unlucky string of a couple client drops followed by loss of service due to weather and then a power outage. Oops, buh bye $600 account, too bad so sad. Yeah: no. Not even slightly acceptable. \n\nWhen being dropped from the game for reasons outside players control approaches null, then we can talk about bans. Lots of people don't live in skyrises where service almost never drops, and even they do get dropped from games sometimes. I bet you have too.","replies":[{"poster":"Thats Down Right","date":"2020-03-01T22:04:57.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> WRONG. Please don't say this erroneous line anymore.
