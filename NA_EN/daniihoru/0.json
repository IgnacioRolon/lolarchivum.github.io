I uninstalled, then redownloaded and logged it and was about to get into a draft game when it crashed. I couldn't play, so I tried closing League and restarting my computer, and now I can't log in, it won't restore the patch to the latest version, AND it has a \"fixing itself\" icon in the corner but it's doing nothing. Anyone know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-14T23:47:44.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kinda sounds like the client might be scanning its files in preparation to repair or repatch, but it's hard to know without being able to see or with a better description. Could you shoot me a quick screenshot so I can see what's going on exactly, or you could try grabbing the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and running a quick Force Repatch.","replies":[{"poster":"daniihoru","date":"2018-01-15T02:48:14.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ran the tool a few times, but it hasn't done anything. The first time it uninstalled it said it wasn't compatible with my version of Windows, which doesn't make sense because it's worked for a few months without issue. It did bring up that some functions needed administrator permission, so it didn't reinstall. I'd send a screenshot but I don't know how, so if you could tell me that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T04:00:51.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh that one message you mentioned\n\n\" It did bring up that some functions needed administrator permission\"\n\nreally tells me this is a kind of permissions error actually. Give the steps in this [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) a try and then try running that repatch for me. \n\nIf that still doesn't help, don't worry too much about the screenshot since this seems to be heading in a different direction than I first thought. You can go ahead and hit up the techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your game logs. If permissions isn't the issue those techs will need to dive a bit deeper into those logs to figure this out.","replies":[{"poster":"daniihoru","date":"2018-01-15T06:23:18.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realized I wasn't on my admin account lol, that might have been the problem.

It reinstalled but it's the same issue: \"There was a problem during installation\" and then \"We're patching it up to the latest version.\" However, neither happens and I still can't login even though I'm online.
