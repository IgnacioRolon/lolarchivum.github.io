Judging by the other comment on this post he did not even mean to ban your champion it was a complete accident and he did not expect you to want to play shaco. Even if it was an intentional ban to stop you from playing shaco adc that does not give you the right to troll an entire game. The fact that through your comments you show no remorse for your actions and worse are trying to justify them by claiming two wrongs make a right, getting even matters, and my favorite statement that people on the internet don't matter and you are not trying to make friends shows that you have some kind of deeper rooted issues as an adult or you are a child that can not handle something so minuscule maturely.
