Now I&#039;m not saying i was justified or not toxic but I have been playing this game for 2.5-3 years and i have not ever been banned nor have I ever received LPQ. But after this game one player who was being what I perceived to be just as toxic reported me and I did not bother to report him. 5 minutes later I am banned for 14 days. This is my first instance of being toxic and now you are telling me the next instance could be a perma ban. I fee like this is extremely harsh especially 90% of what i said that game was in response top the other player being toxic as well.\r\nMy coms that game were as follows:\r\nGame 1\r\nHavocCraze: kys\r\nHavocCraze: you didnt auto him when i went in\r\nHavocCraze: no u didnt\r\nHavocCraze: he didnt have a ring around him\r\nHavocCraze: stun?\r\nHavocCraze: 4 mid btw\r\nHavocCraze: 5\r\nHavocCraze: no&#039;\r\nHavocCraze: no\r\nHavocCraze: no\r\nHavocCraze: no\r\nHavocCraze: bronze/silver vall\r\nHavocCraze: they dont have long death timers\r\nHavocCraze: stfu\r\nHavocCraze: u are so bad at macro\r\nHavocCraze: brand\r\nHavocCraze: wp\r\nHavocCraze: wp\r\nHavocCraze: i go oom too fast\r\nHavocCraze: kys\r\nHavocCraze: you r silver\r\nHavocCraze: finish baron next time\r\nHavocCraze: i have ga\r\nHavocCraze: idiot brand\r\nHavocCraze: pinging me\r\nHavocCraze: dont ping me you bronze player\r\nHavocCraze: wait he actually is bronze\r\nHavocCraze: wtf\r\nHavocCraze: im plat kys\r\n\r\nThis game as I look back on what i said has what i believe to be 4 lines of toxic behavior and I apologize and I understand kys is a very harsh this to say. However, the player I was talking to was spam pinging me throughout  the entire game, asking for the other player to buy him a skin, attempting to steal my jungle camps, and picking me out saying things such as &quot;bad jg&quot; &quot;usless Kha&quot;. I understand reactions like this are not justified and I should have just muted the player and finished the game honorably. But a 14 day ban after a history of being an honorable player and being one for the first players that I saw to receive honor lvl 3 even among streamers made me feel like this ban unfair. On my personal bias I would say I should not have been banned at all, but reflecting on my communicaiton this game I would understand a 1-2 day ban or a chat restriction for 10-20 games. However, for my first offence, no history of being dishonorable, and only 4 lines of toxicity a 14 day ban seems unjustified.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-01-25T16:17:01.234+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

Whether or not you agree with it, things like KYS, %%%, and any type of racial, ethnic, or sexual preference slurs are ALWAYS a 14 day ban.  It should be pretty common knowledge by now.  That's not my rules, that's Riot's and you agreed to follow them when you clicked OK on that TOS to make your account.\n\nAs for banning the other player, I can't weigh in on that as I can only see your chat, not his.
