I can't really say right now because of the preseason changes and whatnot, although jungling is now an extremely impactful role with the new dragon buff being extremely snowball based.\n.\n3.

The single most important thing you can do is to see when you made a mistake and try to never repeat it. Some people will actively write down notes after every game or even after every death to try to drill home the areas they need to improve on, and some people will go into a game trying to focus on mastering a single thing that they know they've messed up before (like missing last hits under pressure, not noticing where the enemy jungler is likely to be by losing track of game time, etc).

If you keep a sense of humor about the game, your fellow man and life itself, it's a blast.\n\n- Never, never, never respond to an unkind word.  With any kind of response.  At all.  For any reason whatsoever.  That doesn't mean you can't communicate with the unkind people.  Just pretend they didn't say the unkind things.\n\n- You might feel frustrated, but don't hassle people who are playing very poorly.  That could (and will be) you in some other game, I guarantee it.  Help them, encourage them not to hate themselves over one match, and try your best to carry the game.\n\n- I personally think it's more important to be \"good at the game\" and well-rounded than it is to specialize in 1-2 roles and/or 1-2 champions, at least before (say) Gold.  But I bet a few expressed the opposite opinion in this same thread.  You can succeed either way, or somewhere in between.\n\n- Unlearn bad habits; everyone else picked up a lot of bad habits 1-29 and you almost certainly did too.  Learn good habits.  Watch videos.  Lots of people make good videos; gbay99 and Foxtrot make some nice videos which are applicable to the game in general.\n\n- Buy wards.  Place wards.  Even if you think it's someone else's job.

Remember this when you're annoyed that you're stuck in Bronze 3 and \"always lose because of bad teammates\".\n\n- Reach out to people when you need help, and help others when they reach out.\n\n- Play the game to have fun and to win, not to get to a certain rank.

Not every gold player can carry to gold, but most should be able to carry to mid-high silver. \n\nDont go ranked right at level 30. Pick 2 roles, and play tons of games at level 30 as them, with at least 2 champs per role (or do like i do and pick 1 champ who can go multiple roles and is rarely banned with 1 backup champ)\n\nIf you try and master all roles you will likely only be mediocre in all roles, and thus less likely to be able to carry to your rank. Remember even LCS teams specialize their players.\n\nIf you specialize in 1 role then you will be at a loss when you cant get it, which isnt actually common if you have good communication with your team in pre match lobby. A typical message i send at the begining of select would go something like this:\n\nMe) Mid pref, top second pref\nMe) I can support if i need to but im worse, and i cant adc or jungle\n\nIf someone else is above me in pick and wants the role i want ill say something like \n\nMe) Its your call, i will support if i have to but we have a much better chance of winning if i dont.\n\nCommunication is key. Most players are willing to compromise as everyone wants to improve their rank. You must also be willing to compromise. Also, mention some bans you like to see as captains will often take at least 1 request if they see them. \n\nEven so, having a backup role that youre still strong at means you have twice the chance of getting one youre good at. Even at last pick, its common for me to get mid or top.\n\n\nLastly, make sure youre at least adequate at support. Its the most common last pick role without communication, so its important you know how to do it decently enough in case you get stuck with it.

If you can hold your own in those games (and not rely too much on the skills of your friends), then you have a strong shot at reaching Silver+.  Ranked is a messy field with players of all kinds of attitudes and all kinds of skill level.  There will always be players who are in ranks that do not reflect their true skill (either better or worse), so getting paired with those kinds of players may make the game a lot easier (i.e., plat+ smurfs) or much harder (i.e., players who had their friends play their accounts to boost ELO).  While you cannot control who 3-4 of your teammates are, you could control how well you perform, and that will account for a lot of how well you do in ranked.  The other 3 important aspects are: (1) the individual skill of your teammates, (2) the teamwork you guys have, and (3) the lack of making bad plays or throws.\n\nI cannot tell you if there is a \"best way\" to play ranked.  Ideally, you should be able to play all 5 roles well.  However, starting off, I'd suggest you should learn to play 2-3 roles really well (i.e., better than people in the same ELO).  If you could have 2-3 roles you play really well, you will climb to your ELO height.  For example, my strengths are top and mid, but I'm also good at jungle and support, while ADC is the weakest of my 5 roles.\n\nNow, after knowing which roles you're good at and/or enjoy playing, it's good to pick up at least 1 hero in which to fit these roles and really know how to play that one hero.  Some people may prefer learning all champs, but since realistically some champs are definitely better than other champs in the current meta, I figured that being really good at a few champs is better than trying to be good at too many champs.  Don't over-extend yourself on champ choices.  Ideally, the 1-6 champs you learn and excel at are ones who bring strong utility and/or team synergy.  Examples are: Mao for top/jung, Janna for support, Warwick for top/jung, Annie for mid/support, Lucian/Corki/Jinx for bot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-11-24T22:15:02.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best advice is to start playing draft, but NOT to play ranked right away.

For example, Morgana and Karma. Learn their matchups, and the way they synergize with teammates.\n\nAs importantly, you want to learn how to keep a team working as a team.

At the same time be aware that this game is not 100% balanced and some champions are simply better than others. If you're going to stick with 1-2 champions make sure they arent trash/troll tier like Urgot Galio, Morde ect.\n\nThat id said i would concentrate on 2 roles and work on 2-3 champions per role to get good with. In addition have a back up role in case you the other 2 are taken.

Here are the major considerations you need to seriously ask yourself before you dive in.\n\n1. Do I have a large enough pool of champions. You must be able to play multiple champions in multiple roles competetly in order to seriously bring them into ranked. Competent doesn't mean X number of games with either, but a deeper understanding of all their abilities, and match ups,  and the mechanical skill to reliably pull off their combos. \n\n2. Rune pages and masteries. Do you have a dedicated set or two for every champion you plan to bring to ranked?  If not stick to normals and do research until you have the IP/RP to put them together.  You will be at a distinct disadvantage if you don't and a liability to your teammates. In competitive play every edge matters, and while deviating from pro meta suggestions is fine to a point...there are set ups that are better than others. Make sure you bring one that is reasonable to the table. \n\n3. Identify your goal. If your goal is to play casualy and have fun, ranked may not be the best place to enjoy the game. It is filled with players of all walks, but by and large they value winning above all else, and that leads to some very toxic behaviors. It also leads to very high degrees of intolerance for anything outside the current meta as they see it. Lots of words will be thrown your way and sadly few of them will be nice unless you are carring your team...sometimes not even then. If your not into that or ready to ignore it to a point then I caution you as its way less high stakes in normals, and even they can get chippy at times.\n\nIs your goal however is to climb the ladder due to that competitive nature in you? Then set yourself up for success. No one passes the test without putting in the study. Spend time outside of the game learning as much as you can. Try and get film of yourself so you can see your mistakes and learn from them. Nothing opened my eyes more than watching a friends commentary on my play one day. It's like hitting the film room in any sport...super important to improvement. Dedicate time for practice and time for experimentation outside of ranked,  then time for actually buckling down and climbing. Remember to mix it up. Every session of play should have time to process and practice what you learned before you tackle it again. Treat it like a sport and put as much effort into practice and preparing as playing ranked and you will see more success than mindlessly bashing your head against the same problems every game.\n\nGood luck, see you in the fields.\n\nM4nTiCoR3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2014-11-25T03:01:27.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best advice...

Don't play ranked\n2. If you want to play ranked, play normal draft. A lot. Hundreds of games.\n3. If you want to practice a particular role, play team builder. The waits can be long sometimes but it's better than getting into e-pene fights in a normals lobby.\n4. Make sure you can play all roles. That doesn't mean you have wreck at all roles. That just means you must be familiar enough with a role so as to not suck. Being a liability in ranked is a sure way to earn the rage of your teammates.\n5. Keep your focus on objectives. Chasing kills (especially in unwarded jungles) doesn't win games and is a sure way to stay in bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acidic Puddle","date":"2014-11-24T16:59:41.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Expect nothing....","replies":[]},{"poster":"FarRockBF","date":"2014-11-24T19:12:02.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silvonius","date":"2014-11-24T06:07:28.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As others have said, DO NOT start playing ranked yet. I suggest having at least 500 normal wins before you start ranked. That may seem extreme, but i started ranked right at 30 and it took me 900 ranked games to get out of bronze. Now, you may be better than i was, idk, but if i could go back I'd rather have done another few hundred more normals and placed comfortably in mid-silver rather than being stuck in bronze.","replies":[]}]}
