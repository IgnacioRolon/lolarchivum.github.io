This is something new Riot introduced. It wasn't in the previous seasons. Positional matchmaking tries to pair you against an opponent of similar skill, but your team skill/rank can vary a lot with this system, and you get people not in your rank range that you are forced to play against due to them wanting to keep queue times lower. This new system promotes people to play more games to try to balance out the coinflip games. However, matchmaking is so bad, that it may take up to 15/20 games sometimes to get the 13 wins instead of the 13 losses. In the end, you are back to where you started, or lower, and you didn't make much progress on your ranked climb because of the system. In the end, more time is wasted climbing than previous seasons.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeleteSuppRole","date":"2019-04-06T13:29:31.052+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":12,"body":"Have you thought that maybe .... maybe it's you ?","replies":[{"poster":"YBaKunt","date":"2019-04-06T13:43:34.201+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":10,"body":"Yes, I'm getting S rank every game with 4 inters who afk farm the lane the whole game.

Top laner continued griefing and ended up with 13 deaths. Bot laners were so underfed that they couldn't do anything. The enemy team just grouped up and took objectives at will, and ended the game.\n\nLoss 2: Top laner died twice in the first 5 minutes and then left the game, didn't come back until 1 minute before the game ended. Enemy Diana smurf (60% win rate) mid laner popped off. The enemy team kept ambushing me to the point where I couldn't even farm my own jungle.\n\nLoss 3: Enemy mid laner has a 68% win rate IN PLAT. https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=ICantWaitToLose This is obviously a master or higher smurf, and please watch the replay if you don't believe me.
