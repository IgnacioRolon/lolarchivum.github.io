Its not something that is reportable but it is annoying. If you're in game like this, just try to practice your farm/last hitting. Bots don't really behave like players do in pvp, so killing them doesn't teach much, but you can get pretty good at farming by practicing with bots.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2016-10-24T02:13:27.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2016-10-24T01:14:01.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-24T01:15:57.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nope. \n\nKill secured, stop being salty.\n[River Shen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udBa7LCcNGQ)","replies":[{"poster":"edgy xayah main1","date":"2016-10-24T01:19:37.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KAhuMN66,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-24T01:15:57.588+0000)\n>\n> Nope. \n> \n> Kill secured, stop being salty.\n> [River Shen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udBa7LCcNGQ)\n\nI wasn't the only one salty ._.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2016-10-24T01:25:53.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Stop being butthurt","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-10-24T03:02:24.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, while a few times is okay, if a player is just going around denying everyone all their kills, that's incredibly irritating, even if it's a bot game.

Not very sporting.    I will sometimes bot game to get a first win of the day if I just don't have much time to play.  But I'll usually play genuine support rather than kill steal unless I just totally have to.    Really though the best thing you can do in a bot game is practice farming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hryna","date":"2016-10-24T05:52:55.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's annoying but it's not against the rules and it shouldn't be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2016-10-24T08:49:56.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Annoying as fuck but ks'ing is seen as a tactical disagreement and therefore allowed.
