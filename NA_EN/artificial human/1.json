Gonna use this as an opportunity to quote an old post of mine from last year. I made it on the \"Making of the Madman\" blog post and it didn't get much attention. It talks about how (at the time, it seems you guys may have changed this stance) there were no plans to update Mundo due to his popularity. I thought this was a bad idea and wanted to outline some of the things that in my opinion work really well about his character, and those that don't.\n\nSorry it's so long, just some food for thought if you see this!\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ColdStone Memery,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=riK28gK6,comment-id=003e,timestamp=2015-11-11T00:38:07.801+0000)\n>\n> While I appreciate that you guys want to hold on to the aspects on Mundo that make him so fun and likable, I think it&#x27;s really a mistake to not plan on changing him up in the near future of league. You can keep his campy personality and so forth, but you have to admit that his model is pretty atrocious by today&#x27;s standards. \n> \n> Look at all the amazing concepts you guys have come out with lately - you could definitely do justice to the crazy mad scientist/hulk trope better than what Mundo is today. Something that&#x27;s been lost to a lot of people who complain about League getting &quot;edgier&quot; is that you can be polished AND fun. Jinx isn&#x27;t super serious, neither is Ekko. Hell, look at Tahm! Mundo could be a comical character who is actually that - a character, not simply a big joke. We laugh AT Mundo, when we should be laughing with him. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being silly and fun, but he shouldn&#x27;t be a walking joke. That&#x27;s why Sion and Gangplank were changed visually and thematically (I understand the issues people have with Gangplank being much too dark/serious now compared to before, but at least he feels like a character rather than a stereotype. I personally prefer the Captain GP skin&#x27;s voiceover as I feel it retains a lot of dark humor from his character compared to the vengeance-focused base GP).\n> \n> In the same vein, his kit -needs- work. I love what you&#x27;ve done with his E recently, it feels awesome and opens up a lot of new playstyles and item builds. But his kit as a whole isn&#x27;t cohesive, and cohesivity has been one of League&#x27;s most important character themes for over two years now. Look at how thematic Yasuo or Rek&#x27;sai&#x27;s kit is. Or if you want less &quot;OP overloaded etc&quot; kits, even something as simple as reworked Caitlyn - something as basic as making her headshots interact with traps and nets, as well as making her Q thin to start with, make her feel so much more like a sharpshooter than before. \n> \n> Does Mundo feel like a hulked-out madman? His ult certainly does, and his Q, though a bit out there design-wise as you guys mentioned, fits very well. His E even feels better now, giving him a kind of &quot;hulk smash&quot; feeling when it activates. W and passive though? His passive is so boring. We have passives like Kindred marking, Darius bleed and Noxian Might, Soraka&#x27;s reworked &quot;ambulance&quot;. These things add GAMEPLAY. Just like Heimer&#x27;s sorry passive, Mundo&#x27;s passive is simply a stat boost, and an unexciting one at that. It _works_ don&#x27;t get me wrong, but is it fun? Does it ever really feel good? If you escape with a few health you won&#x27;t be thinking &quot;Thanks .3% hpregen!&quot; It just doesn&#x27;t feel good. \n> \n> His W fills an important niche for a tank, the &quot;I need to do damage while sticking on a target and being threatening&quot; one, but it&#x27;s just not satisfying either. Like you mentioned, the particle being weird has a lot to do with that. Imagine if Mundo had a kind of Thornmail-esque passive where all damage he takes (not just autos) is reflected back partially on opponents in melee range of him from his acidic, chemically-altered blood. That would feel good and fit well for the character&#x27;s theme, even open up gameplay paths like not focusing the good Dr. down when he&#x27;s in melee range of your squishy, making you want to kite him back first in order to not damage whoever he&#x27;s near. Just a spitballed idea for something that fills the same kind of niche as his W, but makes a lot more sense than fireballs that do damage around his body because Mundo.\n> \n> I really hope no one takes this the wrong way. I don&#x27;t want to change who Mundo is. I enjoy a good Mundo game as much as anymore, I love going where I please and being a general pain to the enemy. I love cleaver sniping and landing a permaslow on a level 1 invade. But he could be so much **more**. He could be a Dr. Hyde style madman, hulked out of control and **out of his mind**. He could still be funny, comical and carefree. He could still go where he pleases and walk all over enemy champions but he could feel more interesting and cohesive whilst doing so. Just food for thought, and I hope a Red sees this and can it into consideration. I can&#x27;t be the only person who would trade a bit of nostalgia and silliness for a more interesting character, especially when I don&#x27;t think interesting and silly are necessarily mutually exclusive.
