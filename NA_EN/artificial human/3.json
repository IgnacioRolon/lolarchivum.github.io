Given the Boards is a lot of visual work and front-end stuff, we naturally can segue into working on the new client. \n\nThat doesn't mean we don't work on bugfixes or major issues.

Our team *builds* the Boards, we don't *manage* them.  We do things like build the responsive mobile experience and fix software bugs.  It's two totally diff things. One is engineer-centric, the other is community-centric.\n\nMy team had 0 to do with the reorg... that's Adillonmostdirty and Keyru and co's team :)","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2016-01-20T19:20:12.856+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe to make it clearer for the non techies: It's like the difference between building a house and furnishing the rooms. \n\nRight now they can't add a garage, but they can change the guest room into a baby room for example.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Baconhawk","date":"2016-01-20T19:24:19.127+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Duke Anax,realm=EUW,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=2qUFp00F,comment-id=000000010000000100000000,timestamp=2016-01-20T19:20:12.856+0000)\n>\n> Maybe to make it clearer for the non techies: It's like the difference between building a house and furnishing the rooms. \n> \n> Right now they can't add a garage, but they can change the guest room into a baby room for example.\n\nFabulous.
