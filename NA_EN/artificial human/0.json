While Star Guardian Lux was (hopefully) worth the wait, it still sucked being told 'new skin soon' and waiting ~two years for another skin.\n> \n> While I can't give you an ETA, I'd be curious to hear if you had any legendary skin ideas in mind, or at least a champion who could benefit from one.\n\nThis may be too soon, but I think Gangplank could greatly benefit from a Legendary skin.  Maybe a robo Gangplank kinda like PROJECT: Yasuo, or a cyborg appearance like Kano from Mortal Kombat.\n\nI also think Zed finally needs a new skin.  Maybe perhaps an Arcade one?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-14T20:31:04.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With his update, I think that's a pretty cool route to take him. \n\nWhat kind of references would you use for Arcade Zed/Mini Boss-esque Zed?","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2015-08-14T21:12:12.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=5mkjVeF5,comment-id=0000000e0000,timestamp=2015-08-14T20:31:04.323+0000)\n>\n> With his update, I think that's a pretty cool route to take him. \n> \n> What kind of references would you use for Arcade Zed/Mini Boss-esque Zed?\n\nHow about we take \"Arcade Zed\" a bit farther and turn it into \"Raver Zed\"?\n\nQ = Shurikens are now glowsticks. Every time you use Q, Zed throws a pair different colored glowsticks, colors chosen randomly.\n\nW = Zed makes a clone of himself that slowly glows different dark colors.\n\nE = Zed creates a burst of dark rave lights around him. The colors of the lights change every time you use the ability, chosen randomly.\n\nR = Rave lights surround Zed and the target he's ulting. Once he lands, a disco ball appears above the target and party punk music starts playing originating from the target. The disco ball emits dark rave lights as it rotates above the target. After three seconds the disco ball explodes in a flash of dark lights.\n\nRecall = Zed makes the same gestures but instead of little emblems appearing around him, glowsticks appear instead, each one a random color.\n\nNo more helmet, face is exposed. Eyes are still glowing red. Wearing typical raver/punk outfit. Face is partially tattooed, right arm is fully tattooed. Wearing a red jacket with no undershirt, exposing chest. Skinny black jeans with pocket chain.\n\nI think that suits Arcade's idea of having a bunch of fun colors, without going into 2D effects, trading them instead for glowing effects and cool music.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-08-14T20:59:38.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=5mkjVeF5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-13T17:05:16.187+0000)\n> \n> While I can't give you an ETA, I'd be curious to hear if you had any legendary skin ideas in mind, or at least a champion who could benefit from one.\n\nWhich champion could benefit the most from a skin that changes the model, particles, voice and everything associated with it?  Yorick and Urgot.\n\n... Alright, since a new Yorick skin isn't going to come out for a couple of years (minimum 2017), the best candidates would be Sion and Kassadin.  They're the champions not on the \"no skins list\" that have waited the longest for new ones.\n\n* For Sion, I wouldn't mind seeing something akin to Dunkmaster Darius, only involving a better sport:  American Football.  \"Football Captain Sion\" with a giant Noxus uniform and helmet and a goalpost for an axe.  When he casts his ultimate, he spikes a football.  His E kicks a minion into the others with great flourish... and so on.\n* Kassadin could be more of a stage magician with his rift walks.  Instead of that purple void he leaves behind, it could be a smoke cloud.  A flock of birds flies out from his E.  His Q could be some magician's apparatus.  Hell, this skin could be what \"Magnificent Twisted Fate\" SHOULD have been after his rework.\n\nJust my 2¬¢, though.  I expect my change soon‚Ñ¢.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-08-14T20:41:04.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Ao Shen Gate incident really left a scar in Riot.","replies":[]}]}]}
