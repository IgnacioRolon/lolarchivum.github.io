First of all, as a french i'll have to ask you to forgive my poor english. \r\nI would like to know if its normal that when using abilities such as yi's Q, xin's E on baron nashor you can end up having a weird animation of the character floating for a small lapse of time.\r\nDuring that animation you can't attack, and therefore in some situation it could be better (yet counter-intuitive imho) not to use these abilities on nash to optimize DPS.\r\n\r\nI hope this post can help.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-02-11T10:54:18.977+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Hi !

This is really annoying since you can't move or attack during this and Baron is free to engage you. I get not being able to walk through him with things such as Fizz's passive or Phantom Dancer, but it's very counter intuitive with Yi. Shouldn't Yi land outside of the \"Wall of Nashor\" when his Q finishes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teslalyte","date":"2015-02-11T08:41:13.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But... that patch hasn't dropped yet...? o_O","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2015-02-11T10:53:22.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has in Europe.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-02-13T19:51:32.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
