Swain is practically useless without some bonus spell vamp and vlad is just a sad vlad without it. AD champions are rewarded by building lifesteal with their primary stats being attached to it be it ad or attack speed. Either give all mages innate spell vamp or give us an item that can help us sustain in lane like any ad champ has access to.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-13T02:08:45.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ravenous hunter","replies":[{"poster":"Valenten","date":"2017-11-13T02:14:00.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ONE thing just like the old masteries.

It made trading back with burst (their intended weakness) a difficult option.\n\nThis is not my opinion, it’s a paraphrasing of riot’s 2016 MYMU when spellvamp was removed from items","replies":[]}]}
