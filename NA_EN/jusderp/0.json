The instructions were told to reinstall league, which I followed the instructions on the the league support site. After doing that, I waited patiently for the launcher to load and at 99%, a message popped up and said the following message ;  \"[Update Failed] Unspecified Error Occured. Please Check The Logs For More Information\" or click retry. I clicked retry, but it started me back at 0%, giving me the same message shortly afterwards. I looked this up on how to fix and it led me to the ,\"Comprehensive Troubleshooting Your Patching Issues\" site. I followed every single solution possible to solve this problem, yet no luck. If anyone can suggest any sort of help that I may have skipped over or an alternate way someone has found out how to solve this problem, please tell me. \n\nAlso, I am playing on a laptop not meant for gaming, and it is pretty old. I don't know if my laptop is to old or has some problem or if it is just my game that has a problem.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-05T17:14:59.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Failure during patching at the last 66% of the process is usually caused by network connection drops to the patching servers.
