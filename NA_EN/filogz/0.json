That makes you can use more spells, poke your enemy in more consistant way etc. \r\n\r\nBut there is one problem... Energy based champions!\r\n\r\nThey have base resource regeneration from Summoner&#039;s Rift and that makes them really** &quot;energy hungry&quot;** because as we all know we want to use as many spells as it is possible on ARAM before we die to **poke** {{champion:101}} .\r\nPlaying champion like Zed, Lee Sin and even Akali is really painful. You can use one rotation of your combo (**W+E+Q** {{champion:238}} ), (**Q+E+W** to minon/teammate {{champion:64}} ) and then you are turned off due to your Energy bar + Cooldowns. \r\nOther champions only have pay attention to their Cooldowns which most of the time are really low. Moreover even when you somehow ran out of energy you can pick {{summoner:13}}  to instantly restore your mana bar. \r\nEnergy Champs can do nothing more than hit their spells into enemy otherwise when they miss, they are punished really hard. \r\n\r\nAdditionally as mana champion you  can almost always pick **Presence of Mind** rune which makes your resource bar almost always above 50%. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s why in my opinion Riot should increase Energy Regeneration on ARAM to similar regen with blue buff?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-13T11:57:38.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being forced to buy mana items is a weakness, not a strength. Increasing energy regeneration would be substantively different from increasing mana regeneration. When a mana-based champion runs out of mana, they can't just wait ten seconds for it to fill back up to 100%; they become useless for a few minutes.","replies":[]}]}
