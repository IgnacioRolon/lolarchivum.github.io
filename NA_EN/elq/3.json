The Miss Fortune icon has eluded me until the icons where no longer available.  I must be frank, I want to trade all of my mini icons with the exception of the Morgana one for the MF mini icon. That trade would be the mini icons for Ezreal, Wukong, Twisted Fate, Taric, and Lux for the Miss Fortune mini icon. Please assist me!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T04:15:09.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since those mystery mini icons were random, I'm pretty sure we won't be able to make any sort of 'trade' since the purchases worked just fine.
