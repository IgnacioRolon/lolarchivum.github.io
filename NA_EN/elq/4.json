Most of the time, this is a result of an unstable connection to the server, so I recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Elq","date":"2016-09-19T20:26:51.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did not add this before because I thought that it was of little consequence but I was queued up with a friend in the game using the  same internet connection.

I was seeing the first few bans fine, i could hover my champ. On my duo's computer, I saw the next player submit their ban. But mine hovered with him at 0 for about 2 minutes. In that time, both of our connections 'timed out' despite nothing being wrong with our internet (I was running WinMTR at the time). Then the next I saw, it was my turn to pick, at 0 seconds, so we got \"dodged\" and I lost LP. Let me know what else I can provide in terms of repro.","replies":[]}]}
