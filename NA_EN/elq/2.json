Later that game the game crashed and I got a bugsplat. Now why do I have a leaver for trying to play the game? So in the end I guess I only restarted my computer twice but still if there's any feed back out there please send it my way... I'm not so much angry as annoyed so there, have a nice day...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-25T20:53:23.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be having a combinations of issues here and that really sucks.  :/  Bugsplats usually happen when a hardware, driver, or asset problem fails to render the game.  You'll want to run through the steps in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to help troubleshoot this.\n\nWhat I'm a bit unsure about, though, is your computer restarting.  Without too much context on that, I recommend double checking your air vents to make sure nothing is causing it to overheat.  Stick to custom games for now to troubleshoot, and hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if your pc is still needing to restart.","replies":[{"poster":"Elq","date":"2017-08-25T21:09:00.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used the reset button on the side of my computer to fix the only could ping problem cause after I closed the window I could still hear the sounds and the league client did not recognize that it was closed.
