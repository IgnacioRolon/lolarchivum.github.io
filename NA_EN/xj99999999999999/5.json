Currently, you can use them to unlock a honor twitch skin + champ or grey warwick + champ. There is also a border for each champion. So 4 tokens for all 4 things (1 each).","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2020-01-08T20:50:54.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still not sure what 2 tokens you are talking about.
