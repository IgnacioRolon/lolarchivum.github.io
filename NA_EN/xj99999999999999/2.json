You had 4 dragons worth of time to make a comeback. The dragons are weaker early, until the dragon soul in which the team gets an uber buff. It takes a lot of investment to get 4 dragon kills cleanly and it meant to be a method to close out games reliably instead of teams with 5+ dragons losing the game due to owning the game up until 1 teamfight. It's nice not feeling rushed to end the game and instead have an option to go for late game where your goal is to keep up the objectives and do a big push with the dragon soul and finish it up with an elder.\r\n\r\nI was originally going to make this about the preseason in general, but I'll keep it simple. I just love everything about this preseason and I am shocked that when riot is attempting to actually slow the pace of the game down, make room for late game strategies and less sustain/poke damage so that champions that specialize it can shine instead of being forgotten is shocking.","replies":[{"poster":"Greenlightx","date":"2019-11-22T23:14:23.899+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"elder dragon is too much and a kiss of death, i have contributed to TF with 5~10% hp, the execute mechanic makes it impossible to do that. all the other changes i like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashe mage AD","date":"2019-11-22T23:10:12.730+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's about the spirits and the fkin executes.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-11-22T23:16:48.610+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ashe mage AD,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hxp03PLV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-11-22T23:10:12.730+0000)\n>\n> It's about the spirits and the fkin executes.\n\nSo it's about people refusing to contest objectives and crying because their great plan of giving up dragons didn't work as well as they hoped","replies":[{"poster":"Ashe mage AD","date":"2019-11-22T23:19:30.129+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-11-22T23:22:14.460+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ashe mage AD,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hxp03PLV,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-11-22T23:19:30.129+0000)\n>\n> You're being intentionally ignorant lol.

And then they nerfed baron, because heaven forbid a team trade baron for elder and actually accomplish something. \n\nAlso, what's the point of having 3 separate win conditions if one team is going to monopolize them? If the game gets drawn out to that point despite the other team having such a massive deficit, they should have the chance at a come-back because its the winning team that's playing poorly at that point. Instead, the team with a lead maintains a lead, with almost no exception.\n\n>IMO, if they REALLY want to keep souls, once a team gets a dragon soul, and the other team gets 4 drakes in total after, they should also get one for whatever their latest non-elder drake is. If they took 4 elders somehow, they receive the same soul the opposing team has. The closer a game is late game, the more interesting the game becomes. \n\nForcing the jungler to camp bot all game because dragon soul is basically an instant GG either way isn't good design.

I haven't had an Elder spawn in the entire patch yet luckily but that does seem a little dumb.

Everyone just plays aggro champions who can roam fast to secure dragon, it's kinda boring and frustrating if you like other characters. Some of the souls are way too good while others are meh. Mountain is meh, Cloud is meh (used to be a lesser rune lmao), but Infernal allowing a free electrocute proc several times a fight is too much and Ocean is resident busted. Ocean soul is a massive mistake and completely out of line imo.\n\nI'm just glad they nerfed Sanguine Blade once already, although I do think it should just be deleted outright. The lethality items need to just be reverted, Umbral Glaive could be seen as decent until people realize you can use Duskblade to notice when you lose the buff and just activate Oracle when you know there's a ward.
