This is different from live in that Lux must kill her target with her ult to get the cool down reduction.\n\n\n\n**WHY THIS BUFF DOESN&quot;T WORK:**\n\nThere are two possibilities where this buff will influence Lux.\n_1. In teamfights.\n2. With Picks._\n\nTeamfights are diverse and always different, but most of them usually last between 10-20 seconds on average I would say.  Even if Lux was to get a kill at the beginning of a teamfight AND was level 16 with 40% CDR, then she MIGHT have the opportunity to use a second ult during that fight, or try to snipe somebody running away.  In every other circumstance (Early and mid game), the fight will end, and Lux will awkwardly have her ult up in 10-20 seconds with nowhere to use it. \n\nPicks occur in two ways with Lux\n1. _With you team: _If you are with your team and pick an enemy, then this buff will be beneficial, as you are not always the one getting the kill with your ult, and it is possible that a teamfight may break out 30 seconds later in time for your ult to be back up due to this buff.\n2. _By yourself:  _When you get a pick with Lux by yourself, you ALWAYS throw your q, e, and r and blow the target up, usually with your ult getting the kill.  So, in this case, the buff does nothing as you are already getting the CDR reduction that is on the live servers already.\n\nSo, this buff seems good on the outside, but in reality it is RARELY every going to provide an opportunity to show itself in game.\n\n\n\n\n**WHAT ARE HER PROBLEMS:**\n\nThe main champions I see at higher elo in mid lane are Ryze, Azir, Vlad, Taliyah, Zoe, Twisted Fate.  One thing that all of these champions have in common, maybe besides Zoe, is that they can all push in a wave relatively easily using only 1-2 of their abilities once they hit around level 5.  Lux, on the other hand, has one of the weakest wave clears...for example:\n**1.** Lux throws e out, hits all minions.\n**2. **Lux has to auto attack all 3 casters to kill them.\n**3**. Lux has to throw another e out, or use q on two melee minions.\n**4.** Lux auto attacks 2-3 more times to clear the wave.\nThis is a typical wave clear on Lux, and unless you are extremely fed, there is not much variation in this.  Her E does not do enough damage to kill casters in one hit, even with Minion Dematerializer (7% extra damage), and this makes her extremely susceptible to being pushed in.  While pushed in, she is constantly behind in following up with roams and has very little pressure overall.  In my opinion, this is one of the major reasons why she is actually considered the worst mid laner of op.gg right now.  She spends so much time trying to farm, she is consistently late to skirmishes and the enemy mid lane gets ahead.\n\nIn addition to this, her e mana cost is extremely high for an ability that does so little damage to minions and is relatively weak early on.  Her q missile speed is one of the lowest in the game, and is EXTREMELY difficult to land during the laning phase, and i mostly use it for farming because of that reason (It is fine in teamfights, it's just fairly bad in lane).  All of these things and more are what lead her to be in an extremely weak state right now up in higher elos, and why you have not seen her in an LCS game in quite some time.\n\n\n**HOW TO FIX HER:  **\n\nMy potential fixes are as follow:\n**1. **Increase q missile speed so that it is easier to land in lane, and in teamfights (Maybe make damage scale based on distance traveled to compensate for teamfights).\n**2.** Reduce e mana cost, and increase its damage against minions. (I think Lux does enough damage when ahead, that a straight buff to her e to champions might be too much)  In any case though, Lux somehow needs to do more damage to minions overall early game.\n\n\nThanks for reading this if you made it this far and let me know if you agree.  I have much more I could have written but I&#039;ll spare all of you the details :P\n\n**TLDR: **Lux is too weak in lane, Lux does too little damage to minions, Lux gets pushed in too easily, Riot&#039;s buffs to Lux will not fix her abysmal winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-29T01:48:48.503+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're right that these changes aren't likely to fix Lux.

Presently, once her opponent is post-6 (and sometimes even before then), Lux tends to not be able to auto-attack them without being killed, even if she snares them first.\n\n- Allow Lux's E to use a charge-up mechanic similar to Gragas' Barrel Roll. This would prevent her poke from being obnoxious, but gives her a way to get better at waveclear or deal more damage through combos.\n\n- Increase Lux's movement speed by 5.

Like keeping the same damage values and make it do like 50% more damage to minions is obviously broken. Gutting the base damage and making it do like 50% more damage to minions is obviously bad. Making it do like 5% more damage is flat out pointless from a balance perspective since it's negligible even if it is a large change to lux's power level.

In D1 if you do what you say the enemy just pushes you in because you got nothing left to clear wave, also lux Q in that elo never lands unless you stand in a control ward and wait them to be in semi melee range, or unless the enemy is ccd already.\nThe problem is Lux is too noob-friendly and thus can't be made viable for actual elos where the enemy uses brain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ionian Vulpix","date":"2018-03-29T02:46:30.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to increase her waveclear without making her poke too overbearing, make her E deal more damage if it's not detonated instantly, much like Gragas's Q.
