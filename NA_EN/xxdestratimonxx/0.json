This started during a ranked-game which I am currently on a promo serie and only needed one more win to move from Silver I to Gold 5. During the ban pick/champ select phase, he made a remark in chat which starts something like this: \"My name neck yourself. If you say this four times during the game then I will promise to leave your lane and not feed.\"\nNow, I didn't want to dodge the game due to the fact that it'll count as a loss in a promo serie, so I thought I'll just play along to ensure that he doesn't demoralize the group dynamic. Below is the chat log from my in-client behavior reform card:\nGame 1\nxxdestratimonxx: neck yourself neck yourself neck yourself neck yourself\nxxdestratimonxx: can you leash for me?\nxxdestratimonxx: ty\nxxdestratimonxx: &lt;3\nxxdestratimonxx: gj\nxxdestratimonxx: fffff\nxxdestratimonxx: care\nxxdestratimonxx: 3 mid\nxxdestratimonxx: yeah\nxxdestratimonxx: grou pup\n\nSo unfortunately it didn't show the complete conversation, but at the beginning of the game, the Thresh player was peer pressuring everyone by insisting people to follow his instruction while sitting at mid lane ready to ruin the game experience for everyone. Now, I don't know if there was a algorithm that picks up certain words then you automatically gets a suspansion or the thresh player sent a report and I got banned from that. But the fact is he was framing this from the beginning because right after I said \"neck yourself\", Our top laner who played fiora, explained to me that I just fell into thresh's trap and I probably will receive penalty for it. Unsurprisingly, I got the suspension right after the game ended. Again, I'm not a type of person who likes to verbal abuse other players. I just don't want one player's selfish idea to ruin other people's gaming experience, expecially in a rank game when every game count. And unfortunately I was the victim in this case.\n\nI wish Riot support group could investigate this, maybe go through the chat from the champion selection to in game chat. Because there are other people who are encountering the same thing from this thresh player and this need to be stopped.\nI felt like I'm innocent yet helpless in this whole situation. It would be great if my suspension could be lifted, but I also know that the company have policy guidline to follow so I don't expect myself to get a pass. I would appreciate the help or response by the staff. Thanks.\n\n_Update: I've never gotten warning nor chat restriction prior to the suspension. So the phrase probably got picked up by the system and deem as extreme hate speech/threats. _\n\n_Update 2: I would like to thank everyone who came and contributed to this discussion. I would never imagine these many support/comment from the community. I would also like to give special thanks to the Rioter for lifting my ban as well as continuing with the investigation. It's an awesome feeling to know there are people who stand for the integrity of this game and making sure this type of behavior do not happen again._","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-09-12T04:39:34.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking this thread as it is extremely old.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).","replies":[]},{"poster":"lazerate","date":"2017-10-20T01:41:59.332+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same shit happened to me.

How come I have to shut up and take it every time i get a troll/am held hostage/flamed etc. and if i say anything i get banned but this player gets a free pass for an apparent escalation ban? Does this mean riot will finally take context into account? Or is this just a case of a lucky player getting upvoted and actually get a real investigation into his case?

You can utilize the /mute and /ignore functions in game to avoid viewing further negativity. You can also make use of the Smart Ping feature for communication with the rest of your team.\n\n- You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n\nEither the rules apply to everyone or they don't. If Riot picks and chooses what rules to follow then it erodes player confidence and diminishes Riot's credibility.  \n\nSo, if this is not considered to be baiting or lashing out then...what is it? Being held hostage?  If so, I assure you there are plenty of players out there who got punishments( that were never overturned) because they said something to their hostage taker.","replies":[{"poster":"No flash no life","date":"2017-10-20T04:02:11.140+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=themachamp,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=OeZ3ipZB,comment-id=000700000000000000010000000300000001,timestamp=2017-10-20T02:52:14.383+0000)\n>\n> -Remember that you are fully responsible for all activity on your account, and if suspensions or bans are incurred, we will not be able to modify them.\n\nActually if it's proven to be a mistake then the ban can be lifted. \n\n> - You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.\n> \n> Either the rules apply to everyone or they don&#x27;t.

Here is the big issue for me:\n\n1st off, it is good that this form of trolling is finally being addressed....props. The issue i have is that riot selectively took context into account when they have clearly stated that it doesn't matter and you are 100% responsible for what you do and say.  Look at it like this...player A get deaths threats from a pre-made and says some things back to them then gets banned. He writes in to riot support and basically gets an \"fu banned deserved\" and is told context and what other people say don't matter, the only thing that matters is what he said.  Now player B is trolled by having some guy to threatening to run it down mid less they say hate speech. He reaches out and is told..\"hey man we took everything into account and even though you used hate speech we will un ban you and erase it from your account.\" \n\nNow player A really feels like crap because riot basically said that saying \"fuck you\" to someone threatening to come kill you is not excusable... but saying hate speech is, if someone threatens to run it down mid if you don't say it.  Riot literally just justified saying something to/for a troll threatening to ruin your game but will keep you banned if someone threatened your life and you said something.\n\ntl;dr: Context should be taken into account for everybody or nobody.  You can't just go....oh you were a victim of this type of trolling? here is your unban....while telling everyone else that context doesn't matter and you are 100% responsible despite all circumstances.","replies":[{"poster":"No flash no life","date":"2017-10-20T05:45:25.569+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=themachamp,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=OeZ3ipZB,comment-id=00070000000000000001000000030000000100000001,timestamp=2017-10-20T05:12:09.352+0000)\n\n> tl;dr: Context should be taken into account for everybody or nobody. \n\nThis was actually one of my concerns when I was making my point, that some of us might get a bit confused about which context matters and which doesn't. \n\nContext of **others** are not taken into consideration when you meant harm, but context of **your** words are taken into account to determine whether you meant harm or not.\n\nTo present in a simpler manner:\n\nCase 1.\n\"f u kys\"   \n\"dafuq u biatch report x9\" \n\nboth punished because both contexts meant harm, regardless of what the cause was. Just because someone punched you doesn't mean you can punch it back, that's not how things are appropriately dealt with.\n\nCase 2.\n(2 monkey teammates died, other 2 defending inhib turret) \n\"singed u useless piece of ** never group, come and def with us now or report x9\"\n\n(teammates got caught before teleport could complete, 0 chance to defend 3v5 so singed is proxy stalling) \n\"I'm running down mid\"\n\nIf you take it by facial value, what singed said can be interpreted as int'ing, hence punishable. But in reality that's not what he meant. He meant good will by all means, and that is when his context proves him innocent. This is basically what OP did. OP didn't mean for the teammate to kys when he typed \" neck yourself\", the message OP delivered is \"okay if you insist I'll give you what you want if that's what it takes for us to enjoy the game together\".\n\nTL;DR context of your words matter, but context of others' words/actions don't.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Marios Half Bro","date":"2017-11-03T08:50:32.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, this is really late, but I'm just curious to hear your response.

Example.....i get a tahm kench that trolls me all game by following me in the jungle and eating me so he can smite the buffs.  I call him a pos and get banned. I write in and basically get told that im responsible 100% mute the troll and just take it up the ass. I report the troll with screen shots but nothing ever happens( that player never missed a day in nearly a year).  I get no context taken into account or anything special. \n\nYet with this case they are being treated differently because they were ..i guess \"trolled hard enough.....or trolled in a different way?\" but at the end of the day they chose to type and got banned for it.  Unbanning them makes all of their posts on toxicity mute as they are picking and choosing what players to save and which players get the big FU.  When , at the end of the day.....a lot of the verbal abuse comes from non verbal trolling. Ik I can only speak for my games but its very rare to see a verbal abuser that was not preceded by some form of non verbal trolling.\n\nShort version....if they make special exceptions for some they should make it for all.

Sadly this has nothing to do with a moral high ground or or anything as we are dealing with a robot.\n\n That maybe true but nevertheless, Riot is still picking and choosing which accounts get saved while other get the same song and dance of you are 100% responsible for what is done on your account, under no circumstances will we overturn or reduce the ban, yata.  On the support web site and in numerous Riot support emails they state to mute and report at end of game.  In this case the OP chose to type and was not held accountable....according to Riot's very own support posts....he should have just let the troll run it down mid or w/e while muting him and reporting him.  For 99.9% of all cases where people got mad/coerced/baited etc. Riot keeps the ban intact. tells us we are 100% responsible for what happens, and the way to deal with trolls is to basically mute, bend over and take it, then report after the game. Never any special consideration or mercy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"nGio","date":"2017-10-19T22:25:34.710+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cool move.
