Basically it&#039;s an RTS where you&#039;re supposed to build a huge fortress that can withstand the massive, billions of hordes of ~~zombies~~ infected, and it&#039;s pretty damn hard, you&#039;re always needing to do SOMETHING, you gotta expand more and kill more zombies and queue up more troops and build more things and do more research and etc and it always feels like you can do more. Also if even a few zombies get in they can infect a building and then those infected infect another and etc so you can&#039;t fuck up even once.\n\nAlso the lategame swarms are basically pic related vs flamethrower robots.","replies":[]}
