Please check logs for more information.\" message while trying to apply patch 6.20. I have submitted a ticket along with an attachment of my saved logs to RIOT, as well as tried what is suggested on the RIOT technical support pages and even on many forums. Each time I relaunch League the result is the same however. I will continue to look forward to an email back but I am just trying to cover as many different possibilities to resolve this issue as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"God of the Cats","date":"2016-10-07T10:35:44.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's somewhat reassuring to see it's not just me encountering this issue, I'm at my wit's end (heh...) with all this. I've spent every waking moment since the dispatch of 6.20 trying to fix this shit and nothing is working. 2 reinstalls now and so, SO many repatches later and I'm left with no answers and no solutions, and I can't even get a response back on my support ticket. I've posted everywhere I can for help and no one is answering. have you gotten a response back yet?\nkinda upsetting I'm not seeing anything from riot about this, but I'm trying to be patient. but god _damn_ am I getting frustrated. hope we get some answers soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Ishka","date":"2016-10-07T16:35:03.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been waiting 2 days on my ticket.
