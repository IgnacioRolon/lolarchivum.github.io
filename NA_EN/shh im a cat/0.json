I fell for one of those fre Rp things and lets just say I thinK I deserved to be hacked, falling for such a thing.\r\n\r\nI was really scared so I changed my password to everything (Google, FB, ect)! I am so grateful for your patience and understanding. I want to personally warn everyone NOT to sign in to any websites for free RP. \r\n\r\nI cant wait to start playing again, though I have the 20 minute penalty because of the hack but thats okay.\r\n\r\nOnce again thank you so much Rito!!!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T03:02:13.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ayyyy we do our best ^_^\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
