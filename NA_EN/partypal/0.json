I was told to kill myself by a duo q! (Isn&#039;t that nice) I actually carried that game as twitch ( got a pentakill and was 21-8 or something) anyways i like this game A LOT! Love the competetiveness! But i think............ WE CAN ALL AGREE...............\r\n\r\nthat this company is out for our wallets O.O\r\n\r\nI have done some research and and an experiment, I took an account and typed the same exact things in chat as the account that i purchased RP on and it turns out i was banned within a few games of the accounts i purchased RP on and the one&#039;s i didnt i was never even chat restricted... seems fishy huh? Well that&#039;s because it is!\r\n\r\nSo for all of you wondering if you should stop playing this game? I think you should.\r\n\r\nDunkey, Tyler1, and many others are treated unfairly because they are getting a lot of money through streams and youtube and competing with the proffessional streamers, open your eyes guys. We need to boycott this game im afraid.\r\n\r\nSo who&#039;s with me?","replies":[]}
