It is real people who you have to contact via Support (link is at the bottom of this page) who verify of the ban is justified or was applied in error.\n\nMany of the people who comment in Player Behavior threads about these bans or punishments have been restricted, temporarily banned, or have been permanently banned before (as was in my case).\n\nThere are a rare few who get tthese punishments lifted or reduced. When such is the case that we feel an individual has been punished in error, we try to help point them in the right direction.\n\nWhen it is just, we try to help that individual to understand they deserved escalation to the next tier of punishment (whatever that may be).\n\nIn short, humans start and end the process. It's started by the players and completed amd verified by both Riot and other players.\n\nI prefer to keep my personal opinions out of these types of threads, but I will shape mine with you here:\n\nYou are not the type of individual who should speak when you go on tilt. You become very aggressive and defensive at the same time. You force others to have to respond to negative comments made by you in chat. You also single other people out which makes for a negative impact on everyone's game. Picture if you could an individual on the enemy team just trying to verify something related to their skill and handling in that game. Now I understand that by tilting your team with your negative behavior, you provided the enemy team with a less-than-desirable game experience. Granted this is not always the case, but you have to understand that in this community, it is governed by its Community. This is a fraternity. By all literal definition of that word, the fraternity of Summoners in League of Legends will protect its best interests.\n\nOther players have judged your coms to be far below the standards of the League of Legends Community. While the vast majority will agree that league is an intense, competitive game, everyone deserves respect on the rift.\n\nYou failed to show respect for the games that you have played where you have been reported. This ban is applied because you have continued to show this type of behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"ognomet","date":"2017-11-15T22:32:32.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i appreciate the comment and the time it took you to write it:\nsince you play the game, you know the environment there : it can get as toxic as it can be, even in my chat log posted you can conclude ( i hope, that i was trying to be constructive: and in the chat when i say 'ok report him, he was ragequit'.","replies":[{"poster":"Xurreal","date":"2017-11-15T23:06:22.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand, completely.\n\nIt bugs me to no end. People are not considerate.\n\nEven in this thread, there are folks who will ridicule you after you have achieved the ultimate form of defeat in League of Legends: The Permanent Ban. Going out on a tangent here, Even some of Riot's staff have utterly disappointed me at times.\n\nTyler1 has anger management issues, and there has been a Rioter who was called out for wishing death and torment on him in a painful and humiliating way (granted that individual was forced to quit or was fired, depending on how you look at it). It goes to show you that people have literally no sympathy towards the defeat and humiliation of another individual at times. But that is because we are all people with different stories.\n\nI personally have anger issues and have gone through some really crappy times in life. But people I know, especially classmates, have described me as a Godly Nice individual (i would refuse such praise often).\n\nBack to my point, i will not walk behind you and twist the knife that has already been placed in your back as others would. I prefer to see you as who you might be rather than who you are based on a moment of lapse. As an individual with anger management issues, I can relate to your feelings of having a game ruined and finally having \"enough-is-enough\" feelings. One day, I hope that Riot really does consider reforming its policies on punishment as they are often times severe and very final, more so than they should be at times. That they can ban an 8-year old Legacy account on the whim with the reasoning that \"You shall never reform\" is arbitrary at best, since HELLO! I'm still here on a new account, honor level 5, just suffering the loss of something I held with memorabilia over a few bad outbursts during a time of hardship in my life that will forever haunt me. Sorry, that is not the point of this post.\n\nI sympathize with you. Unfortunately, the decisions made are backed legally by the Terms of Use.\n\nWhat we have to do is forge the opportunity that one day we can force Riot to wholeheartedly consider that they are perhaps approaching the issue of toxicity the wrong way, perhaps making it worse. From my perspective, the only way to succeed in doing this is to prove that we can, will, and are able to reform and prove them and the system they employ wrong. It is flawed, But we have to make it appear so flawed that they have no choice but to revise the policy on bans.\n\nPerhaps a 1 year ban should be the next step after a 14-Day Ban. People mature. Children grow up into adults. Men and Women make life changing decisions. Perhaps it is not so wrong to believe that an individual can become a whole new person after a year break from League of Legends.\n\nIt is a terrible thing to happen to people like us. Putting so much of our energy, emotion, chakra or vital essence into a common goal, only to be told \"You are apart the 0.006%\" is a toxic action unto itself and does not do anything to promote reform.\n\nIt might sound very corny or New Age-ish, but the best thing we can do is help others to beat negative expectations that Reform is impossible.\n\nDid this make sense? I am not the best speaker, but it all comes from the heart.\n\nThat 0.006% message almost made me give up on League of Legends. If it did that to me, there's no telling how many other people actually DID give up on it due to a toxic message like that.\n\nIf it helps you out, I will share with you what helped me to reform and get this account to Honor level 5 and stay there:\n\nRemember, It is every bit as much THEIR game as it is YOUR game. You cannot and SHOULD not ever try to play someone else's game for them. \n\n* Playing your own game is already stressful enough that you feel the need to take a break every now and then from grinding out games.\n* When someone else starts flaming or insulting or generally being toxic, LET THEM DO THEM. Your job is to do YOU better than they can do themselves.\n* When someone else starts becoming toxic, they become a toxic timebomb. As you have witnessed first hand, the system is very strict about toxicity to a certain degree. Do not make contact with them. Don't tell them about themselves. Do not mention what makes you feel a certain way in chat. If you do this, you are already infected with their toxicity.\n* Lastly, WE are not JUDGE, JUROR, NOR EXECUTIONER! We do not get paid to talk to toxic people. Riot does. Let THEM do their job. They have guidelines they must follow, and they make a living doing it. You and I on the other hand give voice to the injustice they inflict on your games or on other people. NEVER fail to report toxic behavior. It is YOUR game, too, afterall. The reporting system is the tool they provide us to  help them clean up the game.\n\nI type this to you because you have a sense of decency. I do not type this much or put this much effort into everyone. I know you will make good on this, or else I would not do this (it would be a waste of time).\n\nHelp me, and others like us, prove that the Policy on Bans needs to change. What is banned is banned, and permanent is everlasting.\n\nGoing forward, lets make the road for the Next Generation of League Of Legends Summoners not be so rocky and frustrating as hell.\n\nSorry for the massive wall of text, but I'm not so great with words that I can say what I want to say in so few.\n\nGood luck out there, and stay awesome, man.\n\nPlease, stay awesome.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2017-11-15T21:09:14.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have had two chat restrictions, correct?","replies":[{"poster":"ognomet","date":"2017-11-15T22:29:52.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive had one ... more than 3 months ago. but again, what in my chat is BANABLE?\nwhere is my 'mistake'? and how do i be a TEAM player if i dont even get to talk to my team, and ask for help ( and ofc NOT being trashtalked by my team for feeding and inting - when i get camped top?)","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2017-11-15T22:39:11.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">what in my chat is BANABLE?\n\nSo the punishment system works on tiers. 10 game chat ban, 25 game chat ban, 14 day ban, perma.
