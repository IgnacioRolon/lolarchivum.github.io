From the chat log you just kept going on and on about it incessantly. At that point you're just calling more attention to it which isn't even necessary.\n\nYou can just report the player yourself after the game. It only takes your one report to flag the game for review, other peoples reports don't stack with yours, because the system only takes into account whether there are or aren't reports when deciding whether or not to review the match for behavior, after it decides to review the match it ignores the reports and focuses on what happens in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Grabherbythekity","date":"2018-04-02T21:55:26.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I know it looks that way with just one story on there doesn't it.

I feel for you, it sucks to get trolled so bad that you feel the need to react. But it's still not an acceptable response, according to Riot.\n\n2. Naming is basically calling attention to someone for something. Whether they do what you said or not, it can bring negative attention on them. Which is a problem because attention on a troll only adds fuel to the fire, and negative on an innocent person makes them miserable. So it won't matter if they are innocent or guilty because either way calling them on it can only make things worse.\n\n3. Unfortunately Riot does consider it punishable, because whether you intend it to or not it can create a negative experience in the game for the bystanders on your team. Filling chat with talk calling their attention to something that is irritating will only serve to make them more irritated. There's no need to do so, so it's not worth doing anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Grabherbythekity","date":"2018-04-02T22:31:40.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with all of that, but how will anyone ever know what is a good or bad play decision, if we are forced to say  Please do this? or  I would appreciate it if you didn't do that?

And to be fair you did a bit more than just say please and thank you in your chat logs.\n\nSomething that helps a lot is to make use of verb tense to control the mode of conversation. Let me explain:\n\nPast, present and future tense have different uses and connotations in conversation. Depending on which one is used, people will react differently to what you say. Additionally people may use the tenses without realizing or intending, and lead you to react poorly just the same.\n\nPast tense is often about attributing blame or praise, it's about figuring out what happened and attributing it to somebody's actions. Thus if you talk about something that went wrong, and you talk about it in the past tense, people are more likely to overreact because they think you're blaming them. Examples, \"can you stop feeding, why didn't you do X, what was that all about, etc.\" By calling attention to an event in the past, you will usually inevitably cause people to think you are attributing either credit or blame to them. You want teammates to listen, which means you want them to respect you, so it's best to only use past tense to attribute credit after things go well.\n\nPresent tense is often used to talk about values, it's best used for aligning values, but it can also be used to separate people. Examples: \"That's stupid, That's awesome, Why are you doing that?! I'm doing this right now because it's important to me. etc.\" This too won't really help you to make people listen, unless you use it to back people up and support them if they start getting blamed for things.\n\nFuture tense is where the magic happens. Talking about something in the future leaves fewer opportunities for blaming and flaming. And it makes it a lot harder for people to misinterpret your words as some kind of attack. Examples, \"Lets ward here (pings) next time to prevent another gank from being successful,\" or \"play safe when you get back to lane so that they can't force a fight with you,\" etc. By focusing people on the future, you help them to tilt less, and you can get them focused on what they need to do in order to succeed, rather than letting them get distracted arguing about who is at fault for something that can't be changed anyways.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dolyna","date":"2018-03-31T00:16:45.745+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to say, this doesn't seem quite bad enough to me to warrant a punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-30T23:21:23.842+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really, but an account tends to be on thin ice after multiple restrictions.\n\nJust dont fight the stupid, you cant beat them at their own game.
