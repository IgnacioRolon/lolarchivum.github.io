CertainlyT responded with the comment posted in the link provided. He claims is should work on Mordekaiser and that it was potentially a bug. The issue is that there was never any clarification on how its suppose to work in general or more importantly on special shields like Mordekaiser.\r\n\r\nIs Runic Armor still broken on Morde? I started up a custom game and at base health 525 his shield is 131 or 25% of his health. Does Runic Armor just not work? How is it supposed to work because it doesn&#039;t make since on how certain shields that work differently  than a typical shield based on wording anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-11-11T19:20:47.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a guess as I'm not able to test this just yet(still at work) but i think everyone is being fooled by thr lack of working in the Runic armor mastery.  What i mean by this is that Runic armor generates extra shield on top of any action that generates a shield.  Mordekaiser's passive doesn't actually generate shield, his spells do.  To test this, use his spell with and without the mastery and see if there is a difference in shield.  Hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Ergono","date":"2015-11-11T23:18:55.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tested it real quick and no shield generation is not affected by the mastery either.  I tested this on Gromp LVL 1 casting my E doing 77 dmg, I generated 20 shield which is roughly 25% of the damage in line with Morde's passive. This was with the runic armor mastery. Riot Stashu answered my question on the Dev Blog stating:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/R9qEczjl-preseason-open-forum-day-2?comment=00030000\n\nThat they haven't adjusted the mastery to account for certain champs as of now. Don't ask me why I'm not going to push my luck at least I got a response.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-11-11T23:46:32.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, thanks for the follow up!

The problem is that his shield generation is attached to his passive. Not to mention if this does work then it completely messes with his re-work aka build more tank bruiser not damage as the mastery would value damage over building health.\n\nIt's ironic that we are both at work and solving Riot's very own work related issues. We should send them invoices with are hourly rate in RP.\n\nThis sucks for {{champion:54}}  passive if this is indeed the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-11-11T23:38:18.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does suck alittle but it also makes sense that the alternative mastery, Veteran Scars, would be better for him since HP actualy became a relevant resource for him after the rework.  Minor issues aside I'm pleased with how the rework turned out since it gives him a much more satisfying playstyle for what i think his visual represents.  If you are interested, try Bond of Stone and scaleing AD armor and MR for runes.  I find this setup effective if i need early defences and lets me scale super hard into late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ergono","date":"2015-11-11T23:51:04.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately I did the math between Runic Armor under various conditions versus veteran scars. No matter how Runic Armor will actually affect Morde there is never a situation where Veteran Scars will out perform.\n\nI actually plan on running Storm Raiders Surge Solo lane as Morde can easily do 30% allowing him to hit and run constantly.\n\nBond of stone definitely for Duo lane though. I just feel that no matter how tanky Morde is if he's too far away from his tower he's going to get picked apart. Storm Raider solves that issue.\n\nI also plan on running Distortion boots with flash and ghost. Don't really see the value in ignite with him in a solo lane and TP might not be that great given its changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-11-12T00:27:06.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Distortion boots for sure!  Currently thinking the Ionian boots will be the best pick since aside from maybe Ninja tabi and Swiftness boots.\n\nAny thoughts between the Insight or Perseverance Mastery?  I'm about to try out a max summoner spell CD build to see how low I can get Flash down to with maybe exhaust or smite as my other pick.  Have to admit though I'm curious to try ghost again on Morde but the last time I picked it up was about the beginning of season 4 I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Ergono","date":"2015-11-12T02:18:44.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perseverance on Morde is wasted. It only boosts base health regen and at lvl 1 that's 4 / 5hp for Morde. 15% CDR on summoner spells way better for Morde.>>> Flash -- Ghost--Distortion no one can catch you. Exhaust is definitely something to consider.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ergono","date":"2015-11-11T18:35:54.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just going to bump this because I find this to be an issue of a bigger problem with the new masteries, bugs, and no actual information on how some of these work.\n\nI am reading reports of Bandit not working with melee champ spell, as an example. Aside from other 5.22 issues I think actual information on masteries and how they actually interact is warranted, especially when they do not and we aren't given a reason why.","replies":[]}]}
