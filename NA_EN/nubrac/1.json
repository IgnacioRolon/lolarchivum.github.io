Consistently getting verbal abused in every game because im Nubrac\r\n2. Have Constant Summoners Straight Running it down because im Nubrac\r\n3. Have people choose summoners and champs they never played before because im Nubrac\r\n4. Have people Afk and FF 15 and Afk just because im Nubrac\r\n5. Takes 30 minutes to get into a game and get past Champ select and get in game because I'm Nubrac\r\n6. I got banned for no reason, after telling me the strat is okay multiple times then banning me for doing it is wrong.\r\n7. No response yet from riot other then, I \"intentionally fed\", \"griefed\", and \"did it because a streamer was in my game\" All different BS excuses from different rioters, none of which are true.\r\n8. I did the exact same thing hundreds of games before the ban, and couple hundred after the ban doing the same thing. So how come i'm not banned again.\r\n\r\nI can't even play a standard game anymore, everyone sees Nubrac and goes \"someone dodge, ff 15\" and they pick troll stuff they never played thinking somone else will dodge until noone does, then end up with such a disadvantaged team.\r\n\r\nOther players ruin the game on purpose because i'm Nubrac","replies":[]}
