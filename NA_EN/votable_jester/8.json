While it is still being used for its intended purpose of calling &quot;enemy mia&quot;s, this new use dilutes that purpose.\r\n\r\nWhile I have never done this personally, I have had people mistake me for doing this when I was simply calling mia.\r\nIn one such instance, my top laner pinged &quot;?&quot; over her lane to signal that her laner was missing, but I was too tunneled in on my opponent in mid lane to notice.  One easy gank later, I was color blind, and finally noticed her ping in the chat, causing me to understand that it was 100% my fault that I died.\r\nAbout 30 seconds into my wait to revive, I noticed that the enemy top laner had not returned to their lane despite still being near full health.  Thus I pinged &quot;?&quot; over top lane, and was starting to type a more detailed warning to bot lane when I saw our top laner respond to my ping in chat.  She said (slightly rudely, but understandably) that she had called mia and that it was my own fault that I was caught in the gank.\r\n\r\nOnly then did I realize that my &quot;?&quot; ping was being misinterpreted as a complaint towards her.\r\n\r\nWhile this was sorted out fine a few lines later in the chat, it made me realize the harm that this change in use has brought.  The &quot;?&quot; ping has switched from a quick, friendly warning of possible danger to a potential attack from your own teammate.  This not only makes it function worse as the the easy communication tool it was designed to be (people now feel the need to check themselves if it&#039;s just a complaint), but it can also cause hostility when there was none before.\r\nIn that game, the top laner and I had been getting along fine (little communication outside of pings, but no raging or anything either), but that little misunderstanding caused some friction for a little bit.\r\n\r\nWhile this post probably won&#039;t reach many of those people who spam the &quot;?&quot; ping over their allies, I urge those of you who do read this to consciously avoid doing it in the future and stop other people from doing it as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-09-28T10:36:11.568+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":22,"body":"Tldr","replies":[{"poster":"Pantheon Forever","date":"2016-09-28T10:43:22.352+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL:DR \"Pings are annoying and used as weapons\" vs \"Pings are a more effective and efficient way to communicate\" (who is held responsible for the annoyance that some players feel riot or the player)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nI'm taking the side of \"Pings are a more effective and efficient way to communicate\".\n\n\"Some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagree back\" -Jerry (Rick and Morty)","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-09-28T17:59:38.700+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have always been saying that pings are an efficient method of communicating with your team.\nMy issue is that with the \"?\" ping taking on multiple meanings, it takes slightly longer for people to understand your message as they need to check if you may have intended something else.

I believe a certain amount of tolerance is required to take part, not everyone will see it like you do (or me). If a \"?\" is enough to be punished it's enough to make someone lose access to the rift. How much freedom are you willing to sacrifice to make sure no one is ever annoyed. Unsportsmanlike conduct is a separate issue from what annoys you or me personally. Teemo annoys me, should I be allowed to report players that use him for that (of course not)? Trying to justify a player being punished for using a feature of the game as intended should never be against the rules, and if it becomes a problem it should be adjusted or removed not the player. A player using a ping to communicate that they disagree with your action is using the ping to communicate what they are thinking faster. The poster saying he understood that proves that its working. Maybe a new ping (to distinguish the separate uses) should be implemented. However saying a player can't communicate when they see something happening they think will decide the outcome of the game with team mates completely violates the teamwork/strategy portion of the game.\n\nSummary: I disagree, the ping system should be adjusted instead of punishments handed out so players can convey what they are thinking in a quick and efficient manner (bonus points if it can be done in a way that annoys fewer players). Thinking we can have millions of players interacting in a competitive game without anyone ever being annoyed is absurd.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"CooL Ice Tea","date":"2016-09-28T10:04:03.985+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your whole statement builded up on the fact that I would get annoyed if someone gives me a ?

I myself find repeated pings as the best way to make sure they know I'm coming and I want them to run into where I am using my ultimate. This is a very fast paced game and players can often be distracted or not understand the intensity of how important something is quickly enough (especially in normal matches or low ranked matches). More pings means a higher chance of successful communication. The ping limit is already set kinda low @ 5-6 pings per minute. Try and think of the volume of pings as an indication of how important it is rather than a personal slight against you. If I ping once I got the kill in the bag, you are welcome to come grab an assist, but if i ping till my pings time out, I need you to help me and I need it now or I will die for what would otherwise be an amazing play. The same measure can be applied to them using the \"?\" ping to disagree with a decision you made, 1 ping might be for placing a ward in a poor spot, 5 pings might be that you didn't use your ultimate as Amumu in a clutch team fight when it was clearly visible it was available in the HUD and everyone died for it (making plays that relied on it).\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}} ","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-09-28T08:14:11.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not simply about bringing them to my side, but getting them to encourage this view in other players who may not be on the boards.\n\nI agree with you that the boards seem to generally consist of well-meaning, positive players (though as you said, we don't really have proof), but that doesn't mean that their friends are as well.\n\nI also already pointed out that I didn't expect the post to reach many people who do this.\n\nBesides, there's really no point in your comments about this subject being broached or not reaching numerous people who could greatly benefit from it.
