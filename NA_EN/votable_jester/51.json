Currently on live, I typically build {{item:3165}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} and have 20% scaling CDR in my runes.  This allows me to be the glass cannon I want to be.\n\nOn the pbe however, I can only get up to 10% CDR in my runes, leaving me short 10% CDR.  Now I&#039;ll have to sacrifice one of my heavy damage AP items for {{item:3157}} and/or {{item:3102}} or my {{item:3020}} for {{item:3158}}.  My issue with this is it basically removes the option to play as a full-on glass cannon, a playstyle I greatly enjoy.\n\nBuilding defensive should be a choice.  Even if it was always optimal to build some defense, I should be allowed to choose not to.  To solve this, could you please add a heavy AP item with some CDR on it when you update mage items?\n\nEdit: As I've said several times already, I'm not asking for everything.  I'm already giving up defense here.  Why should I have to give up CDR too?  If you want to balance it out, I'd happily throw out the HP on Liandry's and tack on the CDR there.  That would be a cost for the CDR.\n\nI mean why should a champion like Xerath who gains next to nothing from defensive items be forced to buy defense to have an optimal offense?  That makes absolutely no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-29T00:03:21.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then, choose Gathering Storm over Scorch or Ultimate Hat over the hexdrinker effect in Nullifying Orb. I mean, if you want to forego defensive options for offensive choices, you can do that in the Rune System just as well as in the Item System. In the old system, the CDR you were taking in Runes could've been more AP Runes. In the new system, you can't get CDR from Runes, so get it from Items and get more damage than before from Runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-09-29T00:20:58.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am planning on taking those runes.\n\nIn the old rune system, I was also able to reach 20% CDR at the expense of my defenses.  I got rid of all my mr blues for scaling cdr and only 1 AP Quint for a Scaling CDR one.  So I gave up almost entirely defense for that.  As for your claim about those being able to be AP, I probably would have if CDR wasn't so necessary from runes.  Now I can't get enough of it from runes and items combined without sacrificing at least 30 AP before Rabadon's Passive kicks in.\n\nAgain, is there a reason why 40% CDR glass cannon is no longer fine to exist?  It was allowed in the old system, so why not the new?","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-29T00:37:48.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you replace Liandry by Zhonya and take all the max damage option in new Runes, and then dare call that \"not a glass cannon build\", well, that's a bit dishonest. That will be MUCH more AP than in the old system. Liandry versus Zhonya is -10 AP and -15 MPen, but Old Runes+Masteries versus new Runes, with a Page like this one for instance: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update/8200-8229?build=21202071 it's still a lot more damage overall. You have a Flat bonus of +15 AP, and Gathering Storm is worth a full item by itself. The Keystone is just as much damage than the old one. Cut down is up to +8% damage and you have 0 HP in your build so it should trigger on practically everybody.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-09-29T00:47:50.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the Keystone is not quite as good because I took dtf, but that's not really the issue.\n\nAlso not that important, but Cut Down says \"up to\" that damage, making me think it works similar to Dominik's.\n\nFinally, idc if I can do as much damage with that build as I do now with my current build.  It's the loss in the option to build that way (without just gimping yourself) that I dislike.  Again, is there any actual reason for there not to be another high AP plus CDR item?","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-29T01:11:08.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Again, is there any actual reason for there not to be another high AP plus CDR item?\n\nYes, but the issue is beyond that. You complain about the loss of an option which is totally still here. You had the option to go full glass canon and forego pretty much any defense. You still have that option. Plus, now, players have much more different options, the new system is much more flexible. I guess that last point isn't exactly relevant for you, but anyway, you can go glass canon just like before, after a very minor adjustment to your build.\n\nIf you're complaining for the 30 Armor on Zhonya, let me remind you that Liandry has 300 HP, last I checked, so that ain't exactly \"totally absolutely 200% full glass cannon\" either... If you're complaining about the -10 AP, you have much more AP from Runes and so much more AP overall than before.\n\nYou're complaining about a problem that does not exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-09-29T02:42:16.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"15 magic penetration is way more valuable than the 10 AP btw.\n\nIt'll actually be difficult to determine which to toss between that and Luden's.\nIt should also be interesting to see how they change AP itemization when they update it.  There is a chance that they'll deconstruct Morello into several items, and it'll be possible to reach the CDR desired from those items.\n\nAnyways it's clear you don't actually know what on earth I'm talking about.  -10 AP and (more importantly) -15 mpen is a massive loss in damage.  Don't forget that's also swapping out a damage passive for a defensive active.  It's a massive difference.\n\nSo what is the issue with high AP + CDR?  Morello has high AP, CDR, mana, grievous wounds, and mana regen on kill/assist.  I'm asking for 2 of those on a second item.  Literally a stat-stick item of 100 AP and 10-20% CDR would satisfy me.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-29T03:19:30.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And how valuable is 63 AP at 30 min? And 95 AP at 40 min? Without even counting the AP you can get from something like Eyeball collector or the likes. Maybe the optimal choice is not to give up Liandry but to give up Luden instead, I don't know, I don't build glass cannon and I don't like that. And the system isn't even out yet. But you're grossly underestimating the damage you can get from the new Runes if you're actually ready to go all out on damages. I bet my ass that it will largely compensate the fact that you've got to take 10% more CDR from your items.\n\nCDR is supposed to be an utility stats, not a damage stat, it's not on damage items on purpose, because you shouldn't get high utility and high damage in a single purchase (same reason Rylai was nerfed, for instance), and if you want both in the same build you have to take a meaningful trade-off. In your case, the trade-off was that you gave up all defense. Fair enough. But asking for high damage and high CDR on the same item, that isn't fair anymore. Morello is barely OK as is because its passive is pure utility (mana sustain), so the only thing that make it a \"damage item\" is the fact that it's only one of the few 100 AP items left. If Morello had a real combat passive, you'd see everyone complaining about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nut on my Butt","date":"2017-09-29T00:24:05.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blue buff.\n\nIt was nice when the elixir gave cdr.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-09-29T00:28:25.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer not to rely on my teammates for that.

I mean, unkillable nuker is better than just nuker.\n\nWhat I want is to get to choose to go full damage.  Imagine if there were only a couple tank items with pure defensive stats, and others had less to allow for them to have some offensive stats.  Sure, they may be good, but the option to go full defense should always be there.\n\nAs for needing 40% CDR, yes.  As an immobile squishy mage, CDR is 100% necessary to be able to kite.  Even with 40% CDR, I can't afford to miss a single ability on a pursuing enemy.  Without maximum CDR, it'll be that much harder to kite the increasingly mobile competition.  Also, the last 10% CDR (from 30% -> 40%) is more valuable than any of the previous gains, so losing that last gain is the worst of all.\n\nIf the item can't have high AP, I'd want it to at least have mpen and/or some kind of damage passive/active usable at significant range (I'd tie it to landing spells personally).\n\nThis is also a matter of build variety.  Why shouldn't you be allowed to forgo defenses to eke out an extra bit of damage?  It doesn't make sense that the CDR options should be tied to the more defensive AP items.  Sure they may have synergy, but so does AP with CDR.\n\nIt was perfectly fine for me to have 40% CDR with glass cannon builds before the new runes come out, so why should that no longer be the case after?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-09-28T23:20:05.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3100}} I guess if you're going out of the way to avoid any defensive stats","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-09-28T23:28:56.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That requires auto attack range and provides less than 100 AP with no penetration.\nIf you go into autoattack range with no defensive items, you're almost certainly going to die.
