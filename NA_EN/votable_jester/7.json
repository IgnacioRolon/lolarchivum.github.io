This is probably going to be my icon for a really long time now.  I honestly hadn&#039;t expected a reward for my participation in the old honor system as it was really just about being a decent person.\r\n\r\nReceiving these icons (that include mini versions of the ribbon they used to give) was really nice of them.  It&#039;s a little nostalgic to get to see the different ribbons I had (especially since back then, once you got a new one, it overwrote the previous one on your border).  Now I get to use my favorite one, the Mentor one all the time!\r\n\r\nAnybody else like the icons?","replies":[]}
