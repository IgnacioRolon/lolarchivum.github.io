I&#039;m not 100% sure whether this is a bug or intended, but from what I looked up on Black Shield and the terms involved, it should be considered a bug.\r\n\r\nFor context, I was running away from Garen past my middle outer turret, when he started charging at me with his Q.  I threw on my Black Shield and was getting ready to snare him once it came off cd when I found out I was silenced.  My Black Shield was still up, but I could not cast anything.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s about as much as I can give for context.  If this is not a bug, please let me know so I can keep that in mind in future games.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-07-16T13:08:21.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Places a protective barrier around an allied champion, absorbing magical damage and disables until penetrated or the shield dissipates.\n>\n>Shields an allied Champion for 5 seconds.

Those would be things like slows, roots, stuns, supressions, and other movement impairing abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2016-07-17T17:53:49.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Morgana shields the target friendly champion or herself for up to 5 seconds, absorbing magic damage and rendering her target immune to all crowd control while the shield holds.\n\n*clicks on \"crowd control\" and sees this*:\n\nSilence: A unit that is silenced cannot cast abilities or activate items for the duration.\n\nProof: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Morgana\n\nAlso says:  Morgana's Black Shield provides immunity to **all forms** of CC applied in the duration of the shield.\"","replies":[]}]}]}
