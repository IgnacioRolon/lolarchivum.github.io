I don&#039;t mean to make items melee or ranged only, but rather make them increase damage against close or distant enemies.\r\n\r\nBasically, some items intended for short range (assassins, some burst mages, whatever) would get a unique passive (unnamed, so it could be shared between multiple items and stack) that increases magic damage by a percent to enemies with some small radius of them.\r\nItems for long-ranged mages could either just not have this passive, or could have a reverse effect, to deal more damage to enemies at a range than up close.  This would also further reward enemies who can get on these mages.\r\n\r\nBasically this would allow Riot to tune these items to only be strong on those champions they wish to use it on.","replies":[{"poster":"PopcornBunni","date":"2017-08-31T22:18:32.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels like if you aren't a pure burst mage, you'll have shit AP scaling and heavy mana issues to deal any decent damage\n\n{{champion:13}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:7}} all fall into this, having 50% AP scaling at best and only going past the base damage of their spells at 400 or so AP.\n\nWith that, these characters end up all building extremely similar paths\n\n{{item:3001}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}} all provide more damage for these low-scalers than the stronger mage options, and the rest of the items are usually set in place from the start for their utility because it's the only thing they can provide in lieu of better scaling\n\n{{champion:13}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3110}} \n{{champion:163}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3165}} \n{{champion:34}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3157}} \n{{champion:7}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3100}} \n\nWith most mages being on the lower-half of the scaling spectrum, it would be nice to see some more active damage items besides the hextechs.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-08-31T23:18:25.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say most mages have low AP scalings.

The base damage is still going to overtake the scaling and make penetration and abysal mask increase the damage overall more reliably.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
