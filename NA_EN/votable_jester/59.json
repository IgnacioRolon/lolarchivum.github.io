I have a crap load of kill behind the enemy nexus when playing at the blue side (aka behind red nexus). Does this means that when playing blue side we dominate more?","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-12-14T14:25:40.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspect it has more to do to where we \"fall back!\" to when we're pushed in. In the Blue Base the entire base tends to feel safer, while in the Red Base you don't tend to venture near the rock pillars as often, since they somehow feel more exposed. If people don't go to that part of the map, they can't be killed there, thus leading to the different heat maps.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2016-12-14T13:42:16.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you play botgames for first win of the day a lot?

Probably an average of around once every two weeks or so though, and when I do that, I usually just destroy the structures and stuff.  I play it like a game of how fast I can win rather than how many kills I can get (my current record is something like 13:15 or so).\n\nThat could definitely be aiding in the difference between the bases, but I don't think that would be quite enough on its own.  Of course, I may be wrong and that may be it.\n\nThanks for letting me know about that though.  I wouldn't have expected bot games to be considered for this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2016-12-14T13:21:17.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because red side  sucks and wont stop sucking till riot shifts the map to me the same for both sides.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-12-14T13:24:47.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm thinking that really probably is the case, but I can't say anything for sure based on just one sample.","replies":[{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2016-12-14T13:39:41.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot know red side has a lower win rate that's why they place the team with the higher average mmr on red side, but even though red has a higher mmr red still loses more.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-12-14T13:30:09.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did you find this map?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-12-14T13:34:24.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://review2016.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/year-in-review/personal-landing\n\nLog in, and scroll down until you find the map.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-12-14T13:24:19.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a ton of kills in lane, but not a lot in either base.","replies":[]}]}
