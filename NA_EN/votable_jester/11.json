A lot of the people I play with want to play with me, but only play ranked.  I on the other hand generally prefer the casual fun of normals, and the freedom to play whatever champions I want to at the time.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t think of a reason to not have this option in the game, and it would probably result in a moderate increase in play rate as people are willing to go on more often if they aren&#039;t being harassed.\r\n\r\nUnless this would cost quite a bit for Riot to implement, they should just add this.  It&#039;d be nice for those players who would use it, and it would result in more play.","replies":[{"poster":"CannonLordFreed","date":"2017-03-15T22:38:09.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd be nice, yeah. I'm not quite sure how client works without looking through the code, but if I'm assuming correctly, it's probably take a change in an if statement, And adding a few lines, maybe an object and ways for that to interact through methods if it's coded how I would have done it. (I'm still learning Java in a high school computer science class though so how I would do something might not be the best way to implement something.)","replies":[]}]}
