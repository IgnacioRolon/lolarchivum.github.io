It&#039;s also preferable if you don&#039;t need to buy a specific item.\r\n\r\nThis is not a post about current balance, just trying to get a firmer idea on what people consider counterplay to be.  Go ahead and post your own definition below, and please upvote any definition you agree with.  To keep track of the opinion on my definition as well (without tying it to the post&#039;s votes), here&#039;s a poll.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-02-22T20:16:41.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"can i dodge your shit? counterplay.\nI cant dodge your shit?

I say sequence because a single action, e.g. flashing out of something is just that, flashing out of it. It can be done in a moment of desperation, too, and flash alone should not be the only counter to, well, anything.\ncounter+play=counterplay\n\nI don't think it means just avoiding or working around, that sounds pretty passive or defensive, when you can actually be the aggressor before the fact, or simply have an effective counter, during or after the fact.  An example for a simple counter I can think of right now is ziggs' bouncing bomb, most people instinctively run away form it in the same direction it was thrown, occasionally trying to dodge it at the same time, but failing cus of its aoe. Running towards it is counter intuitive but works better. Closing the gap is an aggressive move, I'd say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jezebelle","date":"2017-02-22T21:00:57.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like most infinite mobility champions do not have counterplay. With champions like {{champion:55}} I think it's perfectly acceptable to have high mobility and a high damage channel ultimate that is shut down by silences/hard CC. Her infinite mobility is also situational, as it doesn't refund if used offensively, unlike Yasuo, Camilla, or Fizz. There's also an issue with mages who are supposed to be battle mages dealing assassin level damage having 'counterplay' such as Syndra's ult, Annie's ult, or Veigar's ult. However, unlike assassins, they are usually kitable (iffy on Veigar, personally think his stun lands too soon, and needs a +.5s warning). True counterplay is hard to find in League, I'd like to think of champions such as {{champion:37}} as having clear counterplay, gameplay patterns that are unique and at times strong, but certainly playable against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-02-22T20:29:36.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me it's \"Is there a way you can fight/outplay or just avoid\" or something like that, which I'm personally counting Items/Summoner spells to that as well like how Sustain champions counterplay is {{item:3123}} {{item:3033}} {{item:3165}} {{summoner:14}} which is something that can be used to fight them, though in some champions cases it might be to much of one but that is generally a champion issue at that point.\n\nPersonally, I'm tired of when people say X champion is fair because you can CC them, and that being their only counterplay, because that is counterplay to basically every champion who is not a tank. Hell even some tanks CC is a good counterplay into them as well, the only people that I don't mind people saying CC is their counterplay is {{champion:55}} because her ultimate is a large portion of her damage and hitting her with CC during it will cut her damage so in her case I can agree.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-02-22T20:41:13.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you for the most part.  My only issue is when items become the source of counterplay, champions are too strong when you don't have the item, too weak when you do have the item, or both.  This is an even bigger issue when you consider that you need to dump some money in to get that item, so if you're behind, you may not be able to get access to that counterplay for a while.","replies":[]}]}]}
