It gets hard so they quit because they don't know any better. They will live long boring unsuccessful lives because of it. Winners don't quit.\n\nPeople like this will make every excuse in the book but it's human nature that if you fail real life you will bring that same fail attitude to anything you do. A winner won't.\n\nDon't be taken by that sorry excuse that they lead a successful life and play games to relax and have fun because it's bullshit. Successful people can relax and have fun playing games too but I bet any amount of money that they win a lot more than these quitting failures.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Just Blame Jenny","date":"2017-04-06T08:34:10.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solo Q in a nutshell, from bronze to silver!:\n\n{{champion:16}} *First Blood*\n{{champion:67}} gg open mid *afks*","replies":[]},{"poster":"MisterSki","date":"2017-04-06T06:05:34.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't feed?
