I can completely understand reducing the base because that directly hits the early game hardest, and keeps the late game fairly similar, but reducing the AP ratio by .2 is a massive hit to his mid and late game burst and waveclear.\r\n\r\nWhy can&#039;t they just take small steps when balancing other champions than just their favorites?","replies":[{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2016-12-08T23:42:02.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I find even funnier is you expected Riot's balance team to actually do something right.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-12-09T00:16:20.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're quite gentle with the nerfs to the champions they like.
