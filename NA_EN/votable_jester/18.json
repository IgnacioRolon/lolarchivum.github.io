All new skins are put on sale after a time of 4 to 6 months after they have been released.  Riot usually posts a schedule of what will be seen on sale in the coming month (not exact dates though of when said skins are on sale during that month)","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-08-24T05:54:46.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks.  For some reason I was thinking it was always about 3 months after, but as I said in the main post, I have an unreliable memory for this kinda stuff xD\n\nThanks again.","replies":[]}]}]}
