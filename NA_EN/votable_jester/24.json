They have even specifically mentioned it being fine by them if Riven players are using it.\n\nStop asking for nerfs that make it unusable for anyone who doesn&#039;t build 3+ tank items.  Riot doesn&#039;t want it to be stuck to one class of champions (btw that would potentially make it super snowbally and impossible to stop a tower dive).  They originally hoped that each champion would have several keystones that they could use to help them in various matchups.  This is a step in the right direction, a tanky keystone that can be used by squishies.\n\nEdit:  Gotta love random downvotes :D","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-11-28T21:54:04.234+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're right that it wasn't specifically designed for engage tanks.

It just should remain an option to help deal with games where you know you're going to need a bit more tankiness.  If it's oppressive on anyone, go ahead and nerf it; just make the nerf focused on those who are abusing it.\n\nIf tanks are busted with it, nerf the HP scaling, and slightly buff the flat probably to keep it roughly the same for those who aren't tanks.  If squishies are busted with it, nerf the base (I think buffing the %HP would likely be too strong though as a shift of even .5% can be a huge difference).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-11-29T20:20:05.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not complaining about engage tanks being too strong...\nNever do I say that the keystone is too strong or too weak.
