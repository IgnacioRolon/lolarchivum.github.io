This has made it possible to fit in more or fewer CDR items while still reaching the cap (something Riot has made near necessary for mages).  I myself usually use 20% CDR in my runes, and drop down to lower levels when I plan to throw a Banshee&#039;s Veil and/or Zhonya&#039;s into my build.\r\n\r\nWith the new rune system, there so far appears to only be one option for CDR, a max of 10%.  This will mean that mages will have to get that last 10% from somewhere, further reducing the possibility of a purely offensive build such as {{item:3165}}{{item:3020}}{{item:3285}}{{item:3151}}{{item:3135}}{{item:3089}}.  Now mages will definitely have to build at least one of these {{item:3157}}{{item:3102}}{{item:3158}}{{item:3152}}, where presently that is purely optional based upon the game.\r\n\r\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZsqO8_C9hE0/WTBYTUBt2uI/AAAAAAAAmTQ/TMnrKmRilw0qFkn6Zjqpo02tCfFcT0PaQCLcB/s640/69.png\r\n\r\nIf I had to guess, I&#039;d say a lot of mages will be using {{item:3158}} almost every game again.  The issue here is the massive loss in magic pen that will likely result from this.  Not only will that be 15 less magic pen from the boots, but there will be another 8 magic pen lost from runes (Riot seems deeply against stat-focused runes).  This is a total loss of 23 flat magic penetration.  Overall, mages will lose a ton of damage and build variety with this change.\r\n\r\nThe only way I could see Riot fixing this issue is abandoning this tree idea which is exactly the same as masteries are (really this Rune and Mastery rework seems like a Mastery rework with Runes being simultaneously removed), and allowing players to grab multiple copies of the same rune if they so desire.  This will provide the possibility of 20% CDR from runes again, and keep build variety at least somewhat realistic.  If they still wanted to discourage the stacking of similar runes, they could make some of the secondary effects into &quot;unique passives&quot; for the runes.  For instance, the CDR rune idea they have also provides 2 AP (or some amount of ad) for every % over the cap you go.  They could make that part &quot;unique,&quot; to make stacking less desirable but still an option.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Mages will likely lose a lot of magic penetration and build variety.  Riot could potentially solve this and actually increase build variety if they abandon the skill tree idea, and allow players to stack multiple of the same rune (with perhaps reduced efficiency if they so desire).","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-06-02T22:49:52.491+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't even know what all of the runes are or how many there are.

They specifically told us about that stuff so that we could start discussing it early.\n\nI generally agree with Riot's changes, and have even been called a \"white knight\" on several occasions because I defended things like the jungle plants, so this isn't me just hating everything Riot does.  This is my perfectly legitimate view on their current iteration of the eventual rune system as well as what I would like to see changed about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-06-03T01:02:24.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats fair. But missing ten percent cdr does not actually remove a full offesive build like you have shown. It just makes it slightly less effective as now you only have 40% cdr when you have blue buff. Which should be fairly easy to wear 50% of the time if you arent losing the game pretty hard. And if you are losing the game pretty hard its arguable that you should have gone a more defensive build anyhow.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-06-02T22:53:00.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Automated Riven,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NiHYNH61,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-02T22:49:52.491+0000)\n>\n> ~~You don't~~ Riot doesn't even know what all of the runes are or how many there are.

Things are at the very rough stage, about the only detail Riot has is that they're making these big changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-06-02T23:51:03.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have given some of their ideas for some specific runes and said that they plan on making them into trees (pretty much identical to the current mastery system).\nThey also said \"Please let us know what you think and reach out with any questions you have,\" making me believe they want feedback.\n\nI already asked whether it will be possible to get 20% CDR from the runes, but received no response.  Based upon the information at hand, it appears that the present iteration includes a max of 10% CDR from runes.\n\nFollowing that logical assumption, I thought I would give feedback on how that is likely to impact mages.  I specifically talked about mages as I play them by far the most, giving me a greater understanding of what the rippling impacts of 10% less available CDR outside of items will have.  If they are not yet set upon this system, I want to let them now my own issues with it so they may deal with those in future iterations.  I did not insult Riot or any employees there.  If you read my post without the implied salt of the gameplay boards, you will see that it is constructive criticism of their current plan and my own ideas for solutions to those critiques.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-06-03T01:08:00.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:75}} will become useless. having to wait till level 10 till he has 10%? LOL!!!\nHis only relevance comes from early cdr and stacking well. That same cdr is why he is kinda squishy early. Less defence stats from runes. Something his ult is meant to offset directly.\n\nI know, not a mage. But facing the exact problem, in a big way.","replies":[]}]}
