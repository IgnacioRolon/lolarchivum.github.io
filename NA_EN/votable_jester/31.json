Both nerfs are also massive enough that it could be difficult to tell which nerf isn&#039;t pushing her in the direction they want.\r\n\r\n&gt; Taliyah\r\n&gt; * Mana growth lowered to 50 from 60\r\n&gt; * Base Mana regen lowered to 1.2 from 1.4\r\n&gt; * Mana regen growth lowered to .16 from .17\r\n&gt; * Threaded Volley (Q) no longer deals 50% extra damage to minions.\r\n&gt; * Unraveled Earth (E) trap damage lowered to 80/100/120/140/160 from 80/105/130/155/180\r\n\r\nTaliyah&#039;s nerfs are also fairly immense.  Primarily, the complete removal of the bonus damage to minions with her Q.  While her ability to clear waves won&#039;t be completely destroyed (she can always use her E and W as well) that will cost far more mana and put her in an incredibly vulnerable position.  This will have a dramatic impact on her throughout the entirety of the game.  I could understand reducing it from a 50% bonus to 25% or changing the % bonus to increase with rank, but to remove it completely feels quite drastic to me.\r\n\r\nI personally consider these nerfs to be rather hard on these champions, though I do believe some nerfs to be necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-08-24T06:00:53.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The balance team is correct and they should nerf them both.
