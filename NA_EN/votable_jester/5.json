I have this weird bug where I can&#039;t go to the &quot;my updates&quot; page unless I have around 25-30 &quot;unread&quot; replies.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried to get this fixed, but nothing works, it just redirects me to the boards home page.  Currently with all these hot topics it&#039;s hard to find individual replies to me without the my-updates page, so please help me out.  You can even downvote me if you want, idc.","replies":[]}
