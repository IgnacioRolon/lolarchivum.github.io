Spells that summon spirits involve a slightly longer animation than most other spells\r\n2. Spirit aoe’s are only visible once inside or maybe once spirit is seen\r\n3. Spirits can be attacked, but have x health that acts like Zyra’s plants’ health\r\n4. Spirits grant vision of aoe\r\n\r\n*1. This balances out their long duration, and emphasizes the value of vision control\r\n2. This provides better ambush potential\r\n3. This provides a way to counter the spirits, and possibly check bushes for them.  The health type makes all characters able to kill them without some characters instantly destroying them\r\n4. This provides the decision making process of using the spirits for vision or for their normal effects.*\r\n\r\n**P – Compounding Power**\r\n1. Whenever 1 of his spells reaches max rank, all spells gain some bonus depending on which one(s) is/are maxed\r\n\r\n*1.\tThis provides another level to deciding when to max which abilities, as well as gives a better feeling of significance in the late game*\r\n\r\n**Q – Converge Spirits**\r\n1.\tAll spirits in the vicinity charge target enemy, self destructing, doing X area damage, and causing an additional effect based on spirit type\r\na.\tWhen maxed, reduces cd of all abilities\r\n\r\n*1.\tThis provides some potential damage and stronger effects to potentially turn a fight around\r\na.\tThis makes it easier to replace the destroyed spirits.  It also increases the potential dps of the spell without increasing its burst.*\r\n\r\n**W – Spirit of Protection**\r\n1.\tSpirit grants regenerating shield to ally champions that blocks up to X damage\r\na.\tQ-% reduced damage output by foe\r\nb.\tWhen maxed, increases health and survival duration of spirits\r\n\r\n*1.\tThis creates good siege potential and a safer lane without being overwhelming\r\na.\tGives use to the spirit during a drawn out fight\r\nb.\tThis follows the “shield” idea of the spirit, while also increasing the utility of the other spirit spells and in turn, the Q*\r\n\r\n**E – Spirit of Energy**\r\n1.\tSpirit grants X flat/ % ms buff to allies and inflicts Y flat/ % ms debuff to enemies (Y may or may not be equal to X, I’m undecided)\r\na.\tQ-stronger slow on enemies hit\r\nb.\tWhen maxed, increases aoe of all spells\r\n\r\n\r\n*1.\tThis provides soft cc best for escaping, but not bad for chasing\r\na.\tThis makes the spirit useful after the enemy has left the aoe\r\nb.\tThis increases the utility of all spells without making them overwhelming*\r\n\r\n**R – Raising Spirits**\r\n1.\tSwarms of spirits break through the ground in an area, knocking up and damaging foes for X damage\r\na.\tAoe grows over the duration\r\nb.\tWhen maxed\r\ni.\tIncreases range on Q\r\nii.\tIncreases number of spirits available from W and E\r\niii.\tIncreases the duration of the ult\r\n\r\n*1.\tThis provides hard cc effective for teamfights, escapes, and ambushes\r\na.\tThis gives it a greater team fight presence, and makes it better for cutting off routes\r\nb.\tThis follows the idea of numerous spirits\r\ni.\tMore spirits could chase after an enemy\r\nii.\tMore spirits means increases aoe and vision\r\niii.\tIncreased duration increases the capability of cutting off paths as well as increases the final size of the swarm*","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2015-01-15T18:47:11.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you down-vote this, please tell me what needs to be changed about him.
