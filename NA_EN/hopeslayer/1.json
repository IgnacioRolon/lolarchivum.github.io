(just look at his weird arms for example)\n\nWhen you look at the Twitch remodel, Sion remodel,  Trist remodel, Heimer remodel. Karthus remodel (Trundle was more of just a pointless lore change to recolor him and Sejuani was just to put clothes on her)\n\nThe quality difference from old to remodel is about the same as default Udyr and Spirit Guard Udyr **as their new default skins**. (Twitch, Sion and Heimer being the most noticeable)\n\nYet people had to pay $20-30 to get the quality on par with new champs/remodels.\n\nAnother big deal with the Spirit Guard Udyr was that he had new emotes and interactions, but these remodels/reworks also say different things when you buy different items too.\n\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:77}} {{item:3070}} \n\nPulsefire Ezreal completely changed his look with a new suit and everything, and PFE was the first awhile ago so it gets some slack in comparison to DJ Sona\n\nI don't even play Udyr, I just think that DJ Sona makes Spirit Guard Udyr look so not worth the money in comparison.\n\nAfter DJ Sona, the Spirit Guard Udyr skin should have been a rework, or a Legendary quality (1820 rp) skin at best. Dunkmaster Darius is more deserving of Ultimate status then Spirit Guard Udyr\n\n\n*Edit : the new Definitely not Udyr skin is a bigger character change then SGU, and its better looking.*","replies":[{"poster":"THE GREAT SLOTH","date":"2015-03-04T06:07:11.313+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah… His classic skin looks completely awful. \n\nI'm pretty sure this is how Spirit Guard Udyr happened:\n\n**Riot**: \"How's the visual update on Udyr coming along?\"\n\n**Visual Update Guy**: \"Going great!

It almost hurts to look at in comparison to SGU. I would never buy SGU though because I think it's extremely overpriced and because I agree with you, it SHOULD have been his visual rework. That was my first impression of the skin a year and a half ago when it came out, and my opinion of it hasn't changed.\n\nIMO it's a pretty damn cool skin, but absolutely not worthy of the price tag for the reasons I mentioned above.

Needless to say, I bought it the hour the skin was released. I was content with my purchase and it did feel a lot like an Ultimate skin.\n\nBut lately, I've been thinking the same thing. With the Sion re-release in particular, SGU doesn't feel all that Ultimate anymore. PSE looks more like Ezreal 2.0, and DJ Sona is DJ freaking Sona. SGU just feels like what Udyr should already be.\n\nI still don't regret the purchase though. I love the skin, and on the rare game that I still play Udyr I still enjoy what the skin offers. Ultimately, pun intended, I just hope the Ultimate skins retain DJ Sona's quality here on out, if not better.\n\nAnd yeah, 20 bucks is a lot for some pixels, but I regret paying 60 bucks for COD way back in the day a lot more than I'll ever regret spending money on League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"femmé","date":"2015-03-04T04:36:53.844+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're not going to update udyr because everyone wants to be fucking trick2g so they buy the skin and make tons of money for rito.

What's not fine is the quality of the model. Think about Heimer; his update didn't change him the way that Sion's did, or even Twitch. If Udyr gets upgraded it will be an improvement to the model and textures, but it wont be a re-design of his visuals at all. He'll still be wearing a bear as a hat, he'll still have the big arms and he'll still punch things.
