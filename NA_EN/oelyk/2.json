It used to be that Talon was the assassin with the most reliable dive, because of the instant damage+silence. And then he lost silence, but he still had very quick damage on a cooldown that's decently short. And then they gutted his ult CD, but his E still make him really great at slipping into teamfights to deal big AoE damage. Now, with this rework, they've taken away his 350 base movespeed, doubled the time it takes him to burst, absolutely neutered his dive, AND halved his AoE. Now, he has to rely heavily on out-visioning the enemy team and waiting out every single CC to get into teamfights without being blown up before he even lands on the other side of the wall. Talon doesn't need number buffs, or OP items. He needs to be sped up again, and that's all there is to it.
