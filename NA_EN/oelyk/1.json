Because it's not. Clicking on it yields the force quit option which only appears if it can't be quit normally.\n\nI don't really know what the new patch did but it worked before, now? Not so much.\n\nI should probably submit a ticket but I can't think of anything that changed on my end, while the new patch did come out and it stopped working, mysteriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T02:29:56.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The other League client that wouldn't open may have been the outdated launcher icon.
