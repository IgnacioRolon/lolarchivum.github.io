I'm not promoting a Call of Duty style game for League. I'm also not promoting that getting a lot of kills should be rewarded. I'm referring to players who continuously average a high number of deaths, win or lose. In my opinion, I consider 12-15 deaths in 5 out of 10 of your last played Ranked games as high. I understand deaths to be mistakes. Dying a lot means you are making mistakes. Every player has the option to back and revive health or simply run to avoid death.**\n\nAfter a total of 952 Ranked Games of experience, I'm still trying to better understand how the matchmaking system determines the skill level of players if they are using the other players ELO to balance out the team's average MMR, which seems to be codependent. I have issued player tickets to Riot as an effort to gain a better understanding. In response, Riot employees refuse to release certain information regarding matchmaking. I've had a concern with Riot's matchmaking not including each player's K/D/A as a reflection of play or skill. I believe with a few c.hanges, matchmaking and skill levels could possibly be more accurate and also promote team play.\n\n1.) For example, if a player is consistently destroying objectives in Ranked games, the players attack the objective should receive more LP gain accordingly, regardless if the player wins or loses. This will encourage and reward players for destroying objectives over chasing kills, which I feel lower tier players don't fully understand (possibly because of Riot's League of Legends tutorial not elaborating on this in team play). Many of the players who join league will be solo, therefore the \"team\" aspect of the game can be easily overlooked or overwhelming.\n\n2.) Kill/Deaths/Assists should be considered when matchmaking to better even out the matchmaking in games. Quantifying the kills, deaths, and assists will allow Riot's matchmaking system to better gauge how well players are currently playing, if players are intentionally feeding, or if a player is trolling. By utilizing player's kills, deaths, and assists across their last 5-10 Ranked games, Riot would be more equip to gauge if a player is unskilled or feeding in games. Although an unskilled or non-communicative player may die often (if not more frequently than an intentionally feeder), matchmaking would use this new information to either put him with a lesser skill team or reduce his ELO/MMR. Currently, it is my understanding that Riot's matchmaking system simply puts the poor or unskilled players with players who die less in the same ELO as an attempt to keep wins at 55%.\n\n3.) The whole concept of the \"55% win ratio\" balancing act should not exist and is detrimental to improvement, specifically in lower tiers. If a player is improving or trying to improve, it is ineffective to intentionally match a player on a win streak with players who are on a losing streak. This concept completely negates the attempt of \"balanced matchmaking.\"\n\n4.) I want to address feeding and trolling specifically. I have seen this concept mentioned on the League of Legends Boards/Forums a few time and though the idea of a grouping feeders together would be effective to some degree. I believe the Leavebuster attempts to eliminate reduce the number of disconnects in Ranked games, however I think it could be improved. If a player is intentionally feeding, trolling, or continuously losing games that the matchmaking system gauges as a possible win, said player should either lose more LP than the players who stayed in game and fought it out or be placed with players who also have a high (or increasing) Leaver points.\n\n5.) It is my understanding that Ranked wins are considered in matchmaking. However, I haven't experience the system being accurate in doing so. I play often and currently have 450 Ranked wins. I am often matched with multiple players who have under 200 Ranked wins and/or close to a 48% win ratio. To be specific, I have been matched with players who have 25 or 35 wins more often than it should happen, if matchmaking is truly focused on \"balanced matchmaking.\"\n\n**If you read this post, please click \"yes\" or \"no\" on the poll.
