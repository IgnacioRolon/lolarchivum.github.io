After checking with my peeps over in EU, they let me know that a majority of these cases that they've already investigated actually got their capsules after a small delay, so do me a favor and wait a few hours to see if it comes through. \n\nIf you don't see it later tonight or tomorrow, please go ahead shoot your EU agents a ticket for them to manually look into your missing capsule!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-15T00:35:34.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on a previous similar thread, it sounds like EUW capsules are being delayed for some odd reason. People are getting them after a few hours delay. Broporo suggested that you'd wait and see if it arrives, and if it doesn't within 12 hours, to send in a ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Ineba RHZ","date":"2018-01-15T21:04:17.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I leveled up today (to lvl 49) and didn't receive any capsule (NA server).","replies":[]}]}]}
