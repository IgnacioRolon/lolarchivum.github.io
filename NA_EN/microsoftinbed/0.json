The error you’re getting may be due to missing assets it can no longer locate.  I recommend grabbing our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and restoring your client to a fresh slate.  It’s important to let the patcher continue to scan unless you are getting any errors, and that duration may differ on each PC.  Closing it out can cause it to restart completely and rescan every file for corruption.  I hope that helps clear things up.","replies":[]}]}
