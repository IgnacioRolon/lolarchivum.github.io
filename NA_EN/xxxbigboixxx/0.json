Every other game is just fine when i try to play. Other people in my game will say they are having ping issues to; and sometimes i cant even join the game without disconnecting. I have tried setting the priority to high on the task bar, which didn't work. I try using the old client, which also didn't work. The game used to run perfectly fine 19ms and below almost all the time. my FPS is fine, sitting at 50-60 range. I was just wondering if anyone else is having issues with their ping. To add, I have Comcast internet, but is works completely fine with other games.","replies":[{"poster":"FearNLoathing","date":"2016-12-19T07:03:56.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a massive issue that is happening to large quantities of players.  I would not know the statistical amount, but I can say about 1/4 of my friends list is encountering this issue, myself included.  I will say that the issue of causation here does not lie at the feet of the individual player (or ISP) but on Riot's end, or it was the cause of a bugged patch release of theirs.\n\nIn terms of my own game play being affected, I will be in a game with 120+ fps and a standard ping of 24ms.  About once every minute or so, my screen will pause for a couple seconds without showing the movements of anything (although my commands will still register and the health bars will still update correctly).  My ping will occasionally show itself jumping up to 500, 1000, or 2000+ ms while this occurs but most of the time my ping remains under 100ms during the spikes.  This is borderline unplayable.  I have never once encountered such an issue until recently.  None of the other games I play are affected by the spikes, which means LoL is the sole victim.\n\nI cannot recall this occurring until a patch (6.22 I think) that required me to \"repair\" my client yet the repair did not work and went on a loop for hours.  Eventually Riot released a hotfix for the patch that fixed the repair fiasco, but I believe something between my client attempting to repair itself and the hotfix really caused significant damage.  I have found a page or two about reinstalling Adobe Air to make sure it is up to date and then proceeding to reinstall LoL entirely.  I have not proceeded to the reinstalling LoL part, but I can say that when I went to reinstall Adobe Air, I found it was simply non existent on my computer.  Upon installing Adobe Air, the interval between lag spikes increased thereby making the game slightly more playable.  I may try the reinstalling part shortly.  If I do, I will update my post here.  \n\nThis is still a major issue that needs fixed, perhaps with a pinned post by a Riot representative on how to go about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T18:43:28.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though your connection is tight with other networks, you can still have issues specifically connecting to the game server.
