Other servers and websites im pinging/playing to are giving me 0% packet loss. This happened recently in the latest patch. Sometime i would be right clicking and it shows the click in game but the champ doesn't move. Then it would go back to normal. Ping is showing normal 16ms consistently. Any help would be great.
