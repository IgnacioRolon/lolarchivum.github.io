Even in this story we see a constant \"I can't\", Udyr couldn't control the influx of voices all around him, the maddening cacophony, as much as he couldn't convince Sejuani not to summon the Lost Ones nor could he resist the powerfull influence of The Volibear. Its when Sejuani is close that Udyr surpass his limits and goes from \"I can't\" to \"but I must\", not for himself, but for his daughter's sake.\n\nFor me, the most exciting moments were both times that he confronted Volibear, as Udyr went even beyond and transformed the \"but I must\" into \"I will\", with a clear mind and a will of steel even when facing death itself in the form of a bear\n\nThis story was incredibly well written and at least in my opinion, its one of the best Lore pieces I've ever read, congratulations to the Lore Team for such success","replies":[]},{"poster":"The NA Ogre","date":"2019-02-20T14:01:55.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, i just wanted to ask if Udyr was indeed shapeshifting through the story (like in that last moment where he goes through all the spirits) or if it was simply him taking in the spirits' power/mind and assuming it for himself (like the moment with the wolfhound at the very begginning).
