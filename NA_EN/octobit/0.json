We have become really good friends over the years. He wanted a vacation so he drove 14 hours to visit me. I barely hear of these things actually happening. It is normally &quot;Yeah we should meet up sometime.&quot; but it never happens. I am surprised he has showed up and it has been a lot of fun hanging with him IRL.\n\nI just wanted to make a forum post saying gaming friends are real friends for anyone that doubts it. I doubt my friend will read this post but I am happy he took the trip and I&#039;ll be sad when he leaves.","replies":[]}
