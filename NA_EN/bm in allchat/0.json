However I'm a platinum Galio main that would like PBE access for his upcoming rework. I know you're supposed to just apply and hope you get accepted. However, on the application page for PBE it says Riot will offer PBE access to people who main champions similar to those they're about to release, using Leona and Taric as examples. \r\n\r\nI'm posting to ask for a Rioter to manually give me access to the PBE, as I've played as much Galio as just about anyone in North America. I get asked about his graphics and skins after almost every game I play with him through a \"random\" survey from Riot in the postgame screen. Therefore I think it's more than fair that I'm granted PBE access as I am well equipped to test my favorite champion in his new state","replies":[{"poster":"TMF Revilo","date":"2017-03-08T11:48:05.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if they get people in PBE that actually played the old Galio they might get negative feedback.\nIt's best that they just have people who've never played him and won't miss the old Galio so they can think it's a well received rework\n\n- Salty Galio One-Trick Player :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gali√∂","date":"2017-03-05T03:18:03.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eyyy i already posted something similar to this =p","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-04T21:55:57.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, welcome to the boards!  I appreciate your prowess as a Galio main and interest in the PBE!  I don't have visibility on what will be tested on the PBE, so I'm not sure if Galio or anything will be presented unless announced on the [PBE Boards](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/).  \n\nWe actually aren't able to force, expedite, or manually create PBE accounts.  We aren't able to guarantee it, and don't have info on how to get selected beyond our[ PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ).
