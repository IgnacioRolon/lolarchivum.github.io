I'm an ADC main and I do play top, mid, and support I'm getting better at. But I literally dread the jungle, because I have little pathing awareness and camp clearing times as a jungle. Don't get me wrong, I'm aware of these things while in lane and taking the enemy and teammate jungler into account, but not trying to play jungle.\r\nPoint being, I don't believe it is right to have in draft mode/ranked, your primary and secondary roles. Yet still get autofilled into a role which you have near NO decent experience. It is not fair to me, to need to dodge-lose LP, risk leaver buster. Just because I wish not to play jungle and didn't select that or fill. Of course I understand that autofill may be activated, but RIOT?!? isn't there a way to adjust the algorithm to ensure that players who have their 1st/2nd roles get placed into games where one of which is available, or at least that their match history shows they have played?\r\n\r\nIf you queue with other people, it wont let you start without a certain range of roles being filled, so why not have those all covered before a game being started? hmm...\r\n\r\nAnyone else find themselves being autofilled more often into roles not played, even on rotation?","replies":[{"poster":"BestGmers","date":"2019-03-10T18:53:49.986+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't usually get auto filled but when I do I dodge. I simply DO NOT WANT TO PLAY SUPPORT why won't you give me jungle or mid lane? Just support NOTHING ELSE it's a  really dumb thing.

Nothing you learn as a laner caries over to Jungling, meaning you've basically got to learn an entirely new game in order to Jungle. \n\nAdd to that how often it changes. Turret Plating is the only change to laning early game in how many years? Compared to how often jungle camp XP/Damage/Health/Buffs change in a 1 or 2 year time frame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lo4ding","date":"2019-03-11T13:19:05.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"because it is not possible to be \"afk\" 20-30 min in jungle and then wreck everybody with 2 levels and 100 cs ahead. This was a thing in previous seasons until riot started nerfing this playstyle in season 6 i think. To be honest. In my opinion, jungle as it is today is best jungle that have ever been. You can be pair on CS with other lanes without problem and its all about your opponent jungler. Counter-jungling, counter-ganging and punishing enemy jungler for their decisions is the way of current jungle. But its hard and you need to have some game knowledge to do so. Thats why a lot of people (mostly in lower elo) are bashing todays jungle because they make their camp rotation and then they have \"nothing to do\" if other lanes are pushed which causes them falling behind.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2019-03-10T23:46:49.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And on the other side of that, I hate having an autofilled jungle on my team.
