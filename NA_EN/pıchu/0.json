Do you have those ping spikes without so much going on at once?\n\nIf you have those kinds of spikes constantly, make sure your network is able to get a solid connection with our servers first since those random disconnects mean your network keeps droppings its link with us entirely.

I'll look up the connection guide and try everything in there but yeah it can happen while streaming, while not streaming, sometimes I'm not even running anything in the background.","replies":[]}]}]}
