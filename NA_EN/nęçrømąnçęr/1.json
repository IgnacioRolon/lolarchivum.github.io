Since then,  we have been growing up with Chromas! We are still learning and growing now. Thus, what does the future entails is still a mystery to even ourselves!\n\nTo answer your questions: \n\n- Most likely not all skins will have Chromas. Sometimes color options just doesn't make sense! \n- We will more likely focus on newer skins when it comes to Chromas.\n- The team haven't thought about rework champions, however, this is something that is on our radar!","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2018-04-18T03:46:09.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would chromas for Assassin Master Yi be possible?
