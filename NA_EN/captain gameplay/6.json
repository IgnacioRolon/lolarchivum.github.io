I have played Moba's for 5 years, and developed/lead the design and balance on two separate Indie Mobas ([Rise Of Amon](https://www.youtube.com/user/RiseofAmon?&ab_channel=RiseOfAmonOfficialChannel), [Aeon Of Storms/Storm Of The Imperial Sanctum](http://www.aeonofstorms.com/). This thread is meant to serve as my own take on Game and Champion Design, which I will try to keep relevant to the latest patch. As always, I'm open to any and all discussion and criticism.\n\n*Current Patch 5.4*\n**Game Design Overview**\n\nFor this patch's Design Overview, lets talk jungle. With the 5.4 Patch, there was a huge outcry about jungle changes and direction. Why don't we back up a bit and look at what exactly the jungle should be about, and what separates it from lanes.\n\nThe jungle should be essentially a higher risk area with great diversity compared to the safety and role definition of laning - where towers and friendly minions helping you out, and your general location on the map dictates what you should be doing (ie, mid roams, etc). The jungle should be the very scare areas in the map where you fight over vision and and try to predict your opponents movements and actions, and anything goes. Note, *none* of these design goals preclude any specific role! It is not necessarily a \"place for tanks\", a \"place for gankers\", or \"a place for carries\" - it can be all three, and more. However, each of these roles need *specific catering* in order to be viable. This is why we currently see a meta where one role is favored so highly over others - at the moment bruiser/fighter junglers like RekSai, Vi, J4, and Lee. How do we solve this issue? \n\nOne possible solution is to create greater diversity in jungle camps. Riot has begun this already, with the varied smite buffs - but it can and should be taken further. Lets direct our attention to this quick [Jungle Datatable](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-NoSesqcgP2KN1owSg8gqT0kXE8ieeNhlVo7MBOo4w0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nBased on each camp's stats, I've come up with 4 main stats: \n\nDifficulty Score - the DPS*[Averaged Effective Health] of the camp/10000. This should serve as an estimate of how hard it is to take the camp. The 10000 Denominator is arbitrary, and just makes the numbers more legible.\n\nBounty/Exp\n\nBounty/Difficulty Score\n\nExp/Difficulty Score\n\nSo you may be asking what the purpose of each of these stats are, and how we can use them for improving the jungle's design:\n\nBy adjusting these ratios, we can diversify jungle camps to allow for multiple roles - who each need different things from the jungle. \n\nFor example, it doesn't make sense that the Raptor camp, which grants a buff that allows you to make aggressive invasions - also has the highest difficulty scores outside of Red and Blue. How can you play aggressively when you are at your weakest? Instead, it should grant a *below average bounty/dif*, *average exp/dif,* and have a *below average difficulty score*. This means that the camp can be taken quickly by all junglers, but is only worth taking from a bounty perspective if you then utilize the buff successfully - meaning invading, ganking, or otherwise establishing map control. Thus the raptor camp is now a favorite of the counter-jungler/early ganker -> granting enough experience to not be behind exp wise, while still being easy enough to kill that you are quite healthy and ready to fully utilize the buff it grants.\n\nAnother possible tweak -> Lets examine a carry jungler who scales better with Gold than Exp who should be weaker early game due to his scaling. The wolf camp already grants a very powerful defensive \"ward\", yet for some reason is also one of the weakest camps. It would make more sense for it to have an *above average Difficulty*, *above average Bounty/Diff*, and *below average Exp/Diff*. Thus it is risky for the jungle to take this camp, but it grants him lots of gold and some defense against invasion.\n\nBy better defining each jungle camp, we can foster a much more role diverse jungle.\n\n*Current Patch 5.4*\n**Direct Tweaks**\nThis section is not necessarily connected with the Game Design Overview, and is more of a \"random concepts\" kind of thing.\n\nFor the most part, I feel most champions are not generally considered viable due to meta rather than any significant imbalance. Outside of those champions, these are individual champion tweaks that I feel would be interesting, and do not necessarily have anything to do with game design. This is not a complete compilation.\n\n**Aatrox**\nW - Slight Rework -> Healing changed from 1-3x at 50% break point to 0-400%, depending on his current Health. Just a finer resolution\nR - Slight Rework -> Deals 10/15/20% Target Current Health as Magic Damage to all enemies in 500 radius, granting 30% Weapon Speed for Each Enemy Champion hit, up to 120%. Aatrox also gains 175 Weapon Range. Lasts 12 seconds.\n\nHigher resolution on W just allows more leeway.\nR Change fits his theme from his Heroic Passive/Q/W and lore -> turning fights around when all hope seems lost. It will make him weaker as a 1v1, but much stronger in team fights - especially *losing* team fights - helping with one of the primary issues Melee AA Heroes face (snowball one way or the other too hard).\n\n**Brand**\nR - Rework -> Fires a giant ball of fire at the target. After impact, the fireball attempts to bounce back to Brand (similar to say, Gnar Q). If Brand catches it, he cooldown is lowered by 75% and half the mana cost is refunded. Hitting a enemy currently Ablaze grants Brand a movespeed buff for a short duration. \n\nBrand thematically/Heroic Passive...ly is a mage who wants to \"burn\" down enemies, not blow them up. This change would give him slightly less burst, remove the RN Jesus, and give him a reliable way to re-proc his Heroic Passive - assuming he can position well enough to catch the fireball - offering a more compelling gameplay aspect. Brand would need to catch his ult multiple times in a fight to reach even damage with his old ult, but masterful brand players could even exceed the old ult's damage.\n\n**Fiora**\nQ - Can no longer dash twice\nW - Successful parry now refreshes Q CD and immediately grants Fiora her E (without putting it on CD)\nE - No longer resets on Hero Kill/Assist\nR - Reworked -> For the next 2/2.66/3.33 seconds, Fiora becomes immune to all CC. During this time, she cannot attack, move, or use abilities (except W). Instead, every .66 seconds, she dashes 300 Units in the direction of the Player's Cursor, dealing Physical Damage to all enemies she passes through. \n\nFiora's unique kit aspects are her W and R. Thus it makes sense to push more of her power into her W - adding significant skill leeway in her kit, allowing her balance to be a lot more lax. R, from a game design perspective, is fairly terrible - another RN Jesus press to (hopefully) win does not offer compelling gameplay nor does it give much leeway for the rest of her kit. The only thing that makes her Omnislash appealing is how it looks visually. So why not just allow the player to control it? Personally I think that would feel awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathnor","date":"2015-02-27T04:30:25.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"i dont agree. not even a little bit. you are right on meta junglers overall. their are quite a few more viable ones but is the case with any competitive game things work out in orders of magnitude meaning someone is always at the top. or more a certain play style .\n\ni feel the problem is in base design. overall the problem with the jungle does not lie in champions themselves. it falls into overall design. its the same problem you see with flash imo. i think before i go over what i feel problems are overall a little precursor to why i feel this way might be in order. \n\nive been playing right after release. the problem is for whatever reason 0 CS supports and junglers, although not new concepts to the genre were not present in the overall design. it was months before WW stepped into the jungle and a lot longer for 0 cs support to become a thing. i recall when WW was the only jungler and both teams picked him. hell i remember when no one jungled at all. i feel the problem was one not addressed in the original design and they havent updated base functions to reflect either role yet.\n\nthe first major problem is smite. actually more then anything else its always been the core problem. summoners were made to enhance strategic choice. it was not their to shoehorn, gate, or even allow a certain play style but to enhance it. however the challenge has always been how do we gate the jungle with smite and have it work for many different play styles from mages, to bruisers, or tanks, perhaps assassins, sometimes supports, or even duelists. the truth is each plays so very differently that a singular summoner spell cant and doesnt encompass them all equally.\n\noverall i dont have a good option that doesnt expound the issue further by adding a new gate without the flat out removal of it. you could make smite a active off of jungler items. you could try and gate it threw a multi talent. more on this further down at point 4. or you could keep the enchants and just ditch the summoner.\n\nthe second major fault was in the jungle its self. you slightly hit upon this point but i plan to expand on it. where is the monster with a crap ton of armor and very weak to magic damage? where is the camp with of guys with middle HP levels even the big monster  with out a overload of HP but high armor for magic damage aoe junglers? take for example you choice of calling out raptor camp. they make it high damage to avoid mid laners over farming it.\n\nbut i ask you how is that the answer? its purpose is more a duelist invade type buff. alter it to a single monster with high MR. of course you still have outliers like zed but i think its going to be impossible to make it competitive and tailor different camps to different weakness with out some overflow from lanes. which FYI already happens even with the way they altered it. but you talior the red side to pysical. you talior the blue side to magical. suddenly a champion like Vi plays very differently as she is automatically weak to half the jungle. maybe push the wolf camps opposite wall side out and link another pack of wolves. maybe 4 more little wolfs with both sides liked and having pretty good armor. of course overall numbers from health to damage would have to be altered but again the jungle becomes multi tiered to various play styles. you can even ignore everything i said and retailor it as you please. as long as the jungle is built where different champions have different strengths and weaknesses to different styles it will work out better. do i take the extra damage and semi waste time to farm those camps that are much harder or do i attempt to make a impact on the lanes?\n\ni think this is actually the key. we are on jungle 4.0 (or is it 5.0 i forget) and each time they alter the whole jungle but do it so that the whole jungle reflects a new idea. they should have mixed and matched from several versions and expanded on it more. this would even allow a option of a double jungle meta which might need some tailoring overall but the problem is again at the core of the game not the champions themselves.\n\nthe third problem is machete. they seem to have come to a understanding that multiple paths are needed in terms of itemization. so why is it that a Vi uses the exact same start as fiddle? does you support thresh start the same thing as a janna support? the branching for different roles, aka play styles, needs to be tailored out the gate. again they try to solve a multi tiered problem with a single thing.\n\nits real simple. you make upgradeable dorans or machete version items for the jungle. maybe even alter build paths to where each can build into all the items and later all the enchants. or if you dont want everyone taking a tank version for extra sustain and maybe more defensive stats you shift it to 2 items choices (would require not just new base items but new upgrades) from the original and from their they all can make the enchants. which really should just be a active and not a summoner.\n\nthe fourth problem is masteries and runes. you want the same stats for the jungle no matter which champions play style you are using. however if you alter the jungle as stated very little has to be done as each jungler should build differently as their role and strategy to attempt to tame the jungle should be vastly different. \n\nhowever bladed armor might need need to become true damage and maybe a T1 talent while butcher might get a true damage extra vs monsters and a support version as well. of course bot laners can take advatage of butcher but they are already taking camps anyways so its less of a effect then one might think. also with a junglers easily viable camps being cut in half stealing some of those camps might hurt your jungler a LOT. overall masteries are still kinda a mess imo but this isnt that topics aim. also 3 21 point talents that each have a smite that acts slightly different might be a way to still gate with smite but tailor it for different roles. the offensive tree might have a slight advantage to keeping your health up in order to go out to gank, the defensive tree a smite with a slight increase in damage in order to be able to beat camps easier with less damage taken, and the support tree gives a smite a slight increase in gold. overall i would think with other over arching changes smite could be phased out or into the the smite enchants themselves as a active right off the item. again if you dont want junglers ending up with all talents push them to 16s in the tree. or maybe 11s so if they chose to diversify they can take 2 of them but not specialize deeper into a mastery tree.\n\nof course your still going to have outliers but with a few patches the jungle should be pretty smooth and you can alter kits on problematic champions at that point. \n\nTLDR riot seems to use single items/spells/jungle design to fit all types of junglers rather then talioring them to each play style.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Gameplay","date":"2015-02-27T04:59:38.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit: This comment was made prior to employment\n\nI don't disagree with any of your 4 points - in fact I think they mostly line up with my own thread. I may have been unclear on certain things.\n\nI definitely believe that each jungle camp needs to be diversified so that different junglers think about them differently - this is why I including the 4 different metrics, as well as effective health (though the focus was not on this specifically).\n\nAs far as jungle itemization, runes, and masteries are concerned, I don't think any of these should necessarily be aimed towards specifically jungling. In any other role, you don't gear runes and masteries towards killing lane creeps - thats boring. The emphasis should not be on PvE, it should be PvP. Similarly in the jungle, your items, runes, and masteries should not be about killing jungle camps, it should be about fulfilling your role, whatever you believe that to be. \n\nReally, the TRUE design purpose of Runes and Masteries is to smooth out champion vs champion interactions. It grants customizable leeway for punishing matchups to, well, not be so punishing! This is the philosophy I took when designing RoA's jungle (A map where there is one central, giant jungle with two lanes - running along the circumference), and play testing showed not only were multiple roles viable in the jungle - even having multiple junglers was viable. Depending on how the other team chose to play and comp, we had anywhere from one to THREE junglers per team. Guess what - there was not a single item in that game with an ability/attribute specific to jungle monsters. Similarly, while we had an analogy to Smite, which we called Rend, it did not do flat true damage. Instead, it did % Current HP true damage to non-champions, and increased the bounty of the unit by a sizable amount. Thus it was no longer the exclusive duty of whoever had Rend to secure buffs/objectives - nor was it even exclusively utilized on the jungler! For example, a support/carry lane could opt into Rend, for faster farming, because the Rended creep would grant bonus bounty to the killer, not the Rend user. So when you chose to take Rend, it didn't feel like \"Because I'm the jungler, I have to give up X/Y/Z to take Rend instead\", it felt like \"I'd rather have Rend over X/Y/Z because I think it will be better this game\". However, I chose not to include this in the original post because it would probably require significant changes to LoL's map layout, which I assume is largely out of the picture.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathnor","date":"2015-02-27T05:52:53.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can see where your thoughts line up with a similar goal. i guess i should have more touched on why i disagreed rather then just ideas.\n\ni dont think it can be tweeked into place. i think your looking at a whole new jungle from monsters, to map layout, to items, to summoners to correctly balance it. again i think point 4 clears itself up once the overarching problems are taken care of. \n\nthe problem is that for some time riot has (outside of champions) tried to simplify everything. which is smart overall. people generally dont care for super complex as it adds a whole lot of burden of knowledge that really detracts from the game play itself. but the champions are just far to varied and complex for a single jungle approach to really work for all the styles.\n\nanyways thats my 2 cents on it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-02-27T04:21:46.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Brand what if instead instead of refreshing his ult's cooldown it halves the current cooldown of any of his abilities that are on cooldown.
