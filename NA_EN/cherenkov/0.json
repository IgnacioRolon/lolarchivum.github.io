I would suggest checking on your [firewall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3) first and making sure everything is squared away there.\n\nIf fixing your firewall doesn't help, switching to a public DNS or flushing your DNS could also help fix your Error Code issue, which is also found in the [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5).\n\nThose two steps usually help fix that issue! If you're still seeing that Error Code message pop up, let's see if our Tech team can help out [in a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nKeep me posted on what happens, and hopefully things get fixed soon! :D","replies":[]}]}
