Hope you all had a wonderful Christmas break and happy new year.\r\n\r\nOk so we all know Cassiopeia. The sexy, sassy, and strong reptile lady. Lately she has fallen on hard times with the rework and some nerfs. But so far nothing has been happening. She has been neglected and hasn&#039;t had any attention. She hasn&#039;t had a skin for 3 years for crying out loud. But here is the question. Why is she being ignored. The answer is the Cassiopeia fanbase doesn&#039;t have a voice. Just like how Morde has Malicious Metal and how many popular champ fanbases have multiple voices, us, the Cassiopeia fans don&#039;t have a strong and demanding voice. We need a voice that will demand justice and bring back our beloved snake lady. \r\n\r\nOverall all I want to thank you for taking time out of your day and reading this post. May you have a wonderful day.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2016-01-04T21:57:30.909+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"we complain a lot....to be honest...riot just choses to ignore us.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2016-01-04T18:19:40.387+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you open two windows on your browser, both with boards loaded.\n\nIn one window search \"Stashu\"\n\nIn the other search \"Cassiopeia\"\n\nThe closer you get to the rework, the more voices you see, but they were all ignored, and over time, just gave up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nagma","date":"2016-01-06T05:21:30.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"we got this guy ... canastus if he could spam more maybe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2016-01-04T19:04:51.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure those 2 guys post a Cass thread once or twice a week.
