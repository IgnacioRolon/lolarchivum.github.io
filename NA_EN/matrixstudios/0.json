Varus available early on free champ rotation!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend just started playing League of Legends last Sunday (September 18th, 2016), and he played {{champion:110}} (Varus, the Arrow of Retribution). Now, I'm only level 10 so I can't name every champ by memory, but I have a level 30 veteran friend, and he tells me that the free champion rotation changes every week. He says that the new champ rotation is announced on Monday of the new week, and those free champs are available on Tuesday. Is this true?\r\n\r\nIf it is, then I don't know how my friend played Varus. Varus is in the free rotation this week, and he became available yesterday, (Tuesday, September 20th 2016). If Varus started being available on Tuesday, then how did my friend play him on Sunday? I asked him, and he said he doesn't know. He didn't buy it, so how did he play Varus? \r\n\r\nPLEASE TELL ME!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-21T16:23:41.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Newer accounts do not unlock the free champion rotation until level 6.
