People hate me, people don&#039;t want to be around me. I push others away with all my despair, my tear will dry but I will never be able to forget. Just how insignificant I am...\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}} \r\n\r\nOnce I was surrounded by allies I called my friends, it was just a group that I wandered into. Now they are gone and its been so long since i last saw them.... I&#039;ve never seen them irl but they were the best friends I&#039;ve ever had...\r\n\r\nEven when i beg them,  they still do not come back, they&#039;ve moved on and I can&#039;t... I could never and its because I love this game... I won&#039;t just leave, but no one irl will give me the time of day and enjoy it with me. I just want to hid in my corner. I&#039;ve been without friends for more then a while, I won&#039;t tell you how long or i will surely cry more... \r\n\r\nAll I wanted was a person to love, I got that but now the jokes on us and its only him, a cat and myself... He lost his friends over time they stopped wanting to talk to him, none of them made effort and soon lack of talking weekly turned into monthly and now we are alone.\r\n\r\nI love this game, but I want people to love aswell. It may not happen no matter the distance i&#039;d traverse in elo. It&#039;s saddening to think about, and it still won&#039;t stop me. I will still cry everyday however.... All I ever wanted was real friends... People that talk as much as I do, people that respect my ideas, thoughts and opinions. People that understand I get mad sometimes but won&#039;t just forsaken me. People that can talk to me and say goodbye, or atleast hi..... All I have now is players i found in this game and I will grow old one day with no one.... Odd&#039;s are poptart will die of old age first and it will leave me... senile and old... alone... until i never wake up because i&#039;m 103 somehow and deep down i just gave up. \r\n\r\nI love this game.... But at this moment... All I feel like is {{champion:32}} ... And one day.. I&#039;ll just fade away forever. No one will remember, no one will care and since all I do is league (which i&#039;m ok with) i won&#039;t leave much of a mark...\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t even have people at work who&#039;d talk with me about things I enjoy, they just smile and tell me everything wrong with their day and they don&#039;t even want to listen to me.. No one does and when they do they have nothing to say back. The ones that do fade with time and I just get left behind in their soul journey... \r\n\r\nPoptart Kittenz is all I have now, good thing he&#039;s irl..... My family forsaken me and assumes i&#039;m dead... No one will play this game with me irl. No one converts to this game for me. I will just cry and be sad forever playing the game spending money on it trying to make myself feel good inside.... So if you wonder why I feel mad sometimes, its because when I&#039;m out of this game.. My time is shortening everyday and I am 23 years old... I&#039;ve tried and waited and attempted for 13 years and no one full fills my dream of having someone that would cling onto me and care.. Someone who talks to me and wants to be apart of my everyday life, helps me improve as a person.... I just have 1 person, he&#039;s the love of my life but thats all I deserve I guess... (I have some ppl on the game that try their best but when things get down to the reality of it.. their irl life comes up, they are needed, I see no one irl, I see them only for the games they stick around for, they are all I have left.... and even then its easy to forget they care when i walk away from the game irl. They can&#039;t just come visit me irl, they can&#039;t hug me when I&#039;m down, they can&#039;t give me the attention they&#039;d want to and I need irl to really understand if they give a damn.... And even then there is always doubt in my mind that even they will last. They are young, younger then 18 and I must rely on them to full fill friendship needs... I love you both for taking the time for me but you both will grow up one day and it will be right back to square one for me....)\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my sorrow..... and I will keep this locked up inside only to be let out so i can cry in front my moniter wondering why I had to love a game no one wants to play with me irl... I miss talking with others, huggin them, being there for them, supporting them, helping them ingame, seeing them in game, talking about the game with them... instead i have toxics and players that just don&#039;t want to talk much.... they dont get to know me, they don&#039;t try to communicate they then wonder why i stop trying to communicate..... I&#039;m just tired of the world being like this. I&#039;m not the worse person in the world... even then the worse person in the world would have friends and a shitastic relationship.... I&#039;m done... \r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point, I think my next goal will be acceptance of not ever gaining a social life due to my needy  behavior and I&#039;ll just become like Veigar and not even worry about friends and use my powers ingame to kill anyone that crosses me to make me feel better about myself.... Maybe even go crazy in the process.... Thats ok with me, I guess.. I&#039;m done hoping for someone to come by when I feel like crying or actually am and give me their shoulder to tear up on, no one comes, no one can tell when i feel like this, and no one can handle it forever. It was all in vain.....So I&#039;m going to move on from this post and ignore any comments because I don&#039;t want to dwell on this any more then I had to, I post this only to get my feelings off my chest and the boards are basically my diary... I guess I also hope one day my knights in shining armor come to aid me in my difficult mindset.... \r\n\r\nIts going to take someone epic to crack the depression bubble I&#039;m in and I will not make it easy. Poptart can keep it at the shore line, but it never goes away... \r\n\r\nSorrow will be my group of friends.....{{sticker:sg-soraka}} Have a better night then me...\r\n\r\na Better year..\r\n -CinnaBon Kittenz  a former Soraka main thats now soul crushed....{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}
