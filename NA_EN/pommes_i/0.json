When the animation is bugged the part where she jumps in the air is missing, so she only goes down and then appears at ground level without attacking the frog, who disappears. \r\nI hope you will fix it soon as I am RekSai main and love the poolparty backport animation :D","replies":[{"poster":"Pommes I","date":"2015-07-11T10:51:06.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem anymore :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-09T17:26:50.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pommes I,\n\nThis was a bug in Patch 5.12 that we've since resolved.
