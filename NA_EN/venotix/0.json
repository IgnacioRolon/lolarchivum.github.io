Lost and need help","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I went to update the patch two days ago like i always do and it kept stopping me at 33 or 99 and even 57 percent sometimes telling me an unspecified error had occured, I went through troubleshooting, tried a bunch of internet solutions, but nothing worked. As a last resort, i attempted to uninstall then reinstall league of legends. But when I did this it gave me a new error upon attempting to download the game-\"There is a problem with this windows installer package.A DLL required for this install to complete could not be run. contact your support personnel or package vendor.\" If it would give me the specific DLL file I could fix it myself, yet seeing as this message is about as helpful as \"an unspecified error has occurred,\" I'm just not certain as to what I should do. I have run it as administrator, attempted over and over again, looked up other forums for my same problem but cannot find it anywhere. I really do need help on this one guys, Riot themselves won't respond to my ticket so maybe the forums will. Please help,\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-10T22:38:32.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This specific error often requires certain logs to be gone through to find the cause. Because you've already submitted 2 support tickets, I recommend waiting for a tech specialist to get back to you in your ticket.
