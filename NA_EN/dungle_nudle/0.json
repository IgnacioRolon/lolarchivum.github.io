After receiving a certain number of leaves, which varies depending on the total number of games played and the distance in time between each leave, the player account gets first warned and then suspended for increasingly long periods of time, resulting in a permanent ban for re-iterated offenses.","url":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Leaver_Buster","image":"https://images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb173/leagueoflegends/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do I have to be punished for something that I can't control. On 10/26/2017 I was playing a ranked game with my brother and we were doing well, but then lag strikes and we get from 200- 1000 ms. The game is unplayable with theses type of conditions. Knowing that me and my brother walked from one side of the fountain to the other side to not sit \"idle\"; sitting \"idle\" can get you to leave the game; therefore, resulting in a leaverbuster. The game ended and we lost, the worst part about the game was we STILL GOT A LEAVERBUSTER! BOTH OF US! I don't understand why, the LOL wiki states that if you leave the game you are given three different punishments based on your circumstances. The thing is WE NEVER LEFT THE GAME! I believe this is unfair and I think the punishment system that Riot games has implemented in their game is unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-27T03:41:45.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may not have left the game, but you still in effect \"left\" the game.

If you're having constant ping problems, you should discuss it with your ISP or ask Riot in a support ticket to help you identify the source of the problem.
