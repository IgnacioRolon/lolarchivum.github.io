I play with my friends in the same room with great internet and no lag (at least, for them). Whenever I start a queue or am in Champion select I sometimes dc. When I finally do get back and start a game, I have great ping, but all of a sudden.. A HUGE lag spike comes that makes me \"attempting to reconnect\" or lagging really bad. Whenever this happens, my friends dont get any lag.. Yet i do... My graphics card and Wifi are fine.. I just want to fix this problem immediately because.. I cannot play LoL anymore without feeding, dying, or losing every time as a result of the problem. Please help, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Prop4g4tor","date":"2016-12-31T06:59:56.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running Discord?

If you're having sync issues in champion select as well as delays in-game then something must be hindering the strength of your connection.
