The problem with borderless not being full screen is I am constantly clicking off screen on my desktop, creating new folders, and jacking shi## up.  Looking forward to the fix on this.  Also, my ping doubled from 41 to 84.  Not sure why, but it feels related.  thanks RITO!!\n\n{{champion:202}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fatagan","date":"2017-10-25T19:16:44.086+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i did everything now, from the cfg. file, to the reinstallation and even formatted my pc.
