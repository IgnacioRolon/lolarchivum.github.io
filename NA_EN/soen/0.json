Behaviour like that is sure to tilt anyone.\nIt probably contributed to your tilt and the reason why you want to report them.\nIt goes beyond boasting at that point and just serves to insult.\n\nBasically report it if it impacts you.\nIf it doesn't, just leave it be.\nSome people just like to boast and pump their ego.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lexyy","date":"2017-02-14T22:44:30.701+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2017-02-14T22:46:39.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"No wonder people complain that the report system is broken, because 1/3 of all LoL players do it every game. \n\nIt is not, unless you don't think the report system is broken or whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"Lexyy","date":"2017-02-14T22:53:22.856+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"??\n\nRiot said it's reportable.

There are plenty of people who insult and verbally abuse without being banned a single time. Is that ok also?\n\nReport for \"Gg ez\" wont get you banned on it's own, but it will help in getting you banned in general. You'll still have report under your name, and the more reports you get for a reason, the bigger the chances are of getting you banned. \n\nIt is considered unsportsmanlike and we have that category to report for, so I really don't understand why are you so surprised.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Trenitaliyah","date":"2017-02-14T23:46:40.701+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"1/3 of all LoL players do it every game because Riot has never punished one for the cause.
