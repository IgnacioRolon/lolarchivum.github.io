I have been watching the fps and ping counter in the top right while in my games. And I have not seen any spikes or drops. The lag I am experiencing must be very quick and little that it can not be monitored. Either way if I don't find a way to fix this problem I will be done playing league for awhile. Please please help I don't want to quit this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-24T00:57:43.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like you may actually be experiencing packet loss as opposed to the usual lag people might encounter.
