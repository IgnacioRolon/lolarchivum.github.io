Sure his blink can be interrupted by CC, but that's if you have that sort of CC available. Not everyone does, meaning that if you don't have hard CC built into your kit you aren't going to be able to stop him from getting to you without a timely dash or peel from a teammate. But really, saying after he ults he has nothing? Last I checked he still has ramping damage and healing on hit on every auto attack, he still has his Q which can give him enough health to win a fight through the early and mid game, and can build more tank than Yi while still putting out nearly comparable damage because he has so many on hit effects running in his favor at the same time. Even if it's not quite as high as Yi's, he can put out that damage for longer because of it. Not to mention if he builds a BotRK he can stick to you just fine long enough to drop you to that 50% HP point and then you're ripe for the taking.\n\nBut, again, is Nocturne locking down an enemy for an extended duration while dealing damage and healing in a manner that cannot be retaliated against? You're saying that I'm too focused on his ult, but it's his ult that everyone was QQing about. Sure, outside of that he's a bit meh if there are no 50% or lower enemies, if he doesn't have a BotRK, or if his team doesn't adequately set him up, but part of the problem with WW was that he was powerfarming 6, walking out of the jungle during the early game and getting himself or his lanes snowballing much quicker than other laners because of the inherent sustain in his kit allowing him to stay in the jungle for a much longer period of time than a Yi or a Nocturne or even an Udyr. The weaknesses that made him weak in season 4 were that he didn't bring as much utility as some other junglers outside of his ult, but the preseason meta has shifted to show a favor towards junglers who can safely sustain in their own jungle over junglers who can provide a wealth of utility. Their ganking, counter ganking, counter jungling, and early to mid game potential are enough to allow teams to get the snow rolling down the mountainside because they're consistently at higher percentages of health versus a Rammus or a Volibear who are running a bit lower at all times, making them open to being counterjungled and killed or making it unsafe for them to attempt ganks.\n\nIt's not that I'm too focused on his ult, it's that I recognize the threat his ult brings while also being aware of the play patterns, that Warwicks, and high sustain junglers in general, are taking in matches. The jungle has become risky, and therefore low risk junglers are becoming stronger picks. In season 4 he was balanced out because while some junglers had a faster clear than others, most junglers only really had any issue at all with their first clear and after that they were golden and able to start raining ganks down upon their lowly laners with impunity. Warwick had decent clear times, a powerful early game, but fell off in the late game unless he got fed, or unless he managed to get his team fed, because he couldn't stay relevant after other junglers picked up through the mid and late games. That isn't how this jungle is currently working, and it's because he can either get himself fed or get his team fed, combining his insane sustain in the jungle along with his potent ult locking down kills for himself or his team, that he's strong right now.\n\n>Which is easy because you're not interested in what is balanced, you're only concerned about what you don't like, which is not obective.\n\nDo not attempt to undermine my understanding just because you aren't aware of the bigger picture. League is a game of numbers, and those small numbers add up to a big effect over the course of a match. Warwick's early game dominance was allowing teams to push, get barons, and establish advantages much easier than any other jungler's early phases. If you have any further issues, feel free to take them up with his 60% winrate. No matter how much you want to preach about your own objectivity, or try and chastise a supposed lack of the same on my part, numbers don't care who or why. And the numbers show that he was a dominant force even above Yi's. It is precisely because his ult needed to be reigned back in, both by reducing the damage from Devourer's, removing the damage on hit from Skirmisher's, and reducing the base damage on his ult, that he needs the balance while other champions who are AA centric do not need to be nerfed in comparison.\n\n>No it was the item.\nSKirmisher was the only brand new item.\nDevourer was a feral flare with 15 stacks.\nFor you to say WW was a problem suggests he was a problem in S4, which he wasn't.\nSeriously, logic, connect the dots.\n\nThe only new item was skirmisher, and yet no one complained about WW until the 4.20. changes occurred.\nClearly, this is an issue of items, not the champion.\n\nReally? Tell me one other jungler who can walk out of the jungle at level 6 with a Skirmisher/Devourer and deal 250 base magic damage plus five procs of true damage and an additional 200 magic damage while also healing for almost half the damage he's dealing, while also holding that one enemy in place for 1.5 seconds, which is an absolute death sentence in most cases during the early game. Just so I can expedite this process, that's over 450 magic damage, another 85 true damage, and holding you in place while the enemy mid/ADC blasts you to bits. Please, tell me how Nocturne is able to deal that much damage in 1.5 seconds while not allowing you to retaliate. Justify to me how a Shyvana would need less than 3 or 4 seconds to rack up that same amount of damage with her Burnout up, with an E > AA > Q, and with having to take harass back for it and needing help from teammates to stick to someone long enough to do so. \n\nGo ahead.\n\nI'll wait.\n\nYeah, it's a FF with 15 stacks. And do you know who was a part of the reason that FF got nerfed shortly after it launched? Warwick. Because in much the same way as his ult abused FF, it was abusing the Skirmisher/Devourer combo as well. He *was* a problem during season 4 for the very short reign of the Feral Flare just after it's launch. Especially when the healing it gave was also increasing with the stacks on it.\n\n>Are you stupid?\nHow is that a buff!?\n\"They lowered the duration of his steroid, that's a buff.\"\n\nOh, you got me there, my bad.

His damage over time IS superior. *Over time.* Not with a single button press and then watching for a second and a half while any nearby teammates are also getting free shots on the affected champion. It doesn't \"feel\" worse, it is worse. A Yi has to stay on you to deal damage, and while he certainly has a kit that allows him do, he can still be kited, is still susceptible to hard CC that keeps him from getting close. Keep in mind that the range on WW's ult is longer than the range on Yi's Q as well. And once again, you're missing the point. Yi can melt someone like a Warwick can, but when he does it it's also generally not giving any assists to laners, or at least not as many. Yi also cannot solo a dragon at a low level as he doesn't have that much inherent sustain in his kit outside of meditate, which is very meh early on.\n\n>I snipped it since it was long.

Sure at the end of the day you have to teamfight to win a match, but advantages are won and lost during the early and mid games with 1v1s, and late game a player gets punished if they go off alone by having to fight enemy champions who might be specifically designed to take out single targets. You can't stop his ult once it's already started, you just wait until it's over. A more accurate wording would be \"many individuals, particularly support, will have hard CC that will keep a Warwick from getting within range to use his ult.\" Once he's hit someone with it there's no stopping it, even if you Cleanse/QSS it to end the suppression, the damage still ticks off while you're running away. Warwick may have some of the slowest clearing regularly, but he is currently beating out other junglers because he can stay in the jungle for a much longer time than, say, a Shyvana could. He's clearing faster because he's spending more time in the jungle overall.\n\n>I disagree, because again, if this was an issue pre- 4.20, we would have seen a decrease in the base damage of his ultimate.\nFortunately we did not, and the reduction of its base damage on top of reducing devourer to feral flare numbers serves purely as a nerf that skirmisher's does not cover.\nInstead of pushing WW into other options such as trailblazer, poacher, and stalker's blade, he absolutely needs skrmisher to make up for the lack of damage he once had.\n\nIt wasn't an issue pre 20 because pre 20 you didn't have the opportunity to get an item that added almost 300 damage to a single ult during the early game. The closest that anything came was with the Feral Flare, which was very quickly nerfed for the exact same reason. It was giving too much at too early of a point in the game. Accordingly, Skirmisher's true damage has been changed from on hit to a burn DoT, and the magic damage has been dialed back a bit to make it more manageable. Skirmisher's isn't supposed to cover the nerf, it's supposed to change how it works alongside other factors. For instance, I was running Skirmisher/Devourer on Skarner and while it wasn't breaking the game, I still had to be careful who I fought and when, it was adding quite a bit of damage to what I could pump out at only a third of the way to max level. Just because one part of an item, or a champion, is nerfed does not mean something else needs to cover it, or else it's ruining the point of the nerf. And in all honesty, making it a burning DoT effect means that it's essentially recycling the old effect of Elder Lizard while combining with the stacking damage of the Feral Flare into one item. It's getting some fun stuff added on, not to compensate for weaknesses being made from the nerfs but to make it work in a unique way. Why are you so focused on his damage, though? A champion should bring more to the table than just damage, and there's still plenty of reason to take the other items if a player is trying to play a slightly safer, possibly more supportive oriented Warwick. It's BECAUSE everyone is so worried about his mass amount of damage that Riot is tightening up the reins. Take away his ability to take a carry down to under half their health with just his ult and Warwick players have to learn to play him in other roles because the overwhelming, unfair damage he had is gone. In it's place you now have to work with your teammates to better secure kills, and build tankier so he can do more in teamfights than just ult and run away.\n\n>Sure.\nPick nocturne. pick up skirmishers and devourer.\nProceed to fear your target for over 2 seconds at max rank while also being able to stay on top of the target.\nPick Master Yi, use your ult, tap Q then E, proceed to obliterate your target.\nJust because it seems overwhelming, doesn't mean that other cases do not exist either.\nWW did the following.\nsmte>R>Q,\nThat is his entire kit, this is te same behavior exhibited by assassins and other glass cannons\nThe only difference is you can't interrupt them as easily as you can WW.\n\n>I don't need to name someone who can do that damage with an ult, Master Yi does it just by tappng R, then E, and killing your entire team.\nIt is extremely easy to ignore all of the weaknesses WW possesses.\n\nYou're talking to a Nocturne main. I know what he's capable of, you don't have to recite a strategy or build for me. But that fails to answer my question. A Nocturne ult does not do nearly as much as a Warwick ult does, and in order to kill someone he has to be able to stay on them for that long. Granted, he just got a rather nifty buff by gaining MS anytime he's heading towards a feared enemy, but that's only if they're either feared by a conveniently placed ally or by not flashing/dashing/blinking/leaping out of his tether.\n\nAssassins still have to set up their kills. They can't just press one key and get a kill, it requires careful positioning, usually involving teamwork, to set them up to go on the crazy sprees they can go on.\n\nYou have still failed to answer my question adequately. Tell me one other jungler who, at level 6, was capable of unleashing over 500 damage on a single ult by pressing one key to do so. You can't, because Warwick was the only one to abuse the mechanics behind Skirmisher/Devourer to the extent that he did. Yes, if given enough time, a Yi or a Nocturne can do as much damage. But they need a few seconds longer to do so than a Warwick, they aren't healing for nearly as much, and they aren't locking anyone down and preventing them from retaliating while doing so. You're spouting about Nocturne's fear and Yi's E at max ranks, but I said level 6. Early game, which is where Warwick was tipping the balance of matches.\n\nNot the late game. The early game.\n\nSo unless you can cough up a champion who was able to deal over 500 damage with a single keystroke, suppress a target to either get the kill themselves or to give it to a teammate, and stay healthy long enough to give out gank after gank while other junglers are having to back to heal, applying constant pressure, just don't even bother responding. Because for all your touting about how I'm not looking at the balance of everything, you're the one who's neglecting to look at the small things that are accomplished during the early game that are setting Warwick's teams up for success in the late game just to try and point out that other champions CAN deal as much damage as he does over time.\n\nSure they can. If given time, and if not disengaged before they can set themselves up. But not at level 6, not by pushing one button, and they can't put nearly the same sort of early game pressure as he would.\n\nAnd *that* is why he got nerfed. If you don't like it, feel free to take it up with Riot.

He was NEVER considered an overpowered champion in all my time playing him, being a niche jungler at best and an average/sub-tier laner. He only has 2 scaling abilities, one off of AD and one off of AP and has a conditional movespeed skill, otherwise no mobility besides his ultimate. After the pre-season jungle release, he finally found a way to be played only to be nerfed into oblivion due to overpowered jungle items. At first, with the ult cooldown nerf by adding +20 seconds to his level 1 and 2 ults (which hurts A LOT). Then by gutting his W, which has no hidden passives and is necessary to proc his passive during duels. \n\nMy question is, why not just remove the jungle item from triggering off his ult? His ult is his only powerful move (none of his abilities have hidden passives or scale with his relevant stats) and when people cry about it being overpowered, they fail to realize its a less than 2 second stun on a tremendous cooldown. Morganas snare is over a second longer and on a much shorter cooldown. Fiddle's fear is a longer cc. Skarner's ultimate is a longer snare, and he gets to reposition you. Nobody ever cried about Warwick until the new jungle release and now everybody has an opinion, due to one stupid jungle item. You've ruined top Warwick for everybody who used him (all 3 of us) and now you've ruined top Pantheon by gutting his base attack speed and I'm sure other undesirable changes to him too. While buffing Jax.
