Not only that, but Shaco's entire kit revolves around mind games and out-thinking your opponents. It takes a lot of game knowledge, as well as mechanical skill, to even have a chance at playing Shaco well.

Just land a Q and spam E until they're dead.\"\n\n\"Playing Shaco is easy. Just Q into a lane and burst them down.\"\n\n\nSee what I did? When written like that, even some of the hardest champions in the game can sound easy to play. Once you've read a champion's abilities and used them in a game to see how they work, sure it may seem easy enough to play that champion. But if champions were really that easy, then everyone would be diamond. I suppose if you're smart enough, every champion has a low skill floor. But skill cap is a different matter entirely. \n\nThe real problem when it comes to judging champion's strengths is the disparity in skill level between players. Someone in challenger could probably play Shaco well enough in and around high plat level without batting an eye, because they understand how the game operates on a fundamental level with such precision that the idiosyncrasies of individual champion kits are highly transferable skills. In other words, they are able to take what they know about familiar champions and extrapolate that knowledge to unfamiliar ones, allowing them to learn their intricacies more easily than non-challenger players. \n\nFor the laymen such as you and I, this transfer of knowledge does not come as freely, and we have trouble grasping just how much a champion is capable of unless we've played them dozens of times. I, for example, am a Shaco main (yes yes, INSERT BIAS HERE). I know a lot about playing Shaco, and I know a lot about what he is capable of. But if I were to venture outside my comfort zone and play a champion I have almost no experience with, I would most certainly fail miserably. What does this all have to do with champion difficulty? Simple: it's all relative, based on the skill of the player. The more skilled a player is at League in general, the better they will perform when asked to play something outside their norm.\n\nThink about all the League streamers and video producers on YouTube/Twitch. They all have champions they are more familiar with than others. But as a content creator, one must be able to be flexible and play a lot of different champions in order to be successful. By only playing one champion all the time, they are limiting themselves to a sub-set of players who enjoy that champion; if they're good enough at providing effective commentary, views will be more likely to forgive poor play on unfamiliar champions, simply because they're entertaining to watch. But the majority of the time, commentators play a bit of everything in order to appeal to a greater number of viewers, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/user/Anklespankin https://www.youtube.com/user/Sykkuno https://www.youtube.com/user/Redmercy https://www.youtube.com/user/CaptainMonkHD . \n\nOn the topic of Shaco, his kit may seems fairly basic at first glance (and indeed, since he is an older champion who has not received a major update yet, quantitatively speaking he does have a lot less in his kit than most newer champions). But what you're missing are the little ways in which Shaco players use him to his maximum potential. \"Juking\" with his Q is not quite so easy when everyone carries pink wards or red sweepers. Most non-Shaco players always get fooled by the fake-out tactic of Qing in the opposite direction to that of where Shaco is facing/running. His Q can also be used to recall while stealthed, if timed properly, which most people never even think of. You can Q and stand completely still, sending the enemies off running in other directions, assuming you ran away. Or fake a wall jump, forcing the enemy to burn flash in order to catch you. You can Q over the wall of Dragon pit, smite-steal from the enemy jungler, then use your ult to reposition yourself over the wall again. You can Q to fake an engage, baiting out key spells or summoners. You can even save your Q and not even use it during a gank; simply running into the lane from an unwarded bush is something no one ever expects from a Shaco. This is especially useful on enemies that are very pushed up, who might not notice your coming anyway, or if you're ganking someone with a lot of mobility and you need your Q as a gap-closer as they run away (e.g. Riven, LeBlanc, Gnar). \n\nThis is only a sample, and I could go on for literally pages and pages of things to do with Shaco. Boxes are a whole other matter entirely, but I will say that the best Shaco players all swear that good box placement is the singular most important skill to master with Shaco, and it will literally make or break your game performance. It's not like a Zyra plant, which is simply dropped down as a zoning tool. Boxes are extremely valuable, and wasting them simply because they're easy to use is a surefire way to fail with Shaco. \n\nHe is by no means an easy champion; like I mentioned in an earlier post, Shaco is 100% about mind games. Being able to think further ahead than your opponent, thinking about how they think you're thinking, and exploiting their errors in judgement is key to mastering Shaco. The stealth from Q lasts 3.5 seconds; if you thought wrong about a \"juke\", and the opponent is correct in determining your position, it's over for you. \n\nNow that I think about it, his Q is very aptly named: it is deception in its purest form. If you've ever played against a bad Shaco, it's VERY easy to tell that he's bad. On the other hand, playing against Annie or Warwick, the line is quite blurry between good and bad. That's what makes Shaco difficult, and the primary cause of \"Shaco Syndrome\". It's actually the reason I started maining Shaco. I was fed up with the enemy team always getting the better Shaco. So I decided to start maining him and turn my luck around. And surprise surprise, I'm now the enemy team's Shaco!","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-03-01T03:43:59.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> See what I did?

You were polite, not rude, made good points, and weren't stuck in your current opinion, unwilling to change. So many people aren't open to new ideas at all, and this was a breath of fresh air for me!\n\nIt's interesting, because what you classify as a misunderstanding, I see as the entire point of the thread. When I think of which champions are hardest to play, I think \"what champions have the greatest potential? what champions require the most flawless execution, the most intensive mechanics, and are very unforgiving to beginners?\" In other words, I think of skill cap. \n\nWhen YOU think of what champions are the hardest to play, you think \"who has the highest skill floor?\" They're similar ideas, but in my case I take into account everything the champion has the potential to do, not how easy it is to learn them, because in my mind that's a flawed view. People who think that way tend to believe that the speed at which they get the basics down determines how hard to play a champion is, and once they've done that they have the champion all figured out, and that champion is easy for them (in general this is what I've noticed, not intended to be an insult directed at anyone). \n\nThe way I see it, the more a champion's kit can do, the harder that champion is to play. The learning process might go smoother in some cases, but I already talked about why that may be. In the case of Shaco for example, I found him extremely hard to pick up. I actually used one of my refund credits on him because I just could not play him at all, and kept failing no matter what I did. It wasn't until I got more experienced with the game itself that I was able to take another look at Shaco and realize where I had gone wrong. Kind of a strange beginning for a Shaco main, but there it is. \n\nI digress........the point is, when you say \"the point of the thread is about the hardest champion to play, not the highest skill cap\", I find them to be synonymous. What makes a champion easy or hard IMO is how multi-faceted their kit is; how much they can or cannot do, and how good a player needs to be in order to use every tool at their disposal properly. If this is not your view as well, I'm a afraid we'll have to agree to disagree. \n\nIn any case, thank you for not taking my first post negatively as if I were trying to criticize you, as most would think.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-03-01T05:51:38.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was interesting!
