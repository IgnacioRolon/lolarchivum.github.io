I said when I first heard \"oh, now panth is an avatar of war\" that it would be way less interesting than him just being the small kid in the village who worked out a LOT... and people called me dumb.  Now, here we are.\n\nAtreus... or old panth was a badass who trained his ASS off to overcome his flaws and become a warrior.  He was interesting.  He was batman.  He was an underdog.  He was scrappy.  \n\nNew pantheon is a generic divine warrior guy with no personality.  He's Kratos, minus Kratos' motivation and personality... what little he had.  He's boring as hell now.  I dunno how you take a character that poorly developed and make him LESS interesting, but they found a way.","replies":[{"poster":"Blitzidious","date":"2016-02-26T17:33:24.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I strongly agree. I hope that, with what the story provides so far, that there will be character involved with Pantheon. Like, Atreus, is not in fact dead, and is not only a shell/conduit for the Pantheon. Have him be like Diana and Leona aspect wise. Allow him to maintain character. I want to get to know Atreus more, he's fucking baller. But I'd also like to know more about the Pantheon itself. Honestly, my happy place for his new lore will be where both Atreus and the Pantheon exist inside, well, Atreus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-02-26T13:12:47.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean.

It's spiritual/cosmic. It possesses someone. Therefore, the physicality of this Pantheon, is in fact the physicality of Atreus. It chose Atreus due to Atreus having specific attributes. (This is what I gathered, anyways. As his Bio made sure you understood that Atreus was Determined, had willpower, and could endure through things.)","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2016-02-26T16:31:27.484+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's boring.

I want to play as this young badass from Rakkor, not some weird body snatching alien that claims to be a god. I watched an entire tv show about killing those suckers off.","replies":[]}]}
