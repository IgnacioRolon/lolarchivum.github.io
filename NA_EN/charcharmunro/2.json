Beyond the generic \"git gud\", that is...  And I admit I'm not great at the game, I like to think I'm decent. It just seems like everything in Ranked conspires against you. I mean... I want to win, but I also wanna have fun, and the champions I find most fun to play are all really rather easily counterpicked. Half the time without even deliberate counterpicking. I pick {{champion:27}} and their ADC is {{champion:67}}? Well, guess I won't be able to play past laning phase. Things like that.\n\nEdit: Also, might it be a heavy contributing factor that I've ALWAYS been first-pick and thus susceptible to counter-picking? Or is it just that my mains are all counterpicked by FotM champions?","replies":[]}
