They told me It was toxicity but I was barely toxic in both games. The next time, I was defending myself, Got called a bunch of names, And the player in general who was doing it went unpunished and is now honor level 5, Yet I got a second chat restriction, Then apparently defending someone I said they had a \"Braindead adc,\" OK that I will give you, But This time Idk what to say....\n\nI had an Evelyn run it down, flame, AFK, Come back and run it down some more, because of 2 afk's on the enemy team. then go and take farm our team needs and just afk top lane, so she doesn't get a \"leaver warning.\" Yet telling Eve the reason she was reported, was considered \"Arguing\" with her, and Don't wanna forget the WW on the enemy team was also calling names and being offensive, Being intentionally rude. Also no penalty to either player. \n\nBut yet again I get a 4th chat restriction, Did not say a SINGLE THING BAD in the entire chat. I was calm, Level headed, Never flamed or insulted anyone. Just said the straight facts, Besides a joke to WW which he also laughed at he thought it was funny, As did everyone in the game. I am then being told \"Arguing\" is super uncool! Yet apparently people can go around insulting others for no reason? What is this game coming to? It used to be a fun game where people were chill and have fun playing games, Now I can't even talk without being reported? So Am I really just required to turn off chat in the game now? I just don't understand, Can I get some help in Understanding how When I was just talking in game, I still get a chat restriction? Am I just not supposed to talk anymore? Am I really supposed to just mute my chat and no longer talk to people? Because I get a report and I'm just auto punished? without anyone even reading the chat loggs?

People are human, Gamers are human, You can't expect them to sit there and start breaking down and crying instead of fighting back against a person who is badgering them and beating them down mentally.

I've been cyber bullied prolly 5 games? Will they ever see punishment? Probably not, why?

Just report em for inting. The accusation itself antagonizes the person youre accusing, because they may not be feeding intentionally. I know you've seen people be accused of inting, when they were just being outplayed. Riot cant wait to confirm that and then punish you accordingly. It has to be a blanket set of rules that cover everyone at all times. There can be no stipulations like \"once someone else breaks the rules, you are allowed to break them\".

Its fucked up that \"stating a fact\" can be considered breaking the rules. But I'm just like trying to help you understand that IS breaking the rules. Not stating a fact, but the facts you state. \"Her attitude is bad, her positioning is bad, her ganks are bad. At least you dont have someone inting. You gave talon 6 free kills.\" (All paraphrasing of course) These are all negative, antagonizing \"facts\". And anyone could start doing that to their teammates and just say theyre \"facts\". Thats why its ALWAYS against the rules. Like I said, they arent gonna go fact check games and then lift your punishment once its confirmed to be factual. Talking negatively about your own team like that in the middle of a game fosters a negative environment that Riot is trying to deter with these rules. You can tell people about it later and vent about it, but the middle of a match is off limits for that. It doesnt really matter if the things you are saying are facts or not. Yes, Riot is that strict that they will punish you for negativity. You dont have to call them trash or tell em to die. You can just call them bad, criticize their plays as bad, call them inters, and it has the same effect. \n\nAlso, nobody called you a bad person. These rules are not a moral code or life lesson. They should NOT be applied to real life. They are a set of rules that exist in the vacuum of the game itself, with the purpose to deter negativity in games, NOT to make you a \"good\" person. Stop thinking breaking the rules makes you bad somehow. Its just a video game, and you got a punishment ONLY in the video game.
