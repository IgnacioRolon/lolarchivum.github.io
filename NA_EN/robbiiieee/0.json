Yupp Same here.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":16,"body":"So I'm Here to get the attention of a dev, Because apparently blitzcrank bot is Refusing to give me a human right now. Because blitzcrank bot \"Knows\" this is not a \"Restrict-able\" problem but I got reported by 4 people in 1 game, because they were a \"premade 4.\" I will be posting this chat logg after this message tho, Back during the Tribunal *I was in it* I'll admit we had a few \"bad seeds\" However most of the time people were punished accordingly. Now that blitzcrank bot has taken over he literally doesn't care as long as you have had a restriction in the past *here is the funny part, That was also a premade 4.* So now twice I have been reported by a premade 4 and got restricted by a premade 4, what am I supposed to do? No one is replying to me on the support page. I've clicked on request a human 15 times and you know what it tells me? \"You've already completed this survey, Thank you!.\" Might aswell ask the community this same question, How is it fair? I'm going to post the SINGLE GAME CHAT LOG Right here. Mind you it's only my chat, you will note at the end tho I thank a person on the enemy team because HE TOOK MY SIDE AND REPORTED THEM.

I'll admit I picked a champ I don't play that much but It's a normal and they took my Hecarim. Also it was Rammus and I build pure tank. Then got flamed for doing \"no damage\" Yet I got in trouble?

And if I CAN'T talk like that why does 90% of the community do it and NOT get chat restriction for 1 game?\n\nThat is FAR from verbally abusive, Only part I can see that would come CLOSE to considered \"abusive\" is the fact that I said There you go akali happy? After she spammed pings me to go into baron pit and try to outsmite the 1 level higher hecarim with a full team","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-06T05:04:34.715+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Flaming does not have to be directed at someone.

If that's calling out you guys need to go and chat restrict 99% of the community right now. and B. If telling akali she needs to roam and pay attention in lane is \"calling out\" Then idk what the hell I get every game. This is NOT toxicity, This IS NOT verbal abuse, This is literally them flaming me, Them verbally abusing me, And me basically just trying to play that game. So Idk where you get that I WAS THE ONE being verbally abusive.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-06T05:14:55.253+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Their behavior does not matter. Yours does.\n\nIf other players are violating the rules in games with you, please feel free to report them and they will get punished if it is merited.\n\nThe reason it only took one game to get you punished is because your account was still in poor standing after your **last** punishment. If you don't improve your behavior, the next punishments will likely be a suspension of your account. Eventually, your account will be permanently suspended.","replies":[{"poster":"Robbiiieee","date":"2019-07-06T05:22:17.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"So basically I'm being punished for doing nothing? \n\nBecause the fact \"I don't matter because I'm just toxic\" That mentality is garbage and you should know that. \n\nI haven't been toxic AT ALL since my last punishment, And 1 report means I get another restriction for 0 reasoning? Your basically saying \"We don't care that your doing better were just going to punish you for 1 report no matter what you do.\" \n\nWith that mentality just go ban the entire playerbase, Cause your that's not fair to anyone who actually tries to reform. The end story is I just got 10 game restriction because I got placed with a premade, ANd they didn't like me. That's basically what you just said, Because I went against people who just didn't like me, even tho THEY WERE SO MUCH WORSE, and THEY WERE DOING BAD THINGS, I get punished. So please tell me how I am supposed to \"Reform\" If you guys don't even let me Reform. Because a premade 5 can just get me in trouble.\n\nIt's irritating that I get in trouble for something as basic as telling akali to roam, and to pay attention to map. Yet others get away with being beyond verbally abusive in games on streams and NOTHING HAPPENS. Thanks for telling me \"reforming is BS as long as someone reports you, Your just trash and your opinions don't matter.\"\n\nEdit: BTw reporting them does nothing because It's only people who have done bad in the past who get punished apparently or people who are reported by a premade for no reason. Thanks for the 0 help and thanks for making me feel even more toxic than before.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-06T05:54:22.851+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trying to reform is great.

Cause apparently Talking in chat is breaking rules? That's what your telling me. I know it's missing chat logs because that's not everything I said in that game. I had a conversation with Thresh that game Cause he can tell I was being flamed in team chat. \n\nIt's kinda sad that you just Assume I'm a bad person because of a bullcrap report I've Received, Idk how to even try to explain it to you because all your seeing is that I'm a bad person, When All my friends think I'ma nice dude, and an honest guy. Yet all you see is a jackass who thinks he is right. I'm Sorry you think that but I mean I've been playing this game for over 10 years and I've seen beyond worse than what I've done here In EVERY SINGLE GAME I play. I'm a jungle main I get bitched at and shit on EVERY game whether I do decent to help the team or not. So now instead of trying to help me understand your just saying Your a dick have a nice day. Congrats on being a prick, I'm trying to get answers and your just sitting here saying the same thing \"your wrong. get over it.\" Yet in this instance I KNOW that this report is bullcrap, And the only reason I got in trouble is because a premade team, All four allies I had, reported me because 1 person said to. I got in trouble for it and I'm getting punished for it because Of a toxic person who will NEVER get punished because you guys only care about the ones who have messed up once and are trying to do better. Think about that for a second I'm going to bed because I can't help but fathom Why this turned into a \"flame the person trying to get answers because he supposedly deserved it.\" Instead of the real reason which is the fact that YOUR BOT doesn't punish accordingly. You 100% just told me \"It doesn't matter if everyone is negative, You're the only one who gets punished.\" So thank you for making my bullcrap of a day worse because instead of trying to hear the full story you ASSUMED I'm the bad person, You ASSUMED I am toxic, and I am negative. Well Thank you for proving to me that Mods on this board don't care, because obviously you just want to sit there and think, \"He's bad, He will always be bad, and I hope he gets what he deserves.\"\n\nHave a good night Thanks for being a prick and not trying to help anything.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-07-06T20:25:19.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're going to flame others, argue with them, and call them out, then no, you cannot use chat or you will continue to be punished.\n\nIn fact, you insulted me here just because you didn't like my answer. You keep acting like this isn't a problem. You're trying to push this red herring that it's because of your past punishment. While your past punishment did factor in to it, your behavior here is why you were punished.\n\nAnd no, you aren't the only one who gets punished. However, if it's the first time those players were negative in a game, they would be given the same leeway you were before your first punishment. You already used up your leeway, they may not have.
