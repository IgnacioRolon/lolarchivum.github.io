Often early in the game or somewhere right before mid game, my game freezes and last game it even turned a black screen on me. Using Ctrl+Alt+Del shortcut screen of Windows (8.1) solved the problem temporarily by getting rid of the freeze at that time. Obviously this costs valuable time during a game. I also noticed that there is a lot of line flickering stuff going on. They seem to appear often from character models. I might try to make a screenshot if this is possible, would the problem still persist. I also noticed a similar problem quite a while ago whilst playing a game called World of Warcraft, so this might be related to my hardware, although I am not 100% certain. I solved the problem back then simply by lowering the graphic settings. I did the same in LoL but this seemed not to help.\n\nCould anyone please help me figure out what is the cause of this and what steps I can take in order to solve this problem?\n\nThanks in advance,\nBarrosy","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T01:58:22.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does actually sound like it might be some type of hardware issue. Typically those lines will start to happen when either your card or driver isn't able to correctly display everything, so sometimes it slips up a bit and draws those strange lines. I would suggest double checking those drivers, as well as the rest of the steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) just in case!","replies":[]},{"poster":"WeeGaffer","date":"2017-05-26T22:36:58.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Barrosy\n\nJust my 2 cents, sounds like a video card issue or even a power supply issue. Have you tried updated your graphics card drivers recently?","replies":[{"poster":"Barrosy","date":"2017-05-26T23:52:00.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I did install the Geforce software for my Nvidia card and regarding driver software. Kind of strange since I had a power supply problem a long while ago aswell and replaced it with another one, which seemed to had fixed all problems until now.","replies":[]}]}]}
