I&#039;m also not really sure that I&#039;m posting in the most appropriate board... Anyway, let&#039;s start.\r\n\r\nHere i am today to have a long discussion with you guys about many things I kept for myself for the last 6 years playing LoL.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n---\r\n ---\r\n ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**I -  Who am I?\r\n II - The notion of &quot;balance&quot;\r\n III -   Why so many differences ?**\r\n\r\n\r\n ---\r\n ---\r\n ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**I - Who am I?**\r\n\r\nMy name&#039;s Oliver, I&#039;m 21, student in software engineering, currently living in China for 1 year for my studies. Player since the Season 1, I&#039;ve been playing in almost any game levels (Bronze 5 to Diamond 3). Because I love helping others and having a large knowledge when I play a video game, I&#039;ve been starting to work around theorycraft and I now offer my services as a coach since 3 years.\r\n My goal ? Teaching to others how to progress, think and obtain answers by themselves without the need to copy others stupidly.{{summoner:13}} \r\n\r\nYou might know enough things about me now, right ? Let&#039;s start the real argumentation now. {{summoner:6}} \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n---\r\n ---\r\n ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**II -  The notion of &quot;balance&quot;**\r\n\r\nNowadays, League of Legends community often tries to discuss about fake and real problems. And I&#039;d like to give you my opinion  concerning the balance of the game. You first should know that I&#039;m not here to criticize RIOT games, I respect and admire the company for everything it has accomplished until now. But you know, there is a huge negative point in that game that deserves everyone&#039;s attention.\r\n\r\nIf i talk to you about the balance in League of Legends, most of the player will have this kind of thoughts :\r\n &quot;**This hero is broken... my main champion got nerfed to hell...**&quot; - Am I right ?\r\n\r\nWell, to be honest, that&#039;s a normal behaviour, but also a too simply way to think.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there are 2 other things which are extremely important to care about concerning the balance of League of Legends [RIOT.IMPORTANT], another thing that concerns the community in general [PLAYER.IMPORTANT], and one last thing which is badly analyzed by the community [DATA.IMPORTANT] :\r\n\r\n- **[RIOT.IMPORTANT] Shop&#039;s items** : Some items offer a too huge advantage to some heroes. Let&#039;s take the example of the {{item:3044}} and his well known daddy {{item:3071}}. As you know, the passive property of these items offers a too huge boost of movement speed if we compare it to how you obtain the boost in any kind of situation (That was just an example, but that would be nice if Riot tried to fix this problem). I&#039;ll pass on the few other items that deserve their own section in this thread.\r\n\r\n- **[RIOT.IMPORTANT] Masteries** : Riot  should also be careful with masteries. Yeah yeah Riot, you maybe do it well when you release a new one. But.. 2 months after you release a new one, you sometimes seem to forget them. \r\n\r\n- **[PLAYER.IMPORTANT] Reflexion** : Here is a very important point that most of players (Even in Diamond 5 +) must work on. That&#039;s not because you got recked by a certain champion 2 games in a row that you must create your own discussion on the LoL boards to come to whine trying to give strange and most of the time stupid reasons on &quot;Why the Champion X or the Champion Y must be nerfed&quot;. The opposite case is also valid.\r\n\r\n- **[DATA.IMPORTANT] _Winrate_, a badly interpreted data** : I&#039;ll talk about general winrate by champion here. Hang on, there&#039;s  a lot to read.\r\n Since the beginning of the Season 6, more and more players try to give their own opinion on which champion is too strong or too weak. They most of the time base their judgment on winrate only. Most of the time, that&#039;s... a bad thing.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s first take a sample of 300 players that play the same champion for most of their games (OTP...) :\r\n - Those players will play their main champion so many times that they will learn much faster how to play against any kind of match up, which will give them a considerable theorical advantage. You&#039;ll agree with me, their winrate on this champion will be much higher than 50%.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s now take the same amount of players, we&#039;ll call them **The scholars of the rift**. They only play forgotten champion, judged **out of the meta**. Those players also often have a name that shows their love for their main champion. Those players will have a large contribution to the general winrate of the champion in any server, which does not reflect what the majority of players do and can do with the same champion.\r\n\r\nIf you still don&#039;t see what I mean : Take a minute of your life and analyze the winrate of some forgotten champions. Some of them will have a honorable winrate (**52%, 53%**), but, once again, it does not show what the majority of players does with the champion. Some other forgotten champions will have a much lower winrate (**46%, 47%**), and so, for several months, and sometimes years, without any update done on the champions to give them some help.\r\n\r\nNow we&#039;re done with those OTP, let&#039;s now take a bigger sample : 30.000 players that suddenly &quot;fell in love&quot; with all of those powerful champions.\r\n\r\n- I&#039;ll now tell you a little story that happened about 7 months ago : **Lucian case**.\r\n That was a period where I often played as ADC. For a good half of the season 6, Lucian was a terror in the bot lane. He was the most played ADC from far, but he only had a winrate approaching the 49%. From the moment I don&#039;t really like fashion, broken champions neither, i strictly refused to play Lucian, because I knew he was far ahead any other ADC at this period (Even if his winrate was kinda low). So, most of my games, I prayed to survive to his laser bullets in too many situations, even the Lucian didn&#039;t know what he was doing : &quot;Ohohoh, my laser bullets deal so much damages, i like this champion lmao&quot;.\r\n\r\nThen I decided to create my first whining discussion on a Facebook page that gathers LoL players, where I was insulting Lucian players, explaining then clearly how dishonouring it was to play this champion in ranked, blablabla... Don&#039;t need to go into details here.\r\n\r\nWhat **didn&#039;t surprise me** was the lack of intelligence from 90% of the people that answered me, trying to explain me with strange and wrong arguments that Lucian was just &quot;balanced&quot;, that his winrate was low enough, and that it was useless to nerf this Champion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, **what surprised me**, and made me laugh also, was to see a nerf on Lucian (quite unexpected from the community) about 1 month later, with many people whining : &quot;RIP Lucian...&quot;{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI&#039;ll tell you once again that, most of the time, that&#039;s not because a champion has a low winrate that he&#039;s useless, and vice versa. Please stop basing your judgment on the power of a champion by talking about winrate only, this data reading is widely insufficient and results into wrong and incomplete judgments in almost every case.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I know that most of my development was on the **[DATA.IMPORTANT]** part. However, to conclude with this part, I&#039;d like to tell one thing to RIOT Games : **Please, whenever you listen to the community to improve the balance in League of Legends, please, stop listening to all of those sheeps. Please listen to those rare people that take a lot of their free time to tell you what needs to be improved and what&#039;s good.** {{summoner:13}} \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWell ! Let&#039;s continue with the last part, I need your answers RIOT Games ! {{summoner:6}} \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n**III - Why so many differences ?**\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor this last part, I&#039;ll need a particular attention from RIOT Games. Not sure the community can answer me.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo, as I said in the beginning, I&#039;ve been living in China for the 3 last months, and I saw that there are a lot of differences between the Chinese client and our game client.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Chinese client has 1 week delay for any released update : For example, season 6 ended 1 week later than in Europe and NA, and season 7 started 1 week later also.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- In China, we only have FlexQueue. You have Solo/DuoQueue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- We had the update for the new history (the one we have in Europe since season 5) about 2 months ago.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut there is one huge difference that we have. That&#039;s a software used by almost every Chinese player called TGP, developped by Tencent here are a bunch of features and information about this software (I don&#039;t understand everything with the soft, my chinese is really poor) :\r\n\r\n- The software is directly linked to the League of Legends launcher (you can launch LoL and many other games through TGP)\r\n\r\n- When you are selecting a champion, the soft allows you to choose a mastery page created by professional players. Once you chose your favorite page, you can create , and fill a full mastery page in 5 seconds by clicking a simple button.\r\n\r\n- Still in lobby, you can consult the stats you&#039;ll have at level 1, depending on your runes and masteries. You can obviously check the updated description for each spell too (I remind you that for many champions, European client still has a lot of wrong descriptions and videos on the champion description).\r\n\r\n- When the game is loading, and also in game, you have a second &quot;Tab&quot; key, this one &quot; ` &quot; by default that allows you to check how good your team mates and ennemies are with the champion they play (general winrate is given, not only for ranked games, but for every single game they played (normal, 3v3...)), and also tells you what are the 2 main roles for everyone, and also everyone&#039;s rank.\r\n\r\n- Once the game starts, there a little window is appearing, that shows you what&#039;s the best combo you can do, and another window that shows you what&#039;s the best spell to max first, second, and third depending on the role you want to play.\r\n\r\n- It also displays the blue, red, rift herald, drake and nashor&#039;s respawn time directly in the minimap.\r\n\r\n\r\n... And many other minor things that can help to start a game in the best conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHey RIOT Games, will you offer us a customized TGP for Christmas ? This software is really cool.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\n\r\nIs there any direct link between &quot;Riot China&quot; and &quot;Riot rest of the world&quot; ?\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, we all play the same video game, but there are so many differences. That would be cool to know why.{{item:2050}} \r\n\r\n\r\nHere ends this long message, I hope your eyes didn&#039;t burn while reading me (Obviously not... because you&#039;re currently reading this sentence hahaha. French people are so funny kappa).{{summoner:4}} \r\n\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas to you guys, see you in the Rift ! \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}
