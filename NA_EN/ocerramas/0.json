I was wondering if I could have that game redacted and my LP points given back because that was ridiculous having to lose a game because of a server-side issue after I've spent a good week grinding out my rank, however unsuccessful. It would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T23:33:36.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The service incident that went on last night has since been resolved. As for loss prevention, it cannot be retroactively applied to individual matches, so if your disconnection has resulted in an LP loss, it cannot be redacted or modified. The system was designed this way to prevent abuse of any kind. \n\nIf you're still encountering issues or have any questions, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Ocerramas","date":"2016-09-19T02:07:12.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That in itself is ridiculous considering it's your fault there was any issue at all.

If Rito did allow lp to be able to be changed, I bet some Rioters would secretly change their lp and abuse it somehow, even though it can be noticed it can be hidden. I know how you feel, a loss without it being on your end is really frustrating, but it's Riots code to be fair and to keep it fair they have to meet ends on both sides. I bet they would love to fix everyone's loss, but that would go back to rioters being able to abuse that power. Though just know you can always somehow grind it out and win back your elo, I sure as hell did.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-09-18T05:19:38.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The servers are currently experiencing technical difficulties.

Also, I'm not sure how Loss forgiven works, I'm assuming it's working for any games currently in the process after the server issues were notified onto the servers. Not for games already lost before the server issue was noticed but present during the those games.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-09-18T05:28:02.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue is also affecting logins - you wouldn't be able to login for the time being.
