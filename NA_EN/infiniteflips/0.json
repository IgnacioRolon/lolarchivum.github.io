Random aa at the start of ult.","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don&#039;t really know if it happens all the time but it seems like Yasuo is getting an extra random aa at the very start of his ult. I know that when you get his knock up you can get in an aa before ulting but this bug seems to apply an aa to anyone caught in your ult even if you don&#039;t do that and ult from range applying anywhere from 100 to 500 extra damage depending on ad and crit just like an aa. It&#039;s really random and adds a lot of damage that shouldn&#039;t be there. This seemed to start occurring after his bugfix that stopped that really annoying bug that stopped you from being able to aa right after his ult ended just recently. Has anyone else noticed this? Or am I crazy?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-31T00:10:05.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, we know. Everyone knows.","replies":[]}]}
