I was given some notification when they tried to make changes to it, and couldn't due to not having email access, but I'm making this post to ask what I can do about this. I haven't played in many months and I don't play often, I've never shared account information with anyone but somehow someone logged on. I've changed my password but besides that I'm not sure how to ensure my account safety, since they almost certainly know the account username now (which I can't change), and if they found the password before I'm not sure what's stopping them from doing it again. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T17:45:37.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the registered email is no longer accessible, then submitting an [account recovery ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416)  to our account team would be your best bet.

I'm asking if there's any additional security measures I can take to ensure that my account doesn't get stolen again. (I've also noticed some friends on my friends list have been playing, despite the people I know who own the accounts not playing anymore, so it seems like there's been a security breach in the last few months)","replies":[]}]}]}
