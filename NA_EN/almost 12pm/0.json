Also I tried using the League mobile app for android and my chat still doesn't work if I am connected to the WiFi of my house, but as soon as I disconnect from the WiFi and use my data the chat works on the app, which leads me to believe its an issue with the ISP but since I've already tried everything on the support site, what other options I got?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T16:35:45.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something within your network is blocking you from specifically connecting to pvp.net, further affirmed by connecting to it with your phone.  It could be a setting with your router as well.  The [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide may be able to help, but I also recommend checking out support options specifically for your device.  Meaning, there might be pre-existing firewall settings within your router/modem as well that needs to be configured.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
