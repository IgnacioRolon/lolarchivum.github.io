As a start, if you are stuck at the logo then your settings might be blocking the patcher from opening.  For this specific issue, I suggest using our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to allow access.\n\nYour network could also have problems connecting to our various servers, and we can troubleshoot this but keep in mind you also have a physical distance from the servers that will cause some strain.  You can use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is strong, but again your physical distance will also be an obstacle.
