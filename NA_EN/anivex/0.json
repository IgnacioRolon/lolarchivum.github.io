Takes about 5 minutes to authenticate, then I can launch. When I get to the login page, it tells me that I cannot sign in and that I may be offline. That lasts for about a minute and then I can login. When I finally get to the main client, I can't play a game. When I click the button, it says the client is patching. When I mouse over the patching bar, it tells me that there was an error and I need to restart the client. So I did, hesitantly, and guess what? The exact same process. \n\nNone of this is typical. Restarting my machine did not help. \nWindows 10\n\nEdit: Now it is stuck on the authentication screen. Calculating differences at 33%\n\nEdit 2: I reinstalled the client. Opens quickly now, but says I cannot login to the authentication server. Checked the servers, all green.\n\nEdit 3: Got back into client, got the same error as before, asking me to restart. Left client open for about 10-15 minutes and it eventually fixed itself and allowed me to create a lobby. Still, the issue needs to be addressed. I had time to play a couple ARAMs before. That is no longer the case now and I wont be able to play at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T20:47:55.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you got caught in a patching loop due to the patch not being able to fully download.
