As my title says I have been experiencing a lot of different problems. To elaborate my Client will freeze at least once every day(usually multiple times) when i play ranked. Sometimes it will sort itself out before I pick or ban, other times I'm left with a dodge when it won't unfreeze. Obviously its frustrating to lose a lot of LP and to face wait times all the time as well. When I actually get into the game I'm faced with regular freezing and ping spikes. I've played league for years and years now and this has never been an issue. I've never seen my ping spike to numbers like 5k like it did earlier today. Its even worse when the game will just freeze(I can still hear audio) and I press Ctrl-Alt-Delete and wait around a minute waiting for it to unfreeze. I am also frequently getting audio bugs where it will say someone has been slain a minute or so after it happened and sometimes not at all. My internet seems to be fine and I haven't been having any of these issues in any other games or streaming I might do. \r\n\r\nI thought this might be a g-sync issue as I have a monitor that supports it, but I tried turning that off and although it seemed to make things better initially ,but it is back to being just as bad right now. I'm on the newest windows 10 update, All my drivers are up to date, and I recently tried reinstalling League. Nothing seems to help. I just want to know is this a thing on Riots end or if there is anything I can do to try and fix this. I tried most of the stuff listed in the support faq. I really just wanted to report these issues.\r\n\r\nMy system is:\r\nNvidia GTX 980\r\nIntel I7 4770K\r\nAsus ROG Maximus VII HERO Motherboard\r\nI'm using 16GB of ram\r\nAsus ROG Swift Monitor\r\nCorsair 750W PSU\r\nISP: Shaw Communications","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-20T17:02:37.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This definitely sounds like a problem with your connection having an unstable link to the server. Champ select relies on a service called PvP.net, which synchronizes actions in the lobby and gives you notifications of actions needed to be taken.\n\nAs a first step in resolving this, I recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).

Should I create a support ticket then? \nEdit: I created a ticket seeing as how i wanted to create one before i went to bed and there was quite a few details I needed to gather and attach to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T16:41:21.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both of those steps are pretty important, so I don't suggest skipping them.
