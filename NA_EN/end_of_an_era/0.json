The client wasn't even on my task bar and appeared shortly after, gave it two minutes and it WAS STILL LOADING. I want to mention something as well, for some reason my client loads in post-game really slowly and it won't load it if I don't hit continue after a game ends, this seems to only happen to me and its tilting OUTSIDE of the game.\r\n\r\nBut, basically what happened that even closing the client itself took some effort, and when I opened it back up my Mac gave me a warning that I'm opening a program for the... first time? I don't understand how the app screwed up so bad, so here am I opening it, and  my entire mac freezes! This happens once in a while with different triggers and the new client is the cause of this since they never used to happen. I just spent five more minutes trying to reboot my mac and now I obviously just lost the game for my team since League completely murdered my FPS and literally destroyed my mac into having to reboot.\r\n\r\nThere's actually a thread regarding the alt+tab issue but the board is as equally broken and said I had to be lvl6+ to post.\r\n\r\ntldr - Alt+Tabbing triggers something that freezes the game and requires you to alt tab repeatingly and still suffer a brief FPS drop before it works. On extreme cases the client completely crashes and your computer freezes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T02:45:59.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm your Mac is definitely having a hard time processing that alt+tab for one reason or another. My best advice here would be to try running League in windowed mode to see if it still has the same problems that way.\n\nSince you also mentioned that your Mac randomly decided that it was the first time you had opened League, that leads me to believe there was a file corrupted somewhere in your game files. Let's try using the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to force a repatch to be sure that none of your files are corrupted.","replies":[]}]}
