WTF, I just sent it.\r\nThen you put a link in the email to get status updates for the ticket... but it requires me to log in... can't do that because I'm trying to get that account back from someone who stole it in Latin America. I can't even access that ticket with my secondary account here. What kind of support is this after so much money has gone into this game over the years?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T21:33:07.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll want to submit your ticket through an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) which doesn't require logging in.  You can input an email address you do have access to through that form, so you don't need to login to the ticketing center.  \n\nYou're going to get asked a lot of questions, and likely multiple times and each ticket you submit.  We need to make sure that we're speaking to the owner account, and restoring it to that single person.  We'll only restore an account if we're sure it's going back to the owner, so it's an needed safety measure.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
