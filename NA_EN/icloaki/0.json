But you created me by having such asinine rules and tos. I've done no real harm to anybody but you persist to try to discipline me by slapping me with these restrictions and permanent bans. Which is quite funny cause you think somebody will submit to you through your abuse. But every time you ban one of my accounts for mere words I'll just become that more defiant and toxic. \r\n\r\nI am toxic but I have you to thank for that.","replies":[]}
