Klepto has only a hand full of users that use it reliably. If jax is using it and you aren't punishing him atleast once outta a theoretical 5 times then you arent doing something right or its just a really bad matchup. Tanks are annoying as usually atm but everything is still pretty bot lane focused which is the real problem. \n\nKlepto helps those champions that have to take time to scale up into their powerspikes scale faster in this much faster league we have today. Problem with klepto for those using it to get a bigger lead is they either need to have a way to reliably proc it and its random so efficiency is the key. Having klepto also can somewhat make your engages or trades alot more predictable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2018-01-12T16:21:44.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it just me? you are either skulking around for upvotes or beyond stupid if you don't see the 4,000,000,000,000 \"top lane needs HUGE BUFFS\" post on the boards...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enderspider","date":"2018-01-12T13:20:01.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YuuumSenpai,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QeBhgiTL,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-01-12T10:35:08.777+0000)\n\n> The removal of fervor fucked up top lane like few other htings ever have.
