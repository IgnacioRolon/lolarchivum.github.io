Nothing but dodges even AFTER it came back to normal style draft. You have everyone from TB who is used to saying &quot;Oh I don&#039;t like that pick, I&#039;m just going to dodge&quot; in there with everyone else. Normally I could get into a TB game faster than this even if I pick top lane. But nope, we have 2 groups of different mindsets forced to play together and if someone doesn&#039;t like your pick or you took the role they wanted, it&#039;s just going to be a dodge. 5-6 dodges easily, and I&#039;m still just trying to get into the dang game. Come on man, you took down the new system pretty fast, put TB back up already. I mean...........there is no possible way you were dumb enough to delete the files for it.","replies":[]}
