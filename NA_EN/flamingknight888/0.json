So it is an escalating punishment for continued misbehavior.\n\nWhat is calling them out in game going to accomplish? Nothing except possibly annoying people. You pretty much start at your botlane at the beginning of your logs and just keep going.\n\nOthers behaviors don't excuse your behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-29T01:20:12.081+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You did nothing except flame all game.\n\nIf you have previously had a restriction, this is intended.

You even said in a few parts that you were..... im assuming recklessly going in? With the whole \"you want me to go in and taunt 2v3?\" \"Ok here goes\" commentary.... which personal experience means that you probably were trolling most of the game as well to \"make the game done and over\".\n\nAfter a 10 game chat restrict and a 25 game chat restrict, you are already on the \"watch list\" for behavior. Which means it can take a bit less to do the next punishment tier.... which honestly from your chat alone if you had 0 punishments would have probably put you at 10 game chat restrict, so it is not being more sensitive.... you were just not learning from your previous mistakes.\n\nAt a 14 day ban, there are a few suggestions that I can give to help you avoid a perma ban which will NOT be reversible and you will completely lose access to your account in league if this happens.

It would only be an escalated punishment if you went AFK, threw in some ZT words or were trolling/feeding/inting.
