There's too many people who copy&paste with \"idk who the original artist is\" or outright claim it as their own. A watermark is nothing against a bit of Photoshop.\n\nIf the original artist is pursuing a career (or even hobby) in art it's important for them to get the proper recognition they deserve for something they probably spent hours or days on.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-10-15T19:29:28.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"imo, if I ever got good enough at art for people to share it, I wouldn't care.
