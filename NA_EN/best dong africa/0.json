Let me fill you in please, so my legit brother zack raper is the original creator of the account. He didnt want to play anymore, So i did a name change on the account and linked my email to the account, this was back in season 2. Since then I have dumped atleast 600$ into my account and now that it has been stolen from me and had my debit card stolen as well, the actions riot too was to ban my account. I am really sad and dont know what to do.","replies":[]}]}]}
