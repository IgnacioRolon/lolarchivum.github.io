He has no escape mechanism, no crowd control, and is melee range. I mean Vladimir has 330 move speed, and has W(sanguine pool) to escape. Viktor has 335 ms, and W(gravity field). AND they are both ranged! As it stands, Mordekaiser is one of the easiest champions to gank in League of Legends. Again, he has melee range, no cc, no escape, and a horrible 325 ms. As someone who plays Mordekaiser mid, I have 2 suggestions:\r\n1 = Raise his ms to 340\r\n2 = Boost his defenses (Maybe a bit more starting health, armor?)\r\nI don&#039;t think he needs a major rehaul. I&#039;m not happy with his W, but otherwise I like the place his in right now. He just needs to be tankier and have more ms, to mitigate the fact that he has no cc / escape, and as such is the easiest gank target.","replies":[{"poster":"Witch of Babylon","date":"2016-09-15T22:11:19.298+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has 325 ms because his internet is very bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-09-15T20:41:21.567+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause he is meant to be a kiteable juggernaut.

Other juggernauts like Garen and Darius don't have Frozen Mallet as a core item on them, instead they have higher base movement speed and some sort of way (Garen specifically) to get into the face of the enemy carries, but Riot probably knew Rylais will stay core on him (as it was before the rework as I recall) when he has no gapclosing mechanic, and thus they might've thought that if he had that movement speed as garen or Darius have it would be pretty harder to escape him when he builds Rylais in every game probably.\n\nBy the way, I think the t3 boots / boot enchantments were still existing in game when they released juggernauts rework, and actually rushing one of these enchantments on mordekaiser to help him reach a target could cause a very deadly situation for his opponents who probably did not rush any enchantment. (I believe many morde players would give up 500 or so gold for that alacrity or furor straight after Rylais even to be able to reach their target easily, but that would end up with morde being too fast than intended once he tagged someone with his ult and permaslowed them for that 10 seconds)","replies":[{"poster":"Azrael Jiraco","date":"2016-09-16T20:34:05.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whilst this is true, lane is usually already won by someone before first items are completed.\n\nI agree with the enchantments; I bought them all the time.\n\nRylai's is only core because of his movement speed.

They get a good trade, I have to absorb two or three more auto's if they orb walk correctly.

That is called knowing your champions strengths and weaknesses, being able to understand what they truly mean and change your play style according to them, in order to perform the best on your champion.\nWritten by a jungle main so you better take the tips about ganking to your heart.\nPS, you don't need to have 124 ranked games on morde throughout 6 years to know that.","replies":[{"poster":"MultiDarkPhoenix","date":"2016-09-16T23:01:57.259+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"you completely wrecked dis guy lul\njust learn you can't convince a main who cries over his main that hes wrong, give up","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vampirekid13","date":"2016-09-15T13:08:12.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because neither vlad, which is wearing pretty much a robe, neither viktor, which is half robot doesnt have the ridiculously heavy armor mordekaiser is wearing, making him very slow due to the weight of it all.","replies":[{"poster":"JustSeba","date":"2016-09-15T13:25:54.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's a wraith!

You can't help it. Opinions are strong things. Yet my research has unveiled quite a number of things about Mordekaiser:\n1 - He's a juggernaut, yet squishier then champions like Soraka.\n2 - Unlike Soraka, he isn't meant for the back lane. He's attacks are melee, his q is melee, his w is melee range, and his e is 675 (which isn't allot for a skill that originates from the champ), and his ulti is 650 range. You need to be in the front line to deal any dmg.\n3 - Build Rylais you say? I do, every game. And its unhealthy forcing an item onto a champion. Its unhealthy forcing champions to build a certain path, because they need to make up for an overwhelming weakness. Build diversity is an important part of the game.\n4 - He was meant to be immobile. Really? Why give him any movement speed at all is he was meant to be immobile. His base stats don't make up for it (Nr. 8 lowest health pool!).\na - The fact that he was meant to be immobile doesn't mean its the best decision for the champion. Compare it with nautilus, same movement speed, but you get WAY better defensive stats, and you can use q to move around, plus you have tons of CC. You can R-E-Q and get away from a bad fight. With Mordekaiser, if a fight goes bad, that's it, you're dead.\nb - The fact that he was meant to be immobile doesn't mean he needs to have 325 ms. Darius is another immobile champion, and nobody complains about his 340 ms. Immobile means he has no escape mechanism, no dash, no ms speed.\nc - The fact that his immobile should be compensated for in other areas. Its no in his base stats, its not in his dmg output, he has no crowd control? Where is this compensation you speak of?\n5 - I will always value the opinion of someone who plays Mordekaiser, as opposed to people who haven't. The same way I would rather have heart surgery at the hands of a doctor who's done it 20 times already (ranked!) as opposed to a novice who did it twice on a training dummy (normal!). You simply have no idea what you're saying.\nBut I guess its more important for you to win this argument, instead of actually taking at look at the state of mordekaiser, and trying to promote changes that would be beneficial for the game. I've responded to all your ''reasonable'' points. Do some actual research. You won't even play him, and yet you think you're fit to judge his state.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLightBringer","date":"2016-09-16T22:10:36.976+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you responded to all my points?\nYou said I'd likely gank mordekaiser over Darius because has lower base stats.\nThat's fucking ridiculous because the things junglers care about is how is the play style of the champion much more than his base stats. You push you get ganked, especially on an escape less champion, and that makes it your bad because you fail to analyze your champions weakness and play according to it.\nAnd yea ill gank Darius more than I'll gank morde because darius's play pattern is much more aggressive (lane bully, supposed to force opponent out of lane) than morde (survive lane and scale)\n\nSoraka is a champion that her primary skill drains out a ton of her health, you'll be retarded if you expect soraka to start on 400 health. It's like expecting a champion whose primary resource bar is mana to start with low base mana.\n\nUnlike morde, soraka has 2 seconds cool down on her primary skill that drains % of her maximum health, your point?\nYou don't need to be in the front line to deal any damage, you need to be near an enemy champion to deal any damage.\n\nYou're complaining about morde having a core item. It's like a Cassio main would cry that he has to buy tear every game, a kennen main cry because he has to buy zhonya to survive or adcs to buy last whisper to be able to deal with tanks. Some champions have to buy some items to be much more viable. Morde is one of them isn't unhealthy to the game or to morde.\n\nMordekaiser was designed around being immobile, else riot wouldn't make him immobile, so stop crying about that seriously. \"Why bring him movement speed at all\" - such a tilted unserious question that shows your despair.\n\nGuess nautilus was designed about being a really tanky submarine that can lock down people. Morde is different by any mean from morde, and it's utterly stupid to compare them to each other. \n\nWhere is the compensation I speak or? His damage is insane, he is much more tanky with his shield than other champions even though he had lower base stats, especially because he can recover his shield much more than most champions can naturally recover the +30-70 base health they get over him in beginnings.\nHe also has a stupid amount of lane/map pressure with his ultimate, especially when now dragons are so prioritized and he is likely to get his hand on one and be able to force a tower with it if a minimum of 2 champions with good clear without risking being out of position appear in the lane and take it down, which applies global pressure.\nAlso his teamfight potential is very strong and might cause very impactful consequences. \nLet's imagine they have Janna Ezreal as an enemy bot lane, which you know you have no chance to reach. Does that make you useless, like it would to many assassins/champions whose primary role is to get on top of enemy carry and kill it, and are just bad picks if they can't fulfill their role? No. Because you have your ultimate. And whether you throw it on the enemy tank and decimate it with your sick damage and bot lane, or throw it on the enemy assassin who climbs on your adc and decimate it even faster with your damage because they anyways didn't build resistance, you have another unit that is almost equal to a champion in your team, and even if you can't do much with it in the teamfight, the ghost survives for a whopping 45/60/75 seconds, enough time to brute force an objective with your team. For instance if your team had a teamfight and lost 2 and enemy team lost 2 as well, you're actually in a 4v3, and you can manipulate your ghost to earn an objective (aka herald, dragon, baron) which you couldn't do with another champion. And once you have that dragon objective secured on morde, you can, or better say MUST snowball this objective into another one aka turret or baron, and force enemy team into a really awkward position where they give up one (if well played you might as well force more than one) turret, or try to contest a baron with a dragon with nearly 3k hp and 300 damage on the enemy team. Suddenly the mobility problems seem mediocre to morde compared to what his opponents are facing.\nOh yea I also forgot his totally insane dueling potential once he does get to a target, regardless of which target it is.\n\nRight now it's seems to be you who have no idea what he's talking about, especially when you, an all glorious level 4 mastery on morde ask from a player with 0 morde ranked games to tell you what his strengths are.","replies":[{"poster":"JustSeba","date":"2016-09-16T22:41:17.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm done with you.

Soraka has q specially designed to mitigate that problem. To say that you need to buy tear on cassiopeia is equally ignorant. I play her mid very much, and I prefer building her without tear. To say that Morde's dmg is insane is an uniformed and equally ignorant statement. You can't do a simple stat check it seems.
