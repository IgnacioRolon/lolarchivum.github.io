It is essentially just 5v5, but all champs have the kits they had when they were released, and all removed items and summoner spells are added back in for it. The most memorable bugs and the like would be \"features\". For instance, poppy being able to push baron, blitz flash after q, anivia can tp during egg, and things of the such. Additionally, unique passives would be removed. I thought it would be interesting to see what the game would be like mixing old things with new, and would be a cool to see how the meta of the game for the short time it would be out would change to be different just based on having items like sword of the occult, Leviathan, and maybe zhonya's ring. Also curious which jungle items people would take between the old and the new.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-12T06:29:16.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They would have to recreate everything.

There would probably need to be some employees dedicated to it for it to run smoothly on top of the server costs, any dev time spent creating a backup of the game, balancing issues, etc.\n\n I'd like to see it if it were possible, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C0NCH0BAR","date":"2019-03-12T06:18:24.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"perma-invis eve with six sunfires......
