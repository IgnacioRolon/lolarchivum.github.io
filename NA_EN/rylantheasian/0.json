All i see is you trying to tell everyone what to do, pointing out everyones mistakes, blaming everyone and especially Bard. Only time u actually mentioned inting is when enemy team pointed out that you are being toxic, in which  response u said how your entire team is \"inting\" showing that you are not willing to accept that opponent is better and that only reason you could lose is because your team was trying to lose on purpose.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kitty Cat Tosha","date":"2017-08-30T08:21:21.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're lucky it's only a chat ban, usually \"kys\" results in an instant 14 day ban.","replies":[{"poster":"RylanTheAsian","date":"2017-08-30T08:22:46.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Funny cuz people say that every single game.
