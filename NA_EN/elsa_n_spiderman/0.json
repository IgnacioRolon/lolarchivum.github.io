Example is when they made grievous wounds for self heal only... WTF? and then changes it back.\r\n\r\nNow for sure as HELL I don&#039;t trust them for removing green wards and mana pots. They haven&#039;t got a fucking clue what they&#039;re doing over there. As a support I used to ward at least 3 bushes to prevent ganks. Pink ward doesn&#039;t do anything when you&#039;re against an aggressive lane. The trinket ward cooldown is way too long for the duration they last.\r\n\r\nWhy the hell do you have to wait at least 7 seconds in fountain on an EMPTY mana bar for it to refill? It doesn&#039;t even increase overtime. Energy champs just get a slap on the wrist?? They don&#039;t have to wait for anything.
