Now my ping will randomly spike to 20-33 (which still isn't too bad in the grand scheme of things), but during those moments, I can't issue -any- movement commands or spells for 3-4 seconds. My character will literally just stand there and then the movement commands will sometimes go through after that period is over, but by then I'm usually just dead. \r\n\r\nIt's been happening every game for the past few days. I've made sure that there's no other traffic on my internet. Anyone else experiencing this problem or know of a fix? It is frustrating to randomly lose a 2v2 because you just can't do anything for 3-4 seconds.  I basically can't even queue until i know I've resolved the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T02:08:47.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds an awful lot like packet loss, so let's run a quick traceroute to be sure of what's happening before moving too much further. Grab a tool like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run a trace to 104.160.131.1, then post those results here for me to look over.

Since you ran the trace about 15~ hours after posting this, hopefully that means the packet loss had cleared up. Are you still seeing any moments where you can't move or do anything? Things might be okay now, but let if know if not so we can try a couple other things to smooth this out.","replies":[{"poster":"KING GIANNIS","date":"2018-02-17T02:58:17.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been happening a lot lately.
