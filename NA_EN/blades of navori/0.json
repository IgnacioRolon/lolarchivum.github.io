Each one is listed in order of favorites. Please take the time to read every one, thank you!\r\n\r\n1. Shift Power from Laning to Mid and Late Game\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps my favorite one since it also fixes the issue of shorter games. By adjusting the majority of champions&#039; damage from the early game to the mid to late game without making early game champions scale too hard while also ensuring late game champions don&#039;t dominate the game by not adjusting them too much, if at all this pretty much ensures that you&#039;ll have games focused more around mid-late game team fights, epic battles and less on someone~~ ganking top at 2:45~~ snowballing and carrying the game off of the mistakes of a single player. This actually creates a safety net overall and I believe this concept should be the foundation and all succeeding suggestions should be built off of this. It eliminates snowballing, creates a more team fight oriented game, it makes it longer, everything the community has been pretty much asking for.\r\n\r\nLate game champions don&#039;t get dumpstered for having lower base stats and damage because other champions simply have higher stats and they also don&#039;t have super power scaling because early game champions have their power shifted just a bit more toward later stages of the game so they have a chance to compete. One issue I can see is the incentive to not make too many engagements in laning but at the same time is that something we need when we&#039;ll be having more skirmishes later on anyway? It also prevents too much of hard snowballing.\r\n\r\n2. Increase Base Armor and Magic Resist\r\n\r\nMost champions received sizable increasing to Armor and MR with the introduction of the new season. Perhaps increasing _all_ base armor and MR (except on minions, but including turrets) by an additional 5-10 points and maybe growth by 0.1 - 0.25 with no compensation buffs or changes for damage will mitigate some of the power creep. With no changes to damage this will remedy the problem by a small amount and some new steps looking forward can help fix the problem it even more. This is just a minor step, but a potentially good one.\r\n\r\n3. Increase Base Health\r\n\r\nThis would have to go hand in hand with armor and magic resist so it would be fair, but increasing base health by a little bit, again with no changes to damage or compensations, will help fix the power creep. I believe combined with an increase to base armor and magic resist the first few really good steps to fixing the power creep will be underway, but you can&#039;t really do this without number 2, then the problem wouldn&#039;t really be on its way to being fixed.\r\n\r\n4. Reduce Base AD\r\n\r\nA more &quot;iffy&quot; solution in my opinion. Base AD isn&#039;t a _big_ issue for many champions and even still robbing early game bruisers of too much of their base AD makes them less of a bully and more of a mean kid who gives you spiteful glances once in a while. Not only that, but this only fixes a marginal amount of a growing problem. Maybe they could tone a few champions and leave others alone.\r\n\r\nAnyway these are just a few of my thoughts. I personally believe the majority of the power creep comes from early engagements that are just too reliable and too safe a strategy to not abuse. You have incredibly high damage so you roll over turrets and carry the game off of that. Part of the turret problem comes from the fact there is just too much damage in the game, a lot of it being early. Ever hear the joke &quot;Back once, lose turret&quot;? \r\n\r\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}\r\n\r\n Good luck on the Fields of Justice and look for a brighter tomorrow!","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-04-08T19:05:44.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with increase base armor/magic resist and maybeeee health? maybe.\n\n Everything else, eh not really. \n\n1. even though you say what you say, it will still end up being who has more late game champs while everyone safe plays until late.  incoming GP/ryze every game... while at the same time early game champs will suffer hard for the extreme safe play that will emerge.\n\n2. reducing base AD, might (depending how much of a nerf happens) result in some unfortunate stuff like AP mages returning to the top lane and (prob unlikely, but still possible) adc role again\n\n\n\nAll they really needed to do was compensate for the mass loss of armor/magic resist loss from runes, which they really didn't do.","replies":[{"poster":"Blades of Navori","date":"2018-04-08T19:29:35.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Too Unlucky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TY9lnRcd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-08T19:05:44.527+0000)\n>\n> I agree with increase base armor/magic resist and maybeeee health? maybe.\n> \n>  Everything else, eh not really. \n> \n> 1. even though you say what you say, it will still end up being who has more late game champs while everyone safe plays until late.  incoming GP/ryze every game... while at the same time early game champs will suffer hard for the extreme safe play that will emerge.\n> \n> 2. reducing base AD, might (depending how much of a nerf happens) result in some unfortunate stuff like AP mages returning to the top lane and (prob unlikely, but still possible) adc role again\n> \n> \n> \n> All they really needed to do was compensate for the mass loss of armor/magic resist loss from runes, which they really didn&#x27;t do.\n\nTo an extent I feel like the power creep was more like a power spike since some champions got some compensation while others got none so some matchups have insanely high damage outputs while others have unreasonable, but not absurd, levels. Regardless, you end up with too much damage in any matchup. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaironen","date":"2018-04-08T19:16:01.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That no magic resist is especially bad at the bot lane where a janna w is like an explosion just went off.

Like if i take this rune it beats this champion, not spam x rune because its stronk and meta. Make reasoning/rationale be important when picking your runes. The runes feel like you pick fleet footwork because its better than lethal tempo and press the attack. The runes should fit the champion like a glove that was made for their  hand only. What I would do is split each role into what kind of champions play in that role. It would go something like this...\n\nwell you have poke, heal, and engage supports. So for healing supports we should have a rune that give a boost to shields and heals and that be the keystone. Then because engage is supposed to counter healers with all in engage and tankiness we should give them a rune that helps them beat healers. Maybe we make them bind to an ally once only like kalista does at the beginning of the game. Then that ally does more dmg throughtout the entire game. Then we have poke champions which beat engage champions. So maybe we make their poke do more every 20 seconds kind of like scorch but a bit stronger to where regen doesn't undo the poke damage.\n\n^^ you see by understanding common elements of game design you can easily make meaningful keystone design easy. Then you design the rest of the keystones around things that role has difficult. We think about engage champions and the issues the have like being poked down, but the thing is we dont want to make a rune like crysalis because crysalis makes poke champions shit. So we need to incentivize tanks to bide their time and wait for that juice engage. So we can make it to where the next cc ability will cc for up to 50% long based on how long its been since you attacked an enemy champion. We are not breaking poke supports, but we are also not breaking tank/engage. So we continually do this until the support ru nes are finished and then since adc's have to rely on supports we design adcs around the support runes.\n\nAnother thing I would say is that controlling game length is being done completely wrong. Instead of changing champion stats or forcing people to fight over cannon minions we should look at towers. One design issue i have is that the first towers you can attack in all lanes scale from 0:00 to the 15:00 minute mark and that is fine, but the next tower in lane (the inner tower i think) starts off with way too little hp. at 15 min the outter tower has like 75 armor and mr while the inner has 55 armor and mr. We shouljd use towers as a way to control the length of games. Since they are the objective that controls the length of lane phase. What this does is it allows late game champs to farm up safely and scale (you know, be viable) while also rewarding players who dumpster all over they enemy  laner greatly. This is great for both passive players who need the tower there to do something in the game as well as the players who are very skilled and can just thrash all over the enemy. We can achieve this by changing armor  and mr of the tower. This would also fix the 4 - 5 people in bot lane ganking at 10 minutes issue. (I hate this with a passion).\n\nThere are more intelligent ways to design this, you just need the right people to do so. I am actually a software engineer too. js riot lol.","replies":[]}]}
