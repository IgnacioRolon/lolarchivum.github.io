Fixes will go live in the next patch (6.10) that&rsquo;ll get rid of the annoying error message popping up when you enter lobby. We&rsquo;re also fixing it so your friends list will sort correctly when someone goes offline, and you&rsquo;ll be able to set club tags again. Sorry for these issues and any confusion, and I&rsquo;ll stick around this thread for a little while to answer any questions you&rsquo;re itching to ask about clubs or the friends list. \r\n\r\nGLHF with your clubs and on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Corrupt Talon","date":"2016-10-15T01:46:29.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Riot Games.

Hope this is a good enough place.\n\nI discovered a bug with Taliyah which i figured has probably been noticed by now, but thought i'd do my best to report the issue anyway. League of Legends 6.10.16_05_13_13_53.\n\n I casted my ultimate in between blue buff and the wolves (top right team) and about 5-10 minutes later when i come back to that spot and try to cross where the wall 'used' to be, the navigation mesh seemed to believe the wall was still there and started to navigate me around the walls. I was able to pass through if I were to click through it in 'baby steps', but this was very slow and jittery. I only found this was a problem in one scenario, but to be completely honest, during that game I never got the chance to even try replicate the results.\n\nI'm sorry I wrote this bug here, i was unable to write it in the appropriate area, so if anyone could pass this bug along for me, i'd appreciate it a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"68092871_DEL","date":"2016-05-17T12:36:34.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also found a bug in the options menu in-game.
