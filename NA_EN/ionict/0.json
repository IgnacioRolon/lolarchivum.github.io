The queue pops for everyone in my group except me \r\n2. Everyone goes the champ select while I stay behind in the lobby \r\n3. League client doesn't launch at all sometimes \r\n4. To get into the actual game from champ select, I have to close my client then relaunch as an admin to get into the loading screen\r\n\r\nI've tried uninstalling then reinstalling multiple times with no improvement, and these problems have caused me to get a rather large queue timer.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-18T01:49:17.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If relaunching as admin has been able to fix this each time, it sounds like the client may not have the full admin privileges it needs in order to launch the game successfully the first time.
