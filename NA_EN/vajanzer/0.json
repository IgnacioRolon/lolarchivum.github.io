The only way to fix it would be to hold the power button and turn it off. I sent it to the manufacturers and they replaced a part but it didnt fix my problem. So yesterday i went to best buy and returned it for a brand new laptop, same exact one and Im still having the same problem. Ive used the same wifi on my other laptop, which is 4 years old and Ive never had this problem. So im curious if its just this exact brand that has issues. The model is Asus Q504ua. My roomate is also using the same wifi connection and never experiences the same problem. Ive probably had it freeze between 30-40 times and I have so many leaves due to this problem. I dont care about the leaver buster i just want to get this problem fixed, does anybody have any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"YOUUUUUUUUUUUU","date":"2016-08-30T22:15:32.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's happening to me too.
