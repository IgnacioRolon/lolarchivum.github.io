A lot of us enjoy your game and are willing to put in a lot of man hours and have fun. If we cannot even have a steady frame rate and or constantly disconnecting, how can we enjoy the spoils of war? This is going past hardware, some upgrade their drivers and get a bugsplat spam, including me. If people were at 140 fps. and had a steady server about 3 days before 5.4, then drop to 30 - 15 whilst continuous disconnecting , there's a serious issue. I'd love a hotfix that'd help suffice all the agitation that has accumulated all over League's population. I'm sure you're aware of the situation, but we haven't gotten a conclusive response. Giving us links for self-troubleshooting isn't sufficing for the dilemma at hand. Informing us that a hotfix is coming would be nice. Since you don't have a customer service number and your ticket service is on high volume, what else is there to do? Just say oh well, there goes all the money I spent on League?  This isn't just a oh let's have fun non-stop, it's also a business, and it'd be nice if the professionalism would be evoked more often, and not left in the blinds to gather dust. Anyways, I'm just looking forward to enjoying the rift someday, hopefully soon.","replies":[{"poster":"DONT NEEEED TEAM","date":"2015-03-06T01:57:57.822+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup was forced to buy a new pc to play a day ago no more money for rp :( 1000 bucks for a pc that will run at 60 fps when it gets cut from its 120 fps ... no more cash for rp ...","replies":[{"poster":"Verbal Disease","date":"2015-03-06T02:13:28.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm contemplating that as well, but hoping they fix this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PenetrationPaul","date":"2015-03-06T04:44:00.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"God dammit riot.
