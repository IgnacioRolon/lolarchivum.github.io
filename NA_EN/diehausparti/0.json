After opening the launcher, and finishing the setup I am greeted with an error message that says \"the older version of League of Legends cannot be removed. Please contact your technical support group\". My first thought was to go into my programs and simply try to uninstall the old version of league (which I had already uninstalled once). I tried to uninstall league from my programs in control panel, but it said that it was unable to uninstall it. However, when I search for league I'm unable to open anything related to the game which is extremely puzzling. Basically the my computer thinks the game is installed (it's not), but I'm unable to open the game. I will list below all the various things I have tried to resolve this issue. Any other ideas would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n1. Tried manually finding any files related to League of Legends and deleted them.\r\n2. Cleaned my registry with CCleaner and it didn't work\r\n3. Tried installing league with the local administrator account but for some reason when I log in to the administrator account, I'm unable to do anything. I cant open any applications, my desktop is black, I cant use the windows search bar, I genuinely cant do a thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease if anyone has any clue at all as to what I could do to resolve this issue I would appreciate it immensely.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T15:36:24.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the client wasn't initially removed as intended, but no worries.

In the hextech repair tool, it seems I need to find and select the lol.launcher.exe file in the directory where League of Legends is installed for it to work, but I deleted it.
