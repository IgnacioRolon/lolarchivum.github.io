Some of you may remember me from the real GD, and some of you may have forgotten because I'm not active anymore. And some of you may not remember me at all because you joined after the destruction of GD.\nI just came to say goodbye. Just kidding.\nRiot destroyed the community we had before, when pretty much everybody was on good terms with each other (except for some), and there was not much seperating us apart. They actually destroyed something that they supported, a nice community. Sure, we joked around and insulted each other, and sometimes just flat out insulted each other, but it wasn't as vile as it is now. We're seperated, we don't like each other, and some of the best posters have left. This is a community?\nIf Riot just left GD alone, nothing horrible would have happened.\n\nsigning off, GD (i'll reply to posts if need be)\n\nEDIT: you guys break my heart\nill leave at the end of Christmas","replies":[]}
