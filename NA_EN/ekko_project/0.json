There are 5 \"lanes\" (priorities is a better word), 6 roles, and a shit ton of sub-roles; even if they somehow decide to max ban on one role, there's still a whole lot of champs for that role and a whole lot of champs that can fulfill other roles in your main's place in case you aren't proficient in those other champs for the role you want.\nIf you're having to worry about 2 extra bans ruining your game, I'd have to say you should be playing more champs and more playstyles. If you're having to worry about 2 extra bans for both your opponent's team and *your* team ruining your game, then there's a Report option at the end of the game for the ones ruining your game for you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kledy McKledFace","date":"2016-09-11T18:16:44.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Technolians,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=802bYEBK,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-11T17:46:38.548+0000)\n>\n> I find that 10 bans will cause issues, especially if targeting a single role.\n\nwouldnt be a prolem if they were actually balancing their game","replies":[]},{"poster":"GerAvos","date":"2016-09-11T18:11:47.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would people target a single role.
