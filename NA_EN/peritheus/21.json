She literally is the bottom tier of {{champion:22}}  and {{champion:127}} when they compete.\r\n1. Her q with big base dmg is now literally like a sad single auto attack dmg, and it&#039;s knockup time is .5 while not knocking up those around the target hit. 11 sec still ,flat out nerf for a mere 10 mana cost and 2 sec early off that gives diminishing returns per point 2&gt;1.5&gt;1&gt;.5&gt;same\r\n2. Her w isn&#039;t an aa reset anymore and now you have to wait a whole 1sec to do pitiful ad dmg that scales with health while costing a HUGE amount of mana while scaming players saying she&#039;s just like{{champion:236}}  more like {{champion:44}}  , wake up sheeple, her old w allowed her to do dmg in an aoe while moving for 4 whole secs while freely aa and applying her old passive with ap scaling %max health magic dmg with ease clearing minions, superminons, and that&#039;s right teamfights, This w does no justice except troll your teammates with it&#039;s skill of moving creeps out of your teammates skillshots or into their turret missing the cs they wanted to have been freezed also as a &quot;poke from afar&quot; even though I&#039;m suppose to be constantly in your face while your cc&#039;d but it&#039;s not even literally poking, it&#039;s more like a lvl 1 {{champion:16}} bannana with a little bit of {{champion:104}} short knockback, not a {{champion:126}} &quot; I drop an Acceleration Gate and blast &lsquo;em with a Hyper Charge. Face the future!&quot;\r\n3.Just like {{champion:201}}  they said, passive only applys to that&#039;s right melee users, so sej support is dead to ranged carrys{{item:3070}}  , it doesn&#039;t even apply to super minions and do legit dmg they just slapped old w %health dmg and max monster dmg to large monsters and champs only lul this,also it&#039;s a old {{champion:44}} point and click stun on max frost targets.\r\n4.Single target only stun, pitiful dmg pointblank, {{champion:34}}  aoe knockoff with being empowered 2 secs later to do a {{champion:20}} slow 1/4 dmg explosion that mostly everyone walks out of don&#039;t even bother using this ability to engage first It consumes your e&#039;s passive which makes it useless.Also flashing into her ult is viable and safe to save your carrys\r\n5.Passive is broken omg, get over it people it&#039;s a {{champion:157}} shield {{champion:90}}passive {{champion:33}}curl{{champion:12}} short ulty and it only lasts for 1/2/3 secs while recharging at 9 sec from not taking dmg from champs and large monsters, 1 auto, 1 dot, 1 poke, true dmg and even {{champion:48}}  is all u need to stop her and it has to wait yet again for another 9 secs, while it is nice having +100 x2 your arm and mr, it doesn&#039;t really save you from jgling creeps and invades early.You are also immune to movement slowing effects too if it&#039;s up, but man it feels awful having to back so early and dying to jg mobs with her low dmg of waiting to get a 2nd e off.\r\n*Tldr  {{champion:113}}  is legit being forced into the tank role and being jg only having to take cinderhulk now since her base dmg and clear rates w/out it are abysmal, ap sej is gone and sej support is dead with Ranged carries,She used to be her own unique 5 man game changing ultimate that depended on team to follow up but now is a abomination of different champs in 1 with being a meatshield so nobody really knows what she does which is why her wr has skyrocketed .~Combo q aa, {{item:3748}}, aa /w or just w, e aa,{{summoner:4}}  away, r aa.","replies":[{"poster":"k w√¨x","date":"2017-05-09T13:55:15.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"New Sejuani is absolutely terrifying. Her survivability is through the roof. Her damage and CC are absolutely insane.

Her DPS falls off throughout the fight when compared to other tanks, in some situations it's higher than other tanks on the engage but that is it.\n\nAlso she was already nerfed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kaisergarde","date":"2017-05-09T14:39:42.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support Sej dead?
