All lanes lost,0 turrets, 0 drags and they expect me to sit in base and get leaverbuster for afk, it&#039;s so un fair to try to farm when you are lvls behind and get 1 shotted by the merciless assassin and so in order to catchup in gold and xp I need to get some kills/assists by ganking cause minion xp early is pitiful,but it never works out when it&#039;s so close like 1 hp or 1 auto/ability away from getting them and my team purposefully gave up and harassed me+ flame, while the enemy team agreed to join in the harassment and I&#039;ve been on a bad losing streak since It&#039;s been a while since I played and laning phase is nonexistent after a point where I can&#039;t even walk outside base to farm jg/creeps  3 steps without getting into a fight with the enemy team that has happened multiple times and it&#039;s like late game is decided by 10 mins, It&#039;s pure bs and a unfun depressing experience where comebacks aren&#039;t a real thing anymore when u get 100 0 curb 1 sided stomp in .2 secs or the other way around, it&#039;s not even a game at this point, just needless suffering(didn&#039;t hit lvl 6 till 13 mins) when you have to wait for  a maybe 15 mins (5 needed vote) to get out cause the games decided by champ select, 7 mins in,that&#039;s how awful this knock off copy cat moba is. Guess trying doesn&#039;t get an A for effort.Skill +strategy is gone, game has turned casual, but definitely not friendly in the slightest.\r\n\r\nI really don&#039;t understand why I should be Suspended for 14 days for a cruel bad &quot;game&quot;when I&#039;ve seen plenty of players that belittle others and feed alot get away with it, but when it comes to me going over 10 deaths when the gold u get is pathetically something like less than a cannon minion and  playstyle similar to singed contributing to late game, hence giving opponents bigger bountys(actual strategy), farming, split pushing,ganking. It&#039;s absurd how poorly managed rito as a whole besides prob the art sound,lore?,gd,memes and games, team has become when their ego goes over their heads popular games must revolve around 1% lcs  and slams the doors shut on their whole starting community with no reason answered why they became more strictly merciless,refusing to answer unhealthy issues brought up for years that repeat, hell even all the champs &quot;recently&quot; released are all depressing, edgy, dark,serious to show the recent gloomy years of how fun unique chill rito has fallen so low into the gutter.You know it&#039;s bad when your 50+offline friendlist that used to play for years stop within these recent 3 seasons and even bronze friends, the 1s that want you to play with them with their heart of gold and able to have fun in game, isn&#039;t even able to anymore so they quit, disgusting.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-08-04T00:10:45.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You atleast did more damage than several people in the game, annie is an outdated champion that is not suited in this meta where everyone has mobility, not to mention her short range, ofc youre gonna feed, while tear is a considerable buy as a support due to the fact that it gives mana and can eventually be upgraded into a heavy duty cdr ap mana and anti burst item...it put you at a further disadvantage because it delayed your magic pen items which most ap supports rely on.\n\n\nSorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-08-04T03:56:50.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sold my Items at the end for a tear, Why say sorry when it's clearly ritos fault for not balancing around the rest of the champs and instead of reworking every single 1.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Douglas Funnie","date":"2018-08-04T01:15:09.844+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"You straight up intentionally fed, dude.

And that I wasn't even allowed to lvl up as the opponent seem to insta kill me when I got near the wave. You know that whole it's faster dying than backing lvl 1? and that death respawn timers don't matter early and when ur low lvl you get back into the fray so damn quick, I think I spent a solid 7 mins trying to get to lvl 2, and upon being near an enemy champs death around 10 mins I lvl'ed up 3 times just from that alone. So No it's not fking justified at all when rito trys to make a shape shift a strategic, unique, every1 gets a chance early,mid,late game counter picks,every champ is viable even if your bad, into a fking 10min\"lategame\" meta 1shot aram fiesta run it down at eachother type of bs fighting flashy game, Is that Fun for you to play? Sitting in the side lines as you watch the whole team collapses, along with the towers your supposed \"last line of defence\" thats a wet noodle as they don't do their job, cause wowee it sure is fun standing around and not \"playing\" cause you can't get past them to farm, even if you group, they are just Giant consuming snowballs of burst. Because clearly you're whiteknighting rito dk  if you haven't gotten bans before. It's not fair and clearly your view is skewed from ignorance since you believe this is so called \"justice\"? Then why does it continue to happen more than ever with nothing truly solved? No... It's not really the players fault but majoritylys Rito ignoring it, They want shorter death timers, shorter fights, mobility to get back into the fray, it's part of their plan for the game but it's really causing the community to legit feel cancer int as I've legit had games where both sides get like 70 to 50 kills in fking 30 mins so no. It's not ok to see the 18/2 varus, in 15 mins, no it's not ok to see the 32/6 rengar in 20 mins, It's unhealthy as hell so that is your so called Justice that you defend. Simpleton Whose side are you even on? The veteran communitys pleads that go ignored  or Ritos loyal disposeable mooks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-08-04T15:27:14.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also you posted this thread in the wrong section, there was no gameplay because you wernt allowed to play. lol\n\nMaybe post it in the bugs or player behavior and moderation section.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-08-04T16:54:18.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is player behavior not a reflection of gameplay?
