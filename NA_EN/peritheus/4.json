AP completely is stopped at mid game to late falling off hard while ad eve still can dominate all stages and clear faster than ap and actually assassinate the adc It was so good that when they flashed/dash away, your MS along with ult execute catches up to their range and  muwah, just makes it all 2 clean.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s about sending a message, that eve can still be played in her awesome as steroid old way,and it throws players off a loop since you try to go ad on an ap only champ after they built mr. It&#039;s soo good I legit got S- and S and I&#039;m not even an eve main not even lvl 4 while the scoring system is rework eve to old eve of course you&#039;re not gonna be rengar, xinzhao, rhaast lvls of snowball cheese where they can go 20/2/12 in 25 mins off 1st blood and definitely not top champ dmg either 3-4th place, but I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be clearing total dmg far superior like master yi 45 min afk farms 0 ganks kind of deal is enough to hinder their squishies and jungler as you constantly farm and roam or just sit around a wall with a ward beside it and wait for the squishy to walk right past it to meet their widow maker and she has  so much more potential but I&#039;m not that good soo. Try and make a awesome road for us ad eve lovers, even if it&#039;s only short.","replies":[]}
