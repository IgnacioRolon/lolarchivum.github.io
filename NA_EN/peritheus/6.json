I was looking at replay and saw, sigh yes... a ally turret shot shooting cho dead body at the enemys turret while enemy akali farmed  annnnd It crashed the replay when I tried to find out where it came from.\r\n\r\nI shutdown the frozen pc and It took absurdly long to bootup like a whole 8+mins of loading ,when I came to open up league during the please wait while everything is loading phase, It told me I had to accept the Terms of Service and it forgot my un, Remember me  was unsaved(before saved), so I was a bit concerned if It was like I entered my account for someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Sidia","date":"2018-03-02T09:33:31.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nif you shut down your computer while the client is doing anything it is possible that you crash some client files.
