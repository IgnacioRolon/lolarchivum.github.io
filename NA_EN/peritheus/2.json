{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-11T10:04:59.207+0000","title":"Reported for being honest and talking2much/not talking in silvers,wrongly punished","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"1.Alright the story is I told the truth, my opinion, in my last game, and I was punished wrongly, by a group that bandwagon&#039;d together to report me.\n\nThey refused to ff 1/4 when it was a clear loss that I predicted 20 min s earlier in the game.\n\nThey flamed and raged at my opinion while being inconsiderate to the fact I&#039;m playing Leona in silvers, and everyone knows that Leona practically feeds for engaging but gets her team the kill locking down their carry.\n\nThey constantly ran away from my engages  again and again like they were purposely avoiding me after drama time with cam.\n\nGuess supports don&#039;t matter in their eyes after all it&#039;s a typical low elo experience you can&#039;t find  anywhere else, if you want out just get some smurfs, it&#039;s that&#039;s simple.\n\n This camile had the audacity to speak to me saying if we win/lose, I&#039;m reporting you, the reason? Int, after she complained about how whiny my opinion was while having the same amount of deaths as me really?\n\nIn silvers, communication is key you know  and if you&#039;re gonna prolong a game to 45ish mins after I analyzed this losing game beyond 25 mins just blows hard.\n\n I saw that our teamfight sucks, we barely  even win, pressure of contesting is awful 2, can&#039;t do baron,drags, or even get towers as we all huddle up for 5 mins circle jerking in mid lane unable to budge them at all, pointless, a waste of time.\n\n Sure we rocked hard 20 mins snowball where the enemy team said report jinx for inting even though she did her best lvl 3 and then the lvl 6 destroyed her.\n\nI practically roamed around the map getting free kills for my team top mid, jg objectives, and when the late game came around, it was all for naught.\n\n My team&#039;s flaming me as we get tilted off the face of the earth,both midlaners are calling each other trash when one of them dies, nothing&#039;s happening when we group and if we engaged, we just lose the trade, if we split push, they just pick us off, if we try to baron/elder, we get killed because it&#039;s warded.\n\n But these players just don&#039;t understand, the game&#039;s nowadays suppose to be a 20 min snowball 1 sided unfun toxic fest with going longer means they have better team comp to wreck us.\n\nRanked really takes it on the edge for harsh punishments as it&#039;s 10x more frustrating because there&#039;s a certain type of grade a ahole that just says i&#039;m going to report and rallys up people to report them with unjust cause as they get blamed on harder for prolonging ff votes for the inevitable losing game.\n\n Silv4 here, 20ish games while my team has have over 100s with cam being 300 and still they don&#039;t expect trash players like me. I was honor lvl 3 now i&#039;m lvl 1, chat restricted for 10 games, while they are free 2 go ty riot for understanding to not take the side of the weak in low elo but to take the majority  vote of a bandwagon group of misfits hardstuck in silver elohell with a messed up mindset to screw me over. balanced like you guys balancing the game.\n\n If you honestly punished me for saying f off then you legit need to be punished by actually stepping on Legos barefoot, this Camille was a condescending prick instigating players like me, that&#039;s not exactly healthy for a team oriented ranked environment, But I&#039;m not gonna let someone like that walk all over me and neither should anyone else either.\n\n  2nd game.Are you serious? I got reported when I had a team had a jgler autofilled to that role and can&#039;t play, but I offered up my midlane instead of the laggy toplaner as I am getting flamed by my bot and their team early game for playing off meta while joking around with a probally smurf zed with drunk lee sin in low silver game.\n\nI was criticizing myself, them, and my team in playful sarcastic manner having FUN in ranked, no joke, it was fun asf experience having less reaction time than a drunk lee sin as I smite the drag at 750 for 720 and just to have him smite it, and slowly walk to the wall, missing the snare and hop out I was hopeless.\n\nHe pulled off the flash insec after  4 times and I was playing morg you know, I coulda just spellshielded all these cc the whole game, but I was so sleepy and am only lvl  2 mastery as he chanted how&#039;d you like dem drunk apples, saying how unbelievable it is that he&#039;d find a game where drunk people still win.\nWe lost and I built 6 ruby sightstones at the end saying vision is key, to hide off that I may or may not be the sup, they said nice build lul as I tell them good luck with your hangover at work, but to think I still got reported for a hate grudge,talking 2 much, or just being really bad is unjust, plain wrong as day in ranked.\n \n It&#039;s the type of wrong when 2 girls get in a catfight and they hold grudges for life against eachother but when 2 guys fight they acknowledge each others strength and laugh it off with a drink becoming pals. Dislike me for talking I guess, since I&#039;m so bad, you know there&#039;s a mute option but everyone forgets it and rather just trash talk banter and vigilante reports thinking they sjw. I&#039;ll accept a smurf, if they acknowledge they are, and not harass us low elo scrubs about how bad we are then it&#039;s all good, we probally never get a chance to test out our skill differences with a uncoordinated team usually in low elo that isn&#039;t going to flame,afk,troll,feed,rookie to ranked.\n \n3.This here below is my 1st game after game lobby of being wrongly chat restricted on the verge of being reported by 2 teammates or more as they enemy team pitied my team for having a chat restricted &quot;troll&quot; saying stuff like he&#039;s already chat restricted lets get him perma banned folks, pls report so and so because they can&#039;t defend themselves for being unable to type in all chat, and only allowed 1 message recharged every 300 yrs ~~3mins~~, out of 5  It was my first time and it sucks.\n\n4th. Wow what a message that Rito gives you, play without being aggro in chat, Other players JUDGED that your COMMUNICATION to be FAR BELOW the STANDArDS of the League COMMunity, vast majority agrees that everyone DESERVES RESPECT on the rift, continue speaking this way and you&#039;ll be chat restricted and risk account suspension, hmm wow let&#039;s see, that statement in my opinion is complete pure bs and false,I was called bad where are you getting your STANDArdS? Huh what proof!??, Oh you must mean those little surveys that nobody really truthfully answered/ignored as they joked with it as it being a joke. So in ranked it&#039;s either play like a silent punching bag, where you get harassed with no one to defend you, or do you talk out aloud alot,able to defend yourself and others, so you don&#039;t become a ticking timebomb eventually going to spew toxic harassment everywhere, but people find you annoying so they won&#039;t mute you, just flame and report you, lose/lose situation here.\nRito don&#039;t pull this nonsensical 1 side of the story without revealing the rest of the content, with 0 context makes people more guilty then it seems while sweeping the evidence under the rug of why people act this way doesn&#039;t exactly make better decisions of people.\nP.s. how do you put these logs as links? It makes the post look bad and obnoxiously long while being poorly organized zzZ.\n                           Game 1\nPeritheus: snare stun\nPeritheus: ded\nPeritheus: lol that stun shoudln&#039;t hit\nPeritheus: she did good early though ;c\nPeritheus: ;c\nPeritheus: wow\nPeritheus: gg\nPeritheus: no\nPeritheus: it is\nPeritheus: what I mean is\nPeritheus: we have 0 pressure on turrets\nPeritheus: so they just gonna hit lategame and dunk us\nPeritheus: we can&#039;t ven take baron\nPeritheus: because I went mr instead of ad\nPeritheus: our teamfight sucks\nPeritheus: see\nPeritheus: truly an imaculate teamfight\nPeritheus: I just don&#039;t want to waste time\nPeritheus: Don&#039;t expect yourself so short\nPeritheus: 50 min game to just be a defeat after a 20 min stomp\nPeritheus: It&#039;s because my team&#039;s holding me hostage\nPeritheus: pls end to get me outta here\nPeritheus: fuck off cam\nPeritheus: I&#039;m s5\nPeritheus: and you&#039;re attitude is pure bs\nPeritheus: ez game bois\nPeritheus: For what camile?\nPeritheus: saying the obvious of what&#039;s going on in this match?\nPeritheus: you have no hard evidence\nPeritheus: or proof\nPeritheus: Who do you think you are?\nPeritheus: a smurf in silvers?\nPeritheus: what\nPeritheus: do you not expect trash players like me in ur games?\nPeritheus: huh\nPeritheus: fed bot?\nPeritheus: r u joking?\nPeritheus: hey remember when u guys were liike\nPeritheus: reportj inx for inting?\nPeritheus: and my teams flaming bot for feeding bot lul\nPeritheus: 0 contesting what so ever\nPeritheus: why can&#039;t u guys understand\nPeritheus: do you see this afk\nPeritheus: in base\n\n                  Game 2\nPeritheus: filthy top laner stole my role\nPeritheus: Lol\nPeritheus: I have 10% spell vamp\nPeritheus: nah\nPeritheus: thy weak\nPeritheus: back\nPeritheus: ?\nPeritheus: don&#039;t want 2 be cheesed\nPeritheus: ty\nPeritheus: hehe\nPeritheus: wow\nPeritheus: what as cirpter\nPeritheus: ur such a cheater\nPeritheus: tri hard in s5\nPeritheus: also hitting that ddos\nPeritheus: he&#039;s triharding\nPeritheus: s5 truly agutter place\nPeritheus: triharddd\nPeritheus: tri hartd]\nPeritheus: why do i get games with trolls like this\nPeritheus: gimme a smurf on my team pls\nPeritheus: he&#039;s smurfing\nPeritheus: I can see his blue\nPeritheus: shut up\nPeritheus: You shoulda picked a viable jungler me\nPeritheus: and not play brain dead champs like cuckerino \nPeritheus: oh now he&#039;s talking big and bad\nPeritheus: who tf do u think u are zed?\nPeritheus: a msurf?\nPeritheus: is that all u can do?\nPeritheus: harass people?\nPeritheus: in low elo cause they bad?\nPeritheus: I&#039;m coming in bb\nPeritheus: cvoming nhot\nPeritheus: REEEE\nPeritheus: IO\nPeritheus: I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m, the trolling 1 here\nPeritheus: no ult zed\nPeritheus: are you not quickcasting annie lul\nPeritheus: it&#039;s over\nPeritheus: I&#039;m demoralized\nPeritheus: I lost to drunks\nPeritheus: LOL\nPeritheus: whaaa\nPeritheus: you telling me\nPeritheus: I smited the drag\nPeritheus: at 750\nPeritheus: for 720\nPeritheus: reeeee\nPeritheus: our gnar&#039;s lagging 26 ms, excuses excuses\nPeritheus: lolol\nPeritheus: yeah ddos\nPeritheus: xd\nPeritheus: he said it&#039;s his brain\nPeritheus: he can&#039;t keep up with the speed\nPeritheus: It&#039;s not lucky crit\nPeritheus: If only I had actually shielded myself\nPeritheus: idk about this game\nPeritheus: It feels wrong to try to win against drunk people\nPeritheus: aren&#039;t we taking advantage?\nPeritheus: and isn&#039;t it criminal??\nPeritheus: reeeee\nPeritheus: loolol\nPeritheus: yeah be he drunk\nPeritheus: ^ sleep, drunk, needs water for the hangover etc\nPeritheus: ;c\nPeritheus: I&#039;ve been hitting the surrender prompt like 6 times this game\nPeritheus: I&#039;m being held hostage halp me\nPeritheus: vision is key\nPeritheus: wp &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-11T11:10:22.765+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":">They refused to ff 1/4 when it was a clear loss that I predicted 20 min s earlier in the game.\n\nSo, for 20 minutes, you were negative and brought your team down because they didn't want to ff? Yes, that is a negative attitude.\n\n> Peritheus: wow\n> Peritheus: gg\n> Peritheus: no\n> Peritheus: it is\n> Peritheus: what I mean is\n> Peritheus: we have 0 pressure on turrets\n> Peritheus: so they just gonna hit lategame and dunk us\n> Peritheus: we can't ven take baron\n> Peritheus: because I went mr instead of ad\n> Peritheus: our teamfight sucks\n> Peritheus: see\n> Peritheus: truly an imaculate teamfight\n> Peritheus: I just don't want to waste time\n\nLots of passive aggressiveness here. I get you're trying to legitimately discuss the viability of the game, but things like \"gg\" and the sarcasm in \"imaculate teamfight\" are unnecessary.\n\n> Peritheus: It's because my team's holding me hostage\n> Peritheus: pls end to get me outta here\n> Peritheus: fuck off cam\n> Peritheus: I'm s5\n> Peritheus: and you're attitude is pure bs\n> \n> Peritheus: Who do you think you are?\n> Peritheus: a smurf in silvers?\n> Peritheus: what\n> Peritheus: do you not expect trash players like me in ur games?\n> \n> Peritheus: reportj inx for inting?\n> Peritheus: and my teams flaming bot for feeding bot lul\n> Peritheus: 0 contesting what so ever\n> Peritheus: why can't u guys understand\n> Peritheus: do you see this afk\n> Peritheus: in base\n\nThen, after they don't surrender, you proceed to curse at them, accuse them of \"holding you hostage\", calling people smurfs/not, accusing people of inting/flaming, and threatening to afk. Hint: That's not how to talk to your team.\n\n----\nThe next game, you appear to get mad at someone for \"scripting\". Hint: There's good players in the world. And if you truly think someone's scripting, just report them.\n> \n> Peritheus: wow\n> Peritheus: what as cirpter\n> Peritheus: ur such a cheater\n> Peritheus: tri hard in s5\n> Peritheus: also hitting that ddos\n> Peritheus: he's triharding\n> Peritheus: s5 truly agutter place\n> Peritheus: triharddd\n> Peritheus: tri hartd]\n> Peritheus: why do i get games with trolls like this\n\nThe irony in this next snippet is you just harassed someone for the champ they played.\n\n> Peritheus: You shoulda picked a viable jungler me\n> Peritheus: and not play brain dead champs like cuckerino\n> Peritheus: oh now he's talking big and bad\n> Peritheus: who tf do u think u are zed?\n> Peritheus: a msurf?\n> Peritheus: is that all u can do?\n> Peritheus: harass people?\n\nAgain, the irony here being that you're the one that's being an ass to your team and threatening to afk/feed.\n\n> Peritheus: I'm pretty sure I'm, the trolling 1 here\n\nThis isn't even all the snippets I could pull, but I'm already at almost half of the chat.\n\nYour communications are very negative towards your team. You don't chat with the purpose of winning the game, you chat with the purpose of assigning blame and/or giving up. That's why you were punished.\n\nLastly, I will point out that Riot based the new instant feedback system off of the tribunal tendencies to vote punish/not punish, and it has evolved over time. Bottom line: the rules for punishment are based on thousands of actual community members voting to punish/not punish people who were reported, it's just automated now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlimeyNickoli","date":"2017-09-11T12:04:01.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly can these even be trusted we only get to see 1 side every time i see these it always just gets hate but we never know what they are saying maybe this person is just defending his/herself maybe they started it we will never know","replies":[{"poster":"Kitty Cat Tosha","date":"2017-09-11T12:28:03.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"but mooooom, he started it!\" stopped being valid when mom finally decided to put her foot down.","replies":[{"poster":"SlimeyNickoli","date":"2017-09-11T14:32:19.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-09-11T12:17:21.467+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who started it is irrelevant, and you don't need to retaliate to defend yourself... in fact you can just use the mute button and be done with it.","replies":[{"poster":"SlimeyNickoli","date":"2017-09-11T12:24:46.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally never have this issue but its just sad to see someone put this up to just get destroyed by everyone after they already got punished","replies":[{"poster":"MaroModo","date":"2017-09-11T12:36:06.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SlimeyNickoli,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5oy1czwc,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2017-09-11T12:24:46.098+0000)\n>\n> I personally never have this issue but its just sad to see someone put this up to just get destroyed by everyone after they already got punished\n\nSo he doesn't think his actions are wrong and you think the community should encourage his behavior?
