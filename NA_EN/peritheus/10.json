It blows hard when you&#039;re  the 1st and lone wolf support,jgler,adc whatever and face checking the brush river brush with a ward to see a 5 man cc filled certain death invade before dying in less than 1 min 15 secs(literally like ai games cheese) and in snowbally games like this where the match is already decided where the chances of making a comeback are incredibly low, there&#039;s a reason why ff15 was made and reflected of how much a problem the game is.\r\n\r\nPlus it denies the team who died first an inability to remake if you tried to apologize for bad ping then dc after it has happened so if you tried your best to see if it the connection changed as best you could within a &quot;supposed&quot; min  and 30 secs(the allowed remake breathing room) before dcing it screws you and your team over(you could be evil and intention feed in less than a min so the afk gets punished harder plus deny a ff15 vote when you guys got a dc just to watch the world burn for their own selfishness), also time is faster in game, you wait 2-3 min on the computer clock, you join in game it&#039;s 6-7+ mins It sucks, because this thing is only relatable, to those whose experiences it&#039;s volatile nonsensical bs thing 1st hand many times where I thought aww a shame they couldn&#039;t remake,no it&#039;s cause their team died 1st before the player dc after death before 1min 30 secs, plus players tend to im a dive kill em if they reconnect/dc (lol no catchup xp so you can snowball) so it makes it even harder to deny the stupid rule where you wasted everyone&#039;s time by afking but then carrying, just to get slapped with a ineligible, +risk of low priority queues.\r\n\r\nTLDR; 5 Man Homestart cheese invades, first death denys remake breathing room for that team(only given really 40secs instead of 1min 30)if they don&#039;t dc beforehand,time in game is faster,mo assists+blown sums = mo gold and unhealthy stronger starts,catchup xp is negligible and you will be most likely 1st priority of flame,reports,griefs(ff15 1 no), and dived if reconnected from dc since the tension is strong, moral low, mercy is rare.","replies":[]}
