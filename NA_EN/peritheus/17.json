Because I fiddled around with {{item:3102}}  and {{item:3814}}  and both popped by one {{champion:110}} q even though it looks like they stack, but don&#039;t. If you aren&#039;t fixing it at least state it doesn&#039;t stack or something kinda like the {{item:3156}}  and {{item:3053}}  stacking.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperPewPew","date":"2017-03-12T05:53:27.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, for quite some time they have been behaving like that. Apparently they don't have any prioritization besides Morg's E (i.e A magic damage, crowd control spell won't proc Sivir's/Noc/Banshee's if shielded by Morgs E.
