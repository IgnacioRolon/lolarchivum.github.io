I supposedly have bad ping, but at the same time I don't\n\n...what? Also, can you cut it with the behavior?

When she popped for me, there was no motion of entering the range or the like, meaning there's an actual delay in feedback to the feature for stealth. Reaction's merely part of what could be the case for some people, but it's rude to assume that's all there is to it.","replies":[{"poster":"WorryWolfy","date":"2017-08-21T18:12:30.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be too defensive, it won't help you improve your reaction speed. :)","replies":[{"poster":"YokoNomi","date":"2017-08-21T18:16:18.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WorryWolfy,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=MNENdKJW,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-08-21T18:12:30.701+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t be too defensive, it won&#x27;t help you improve your reaction speed. :)\n\nI'm merely explaining multiple probabilities that play into a fault with the mechanic, though admittedly the bias response did annoy me.","replies":[{"poster":"WorryWolfy","date":"2017-08-21T18:17:34.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't be annoyed by such things.
