Just had a game where I believed we&#039;d be blue side cause  you know, my team was on the bot side in the client screen (loading into game) and all of a sudden when the game started my team was top red side, This isn&#039;t intentional isn&#039;t it? Because I always recalled it being bot side blue, top side red, this wasn&#039;t intermediate bots, it was normals and it~~ put me in anaphylactic shock~~ honestly  triggered me.{{item:3073}} {{champion:32}} {{item:3073}}","replies":[]}
