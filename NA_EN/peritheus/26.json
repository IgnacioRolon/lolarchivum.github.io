Late game champ btw. How can we counter this  if he gets ahead in this snowball early 20 min burst meta when we&#039;re all 2 behind in gold,lvls, and feeling hopeless if we are still unable to kill him without a single person/2 dying for him.\r\nI mean I was told by a mastery lvl 7 azir that he has to hug turrets till lvl 12 before proceeding to shurima slam bam, that&#039;s 20ish mins right there of passively farming, if that&#039;s suppose to how late game&#039;s envision then why am I seeing these so called &quot;lategame champs&quot; destroy everyone with 2 items in less than 20 mins.\r\nAlso why would they give {{champion:5}} an aoe old poppy invulnerability like ult where instead of being dmg only by a single champ, it&#039;s not being dmg by whatever&#039;s champ not in the circle trying to hurt you.","replies":[{"poster":"One Ashe On","date":"2017-10-04T03:41:10.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the title is about Ardent Kog'Maw, continue about Azir and end with Xin Zhao.. You really need to focus on 1 thing.\n1: Ardent censor got it's health per attack removed and it was the most broken part of the item\n2: Azir is nowhere as strong as he was first released. People are just not used anymore to play against him. Give it time and it will go back to where it was before.\n3: Xin Zhao ultimate have a large AoE arround him.  It doesn't make him immune totally to damage and people on close range can make his life hell. If Xin ult, ask the melee tank to CC him in place and his ult end useless.","replies":[]}]}
