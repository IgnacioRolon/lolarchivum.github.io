The game was terrible to me with respect to RNG, and I had 2 HP before I entered the dragon stage. I just did not have the items and champion levels I needed to beat the dragon, and it knocked my 2 HP off and I was out of the game. Both the players I just beat went on to beat the dragon... I think this is silly.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-07-07T05:16:39.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya , dragon abuses teams that are actually meant to deal with groups rather than killing a single target.\n\nNot to mention tanks are pretty much useless against it since it can hit everyone while your characters refuse to spread out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2019-07-07T05:33:07.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of hate the dragon stage design. You have to completely alter your team formation to be as wide as possible in order to keep your mid rangers from being wiped out by the splash as the drake slowly rotates around torching your tanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-07T05:51:14.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have lost to krugs.

You always want a red buff/morellos to deal with Dragon if you might go a composition that will otherwise struggle with it, like sorcs. Spreading properly to prevent its splash from killing much of your team all at the same time is also important.","replies":[]}]}
