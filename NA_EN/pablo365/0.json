You also wished that someone on your team would end up in the hospital. Those 3 games looked like a roller coaster of tilt. When that happens, even without internet problems, take some time off. No point in playing a game that is supposed to be fun if you're just getting angry about it. Having internet issues on top of that is going to most certainly create a frustrating experience for you, others, and you will additionally have to do with penalties that result.","replies":[{"poster":"pablo365","date":"2017-12-12T21:33:57.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"As i imagine you can see though, the power outage was during my zilean game, the two teemo games was because of internet.
