Enjoy!_\n\n**_@Morello, if you happen to stop by here, I would ask you to be so kind to actually watch the video instead of read, the video was mainly made for you, and there's a message near the end. Grab a coke, grab nacho's with some dip, and from there on I can only hope you'll enjoy yourself! :)_**\n\n\nHi again,\nMy name is Yaime Loveheart, although most of you would probably know me as Bestbilbo, which was my account I used to have to post here on the NA League forums (I lost it, hence I&#039;m posting from a new account). I suppose most of you don&#039;t know me by now, or &#039;&#039;us&#039;&#039; for that matter, so please let me start off by reintroducing myself and telling you what we&#039;re all about as we go.\n\n_**Reintroducing myself**_\n\nI&rsquo;ve been playing League for 5 years now. I would like to thank Riot and all the people I&rsquo;ve ever played with because it would be a horrifying thing to imagine if League of Legends hadn&rsquo;t come into my life. Quite literally, it saved me. I was in a dark place for a pretty long while and so to speak, League was a little sunshine.\nHowever, as time dragged on League of Legends started to grow on me. Long term players know what it feels like to have their IP stacking up (either because they own all champions or because they don&#039;t care for the few that are left available for them to purchase), they know what it was like to see [Shushei](http://imgur.com/QlgWPgL) on Gragas at the first world championships, and they know what the good old days were like when there was no meta yet and nobody would give a sh*t if you were running something like nunu swain botlane.\nAt some point I decided to show up at the forums, you know, the place where overenthusiastic nerds like me passionately share their love and ideas for the game. At certain times I seemed to be enjoying myself much more on the forums compared to when I was actually playing the game, and this felt wrong.\nThis feeling dragged on and something kept nagging at me; I didn&rsquo;t know why I felt it, what had to be done exactly, or how, but I could feel the game could be so much more.\n\n_**Where it all started**_\n\nAt the time I was researching older MOBA&rsquo;s such as DOTA2 and I was fascinated with some of the abilities these games had. However, I wasn&rsquo;t going to play a game such as DOTA2, many elements to the game are simply very unhealthy for a competitive game environment, the mechanic of being able to deny creeps is the first thing that comes to mind. And please, even though these are the League forums so most of you probably wouldn&#039;t even mind me bashing on DOTA, you should understand this isn&rsquo;t just a matter of opinion.\nYou see, many game developers seem to think that complexity for the sake of complexity, which is to say, overly complex and meaningless technical aspects you need to master before being able to play the game seriously, is the definitive factor of a &lsquo;&rsquo;good competitive game&rsquo;&rsquo;, but this is wrong!\nBecause the greatest sense of competition isn&rsquo;t achieved by simply outperforming an opponent in external matter (such as being able to mash a complicated chain of buttons faster and more accurate than your opponent), but by actually outplaying them in internal affairs.\nYou don&rsquo;t really feel like superman as much when you&rsquo;ve managed to farm about 80 more creeps than anyone else in your game compared to the feeling you get when you outplay the entire enemy team by killing everyone and scoring a pentakill, do you?\n\nThere&rsquo;s a very clear difference between technical skill and playful skill.\n\nTake RTS games for example. Before you are even able to play a RTS on a competitive level, one must get the hang of the basics first, and this feels like a fricken chore because it&rsquo;s an extremely hard and frustrating experience for the most of us. It all has to do with very difficult technical aspects rather than having to do with the talent and individual insight of the player to outplay the opponent, and so most of us stay away from these kinds of games because we understand that in order to actually get good we would either have to be Sonic the Hedgehog&hellip; or asi- sorry, can&#039;t actually say that here.\nSo what you should know by now is that technical aspects in a competitive game limit the sense of competitiveness, overcomplicating this shifts the focus from engaging competitiveness that revolves around the players armwrestling with each other to players individually trying to beat the game on a technical level.\nThis is also why denying your opponent creeps in League of Legends is way more engaging, you actually have to interact with your opponent (using your positioning and abilities to prevent them from farming) instead of right-clicking an NPC before your opponent does.\n\nAnyway, at some point during my time on the forums I made a [thread](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2562226) about how I wanted champions to be more interesting.\nI thought the complexity for the sake of complexity argument was a lame excuse to not design champions that can do very cool stuff, but this was a false train of thought.\nThis is where I bumped into a man called [Ryan Melley](http://imgur.com/pUO0OiX), or, &#039;&#039;Itemsguy&#039;&#039;. In a way he became my mentor and provided me with all this knowledge, revealing to me what was actually nagging at me about the game in the process. This ItemsGuy had come up with a logical, concrete theory about MOBA game design, he had found out what was incredibly wrong about League of Legends and had even started working on solving these problems already.\n\n**_&#039;&#039;Are Champions As Awesome As They Could Be?&#039;&#039;_**\n\nI became obsessed with ItemsGuy&rsquo;s work, and I was so impressed that in 2013, he allowed me to make a forum post about it which was called:\n\n[&lsquo;&rsquo;Are Champions As Awesome As They Could Be?&rsquo;&rsquo;](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3013310)\n\nIt took some time, but eventually it blew up. Morello even stickyied the thread and we ended up getting over 250,000 views. It&rsquo;s a long thread, so here&rsquo;s the post in a nutshell.\n\nThese are very important things in a competitive MOBA game:\n\n* Counterplay\n* Readability\n* Theming\n\nIn terms of counterplay at that time we had already observed how Riot had transitioned from targeted abilities to favoring skillshots (Ryze old Q, Ryze new Q, Pantheon Q compared to Kalista Q), meaning you can somehow avoid getting damaged. \nIn terms of readability they were already working on making it easier for the player to understand what was happening through improved HUD and champion animations. \nIn terms of theming we noticed how more often than not they treated the theme of a champion as some sort of cherry on top of the cake rather than the thing that holds the entire champion together.\n\nTake Leblanc the Deceiver, her passive and W enables her to juke and confuse enemies, but is her kit mainly about deceiving? No, because you don&#039;t really pick Leblanc to confuse the sh*t out of your enemies, the main reason you&rsquo;d want to pick her is she does insane burst damage.\n\nTake Zyra. She saw competitive play very quickly and became one of the first popular AP-based supports, but did players pick her for the fact that she was the mage that could do crazy stuff with her plants? Sadly, no, [she was mainly picked because she&#039;s great at teamfights.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1GB3mRHOo8&amp;t=1m30s)\n\nSo, yes, Leblanc can do a little deceiving, as Zyra is able to grow plants, which allows her to zone a little bit, but without wanting to offend anyone I&#039;d like to say that these things are very watered down. \nBut before I get into this further and before I mention Itemsguy and his work again we must acknowledge the fact that I&#039;ve been talking about a thread we made three years ago. We can&#039;t deny the fact that the MOBA genre has developed in this time and that Riot has learned and done a lot.\n\n_**What about other MOBA&#039;S?**_\n\nFor starters, games have been developed that seem to do quite well. But harshly put, this doesn&rsquo;t really matter, because games such as Smite, Heroes of the Storm or DOTA2 don&rsquo;t have the same potential that League has to become the best MOBA game ever, and here&rsquo;s why:\n\n**1.** Due to the nature of the game, the camera and it&#039;s engine, Smite has way less potential to be a very popular E-sport. [It&#039;s just way less watchable. ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT3oDqqaMsk&amp;t=2m33s)\n\nBut the worst thing isn&rsquo;t even that, but their God design. Some of these gods are closely tied to ancient stories and beliefs about these gods, so that their abilities make sense when you read their lore. But this isn&#039;t a good thing. You don&#039;t want to burden the player with homework before they can understand something about a character.\nTake Mordekaiser for example, a new player would probably expect to get smashed in the head with his giant mace when he&#039;s up against him, instead he does some weird magical stuff and nabs your ghost. To completely understand why he does the things that he does [one must read his lore](http://imgur.com/3JYHfi6) and this is what you would want to avoid.\nLore should be an addition to the universe of a competitive game, made for those who are interested to delve into these worlds, but especially for a game that wants to become a sport, it shouldn&#039;t by any means be pivotal to read. Take soccer, you don&#039;t need to know the history of soccer in order to kick a ball around, do you?\nIt&#039;s even worse that most of the Gods in Smite are in fact completely random. A lot of Gods just &#039;&#039;do stuff&#039;&#039; and it&#039;s all up the player to get to know dozens of these seemingly random abilities and memorize them. \n\nThe fact that Smite&#039;s playable characters are based on ancients stories and beliefs is a basic principle that limits the game&#039;s potential. \n\n**2.** Heroes of the storm is a brilliant concept. People are able to play characters from all of the games Blizzard have made. As a game it ties all of their games together and lets players immerse in the universes created by Blizzard Entertainment.\nAnd you know what&rsquo;s so genius about this? \nImagine a player who has never played anything from Blizzard in a heroes of the storm match and he or she is having a blast wrecking balls with a specific character, well you bet there is a high chance he might actually try the game where the character came from!\nHeroes of the storm is a game that is able to suck in new players and get them acquainted with more than just one of their games as well as a game that is able to tighten the grasp many &#039;&#039;loyal Blizzard veterans&#039;&#039; find themselves in.\n\nBy itself this is a genius concept, however when taking into account the potential the MOBA genre has, therein also lies it&#039;s flaw. All the characters in Heroes of the Storm are based off the characters they are in their other games. And thus, similar to the problem Smite has, in many ways the player has to deal with seemingly random, abstract concepts and mechanics just because they are based off characters that were not intended to be MOBA designs from the start. And even though this harms the readability of the game and limits the game&rsquo;s potential, Blizzard is kind of right to design their heroes like this, because that&rsquo;s what the players want! Fans of those characters are still going to expect them to do the same obscure-a$$ sh*t they did in the universe of World of Warcraft or whatever.\n\n**3.** I&#039;ve been told DOTA2 is almost quite literally an exact copy of the old DOTA. \n\nThe game has numerous problems; very steep learning curve (low accessibility), characters with a lot of random stuff (tied to little to no theme at all, thus resulting in very low readability, which only adds salt to the wound of the game already being quite hard to play), and poor counterplay (devastating abilities that offer little to no counterplay apart from just &lsquo;&rsquo;staying away from someone&rsquo;&rsquo;, which isn&rsquo;t engaging). \n\nHaving said all this, in a twisted way I think it&#039;s very funny that whenever you bump into people talking about the MOBA genre or some &#039;&#039;LoL vs DOTA&#039;&#039; argument you will always find reasonable people who are able to admit the following:\n\n_&#039;&#039;Yes. League of Legends is easier, Dota is harder, they&#039;re different games and both have their pros and cons, whether one game is better or more enjoyable is a matter of personal preference.&#039;&#039;_\n\nWell, yes, sure, there are two sides to every story, and in case of the comparison of League of Legends and DOTA2, one game definitely doesn&#039;t rule out the other. But in terms of the best MOBA game, or the perfect MOBA game ever developed, it goes a little further than that, and neither of these games come even close.\n\nOkay, so now I hope the following is something we can all universally agree upon:\n\n**1.** Dota2 is a harder game, it&#039;s harder to get into (higher skill floor) and more hardcore (higher skill cap)\n\n**2. **League of Legends is an easier game (lower skill floor), it&#039;s easier to get into and less hardcore, which is to say, the game has a lower skill cap than DOTA; you are able to pull off less skillful plays because there are less tools at your disposal. For instance, there&#039;s not a whole lot a Garen can do more to shine in a game than to just walk up to the backline of the enemy team, spin to win, and use his ultimate as an execute. That&#039;s kind of as far his current design allows him to go. [Compare that to this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE9ecc0eQC0&amp;t=0m12s)\n\n[To clarify, read this quote by a Riot champion designer.](http://imgur.com/Gsz4fSS)\nThe quote says the designer wouldn&#039;t mind reworking Garen into a design that would allow you to do more cool stuff while holding true to what we already know and love about Garen. The trick is not to simply overcomplicate his design and making him harder to play, but keeping him as easy as he is to get into, yet making it more rewarding for the player when he masters the champion by allowing them to do more cool stuff the better you get.\n\n**3.** You could say Heroes of the Storm is quite the opposite of DotA2. League got rid of creep denying, Heroes got rid of gold, farming and an item shop altogether. Not to mention the removal of external factors that affect gameplay such as rune pages and masteries. And while this does make the game more accessible and easier for new players, various other factors contribute to making the game even easier which dumbs the game down. For example: dying early game isn&#039;t as much of a problem because you don&#039;t give gold to the enemy, death timers are still low and the maps are relatively small so you can quickly get back into the action when you respawn. Also taking damage isn&#039;t as punishing due to the fact that you can frequently click on healing fountains or can rely on teammates that can heal you up in little to no time at all. Whereas in League, most of the time [when you&#039;re this low](http://imgur.com/TqjEQUQ) you&#039;d probably want to hit your &#039;&#039;B&#039;&#039; button.\nThis makes Heroes of the Storm the easiest game to get into, which is good, but at the same time it&#039;s the most casual and lacks depth the most, which is mweh for a lot of people. Including me.\nThere&#039;s another thing about Heroes that&#039;s brilliant though, but that&#039;ll be a surprise for later.\n\nI hope you understand now why I think it&#039;s funny to see people having an &#039;&#039;LoL VS DOTA&#039;&#039; argument, because as a matter of fact, the truth lies in the middle.\n\nHave you ever heard people say that the guitar is both the easiest as well as the hardest instrument? You could pick up the guitar and learn to play fricken wonderwall in a day while if you&#039;d play the guitar for the entire duration of your life, at the end you would be able to play extremely hard things and would still be able to find out and discover new things. And there you have it, that&#039;s what a competitive game should be like, too. \n\n[And here&#039;s a quote that backs me up only from a person you do trust.](http://imgur.com/Eladm1e)\n\nOkay, so maybe that quote isn&#039;t a very good example because the quote implied that the game was too hard for people sometimes, while the point I&#039;m trying to make is that it&#039;s too easy and lacks depth. But before you stab me with a blunt knife, please note how this quote from Zileas is from six years ago and goes [all the way back to 2010](http://imgur.com/WzCpsYw). It would take another three years for me to bump into Itemsguy and realize where the game could be drastically improved upon.\nIn 2013 we suggested many changes to a lot of problematic champions in our thread, and as the prospect of change is scary for everybody, people were outraged. We already had conclusive evidence Riot agreed with us on so many points, however back then even a few designers showed a little resistance. \n\nBut could it be that I can prove what I&#039;m trying to say by using the work Riot has put out in the meantime, over the course of these past three years?\n\n**What has Riot been doing these past three years?**\n\n[Take a look at this quote.](http://imgur.com/IJnc3AA)\n\nMorello states it&#039;s important to pay attention to what people love about a character, but if a champion is simply unhealthy for the game or just one big mess you should do something about it no matter how much the community demands to leave things unchanged.\nThis is the exact reason why Sion&#039;s former bullsh*t Q, which was basically just some magical particle that would stun you for some reason, is now replaced by an ability which makes much more sense, offers healthier counterplay, and fits with his character. This feels better when playing Sion, as does it help improve the over-all readability of the game, lowering the burden of the knowledge put upon players. Also, considering it&#039;s already quite some time ago since Sion&#039;s rework was put out, it&#039;s even arguable whether the designers at Riot would still keep his W the same if they&#039;d rework Sion another time. Because why should an undead warrior that carries around a big battleaxe be able to put a magical shield around him and allowing him to detonate it to make the magical shield explode? It doesn&#039;t make sense with his character and this is also why the ability feels much more random and flavorless compared to how fitting and fulfilling it feels to fire a big fireball as Brand or hooking someone as a big man in a diver suit with your anchor.\n\nSince I&#039;ve started talking about abilities now, let&#039;s immediately boil down to the bare bones of mechanics in League. Animations for abilities are added to complete the visual design of a champion and to visually support what the champion is able to do.\nA bad animation or an ability that&#039;s shoehorned on to the wrong champion makes no sense and results in low readability. Remember how the cloud of filth, the old animation of Trundle&#039;s ultimate, was supposed to tell us he was stealing our stats, making you weaker and making him stronger? The new animation does a much better job at translating the mechanic into a visual experience. Trundle gets bigger, you get smaller.\n\n[Are you familiar with some sort of game where people are blindfolded and they have to stick their arm into a box to touch an object and guess what they&#039;re dealing with?  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag6HtGlPhL4)\n\nImagine you&#039;re the one whose blindfolded and you feel that you&#039;re touching a spherical object. You can&#039;t see the object, but you&#039;re getting a gist of it. In this case, chances are you&#039;d rather say you&#039;re dealing with a tennis ball or a man&#039;s swollen testicle. You couldn&#039;t possibly say you think you are touching a rubik&#039;s cube right? That would be illogical.\n\nThe same should apply to mechanics in a MOBA. Similar how lore should be an addition to a MOBA rather than depending on it, so you [shouldn&#039;t use Graves&#039;s old lore to justify the fact that he&#039;s able to shoot a smoke screen](http://imgur.com/RwUvngh) (and even worse, his new lore no longer explains it and leaves us in the dark), animations should merely support the mechanics of an ability. Which is to say, without any added particles the mechanics of an ability should already make some sense on their own and be fitting to the theme of the champion.\n\nLets say we take the following mechanic: an ability where once you&#039;ve casted the spell you quickly travel toward your target and snare it when you&#039;ve reached it.\n\nNow would you rather expect [this guy](http://imgur.com/ACu7Kno) to do that, or [this guy](http://imgur.com/Na13BRd)?\n\nIf it doesn&#039;t make a lot of sense for an old man to do such a thing, then why does an old tree have that ability in the actual game? Just looking at Maokai suggests he&#039;s going to offer somewhat slow game play and using nature itself to devastate his enemies. \nBefore his visual update we would justify the fact that he was able to teleport to you and snare you because we could see him turning into a magical bunch of leaves. During this time the animation didn&#039;t just support the mechanics of the ability, the ability depended on the animation, as we have already concluded that the mechanic itself doesn&#039;t make a whole lot of sense on a character like Maokai on its own. As of right now it&#039;s even worse, where the animation of his W no longer has anything to do with nature and Maokai just kind of travels beneath the earth as if he is somehow trying to compete with Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s niche.\nMaokai&#039;s current W makes no sense thematically, harms the accessibility and readability of the game, and I haven&#039;t even mentioned yet how the ability is unhealthy for the game because it offers poor counterplay to begin with.\n\nBut what if you&#039;d replace his W with a skillshot that summons a wall of trees one by one, where the last tree would take the longest time to pop up.\n\nThis new ability would fit his theme because now he&#039;d actually use nature to devastate his enemies instead of randomly teleporting to you. Also it would still do good for him as a tank because his W would still be able to make sure you ain&#039;t going nowhere. And because it makes more sense you&#039;d improve upon the readability of the game, as well does this ability offer more counterplay. \nAs Maokai: ability wouldn&#039;t be targeted, so it would be more of a challenge to use (also will make the ability feel more fun and rewarding when used well).\nAgainst Maokai: you&#039;d be able to play around the ability/juke instead of not really being able to do anything to his current W but stay away from him, which doesn&#039;t encourage engaging gameplay.\n\nIn our thread from 2013 we also mentioned how we thought there wasn't enough variety among ADC's, whenever a new marksman would come out it would just feel as if they added another character that right clicks most of the time but ends up doing it just slightly different.\nWhen Quinn was about to be released I was hoping for something really unique, a falconer champion that would be the first champion with an individual, controllable pet. Similar to Rexxar in Heroes of the Storm, whom works very well by the way.\nBut what we got is a champion that--if you looked closely enough at the bare bones of the mechanics--didn&#039;t play like a falconer at all.\n\nImagine Quinn wasn&#039;t released like this, but as[ this guy.](http://imgur.com/i9fTFvS) For now, let&rsquo;s call him &lsquo;&rsquo;Bob, the generic marksman assasin&rsquo;&rsquo;.\nHer Q ability would make just as much sense if Bob&#039;s Q would be that he throws sand in the eyes of the target hit.\nHer W ability would make just as much sense if you&#039;d animate Bob temporarily heightening his senses, revealing an area around him for a short while.\nHer E would do just fine on this Bob because he&#039;s an agile mofo capable of doing back flips.\nAnd her ultimate could be replaced by Bob suddenly running faster for a short while and drawing daggers to engage in melee combat.\nIf Quinn was really about playing as a falconer, then how could you remove her bird Valor from her kit entirely and still make things work?\n\nFor the sake of making my point, imagine my dream would have come true and Valor would&#039;ve been a pet you could control individually, would you still be able to replace her with a pile of sand? No, you would not, because it makes no sense to be able to control a pile of sand or even watching it move on its own.\nSo I&#039;ll say it once more, animations should be there to support the ability, but the mechanic should already be thematically fitting on its own.\n\n_&#039;&#039;But wait, Yaime!&#039;&#039; you might think, &#039;&#039;you said it has been three years and Riot has learned and done a lot!&#039;&#039;_\n\nAnd yes, yes they have. I just told you we have always thought that ADC&#039;s have always been way too similar, can you imagine how happy and proud I was to see them making changes to a lot of ADC&#039;s to create more diversity, because they too figured out they could emphasize more on all giving them their own niche? \nQuinn gets to fly around with her bird now, Corki gets to fly more because he&#039;s in a plane after all, Graves feels more like a dude wielding a shotgun, and so on!\nAnother thing to note is that not only is it boring when champions are very similar, it also becomes a problem that they end up fighting to be the best at their role.\n\nCreating more diversity fixes this, and if you want proof of this take a look at what a great job they have done with supports. Because there is a wide variety of designs there isn&#039;t such a thing as the best support champion of all time.\n\nTake Braum, Soraka and Blitzcrank.\n\nThey all do their own thing, they are not arm wrestling with each other to be the best at same thing. One isn&#039;t simply better than the other, they&#039;re just different.\nBraum provides damage mitigation and disengage, you pick Soraka for healing, and Blitzcrank is able to pick off enemies one by one by pulling someone into his team. Whether someone is better is situational and revolves entirely around the enemy team and your own team composition.\n\n_**You seem to hint that Riot has stepped up their game, so what&#039;s wrong?**_\n\nWell, what remains a very big problem to this day is that even though they tweak champions for the better, most of them remain a lackluster version of the gaming experience they could deliver.\nChampions consist out of four abilities and a passive. Let&#039;s say that one ability roughly makes up for 20% of the champion. This means that more abilities a champion has that doesn&#039;t fit very well thematically, the more you basically steal from and confuse the champion&rsquo;s identity. They become watered down versions of what they could be.\nWhat would Mike Tyson be without his tattoo or boxing gloves, Neil Harbisson without his antenna or colorful clothes, or Jimi Hendrix without his afro and electric guitar? \nRemember when I said Sion&#039;s current W still doesn&#039;t make sense. To this day that ability still makes up for roughly 20% of his character, while instead the ability could be replaced by an ability that actually fits with an undead warrior that carries around a big battle axe.\nThis is also why Quinn shouldn&#039;t have a Q ability which animations make just as much sense if you&#039;d replace them by having her throw sand in her enemies eyes, or why her E shouldn&#039;t be her doing a backflip. Because why would a falconer do backflips? Nothing about doing a backflip is characteristic to falconers, and have I told you [Itemsguy has done a bit of falconing?](http://imgur.com/moCvK8J) He knows.\n\nI could go on and on, such as Alistar being [able to do this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utf6x70S6Fw&amp;t=1m8s) doesn&#039;t make a whole lot of sense and takes up 20% of his space that could instead have been dedicated to him doing something [like this.\n](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TSEW5R0Ro&amp;t=0m10s)\nWhich is about the most iconic thing a bull could possibly do!\n\n_&#039;&#039;But wait, Yaime, aren&#039;t you over exaggerating right now? We get that theming and readability is important but aren&#039;t you stretching it too far? Is a game not allowed to throw a little illogical things in the mix such as a bull healing people or a falconer doing backflips?&#039;&#039; _\n\nI&#039;m sorry but, no. Here&#039;s a quote of the game designer and acclaimed author Jesse Schell:\n\n&gt; _&#039;&#039;We can create games with powerful themes right now. But why should we do this? We aren&#039;t artists, we&#039;re designers. Artistic expression is not our goal. Our goal is to create powerful experiences.\n&gt; It is possible to create a game without a theme, however, if games have unifying, resonant themes, the experiences we create will be much, much stronger.&#039;&#039;_\n\nIllogical things such as a falconer doing a backflip makes no sense, it unnecessarily harms the accessibility and readability of the game, as well as it creates a less powerful experience Quinn could possibly deliver as a champion. And I&#039;m also not stretching it too far because this game is trying to be a sport after all. A person who has never seen a soccer match will probably understand very quickly what the point of the game is.\n This manner of quickly being able to understand the game does not apply when you let that same person [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMec5aE5Gm0) for the first time.\n\nIt&#039;s a funny video, but about 99% of people would probably have no clue what the F is happening.\nAnd sure, due to the nature of videogames League of Legends might never be able to be as easy to read as a game of soccer, but this by itself shouldn&#039;t be an excuse to not make the game as readable as it could possibly be!\n\nNot to mention the fact that certain champions or existing abilities may rule out the existence of other possible cool archetypes. For example, the fact that Quinn is able to do a backflip kind of prevents an [acrobat](http://imgur.com/A2gQgpl) champion being added to the game, which could be a quite cool concept, right?\n\nSo an acrobat champion doing a backflip would be quite a cool and fitting ability, but it would be a problem that Quinn has this ability already!\nIn this case there are two possible scenarios:\n\n* A). They will never release an acrobat champion because Quinn&#039;s abilities have a messed up thematic identity. (On screen: an acrobat champion would simply feel to similar.)\n \n* Or B). They decide to add an acrobat champion to the roster anyway. Which will end up with champions feeling very much alike. No offense Riot, but what drastically new does Jhin bring to the table compared to Caitlyn?\n\nWhy didn&#039;t I realize earlier that probably the only reason League of Legends knows of the champion Zed is because Shen just didn&#039;t fill in the &#039;&#039;deadly ninja&#039;&#039; archetype yet, because instead of being as deadly as he looks, he actually doesn&#039;t play like this at all and ends up being one of the most protective and tankiest mofo&#039;s in the game. It&#039;s the same reason why Braum was added to the game while we already had Leona.\n\nWhat&#039;s a Vel&#039;Koz compared to Xerath compared to Lux?\nThey&#039;re all long range poking mages with some crowd control.\nAnd we&#039;ve already learned about how fun and healthy it is for the game to let champions have their own niche to create a wide variety of champions, instead of letting them arm wrestle to be the best at the same thing.\n\nSpeaking of seeing and experiencing the same thing over and over and over again, listen to this:\n\n‘’[Let me be serious here… League of legends doesn’t work as a competitive game or a fun party game to play with your friends, as of today I have more than 8000 matches played on this game, so I have some legitimate grounds to review the game on.\nLaning phase, the other guy sits under his turret and farms creeps for 20 minutes, then the rest of the game is both teams walking around the map, accomplishing nothing, until some dumbass gets caught. That's every match in a nutshell.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzgbZL12VI&t=1m31s)'' - videogamedunkey in ''I'm Done With League of Legends''\n\n\nYou see, the main, first and foremost reason why League of Legends won&#039;t become a better game even though in these three years they have become better at designing champions is that through their design, they are still forcing the game to stay the same as it has always been. Which ends up making the game feel generic, stale, boring and repetitive.\n\nI&#039;m truly sorry, Sky, but to answer [your question](http://imgur.com/PabCyCK):\n\nFiora&#039;s old kit was loaded with powerful targeted effects with very poor, limited counterplay. Additionally, an ult that was more powerful in teamfights wasn&#039;t very fitting for &#039;&#039;the Grand Duelist.&#039;&#039;  These were very good reasons for Riot to rework her, they could have taken this opportunity to rework the Grand Duelist of League of Legends and finally give League of Legends the Duelist champion League of Legends had never seen before, but instead they failed to deliver once more and screwed up by giving her some huge AoE heal that can also heal teammates, which encourages her to get into teamfights like so many other champions. Why would a duelist want to charge towards multiple teammates--or worse, enemies? Why the heck should a duelist with a sword be able to heal herself and her allies in the first place?\nIf you do the research you will come to realize that Riot seems to be obsessed with teamfights, and how they almost neurotically feel the need to give every champion this cool big teamfighting ability or niche because they think a champion wouldn&rsquo;t be able to function otherwise.\n\n[*Surprise!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bSEfx6D8mA)\n\nThis, to some extent, is what Heroes of the Storm does well. Even though it&#039;s still quite dumbed down due to the mechanics of certain maps encouraging you to pile up and because the overwhelming majority of heroes is still encouraged to be as braindead aggressive like 99% of the champions in League of Legends, some sort of triangle of available strategies--or different branches of strategic playstyles does exist through their hero design.\nYou can just charge in and kill everything as the Butcher (Aggressive), you can play defensive and zone out an area as Gazlowe (Territorial), or you can heavily influence and control things in a match as Abathur (Control) without directly engaging in combat.\n\nAs of now Riot designs champions in such a way that we&#039;re all encouraged to pile up and have a big 5 vs 5 party. This type of champion design results in every game starting to feel very much the same where two teams just dance with each other for 30 minutes after laning phase until, like Dunkey said, some dumbass gets caught.\n\n**Doesn&#039;t this get incredibly boring? Where&#039;s the impressive strategy here? How is this supposed to feel engaging if every game it&#039;s the same old story all over again? **\n\nIt&#039;s like the MOBA genre was derived from rock, paper, scissors, where they took the luck factor out of the game and made it so that the team with the most skill would win, except for whatever reason they have taken out the option to choose paper or scissors as well, so right now every game it&#039;s fist against fist over and over again, where the fist that has Master Yi or Doctor Mundo wins. Two teams always using the same method to destroy each other&#039;s nexus isn&#039;t by any means engaging.\n\nThe perfect MOBA game would offer way more strategic diversity, playable characters would be able to be categorized into three different brackets; aggressive, control, and territorial (defensive). In theory it would work like a triangle of playstyles where territorial champions would be able to stonewall aggressive team compositions, aggressive champions would be able to catch out control champions, and control champions could run around territorial team compositions. But in an actual game it wouldn&#039;t be as black and white as that, you&#039;d have to take into account player skill and so it would turn out to be execution based, which means that no matter how your champion plays like you will do better than your opponent if you are more skilled than they are, so an aggressive team composition would actually be able to break apart a territorial one if they make the right decisions and execute them well.\n\n_**Why should I care?**_\n\nSo one thing you might wonder is, why should I care? What if you are still enjoying the game in its current condition, you haven&#039;t given a d@mn about all of what I&#039;ve said so far and you still think that League of Legends is the best game ever.\nLet&#039;s say you don&#039;t mind that a champion called The Monkey King is better at deceiving people than the actual Deceiver of League of legends, let&#039;s say you don&#039;t see how some champions are a complete mess and make no sense whatsoever, and lets say [you don&#039;t feel cheated](http://imgur.com/CbU90ed) when you are ulted by Vi when you&#039;re playing some zero mobility character such as Ashe, or when you get hopelessly rolled over by some Tryndamere or Master Yi.\n \nIf all of this doesn&#039;t apply to you, chances are it&#039;s going to somewhere in the future, and if not, you will probably get sick of every game boiling down to two teams dancing around each other for 30 minutes after laning phase until someone gets caught. It never ends!\n \nRiot, you as a company, the playerbase of League of Legends and the game itself has matured and learned too much to approach all the problems in League of Legends with band-aid solutions. In many ways the game is one big mess where one or more of the following problems apply to an overwhelming majority across the entire champion roster:\n\n* **Niche From Single Abilities** - Rather than bringing unique strategic value to a team through their entire kit and playstyle, many champions&rsquo; proclaimed niches tend to stem from a single ability (Fiora&rsquo;s ult, Twitch&rsquo;s stealth)\n\n* ** Mechanical Dissonance** - Numerous champions suffer from kits with conflicting internal goals, whether through mechanical details (Brand&rsquo;s DoT has less uptime when his abilities are combo&rsquo;d) or divergent purposes (Kindred relies on killing champions but % current health damage and the no-death ult makes it more difficult)\n\n* **Thematic Dissonance** - Many champions, especially earlier ones, possess mechanics that are at odds with their theming (Annie and Brand will stun you with fire, Quinn does backflips)\n\n* **Homogeneous Kits** - Within roles, there is generally a strong amount of overlap between certain champions (Cait, Jhin, and Jinx have long-range poke, immobilizing traps, and long-range executes), to the point where some are almost identical (Akali and Diana being the most obvious instance)\n\n* **Mechanical Overload** - A few very popular champions suffer from mechanical overload, possessing more tools than they need to fulfill a niche or role (Yasuo&rsquo;s double-passive and wind wall, Lee Sin&rsquo;s, well, everything)\n\n* ** Strategic Staleness** - The vast majority of champions are geared towards the same strategy of &ldquo;lane for 15 minutes and then run around and teamfight when somebody messes up&rdquo; to the point where anything outside of that is seen as a singular niche (Bard is The Roaming Support, Quinn is The Roaming Marksman)\n\n* ** Generalist Gameplay** - A few champions don&rsquo;t specialize in any particular role or niche, and have kits that don&rsquo;t give them any real strategic strengths or weaknesses (Lee Sin, Kayle, Nidalee)\n \n* **Shoehorned Kits** - Some champions are designed not simply with a certain goal kept in mind, but rather as a direct response to a need and only that (Irelia as a counter to a marksman-heavy meta, Lissandra as a vessel for Puck&rsquo;s position-swapping projectile, Kindred as Totally The One And Only Jungling Marksman)\n\n* **Burden of Knowledge** - Some champions possess mechanics that are crucial to understanding their gameplay, but either unknown or unclear to players who haven&rsquo;t gone on the Wiki and read the tooltips (alternate crit effects or other system-breaking mechanics among many of the recent marksmen changes, Yasuo&rsquo;s/Azir&rsquo;s/Kindred&rsquo;s double passive)\n \nThese past three years you&#039;ve been taking a different, better approach to champion design than you have ever done before, and while this means that you are starting to put out better content more consistently since you are going to be hitting your mark more frequently, an overwhelming majority of the problems I just mentioned will continue to exist, as does your over-all approach and vision of the game limits the game&#039;s potential in terms of creating a game that offers the most powerful experiences through playable characters, and in terms of limiting the strategic diversity, where, if things will go on like this, the essentials of a League of Legends match will continue to boil down to nothing but non-strategic, dumbed down, flavorless 5 vs 5 clusterf*cks which we have already grown accustomed with over the past few years.\nAnd even though three years ago Itemsguy and I received a tremendous amount of love and support from players all over the globe, we were still scoffed at by a lot of people. But as of right now, [more](http://imgur.com/rIpZWop) and [more](http://imgur.com/K59zr0Q) people seem to be [waking up](http://imgur.com/3ulW2tk) and asking the same [questions](http://imgur.com/i56EPdl) we had already asked before. People are either getting bored or extremely frustrated with the game, and are slowly but surely done with it, and no matter what problem they bring up the root of the cause will most likely always be a lack of consistent theming, which results in a game with lower readability, accessibility, and poor counterplay. Which ends up robbing the game of awesome strategic playstyles and making the game feel boring and repetitive.\nIt&#039;s hard to see a game that we all love fall apart, knowingly it could do so much better. Which, come to think of it, is probably how my parents felt about me when I was playing League all day and screwed up in highschool.\n\nImagine a League of Legends where teams are truly able to fortify and zone areas through a consistent roster of territorial champions, a League of Legends where a lot of champions would have an accentuated aggressive playstyle compared to what we know today, and a new type of champion that sacrifices some of these specific powers so that their design allows them to create a new playstyle (control) where these characters are all about controlling the map, whilst being versatile and adaptive. \n\nIt would be a game where a champion such as [Maokai would now be a territorial tank](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-maokai-twisted-treant.html) that truly delivers on giving you that angry forest playstyle. \n\nA game where [Malphite would have even more of that rolling stone playstyle going on.](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-malphite-shard-of.html)\n\nOr where [Galio would finally play as a gargoyle fulfilling the tank role with a control playstyle. ](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2013/01/champion-redesign-galio-sentinels-sorrow.html)\n\n[A game where Heimerdinger finally gets to invent stuff because he actually gets to build stuff and be an inventor.](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-heimerdinger-revered.html)\n\nA game where you would want to pick Zyra because she&#039;s the nature mage of League of Legends and not because she&#039;s just good at teamfighting, which would result in [her being a control champion that&#039;s all about growing and taking care of her plants,](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-zyra-rise-of-thorns.html)turning Summoner&#039;s Rift into her own garden.\n\nA game where toplaners like Yorick, instead of being an unhealthy and boring design, now [gets to be that Necromancer that can control a herd of zombies and as a gravedigger turns portions of the map into a graveyard.](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2013/01/champion-redesign-yorick-gravedigger.html)\n\nDoesn&#039;t all of that sound refreshingly exciting?\n\nI&#039;m not trying to step on your balls here, Riot, but I want you to feel [this](http://imgur.com/ifoujoa) under all of your @sses. You used to share the numbers of the playerbase of League of Legends, but seeing as you don&#039;t do that anymore and taking into account the existence of other MOBA&#039;s and the amount of people complaining on the forums compared to the amount of complaining three years ago, one can only assume that the playerbase is slowly diminishing because people are done with your game, quit, and might even jump ship to other games. And chances are that because of the reasons I have been explaining throughout this entire thread, you won&#039;t actually be able to fix the game and can only try to slow down the rate at which people are leaving. Not to mention the fact that oversaturation is another problem the game has to face eventually, and my guess is that League of Legends would die in a heartbeat the moment you remove the carrot from the stick and people will no longer have any new playable content to look forward to.\nAnd I mean it when I say that it comes from the bottom of my heart when I tell you how grateful I am for what you have created to so far, but in order to develop the best moba game ever that is as accessible as it can be, as impressively deep and skillful and as fun as it can be, what ultimately would result in the game becoming truly the most viewed and most readable eSport where even people who don&#039;t even play the game can enjoy watching a match and understand what&#039;s happening, there&#039;s simply no room for these major thematic inconsistencies like this:\n\nWhy does the Monkey King do more deceiving than [Leblanc the Deceiver? ](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-leblanc-deceiver.html)\n\n[Why does Kha&#039;Zix have a passive that does more damage to isolated targets if it would be more fitting better on this guy who&#039;s supposed to be the embodiment of a nightmare that haunts you?](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-nocturne-eternal.html)\n\nAnd why does this same creature evolve himself when it&#039;d be more appropriate for [this half-robot man to do that by engineering his own suit?](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-viktor-machine-herald.html) Viktor&rsquo;s passive is called &lsquo;&rsquo;Glorious Evolution&rsquo;&rsquo; after all.\n\nWouldn&#039;t it be cool [to make Alistar play like a bull](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-alistar-minotaur.html), while this would make room for [this guy which is basically a placeholder for what we know of Alistar today so League of Legends can still have a colossal figure that heals and headbutts people?](http://lolchampdesigns.tumblr.com/post/34494405492/original-champion-edmund-the-abomination)\n\nAnd while I&#039;m at it I might as well say it would be so much more readable and fitting that instead of this robot hooking people, [you let this guy do that.](http://lolchampdesigns.tumblr.com/post/36449434900/original-champion-ronan-the-fisherman)\n\nFixing all of these problems would make room for a game with way more interesting stuff, and more diversity, where for example the support role could consist out various niches offered by champions that could be yet again divided into the three strategic playstyles of territorial, aggressive, and control.\n\nLike this [Lux could finally be the mage of light of League of Legends](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2013/02/champion-redesign-lux-lady-of-luminosity.html), that supports her team by defensively granting them vision, where [Vel&#039;Koz the Eye of the Void could provide vision in a way more aggressive way](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2015/03/champion-redesign-velkoz-eye-of-void.html) and getting up in the team&#039;s face with [his cute, iconic, mini-sauron,](http://imgur.com/VZZe8dN) and [Teemo could grant his team vision in a more versatile way](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-teemo-swift-scout.html) by being the swift scout that he is and dropping his mushrooms.\n\n_** @Morello**_\n\nMorello, I wanted to deliver a specific message to you because I can&#039;t thank you enough for what you&#039;ve done for us so far and I&#039;m unable to express into words how I felt like when our thread from three years got over a quarter million views when at the time I was still in doubt of whether I was even worthy enough of this world. And I know that sounds cheesy but it&#039;s true.\nAnd we all know you&#039;re no longer even the Lead Champion Designer of League of Legends and that you&#039;re currently working in R &amp; D to create some new game where we will probably be able to play as the character Phreak and slay hundreds and thousands of Teemo&#039;s with an unlimited supply of trinity forces to deal tons of DMG, but you must understand my cause and disappointment since there hasn&#039;t really changed much in these years and now the game seems to be slowly dying.\nNot to mention the mixed feelings of both pride and frustration when we saw you guys deciding on giving Quinn the niche of mobility as a marksman, while our thread and [this Redesign](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2013/02/champion-redesign-quinn-and-valor.html) has just been sitting here for three years already and while I&#039;m fairly certain it would considered to be so much more fun, fitting and successful.\nAnd don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m not suddenly trying to make the general message of this thread: &lsquo;&rsquo;We told you so&rsquo;&rsquo; but I would rather want you to take this video an as invitation.\n\nI&rsquo;m just hoping you can do something. And not for me, but perhaps you could take a moment and think about ItemsGuy. Because even though I know that you have already met the guy, I&#039;m telling you, Itemsguy, or Ryan Melley, however the hell you wanna call him, is a fricken genius. And I know in my heart that there&rsquo;s a bunch you guys at Riot could learn from him.\n\nBecause, as a matter of fact, Morello, I&#039;m kind of done [(and I think you&#039;d understand why).](http://imgur.com/KPnHN10) To tell you the truth I was already quite done with the game as soon as ItemsGuy provided me with all this knowledge and kind of ruined the game for me [(and I think you know what that feels like).](http://imgur.com/yaTZ04G)\nAnd even though I managed to stay away from the game for about a year, I can&#039;t let it go, I keep coming back to the game because I read Ryan&#039;s redesigns from time to time. I&#039;ll hop into a game and select a champion I&#039;d be excited for to be reworked properly, a champion Ryan/ItemsGuy has designed better on paper, and after a few minutes into the game I will be remembered of all the reasons why I quit and realize how boring things still are. And that the reason I keep coming back is that I have nostalgia for a game that doesn&#039;t even exist yet. \n[A game that League of Legends could be](http://imgur.com/oZVpf9k) [(and you&#039;ve already kind of started this process of making the game feel almost entirely different from what we were used to).](http://imgur.com/p9SZbYY)\n\nSo, a MOBA game where every champion offers the most fun and powerful gaming experience they could possibly deliver, which results in an extremely readable game with engaging counterplay and mind blowing strategic playstyles that could be broadcasted on national television and people who don&#039;t even play the game could understand what&#039;s happening and enjoy themselves watching a match? \n\nI, Yaime Loveheart, vote yes. Now who&#039;s with me?\n\nLet&#039;s start a riot!\n\n-------------------------------\n\nRyan Melley/ItemsGuy redesigns blog:\nhttp://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/\n\nRyan Melley/ItemsGuy business related:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-mell...\nhttp://www.ryanmelley.com/\n\n--------------------------------\n\nHelp make a change. League is dying right now and it seems that the players nor Riot know why exactly. Ryan Melley/ItemsGuy&#039;s Redesigns are good examples of how the game can be fixed and saved from a slowly but surely dying playerbase.\n\nIf you can, help us by spreading Ryan Melley&#039;s work and his name. Make sure Riot can&#039;t ignore this thread or the video on youtube. Support under this thread, as well as likes or even views on the youtube video are very much appreciated.\n\nAlso, in this case, do shoot the messenger. Although approved by Ryan/ItemsGuy himself, making the video and this thread has been solely my decision and responsibility. That is because I can&#039;t let this go, the game simply means too much for me to just leave in silence without a Finales Funkeln.\n\nThank you, and, I love you.\n\n-Yaime","replies":[{"poster":"Pledgie","date":"2016-03-18T19:30:31.847+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"takes 30 rolls of the scroll wheel to get to comment section. upvoted","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2016-03-18T20:10:29.092+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's nice to hear that there are people out here who share my appreciate for a good ol' fashioned wall of text!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AATTRROOXX","date":"2016-03-18T03:50:39.431+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is your complaint?

It's a very mage-y ability, and even though you could say \"but he's a tanky guy so durability makes sense on him!\" it seems it would make more sense for that durability to be more brutish than magical in nature. \n\nFor **B**, consider Fiora - new mechanics were introduced into her kit to allow her to become more of a fencing-style duelist (dash in and out, strike at vitals for winning trades), while also allowing her to be \"fair\" in that dueling power (contrast Yi who really just needs to right-click on you and out-stat you to win duels). However, they also decided to give her an ult that heals her entire team rather than something that would be more at home in the context of a masterful duelist!

It's gotten to the point where Riot seems to be boiling down a champion's niche to their ultimate: Vi's niche is that she can reliably CC the enemy carry, Kindred's niche is that she can stop people from dying, Fiora's niche is that she can heal her whole team, etc. - and you can notice that these \"niches\" have very little to do with whatever those champions are doing whenever that R button is grey. This sort of monotonous routine is what seems to be driving a good number of players away (if threads on the boards and stuff like Dunkey's video are anything to go by), it's almost like despite there being 130 champions in the roster, every game manages to feel more or less the same!\n\n(Went a little over 8 sentences, but hopefully this all still makes sense)\n\nPS - Also, I guess it's nice to meet another \"I\" Guy!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Urgonnalearn2day","date":"2016-03-18T01:22:09.579+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":16,"body":"You say a lot of things as though they are fact.... it's really a long winded opinion that's just painful to read.","replies":[{"poster":"Yaime Loveheart","date":"2016-03-18T01:42:28.206+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":6,"body":"Game Design can be approached as science (you can objectively measure the cause and effect of overly complex technical aspects, the satisfaction of romping around in the boots of a well-themed character (or the manner of how much has been lived up to the theme of a character while it was in development, really), the replayability of a game in terms of strategic diversity the game offers, etcetera!)\n\nI mean no offense, but the things I state are not simply a matter of opinion, and even if they were, there's enough material out there to support the thought that the things I say are in line with the opinions of Riot and the direction they have envisioned for the game.

Take a look at all the content Riot has brought out in the last three years, in the ~15 months especially. They hammer on theming, variety, distinctiveness, exaggerated strengths and weaknesses (which allows for champions like Tahm Kench and Bard to exist, very dramatic designs in terms of gameplay which people wouldn't have been able to dream of about three years ago and prior to that!)\n> \n> Seriously, feel free to stick to your opinion. But in all honesty, taking a step back from the MOBA genre itself and the work Riot has put out in the past (and comparing that to their more recent work), everything adds up.\n\nI think you make a lot of interesting points but I'm unclear about your stance on relationship between \"lore\" type stuff to \"gameplay\" type stuff because on the one hand you say that lore type stuff is what holds back other MOBAs from being the best and then you don't like it when champions in LoL do things a tree wouldn't do or a falconer wouldn't do as if this other part of the game should be driving the mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"Yaime Loveheart","date":"2016-03-18T01:59:15.310+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lore shouldn't be pivotal to read for players in order to understand something about the game. But lore itself is absolutely great! If you'd want my opinion on the current state of the lore in League of Legends I'd rather not do that here because it'd open up a whole other discussion that would just derive from my thread which has to do with gameplay. \n\nBut what I'd like to say to you regarding lore is the following; lore is absolutely awesome. This is also an edge League has over HOTS (Blizzard can't really make a story out of their MOBA game, or at least not a very rich and serious one seeing as it's just a bunch of characters from different games all sucked into one game, and they don't even have interest in doing that anyway!)\n\nWhereas for League, the League of Legends lore could be very, very rich. I could even see books being published about characters, etcetera.\n\nThere's just one rule; lore should give more insight about characters for those who are interested to read about the background and stories regarding the lore of the game or certain characters. However, it shouldn't be pivotal to read to understand something in-game. I know I've used Mordekaiser very early in the thread. As for him, he could've been a character with a very readable design, with healthy counterplay and tied to a unifying resonant theme. As long as that's done, you could make up about any cool, deep, interesting story about him!\n\nEDIT: Also, just to clear that up and clarify once more: lore itself doesn't restrict a game. Even if lore has to explain for certain things in the game, lore isn't the thing to blame, but the game itself. An unreadable game is an unreadable game, and whether that game depends on the lore explaining these inconsistencies or not, it doesn't really matter. As long as you have a game that is as readable as it can be (by really holding true to the core of the theme of a champion and pushing that to the next level so they have a unifying, fitting playstyle with characteristic abilities), lore can go and be as wild as a player could wish for! \nBecause if that's the case, even players who don't care about the lore don't have any disadvantage!\n\nIt's similar to the argument with adding visual particles/animation to abilities; mechanics shouldn't depend on the visuals, they should merely support them. Just as lore should merely support the game in terms of adding story, the game shouldn't depend on it by telling players through lore why some dude in full metal armour actually happens to steal your ghost.\n\nGlad you think I've made some interesting points!

It isn't characteristic to a bull, it takes up 20% of his space that could have been dedicated to a mechanic that actually does make sense for a bull to do. (all in all this makes sure Alistar delivers less of a powerful experience as a playable character, as well does it harm the readability, and therefore also the accessibility of the game).\n\n2. Champions that have abilities that aren't fitting to their theme make sure they kind of prevent other interesting characters being added to the game. In case of Alistar: he doesn't really play like a bull. Obviously, his knock-up and knock-back was derived from a rampaging bull (charging and pushing away, then knocking into the air), but what it really is, is just a very watered down and abstract realization of what a ''true bull playstyle could be.'' \n\nCurrent Alistar's kit is just fine, but it doesn't belong on a bull, hence his current kit would be very appropriate for a character such as [Edmund, the Abomination.](http://lolchampdesigns.tumblr.com/post/34494405492/original-champion-edmund-the-abomination) See how the healing could actually be interpreted way easier here with him having these canisters on his back that would light up if he uses his heal?\n\n[Now that we know Edmund, Alistar can have his own kit and truly deliver on playing as the mad cow we all want him to be.](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-alistar-minotaur.html) Which, all in all, besides fixing the theme's of these champions, even improve upon the accessibility and readability of the game!","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2016-03-19T02:53:31.768+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now, I'm not wanting to sit here and be like \"this is a bull, bulls don't heal people\" because what you're saying has truth.

Alister heals people, Nunu sucks up and distributes heat (no where in his lore does he do this nor learn this magic), and its never explained why Annie charmed her bear into a plush toy.\n\nI will say that there are things on some champs that make me cringe, a lot. \n\nIn alphabetical order I'll list them.\n\n{{champion:34}} Moves very slowly for a flying champion.\n{{champion:1}} stuns enemies.

I don't understand how half the Stands in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, but I can't say it isn't a damn fun read! League of Legends, however, is a fast-paced competitive game with well over 100 characters, so it might be good if players can look at any one of those characters (or more likely than not, the other 9 that are in any given match with them) and get the basic gist. Alistar being a magic bull (or \"minotaur\" in this case) should mean that he does bull stuff but cooler than bulls do it, Quinn should do cool falcon stuff that real falconers can't do (like flying with Valor or having such strong communication with him - as an ex-falconer, I can say that birds of prey just kind of do what they want!), and so on. \n\nAnivia - I agree with you on this one, although I think something along the lines of designing her more after a secretary bird while having her use her wings to whip up arctic winds could be a solution to her that doesn't require giving her mobility. That being said, there are a thousand \"cryophoenix\" kits that could work, and for instance, something like Aurelion Sol's W -> E combo could make sense and be pretty cool on her. \n\nAnnie - This is actually a big gripe I have with Annie and Brand! Fire can do a lot of cool things, but freezing people in place isn't one of 'em. \n\nAzir - His huge mobility in general kind of plays at odds with his territorial gameplay (he should be strong where is soldiers are at the cost of not really being able to move around that much); that, and he seems like he should always want to keep his enemies on the other side of his soldiers.\n\nBlitzcrank - I'd actually say that something along the lines of kicking into overdrive and then having to cool down makes sense for any mechanical thing (think of opening up 20 big programs on your computer and then having to let the fans cool it off for a while). As well, having to suffer for momentary mobility makes sense as the kind of mobility a large champion would have (granted it makes sense that they'd be moving, so something like that on Maokai or Yorick wouldn't make sense due to theming). That being said, huge mobility on a champion with a long-range pull is't great, considering that the intended counterplay to that is moot when Blitz can rapidly position for it (or just run up to you and lose it).\n\nMundo - Also this! It's just kind of random.\n\nEkko - Stealing speed makes sense (slowing enemies down and speeding them up), but yeah, the time zone is really mechanically contrived and unintuitive in how it works, even though it makes sense from a purely mechanical perspective (get a more powerful effect when you take risks etc.). \n\nEvelyn - I know, right! Why does a sneaky assassin have an ult that's most effective against the exact thing she wants to steer clear of? (This thing being clustered up groups of high-health enemies)\n\nEzreal - I'd argue that any mobility Ezreal has could be attributed to him being a \"magical explorer\" - that being said, a little blink is a really lame version of that, and champs like Bard and Aurelion Sol feel more like explorers than he does. He's less *The Prodigal Explorer* and more *The Prodigal Guy Who Shoots Magic Stuff*. \n\nFiddlesticks - Doesn't really make sense for a scarecrow, huh! They're meant to scare people away, not stick a *straw* in them and suck 'em dry. \n\nFizz - I'd attribute that to him \"dodging\" attacks by jumping on his pole weapon (like how Vlad dodges attacks by turning into blood or Yi dodges attacks by moving really fast), but then that brings the question why a fish-themed champion is doing that (rather than being slippery for more fish-like reasons, like slipping out of CC). \n\nGangplank - Oranges are good for your health! Maybe I've played too many video games, but I don't think it's a stretch to associate eating food with some sort of heal or positive buff. It doesn't seem to have much to do with the rest of his kit (being a tricky, underhanded pirate) beyond meme status, though....\n\nGnar - I think it's more of a mechanical thing - the important thing here is that he's doing this damage by constantly hitting people with his boomerang, which is the thematic aspect. It also makes sense, I suppose, that Mini Gnar does consistent damage that is dangerous when ignored but not especially devastating on its own (and having him be able to deal competitive damage to tanky targets without % health damage would mean he'd absolutely blow up squishies, which might work for Mega Gnar, but not Mini Gnar).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2016-03-18T02:40:22.438+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's more of \"since Alistar, a massive minotaur with a splash art that [looks like this](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/54/Alistar_OriginalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150109040256), has an ability that's dedicated to healing, his kit has less room to let the player do cool angry bull stuff.\"\n\nIt's like if Jhin had an ability dedicated to kissing his teammates' boo-boos better, or if Soraka's ult had her pull up her non-existent sleeves and One Punch Man the hell out of someone.

Can't say that it worked. Kind of a shame that Karma is pretty much a generic mage right now, the only thing that was really ''karmatic'' about her on her old design was her passive, granting her more exp if you screwed with her and lowered her pretty green health bars. And we both know that passive is gone, too.\n\n> Anyways, I mostly agree on your points, even though I disagree on a few smaller concepts. For example, Sion's shield. I think it's drastically harder to rework a champion, compared to when you create a new one. Because you always have to mind the original concept and try to not alienate the fans the character had. While I do agree that the magic shield was unnecessary or even weird, I think it's readable enough and fills a more fitting role. In a way I prefer Riot to slowly work towards what you describe, but still mind the identity of some characters.\n\nFair enough. We'd prefer him to do something that makes him more durable in a brutish, undead warrior kind of way, instead of a magical way, and even though the ability, whether you like it or not, is going to harm the readability of the game because it will always remain a little random and confusing for an undead warrior, it wouldn't be _all that bad_ for keeping it on him for the community's sake. However, this actually becomes more of a problem the moment people are attached to things that actually conflict with how Riot wants the game to be; competitive and engaging.\nFor example, a front-line fighter shouldn't want to hide in brushes to regenerate health. A front-line fighter should be in the frontline and be able to stay there for as long as possible, without having to pu$$y out and recharge as if he's some kind of battery. It's the same reason why Zyra's old passive is going to be removed; her old passive was a stand-a-lone feature on her kit, didn't really mash well with her other 4 abilities, and just only meant something to her when she died. However, these passives that trigger something on death should also be fitting on the character. [Such as an undead warrior rising up from the ground, forcing you to take him down once more](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2013/01/champion-redesign-sion-undead-champion.html). [Or a barbarian going on for just a little longer than you'd actually want him to, before he greets Death and takes off with him.](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-tryndamere-barbarian.html)\n\nBut most importantly, it doesn't fit Zyra's play-pattern: she's all about dropping them AoE damage right now and she can't do that when she's dead, so it conflicts. Zyra has a passive that does something for her when she dies, which is something she's going to want to avoid at all costs anyway. Whereas with Redesign Tryndamere, ofcourse, you wouldn't want to die either, but his barbarian nature makes him want to get into the fray and risk it, going all-in, and even if he ends up falling, it still isn't the end of the world because he's able to go on for just a little longer which his character is all about besides that Redesign passive!\n\nSo sure, arguably, if some designs or abilities would really have to be pardoned (this is more than a ''what if'' of course, instead of ''ItemsGuy and I would really support this decision), Sion's W would kind of be okay. However, as for things the players have grown attached to but just isn't really healthy for the game, such as health-regenerating brush Garen, those just can't really be pardoned. The kit of a champion should work towards one goal, and if Zyra should be about her plants and doing stuff with them/growing stuff with them, giving her a passive that allows her to do something when she dies probably isn't a very smart thing.\nAll of Garen's abilities encourage him to be at the front-line,[ so his passive should to](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-might-of-demacia.html), this is all for making League of Legends a better game, even if this change would mean we'd have to say goodbye to brush Garen!\n\n> And this is where I adress my main point. I am one of the Karma mains, that were rather pissed off at the 5.10 changes (removal of shieldbomb), or as some Old Karma fan's called it \"the murdering of the last aspect reminiscent of Karma\".\n\nI feel a little sad sometimes I didn't really get to play old Karma (she was one of those champions for me that you just never saw and never touched yourself, like what Karma used to be to thousands of other players as well), but now taking her rework into account, I'm not so sure if I should be as sad about it.\n\n> You seem to be highly invested into gamedesign and probably as much in love with this game as I am (and even share some disgruntledness with recent design decisions).

Hope he'll give you his two coins regarding what Karma should be and how incredibly hard they F'ed up with her rework. \n\nAnd for me, all I can really say is: her rework doesn't have a theme, not at all. It doesn't revolve around a concrete, defined goal, or something that is characteristic to her character. The approach they took was this; Old Karma is bad and doesn't work, let's make her into a mage that is able to function and be viable while keeping her mantra system in tact (similar to how instead of designing Lissandra around the concept/theme of ''Ice Mage'', they said ''We want her to be able to be an initiating mage'', and then gave her all the tools she needed to be able to do that, which resulted in her being able to randomly teleport to the position of her ice claw ''because we just wanted her to be able to dive into the fray''. She's not ''Karma'' in the sense of the word and concept of Karma itself, which we'd like to think is what Karma should be to League of Legends. Instead they took Karma and turned her into ''Mage that functions with mantra system.'' \nThey're just three random, generic, arbitrary ''mage'' abilities which you can empower every now and then to make them even stronger and give them an additional effect. \nNow, this does sound like it could be very cool, but it just ends up feeling very lame when the abilities have nothing to do with the character it was shoehorned on!\n\nPS: You seem nice. Feel free to add me! I do play a game every now and then, playing champions I feel are less aweful (currently in sort of an affair with Darius so to speak)\n\nCheers, and hope ItemsGuy is going to give you a more detailled response in terms of new and old Karma! He's capable of expressing his thought way more clearly, also because he breathes champion design. I just ''get it'', it's easy for me to conclude whether something is good or bad, or what should be changed, or provide solutions (fun fact: I came up with Yorick Redesign, after I knew ItemsGuy didn't really know what to do with him yet, back in the days), it's harder for me to explain exactly why. Which is to say, I still can, but ItemsGuy just does it a whole lot better!","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-03-22T13:08:56.539+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Sad thing is that two friends of mine whom I live with ended up commenting: _''Dude, if you had only asked us to help you, we would have.''_ And that would probably resulted in a much better video after all.\n\nI think it was Christopher Hitchens (a journalist), who said, that it's a shame that, you usually meet the people at your book presentations, that you should've met before writing the book in the first place. I guess that's the same thing with a lot of stuff. We probably just have to take the input we get and try to incorporate it into our next work.\n\n> And that, ultimately, was the point of the video! I was hoping that the information would out-weigh the things the video could drastically be improved upon! Glad that it seems to have worked for you :)\n\nI started disliking people using good rethoric over good content. Especially politicians are currently pissing me off. I only judge people based on their ideas and arguments, even though that I am aware, that this is not true for the broad masses. It makes me very conflicted when I try to adress the masses ._.\n\n> That said; do you like [Redesign Karma?](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2013/03/champion-redesign-karma-enlightened-one.html)\n\n**Short answer**: nyeos. \n**Long answer**: I have reworked Karma half a dozen times now and noted down the things people liked about her and some things about gameplay, that I need to avoid. Her old passive is one of them. I currently prefer the version, where she gains extra AP based on the hp she (and her allies) has/have lost in the last few seconds. This makes her more reactionary (punishing aggression) and doesn't encourage running around on low hp. \n\nAnother thing, that I dislike is the readability of the crest (2 counters?) and the lore impications. Why would she pass around her crest? I know it's kind of a place holder for a beacon, but it's one of the first things I noticed. And also that you wanted her to be a support, and not a midlaner, as has been for years now (but I guess in your reworks you are targetting a different game than today).\n\nLastly, and most importantly; I liked Karma for the duality in her (mantra'd) skills. Adding an opposite aspect, instead of just giving more of the same. A damage spell, that heals affected allies and a shield, that damages enemies (like, actively, not thorns). It gave her the flexibility she was known for, usually at cost of her power... unless you would find situations, in which both aspects could apply (healing multiple allies and enemies at the same time, shielding a core target and dealing damage, etc.) This also gave her the _\"wise\"_ element, in which you would have to know HOW to apply your spells a lot more, than you do now (well, how do I apply RQ's damage? in their faces, duh). \n\nOther than that, I like the overall idea and design, even though some minor details might be problematic. Like the crest only gaining stacks one way (you could let it get 1 stack each for switching targets, for example). This kind of allied based supporting is something that Orianna with her ball and Lulu with Pix just barely miss, thematically. I'd be lovely to have a champion succeeding on that. \n\n> Kind of a shame that Karma is pretty much a generic mage right now, the only thing that was really ''karmatic'' about her on her old design was her passive, granting her more exp if you screwed with her and lowered her pretty green health bars. And we both know that passive is gone, too.\n\nWell, there was a karmic aspect to her (I have been taught that _\"karmatic\"_ is wrong, apparently?), a dualistic and an enlightened aspect. Her ally-heal symbolized **good karma** (rewarding hardship), while her shieldbomb and passive represented **bad karma** (punish those preying the weak). **Dualism** was apparant in all her basic spells: damage/heal, speed/slow, shield/damage. Unlike Lulu, she could have both aspects at the same time, making it different from the western meaning of dualism (either/or) and highlighting more the _\"understand the wholeness of all things\"_ (embrace all)  dualism in eastern culture. And lastly her **enlightenment** was symbolized by her mantra and lvl6 abilities. All of this made up Karma's old thematics, all borrowed from asian culture.\n\nThat being said, I do agree, that her passive didn't quite encourage the kind of behaviour she should have. But her CURRENT passive does even less of it,..\n\n> Fair enough. We'd prefer him to do something that makes him more durable in a brutish, undead warrior kind of way, instead of a magical way, and even though the ability, whether you like it or not, is going to harm the readability of the game because it will always remain a little random and confusing for an undead warrior, it wouldn't be _all that bad_ for keeping it on him for the community's sake. \n\nI am sometimes very conflicted with those things, because there also seem to be good arguments for keeping it. In a way, it has become his character, and some \"odd\" flavour to some designs make champions more interesting in the longrun. Or unique. Just another undead warrior, compared to an undead warrior with an exploding bloodshield? \nOr let me put it this way; there are a lot more problems that I see, that highlight this problem better, than Sion. Quinn's example was probably one of the best. \n\n> However, this actually becomes more of a problem the moment people are attached to things that actually conflict with how Riot wants the game to be; competitive and engaging.\n\nI am not sure about that, actually. \nSome person (gbay99?) once compared LoL to football/soccer. Because it's an everyman's sport, that can become competitive. People like watching it, because they used to play it, when they were younger. It's like your guitar example. Riot is currently trying, as seen by Manamune and Alistar-combo changes, to make competitive and the normal game more alike, instead of just making it more competitive/engaging.\n\nI guess making more people play a game, to understand it while watching, makes more sense when building on nerd culture, instead of building a game that everyone can watch (is that feasible?). \n\n> For example, a front-line fighter shouldn't want to hide in brushes to regenerate health. A front-line fighter should be in the frontline and be able to stay there for as long as possible, without having to pu$$y out and recharge as if he's some kind of battery.\n\nIsn't the argument here, that they wanted to give him the tools of going in, getting his head bashed in, running out, and having good incentives to reenagage as soon as possible? Basically reducing the downtime between his fights. I do agree, that this leads to some funny gameplay, like Bush-Garen. But I think this is also due to the fact, that Garen has problems with gapclosing... which he doesn't have if he can surprise someone. I think Riot's approach of readucing his downtime on higher levels and making him at least charge key targets, while nerfing his overall damage against everyone else, makes sense. Because he is less likely to just camp and jump _anyone_.\n\nOh and Zyra's passive is an abomination in terms of gameplay. Thematically, it at least gets across, that Zyra isn't the person, but the plant. I reckon? But they want to change it in the mage update anyways.\n\n> similar to how instead of designing Lissandra around the concept/theme of ''Ice Mage'', they said ''We want her to be able to be an initiating mage'', and then gave her all the tools she needed to be able to do that\n\nI mean, at least they had learned, at that point, that champions don't only need a thematic character, but also an ingame one.\nBut out of curiosity.... a \"frozen\" stun, a root, several slows and a heckton of damage. Isn't this what you'd expect from Lissandra? And isn't her ice-shard travelling trying to get across the way she usually moves.... like, ~~holiday~~ on ice?\n\n> PS: You seem nice.

I also really, really like designing supports and can/will turn just about every champion into one. : P\n\n>Lastly, and most importantly; I liked Karma for the duality in her (mantra'd) skills. Adding an opposite aspect, instead of just giving more of the same. A damage spell, that heals affected allies and a shield, that damages enemies (like, actively, not thorns).\n\nThing is, while this might be somewhat colorful from a thematic standpoint, it's actually not great from a gameplay perspective. One thing that designers must try to create, regardless of game, regardless of genre, are these things called \"meaningful choices\" - since that's what introduces the idea of giving players real consequences for their actions. Hell, it's why people rag on Telltale games so often (and David Cage games are worse about this), because you can make all these decisions and still end up at the same destination.\n\nSo having Mantra on Karma increase her spell effects is important because she can decide that she needs to make an offensive play or a defensive one, and even while Mantra Q still does a bit of both (prevents damage while reflecting it to enemies), you still press it when you just want to do a stronger version of what that ability does. Karma's flexibility and duality, then, comes from the fact that she has such distinct offensive and defensive capabilities on her kit, not that her high moments involve kind-of-sort-of a jumble of offensive and defensive power. \n\n> This kind of allied based supporting is something that Orianna with her ball and Lulu with Pix just barely miss, thematically.

They may have grown up in that house, but that's no reason not to fix it - although I do agree that certain iconic elements ([Nasus](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.com/2013/01/champion-redesign-nasus-curator-of-sands.html?q=nasus)'s Q, [Nunu](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.com/2012/12/champion-redesign-nunu-yeti-rider.html?q=nunu) being a counter-jungling devil) are what I try to build redesigns around when it doesn't sit at odds with game health. \n\nIt's not that Sion shouldn't explode, it's that he could be doing something so much cooler instead, something that would become memorable for all the right reasons (like an \"Undead Juggernaut\" running halfway across the map to slam his body into your team).\n\n>I guess making more people play a game, to understand it while watching, makes more sense when building on nerd culture, instead of building a game that everyone can watch (is that feasible?).\n\nThe question here becomes \"should they want to watch it just because they've happened to play it, or should watching it be able to inspire people to play?\" If League is something you can watch and get sucked into because of the larger-than-life iconic things a champion can do, the things that are so cool yet make *perfect sense*, I'd imagine that would be better than people just deciding to watch it because they already play the game. I can get into a soccer game because I understand what everyone is trying to do, and can recognize when something amazing happens. Imagine in League, instead of watching people Flash about and use their weird ults on each other, you see an amazing counter-initiation from a team with a Maokai who sinks in his roots and traps the entire enemy team in his forest? Or perhaps if you see Amumu pulling together an entire team for a big hug while Brand turns them into a bonfire?\n\nWatching League should be more like watching these diverse and interesting characters duke it out, and less like watching bundles of mechanics fulfill technical roles better than their opponents. \n\n>Basically reducing the downtime between his fights.\n\nThis can be done [without encouraging him to sit in brush all day](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.com/2012/12/champion-redesign-might-of-demacia.html?q=garen) (and I may actually steal Tahm's grey health mechanic once I get around to reworking him, since it's also a mechanic that only rewards regeneration once you've actually stepped in to the fight instead of going from 10% health to full because you hid behind your tower for a while). \n\n>But out of curiosity.... a \"frozen\" stun, a root, several slows and a heckton of damage. Isn't this what you'd expect from Lissandra? And isn't her ice-shard travelling trying to get across the way she usually moves.... like, holiday on ice?\n\nAll the CC in her kit makes sense (although her splintering skillshot sits at odd with her root and stun considering where she ideally wants to be positioned), and the last I remembered, ice doesn't really get around by teleporting to other ice. I'd love to find the actual post on the old forums, but I remember either Meddler's or Morello's reason behind that one ability was \"We were trying to find a place for it for a while and it made sense on a point-blank AoE mage). \n\n>I'm on EUW\n\nSo is Yaime!","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-03-23T05:01:11.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Main reason I don't do something like this is, \"Karma is more dangerous at low HP\" is a bit more readable than \"Karma is temporarily more dangerous based on some amount of health both her and her allies have lost.\"\n\nI use 3 bars next to her hp/mana to represent this.

Erm, I would call this thriving, very much so.\nGetting there was the other thing, though.\n\n> Redesign!Karma should feel a bit better about getting hit.\n\nAs far as I've seen, without instant heals or shields, controlling your hp at low health seems to be very hard though. So yes, better for getting hit, but worse staying at low hp, which your proposed passive promotes.\n\n> As for lore implications, in a pinch, I will more often than not push these to the wayside considering League is a game first and foremost, and that the out-of-game narrative exists as a supplement to gameplay.\n\nI was just saying it probably should be something else than her crest, which it could easily be.

I love supportive characters.\n\n> So having Mantra on Karma increase her spell effects is important because she can decide that she needs to make an offensive play or a defensive one,\n\nThis is why Old Karma's mantra allowed her not only to change a spells use, but a whole spell rotation. Depending on her mantra she would have **damage-slow-damage** or **heal-speed-shield**. I never thought these weren't meaningful choices, neither did I think that including the decision \"can I guarantee a propperly placed shieldbomb\" into my consideration of what to mantra.\n\nAlso about meaningful choices, when giving someone both, shield and damage:\nJust for a short mindgame, imagine a shield being 80% effective, compared to others, with an added AoE, that has 80% of the usual  damage of an AoE.\nNow in most situations you could use one or the other, to yield a subpar ability, but the flexibility makes up for some things. And sometimes, you would be able to use a spell at 160% effectiveness, compared to other abilities. Now, if this happens to happen around 1 in 4 cases, you have 80-80-80-160 -> 400% effectiveness in 4 casts, so the same as other 100% effectiveness abilities.\n\nBut you feel clever for finding these situations in which the other part isn't wasted, even though you are expected to. But having an ability that scales with your cleverness is actually...quite clever itself and fitting of a champion designed around wisdom :). And, again, this seems like meaningful choices, to be honest (because sometimes taking the 80% effectiveness in a good situation is better than 160% effectiveness in a bad situation).\n\n> you still press it when you just want to do a stronger version of what that ability does.\n\nThis is exactly what I and many other Karma mains find currently boring about her :-/\nCurrently, so many other champions do this, and Karma appears to be all about her mantra. So it being like all the others just feels wrong, when it used to be so much more (one root of her complexity, decision making and way of showing propper Karma mastery).\n\n> It's not that Sion shouldn't explode, it's that he could be doing something so much cooler instead,\n\nAs I wrote to Yaime, I think this depends a lot on what exactly you would replace it with. Just saying _\"something cooler\"_ makes it too easy for me to agree, but I wanna stay sceptical until I actually see something I would prefer for sure.\n\n> \"should they want to watch it just because they've happened to play it, or should watching it be able to inspire people to play?\"\n\nI wasn't sucked in be the competitive aspect of it, but because I wanted to learn about all the different champions (before even seeing a full game). I am probably not that representative of the population, though :-/. How did you get sucked in? Or the majority of players, for that matter?\n\n> Watching League should be more like watching these diverse and interesting characters duke it out, and less like watching bundles of mechanics fulfill technical roles better than their opponents.\n\nI mean, they are colorful either way. I am also a bit unsure whether certain characters also limits the creativity behind certain playstyles... like players building certain champs differently, a very strong factor in early League (AP/AD ez? early nidalee? AP/AD sion?). Something I too enjoy, which I somehow miss in your updates and recent reworks. But your reworks are for another game, essentially, so I could be wrong.\n\n> This can be done without encouraging him to sit in brush all day\n\nI don't see any mechanic in this redesign, that would fill a particularly better role than just plain more resistances in fight.

I think so.\n\n> So is Yaime!\n\nHe... wait....what? But.... is this just his secondary acc for NA?","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2016-03-23T06:23:40.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I use 3 bars next to her hp/mana to represent this. Should be as understandable or even more so than the crests thingy.\n\nThe bars only solve part of the puzzle. The other one is one that Hecarim's self-heal illustrated as a pretty big problem a while ago: in a game like LoL, it's pretty hard to make decisions based on damage you aren't involved in. In Hecarim's case, it's mainly about his self-heal being really hard to optimize, while it seems that from what I know about your Karma's case, it's about not having a \"right choice\" when it comes to who to damage.\n\nEven if you think otherwise, having a big floating crest over the head of the person you don't want to attack creates a much more immediately clear gameplay experience than \"maybe don't attack Karma or anyone near her unless maybe if her pips are all the way filled or maybe if they're not filled up yet??\" \n\n>More damage, better shielding, missing%hp heal? Erm, I would call this thriving, very much so.\nGetting there was the other thing, though.\n\nThose were more tools that she happened to have, but their overall general usefulness (especially with \"stronger at lower health\" being largely expressed through AP scaling, which can't be as strong or noticeable as a tertiary scaling effect since you can simply buy it) was pretty limited. Redesign Karma gets a lot more bang for her buck when she's under fire, because she gets stronger from both being at low health *and* taking hits (which is what would bring her to low health).\n\n>As far as I've seen, without instant heals or shields, controlling your hp at low health seems to be very hard though. So yes, better for getting hit, but worse staying at low hp, which your proposed passive promotes.\n\nShields aren't the only form of damage mitigation, thankfully - the ability to block one instance of damage can potentially be better than any shield if timed right, and the power of that counterattack with the bonus AP she gets should be enough to benefit from the aggression she doesn't outright discourage, unless she's just in a really bad position (where the \"risk\" part of the \"risk/reward\" manifests). \n\nA staggered heal is also allowed to be a bit stronger than one you get all at once, and is especially useful when Karma puts the fear of god into people when it comes to throwing burst damage at her - unless they're really eager to have it thrown right back in their face, anyway!\n\n>But you feel clever for finding these situations in which the other part isn't wasted, even though you are expected to. But having an ability that scales with your cleverness is actually...quite clever itself and fitting of a champion designed around wisdom :). And, again, this seems like meaningful choices, to be honest (because sometimes taking the 80% effectiveness in a good situation is better than 160% effectiveness in a bad situation).\n\nUnfortunately, while you may be able to see the cleverness in it, that sort of mechanic most often manifests in false options and strategic stifling. The player gets two vague answers to situations that call for multiple things (ally is dying, enemies are not dying fast enough) rather than getting to feel good and smart about reading the situation well and making the \"right\" choice, while their opponent sees a situation where they have no ability to force your hand in some way or another. Compare to Heimer seeing a situation that calls for both damage and CC (since both of those tend to be pretty useful) and realizing that damage is much more important, or his opponent not wanting to let him throw damage at their team and getting rewarded for forcing him to blow his ult on CC in self-defense instead.\n\nWorst-case scenario for the Karma player is that they have to deal with the fact that they got the full use out of one underwhelming mechanic instead of two.\n\n>This is exactly what I and many other Karma mains find currently boring about her :-/\nCurrently, so many other champions do this, and Karma appears to be all about her mantra. So it being like all the others just feels wrong, when it used to be so much more (one root of her complexity, decision making and way of showing propper Karma mastery).\n\nI think you may be putting a bit too much stock into that ultimate, when it's really just a vessel for her other abilities. Since her other abilities right now are pretty boring, her ult is consequently boring - I doubt her ulted Q right now would be more interesting if its explosion did less damage so it could heal allies. \n\n>As I wrote to Yaime, I think this depends a lot on what exactly you would replace it with. Just saying \"something cooler\" makes it too easy for me to agree, but I wanna stay sceptical until I actually see something I would prefer for sure.\n\nI think my solution earlier would be to have Sion swing wildly in front of himself for a few seconds, reducing frontal damage while also damaging enemies in front of him with each swing. It would be a brute-force way of defending himself (and one that demands aggression, since it's useless while running away), and it also plays a lot better with his other abilities since they can be used to maximize its offensive power (his shield also does this partially due to the delay before it can be popped, but that ends up being watered down since he can just shield a few seconds before walking up to you rather than having to deal with the consequence of using it in combat). \n\nThere are plenty of other solutions, of course, but there's also the point that any ability that employs brute force, on Sion, would be a cooler and more appropriate alternative than anything that does not. You don't play as Ryze so you can hit people with a stick, after all. \n\n>I mean, they are colorful either way. I am also a bit unsure whether certain characters also limits the creativity behind certain playstyles... like players building certain champs differently, a very strong factor in early League (AP/AD ez? early nidalee?

But your reworks are for another game, essentially, so I could be wrong.\n\n\"You can build different stats!\" isn't very compelling gameplay, and I have a strong feeling that people become so attached to stuff like AP Trynd because either A) regular Trynd isn't that interesting to start with, or B) no other champion provides the gameplay experience that AP Trynd does. My goal is to create a roster so diverse that this is no longer an issue, so slapping AP values onto things for no reason isn't something I make a habit of doing.\n\nAs for items, they should be more about strategic options than stats. ZZ'Rot and Randuin's are both tank items, yet they fulfill very different purposes and create very different playstyles. Champions should have a lot of decisions to make while simply building within their role, which I also feel that League doesn't do as well as it could. \n\n>I don't see any mechanic in this redesign, that would fill a particularly better role than just plain more resistances in fight.

Current Garen doesn't want to fight all the time, because he has to back off to heal. Redesign!Garen doesn't want to fight all the time, because his effectiveness (damage, durability, sustain) drops off after a few seconds due to ability cooldowns and effect durations. \n\nThe reason his W manifests durability through both defense *and* sustain, is that it gives him the possibility of coming out of a fight with more health than he had going in, if he's able to play decisively rather than savagely slugging it out like that no-good Demacian counterpart of his.\n\n>I think, in the beginning Riot just tried to use kits that could make some kind of sense, thematically, but more working from a \"what abilities are even possible/thinkable\" perspective, rather than from the perspective we can look at it today.

I think so.\n\nThis is part of Riot's growing pains, and I fully acknowledge that I've only been able to learn so quickly from Riot's mistakes and successes because I'm doing it from an outside perspective. With Riot, it's a combination of not everybody working on every project, and not having a lot of time to look back on mistakes because there's always a new problem to break through.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-03-23T13:19:56.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The bars only solve part of the puzzle.

This is why nobody would've minded Old Karma being gone if her RQ would've dealt more damage and RE would've healed the target too.\n\n> I think my solution earlier would be to have Sion swing wildly in front of himself for a few seconds, reducing frontal damage while also damaging enemies in front of him with each swing. \n\nFor some reason I find Sion to be more boring if all he offers thematically is \"undead brute\" and the bloodshield is gone.

However, when talking about decisions based on damage you are not involvied in: Similar things would apply to your crest in a sololane.\n\nExcept, visual indicators aren't just there to look pretty! The point of having stuff like Jhin's ammo count or Darius's floating bleed stacks are to give allies and opponents an idea of what your capabilities are (ex. someone who has 3 bleed stacks might want to back off before they get 5).\n\nThis ties in pretty well with your next point, as with the crest, it's an in-game visual that provides opponents with a clear indicator of your capabilities (don't attack the person with the crest vs. don't attack anyone near Karma except maybe when she already has full pips or doesn't have any). Solo lane problem has also been addressed in the previous post I think, insofar as you would have no real reason to attack a Karma in a solo lane so all she'd be accomplishing is allowing you to freefarm. Karma's a duo-lane champion because she can discourage you from attacking someone you absolutely do want to attack (the marksman who will destroy you if they get to freefarm) at the cost of leaving herself open, leading to risk/reward scenarios or one where you could bait her into protecting herself and leaving her marksman open.\n\n>Unless it's in a sololane, because then Karma will permanently have the crest and counterdamage for free.\nCompared to the passive I propose, it doesn't give Karma windows of power (asking her to retaliate immediately), but just keeps giving more and more power to her.\n>As an enemy you have the opportunity to poke her down and never let her reach high amounts of AP from the passive, or predict her retaliation accordingly.

In a sololane there is noone else to attack...\n\nI can understand why you would jump to this conclusion (killing enemy champions is good!), but Karma is one of the lowest-priority champions on her own. As a support, she easily benefits the least from gold (low gold dependence/efficiency), so as long as you aren't also a support, you win the lane simply by farming as much as she does...which should be easy, because all she can do is pap you with her baby-weak autos.\n\nOn her own she has no poke, no waveclear, no utility, no real way to benefit from you not attacking her...at worst it's a boring lane for both parties, but Karma has literally no reason to go solo considering all of her actual usefulness lies in augmenting champions who can already do things on their own. \n\n >And can potentially be a lot worse against Rumble ultimates, or in teamfights in general. I didn't say you have no ways of damage mitigation, but shields and instant heals allow you to control your hp better.\n\nIf she were to control her HP so universally (ie. not really having to read the situation or make split-second decisions in order to stay alive), she wouldn't be allowed to be so scary at low HP. Since she already discourages burst damage pretty hard, giving her massive burst survavability would be both redundant and make it hard to play around a high-impact counterattack.\n\nI guess in more straightforward terms, she's rewarded with sustained healing and damage mitigation (which are more powerful overall than burst because you can die before you get the full effect) if she's able to discourage burst damage, which she is good at. If she constantly leaves herself open - which she needs to do to support her allies - she runs the risk of taking burst she can't slap away. Having some sort of burst survivability (the strongest of which is a shield because it is temporary) would mean that she'd be allowed to have her cake and eat it too, giving her opponents very few \"right\" options.\n\n>So you do think Karma's hand can be forced by creating a situation in which she must use her shield in a defensive way and not allowing her to utilize the offensive part of it?\n>\n>I mean, if you forced old Karma to use her shield and heal, she couldn't use the shieldbomb offensively?\n>If you forced modern Karma to RW, she can't use RQ and RE?\n\nThe thing is, as I said in the bit you're replying to, Karma gets full use out of *some* part of that ability regardless (even if she shields a full-health ally and the shield isn't scratched, she could have still dealt damage), rather than being allowed to make the mistake of contributing something that isn't vital to a fight (Heimer being forced to use a low-damage/high-CC ult in a scenario where damage is much more important than CC).\n\nOld Karma has a real hard time making mistakes, since chances are the situation is going to call for offense or defense and two of her ults give both of those things in fairly even portions. Current Karma loses that defense from shield ult when she opts for the fireball ult, which is much different than \"Oh, Karma gave a shield and damage but we didn't really need damage in that scenario.\"\n\n>I think Riot does. It used to be a clever secondary resource that opened up different rortations. Of course it's boring if it just gives you more of a boring base ability.

You are describing to me two ultimates which have a survivability and damage component to them while not really providing any interesting tradeoffs. I understand the want to eat your cake and still have it, but that's more from a player perspective than a designer perspective (as a player, I think it would be great if ulting early as Darius still gave me the reset, but it's allowed to be powerful by design because I have to choose between less damage that I know I can do right now and more damage that I might not be able to do at all - same case with Tahm's Q).\n\n>For some reason I find Sion to be more boring if all he offers thematically is \"undead brute\" and the bloodshield is gone. In terms of gameplay I would prefer your propositions though.\n\nIf you find Sion boring because he's an undead brute, that's because he's an undead brute. You can find Brand boring because he's just a fire guy, and that's fine, because that's what he is.\n\nIt's like opening a carton of chocolate chunk icecream and going, \"Man, this would be better if it were Cherry Garcia...\" If it says \"chocolate chunk\" on the carton, that should be exactly what you get, because some people actually *like* that flavor (I know, right?). And the thing is, that's okay! Something doesn't have to be crazy unique for it to be good, and sometimes a dude just wants to play League so they can hit people with their axe really, really hard. Darius seems to still provide a compelling experience even though he's not shooting fireballs out of his ass!\n\n>As far as I've seen, most successful games have a way of showing your personality.

Your personal expression should be \"I love protecting my friends, which is why I play Braum,\" or \"I'm a fun-loving show-off, watch me catch 12 axes at once as Draven\" - if players aren't feeling this way already, then the roster itself isn't as diverse as it should be (which Riot has already acknowledged as a problem, hence reworks). \n\nPersonally, I think expressing yourself by playing a champion whose personality and gameplay strongly resonate with who you are as a person, leads to a more compelling experience than expressing yourself by building AP on Trynd.\n\n>I've seen current Garen stay very long in fights too, because he becomes so tanky with his W.

Where do you get from that I want them to \"just be pretty\"??? It sometimes feels like you aren't even answering to the things I wrote...\n\nOh, sorry if I miscommunicated what I meant, there. It's not that I thought your tertiary resource meter was simply an ~aesthetic~ component, but rather, that the visual gave less actionable gameplay information than it needed to, considering it was affected by damage done to all nearby allies AND Karma (something closer to being appropriate would have to exist on all champions that would contribute to this meter, and the mechanic itself would still likely have to be more focused than \"Karma gets benefits when you hurt allies within X units of her\"). \n\n>You make Karma's solo lane boring on purpose, to force her into the support role? I don't think many Karma players will appreciate that. Or any, as far as I know.\n\nAny champion that brings value to their team by adding power onto other champions must consequently be weaker on their own - when they aren't you get champions like Lulu (and old Soraka) who get the best of both worlds and hurt the game because of it. \n\nThat, and it's not that her solo lane is simply \"boring,\" it's that it's largely inefficient. Whatever gold you do get would be better spent on a champion who doesn't have Support-tier gold independence (since supports can't both thrive in a no-CS duo lane situation *and* scale really well with purchased stats), and unlike a fighter/mage/assassin whose power is mostly focused on themselves, supports have no-one else to put their power onto and can \"not lose\" their lane at best. It's the ultimate low risk/low reward.\n\n>Compared to Soraka, Karma wouldn't need to poke to keep her ADC alive. She would let him auto-win any trade and stay all the way back. There is no reason to expose her. This is exactly the reason why Soraka was reworked.\n\nExcept, since she's at full health and not risking anything, she's getting 0 value out of her passive...which is fine, and she can make that low risk/reward decision, but that'll ultimately mean she won't be \"auto-winning\" anything since her damage and heals will be less effective (especially in the early game/laning phase).\n\n>Does she? Why? Just leave the crest on the most likely target?\n\nJust having it on, say, your Tristana (who you want to not die) means that you'll be missing on all the effectiveness you'd get from putting it on Malphite - which also puts you closer to their frontline. Just having it on Malphite (who is currently getting hit a lot) means that you're leaving Tristana wide-open. \n\nEspecially in team scenarios, there's never any \"right answer\" for the entire fight, and part of her gameplay mastery would involve knowing who to mark at the right time, who to use Mantra effects on and when, etc. Against her, it's entirely possible to make a feint, \"initiating\" on a target she reflexively moves the crest to before spending your burst on someone else. This is why I'm so adamant about her counter-aggression being focused on only one target at a time, rather than blanketed across her entire team.\n\n>And Heimer's CC does damage too? You also just CC'ed someone. You perfectly used all of it, while Karma could use half of one ability. And maybe her damage would've been more useful, but she had to heal? Isn't this the same thing as forcing Heimer to CC, but his damage would've been more useful?\n\nHeimer's CC does much, *much* less damage than his actual damage ability, because its CC is fairly strong and his actual damage ability has no CC whatsoever.\n\nAnd like I said, CC isn't equally useful in every scenario, and neither is damage. For instance, Heimer using his damage when it's not enough to finish off the Vi diving him rather than burning his CC to give his tank enough time to peel, or using CC on someone about to grab a Thresh lantern and only delaying them whereas going with damage would've killed them outright.\n\nWith Karma, however, \"And maybe her damage would've been more useful, but she had to heal\" is a moot point if I remember old Karma's kit correctly, because that cone AoE both damaged *and* healed. It would be a more engaging decision if she had to choose between damage and healing, rather than throwing out her heal and going \"ah, well, here's also some damage.\" \n\n>It was more about making many decisions in short time, which can have different effectivenes-levels. Which enemies could partake in, by creating situations in which the Karma's actions were more or less effective.\n\nEven then, it sacrificed amazing high-moments in order to get rid of its low moments as well. Its highest point for the player just ends up being less satisfying, while their opponent's maximum satisfaction is diminished to \"Well, I kind of forced her to use a slightly less effect-efficient version of one of her mantras...\" \n\nCompare that to dodging an Ashe arrow or forcing Tahm to pop his E and waddle out of the fight. Ashe gets to feel really good about that 3 second stun while Tahm can stick around forever if he manages his engagements carefully, while their opponents get to feel cool about temporarily taking a tool away from their opponent through skilled play. \n\n>Then find situations, in which you need both. This creates (created) a clear differences between good and great Karmas.\n\nAnd again, this is also the scenario that made her opponents not feel great. At worst, Karma kills one bird with one stone, but in these scenarios you describe, her opponents just have to kind of deal with all the tools Karma has without having to really give up anything. You can only ever force her to be less efficient, which limits their agency (in a competitive game!) while making some Karma players feel kind of clever.\n\n>Some people just enjoy champions that can alternate between helping and hurting.

Being able to choose between helping and hurting (and being able to choose wrong) is what allows that \"help\" and \"hurt\" to be meaningfully powerful, rather than nigh omnipresent or sometimes vaguely unoptimized.\n\n>Don't insult me.\n\nI'm not insulting you, although I probably didn't phrase myself the best way there.\n\nRather, I understand you found something about a character that had a very strong impact on you (in this case, it seems to be \"feeling wise\" about getting the most out of a multi-faceted ability, finding situations where its uses overlap), but this thing as it was implemented was not healthy for the game. As players, we're more focused on what makes us feel good, but as a designer, I need to make sure that my opponent has opportunities to feel good as well.\n\n>There is a difference between archetypes and stereotypes.\nThe trick is to have recognizeable patterns, so people can relate, but also something unusual or new, which stereotypes lack.\n\nAgain, not everything needs to have a secret compartment or pleasant surprise. Xerath doesn't need to show us that he has a secret heart of gold by healing his teammates, when the core of his character is about power. Ashe doesn't need to smack people with her bow because she needs to show us she's tougher than she looks.\n\nIt's fine for a character to be \"just a brute\" or \"just a mage,\" because these are things that people like. It's good to have characters that are unique through a novel blend of themes (\"Space Dragon,\" \"Catfish Chauffeur,\" \"Ninja Tank\"), but it's also ultimately important that they are faithful to those themes rather than being surprising for the sake of being surprising. \n\nHaving a random unexpected thing on every champion may cause them to be more interesting to some, but it will end up turning League into a homework assignment where players must memorize what out-of-the-blue things 130 different characters do. They'd also ultimately feel less \"unique\" because they aren't juxtaposed with champions that play their archetype straight.\n\n>Because, for some reason, people are less and less defined over the champion they main, than the role they play.

Ideally, exploration should be more about seeing how 5 unique characters interact, rather than how much more you can heal yourself as AP Yi. Bringing up DotA2 as an example, people are more likely to remember that cool moment where someone figured out you could hook someone back to your fountain with a Chen/Pudge combo, rather than that one time Puck took Item X over Item Y.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2016-03-24T04:10:47.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> the visual gave less actionable gameplay information than it needed to, considering it was affected by damage done to all nearby allies AND Karma\n\nShould be rather intuitive, actually. You hurt her ally, she gains the glowing bar. I mean, I don't think it's perfect, but keep in mind, that I am working with what I've got; the game so far, the community and Riot's philosophy.

I think there is also a design argument for having those kinds of champions.\n\n> That, and it's not that her solo lane is simply \"boring,\"\n\nI am trying to stay short and precise. You want her out of sololanes, which people won't like. That's my point. \n\n> Except, since she's at full health and not risking anything, she's getting 0 value out of her passive\n\nIf she isn't supposed to scale well with AP, she probably really doesn't need the AP that much. Getting hit herself isn't a requirement, having her target hit, is. Getting through to her and hitting her would give her even more power though, compared to Soraka, who would lose her healthpool to heal with.\n\n> Just having it on, say, your Tristana (who you want to not die) means that you'll be missing on all the effectiveness you'd get from putting it on Malphite\n\nConsidering the short CD you proposed, I don't see much problem with her switching.

It feels like you are getting sidetracked sometimes.\n\n> With Karma, however, \"And maybe her damage would've been more useful, but she had to heal\" is a moot point if I remember old Karma's kit correctly\n\nI was talking about modern Karma (RW) here. \nBut either way, if Old Karma uses her mantra for healing (RQ), she can't use it for the extra damage (RE). It's pretty much the same, but more unique in application.\n\nAnd \"also here is some damage\" on her RQ only worked if you had the propper positioning and timing... So it takes more skill and planning than the current format.\n\n> Even then, it sacrificed amazing high-moments in order to get rid of its low moments as well. \n\nI know where you are getting at, but you are painting it a bit black and white. I mean, what's the point in hitting someone, if he can heal it up anyways, only spending some mana? So you should kill him outright and he should have an instant dodge.\n\nSometimes it's more interesting to have multiple decisions and actions add up. Sometimes reliability is a desireable trait. Sometimes people like working with nuances. Flashy kits and hits are interesting, but sometimes dividing it into more steps adds some drama to it. I mean, we have multiple layers of towers for a reason, I guess? Instead of just one inhibitor tower right behind the lane.\n\n> You can only ever force her to be less efficient, which limits their agency\n\nI disagree. Or, let's say, I would love to compare it to an Annie, who flashes onto you and instagibs you. I don't think that Karma has been even close to the worst offenders here.\nOr let's look at Zed. If he ults you, you are guaranteed to take some damage. But dodging (most of) his Qs can limit the damage he does, It's a few seconds of multiple actions that add up, but ultimately, they will take more or less damage.... in a situation that both participants are involved in.\n\nNot saying that I liked the lack of counterplay Old Karma had...\n\n> I wouldn't really describe old Karma as a champion that alternated between helping and hurting\n\nYou could either heal with RQ or damage with RE. You couldn't have both. This is the closest to  _\"not necessarily having a heal in her kit\"_ we have gotten in LoL so far. Next closest would be Liss.\n\n> Rather, I understand you found something about a character that had a very strong impact on you \n\nI am mostly concerned with game design. I used to work a lot on the game design of a SC2 mod, in a small community. But I never thought I'd be good/experienced/knowing enough to contribute to a community as big as LoL's. But when my favourite champion was changed contrary to my understanding of game design and contrary to my understanding of RIOT's game design and contrary to the desires of all the Karma fans I knew... I just had to start arguing.\nAnd I have yet to hear a justification for what they did in 5.10, that would beat any of my game design arguments.\n\nSeeing someone imply I would do this for my own needs, when I spent the last few months arguing as objectively as possible, feels like a hit in the guts.\n\n> Again, not everything needs to have a secret compartment or pleasant surprise. Xerath doesn't need to show us that he has a secret heart of gold by healing his teammates\n\nNot saying they need something contrary. But unusual. A personal spin. Like having Brand's combos or Twitch piercing enemies. Rats stink and are sneaky, we get it, but piercing crossbow shots? Nice.\n\nI also like that Aurelion Sol isn't just a dragon, but a cosmic one. How Braum has a door instead of a shield and Jinx has no boobs. It's the small things in life, you know(heh)?\n\n> rather than being surprising for the sake of being surprising.\n\nOf course not. But this would probably come naturally with good character design. Sion doesn't have a bloodshield for the sake of not being a brute, but because he used to have a similar shield. That's not a perfect reason, but at least a reasonable one. \n\nOn a side note, I dislike Shen's new sword. It seems like a missfit. Probably the european sword on a ninja. Ninja tank was already stretching it...\n\n> Ideally, exploration should be more about seeing how 5 unique characters interact\n\nProbably, but this might fall prey to what LoL should be, what it is and what it used to be. It's a weird hybrid of those things. It used to offer things it shouldn't have, what surprisingly many people got attached to. Maybe an argument for LoL2? \n\n> It is very clear that you care about Karma a lot, and I appreciate that you've taken the time and effort to plead her case to a complete stranger\n\nI don't choose those strangers randomly. I usually only try with people I expect good arguments from. Either I learn to defeat them, or I can adapt them. Either way, I am moving forward. \n\nI am looking forward to your replies.

And if that seems boring to you, that's fine! Just means that you wouldn't really like playing as an undead warrior with an undead warrior playstyle, because, although giving him a magical shield would make him more interesting for some, it will probably only feel less satisfying for the people that actually want to really play _like_ an undead warrior. \nFor the record, I'm a big fan of LOTR and Treebeard, plus I've always been drawn to ''magic + nature'' in terms of videogames (just as necromancy is something I've always found cool, which is why at the time when ItemsGuy didn't know what to do with Yorick yet, I came up with 90%/the general gist of his abilities in his Redesign, ItemsGuy just added the numbers and some mechanical things that were necessary in terms of counterplay), and I remember how I was very dissappointed to find out how Maokai turned out to play like. Sure, I could see I was playing _as_ (visual)  an angry, magical tree, but not really _like_ (gameplay) one.\n\n**ItemsGuy: This is why I'm so adamant about her counter-aggression being focused on only one target at a time, rather than blanketed across her entire team.**\n\nDefined strengths and weaknesses! :)\n**\nSilverSquid: And Heimer's CC does damage too? You also just CC'ed someone. You perfectly used all of it, while Karma could use half of one ability. And maybe her damage would've been more useful, but she had to heal? Isn't this the same thing as forcing Heimer to CC, but his damage would've been more useful?**\n\nJust wanted to say this as well, but the damage might as well not be on there for Heimerdinger. Seriously, it's really just ''the CC option'' of his ult, not ''the CC option with some damage''. Sure it is _some_ damage, but the damage is little enough to objectively conclude that it's there for the CC only, really. Don't even think it'd hurt him that much if they removed the damage entirely.\n\n**ItemsGuy: Even then, it sacrificed amazing high-moments in order to get rid of its low moments as well. Its highest point for the player just ends up being less satisfying, while their opponent's maximum satisfaction is diminished to \"Well, I kind of forced her to use a slightly less effect-efficient version of one of her mantras...\"\nCompare that to dodging an Ashe arrow or forcing Tahm to pop his E and waddle out of the fight. Ashe gets to feel really good about that 3 second stun while Tahm can stick around forever if he manages his engagements carefully, while their opponents get to feel cool about temporarily taking a tool away from their opponent through skilled play.**\n\nDefined strengths and weaknesses with examples of actual gameplay!\nSilverSquid, not sure if you're familiar with HOTS, but allow me to use some examples:\n\nTake Sgt Hammer: She will wreck your balls if she's stationary. If she settles down and you let her stand still, you're fucked. If you force her to move she's not gonna be entirely useless, but you cut down her power A LOT. Her goal: stand still, shoot from distance.\n\nTake Abathur from HOTS: He will push like a mad man the further he is on the map/the closer he is to the enemy base. If you search and hunt for him and force him back to base, you cut his power a lot. He's not entirely useless when standing in base, but he does push less effectively. Goal: Move as far into the map to push harder.\n\nTake Rexxar from Heroes of the Storm: As long as Mischa is up he's pretty powerful, kill the bear and you cut his power A LOT. He's not entirely useless without Mischa, as he's still able to cast his Q and auto attack, but still, killing his pet companion is the most effective way of dealing with him. Goal: Screwing you over with bear/Mischa and keeping her alive.\n\nThese are very unified playstyles: Sgt Hammer wants to wreck your balls while standing still, from distance. Abathur wants to push as hard and as far into the map as he can, Rexxar wants to screw you over with his bear. The counterplay to these designs are very clear, the moment you prevent them from reaching their ideal situation is where you cut their power, although, you do not make them entirely useless.\nSgt. Hammer can still do stuff even if she's not stationary, Abathur can safely sit in base and Rexxar can still auto attack and Q when Mischa's down. You cut their power A LOT by making sure they don't reach their goal/perfect scenario.\n\n[Redesign Yorick](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2013/01/champion-redesign-yorick-gravedigger.html) wants to overrun you with a herd of zombies, you cut his power by dealing with his zombies, although, he's never entirely useless: even without tombes he can spawn at least one zombie next to him with every cast of Gravecall.\n\n[Redesign Fiora](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-fiora-grand-duelist.html) wants to force duels, which is to say; 1 vs 1 fights. Force her into teamfights and you cut her power, however, she'll still be able to do something; disarming an enemy (preferably someone whose sets out to kill your carries), reducing the damage they deal for a few seconds sounds good, aye?\n\nThis all has to do with creating a character with one concrete goal in mind, this allows champions to really shine at something, because they are less good at something else. And those are trade-offs and how they should be! Which is probably what ItemsGuy is trying to say here about Karma and her previously being able to deal with multiple people at the same time. It's just a bit too much!\n\n**SilverSquid: Considering the short CD you proposed, I don't see much problem with her switching. She really doesn't have to commit a lot.**\n\nBrings me to my next point: Irelia, Yasuo, Lee Sin, these are all designs that are inherently broken. Tweak the numbers all you want, so long as they don't have a concrete goal tied to their kit/very defined strengths and weaknesses, it'll be very hard to balance them. And even if the numbers seem appropriate at a particular moment, the design is still going to feel lame to play against. I mean, whether Leblanc is balanced or not, it never feels very fair ''just getting blown up'' by her, because there is nothing you can really do but just to stay as far away from her as possible and hug teammates.\n\nThe numbers in ItemsGuy's Redesigns are subjective to change. The most important thing to note is that his designs can be very balanced with the right numbers, and if a champion would either turn out to be UP or OP, all you'd have to do is play with those numbers! \n\nPS: Also 5 seconds is actually a pretty long cooldown, enough time to wreck someone. (ie AP Malphite ult on your two carries... ouch!)\n\n**SilverSquid: I try to copy existing design elements, try to listen to what the community likes and try to estimate what Riot is likely/willing to implement.**\n\nFriend of mine read a lot of ItemsGuy's redesigns, loved a lot of them. However, something he'd say time and time again: this isn't DOTA, this ability doesn't fit in League. Three years ago we were struggling with this; how were we going to convince Riot to really start with the theme of a champion, which would result in more defined weaknesses, but also accentuated strengths (so you actually have these: ''WTF THAT'S POWERFUL''-ultimates)?\n\nWell, let's say I couldn't have dreamt back then that one day Quinn would be turned into the roaming marksman, with her mobility-ultimate on a **_three second cooldown._** They're getting there! (or some dragon being able to fly very large distances, or some frog being able to swallow up enemies or allies, all kits and abilities they were absolutely terrified to even think about three years ago! hehe)\n\n_**SilverSquid: Probably only the transition is boring. From having few champions that have a lot of ways to be played, to having a lot of champions in basically one way to be played. I am just trying to highlight concerns of mine. And also trying to highlight why League isn't as interesting as it used to. The sense of adventure is gone. Adventures in seeing new builds, new metas, new ways of thinking. Now they get starved by the rare release every few months, instead of whenever they played...**_\n\nUsed to play Nunu + Swain botline a lot with that same friend. It was glorious. However, the only reason we were able to get this specific type of joy out of the game is because we didn't have pro players to figure the best strategy out for us, yet. And as long as the root of the cause is the game lacking in strategic diversity, it'll remains this way, even though if you like still like playing tryndamere AP or AP Tristana (dunno if these are still possible but w/e you get the picture).\n\nPlaying AP Trynd is funny because it's something different. However, it's only really as funny and cool if it's as viable as AD Tryndamere, because ultimately, the game is about trying to destroy the opponent's nexus instead of seeing yours being blown to bits. Like ItemsGuy, I really think that people enjoying the balls out of those weird item builds on champions is more of a result of the champions being boring/not delivering you the proper experience they should deliver, rather than personal expression for the sake of personal expression. \n\n_**SilverSquid: I am looking forward to your replies.

The moment Riot says [''you have to kind of look at a character and almost be able to know just from the splash image what it's abilities are, what's it's gonna do in a game, how it's going to function'' ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs1yD8m2fvE&t=2m30s), followed up by an image of a blind monk that ends up doing _nothing_ a blind monk would do in the actual game, is where things go horribly wrong. Blind monks are blind, a playstyle that could be dedicated to such a character could be a playstyle that would have to do with revealing enemies ''through his senses'' rather than just being able to teleport everywhere as if he's somehow like Neo from the Matrix Revolutions (third movie).\n\nSo yeah, I'd really like to lay an emphasis here on the fact that Ryan does not rehaul their philosophy, but he actually holds true to their own values. Three years ago this gap was much wider compared to now, because Riot has stepped up their game, but the moment you rework a grand duelist and still end up giving her an ability that is most effective in a teamfight scenario would yet again be a case of Riot not doing what they say they are trying to do. It's that simple, really! \n\nKay. Gonna quote one of you guys from now on and respond/just add a little sumthin':\n\n**SilverSquid: You make Karma's solo lane boring on purpose, to force her into the support role? I don't think many Karma players will appreciate that. Or any, as far as I know.**\n\n\nPerhaps I can be a little more clear than ItemsGuy, he went for the detailled explanation.\n\nHere's the thing; this is the nature of a support design. They have to be designed is such a way that they can still be very useful without gold in-come. However, they shouldn't really be able to get a whole lot stronger when they get gold because otherwise they become a very safe and OP compared to champions that do actually need gold.\n\nSame reason why Riot was more than happy to kill Soraka midlane. A character that heals a whole lot shouldn't really thrive on gold or being able to function in a lane on her own.\n\nNot really getting anything out of going midlane with Redesign Karma is similar to running current Soraka midlane; the two midlaners will both end up not really doing much to each other.\n\nSo yeah, this is just kind of a matter of how supports have to be designed in a very specific way. Want a support that heals? Sure, but do it in a way that makes it engaging instead of very passive, Soraka does this well right now. Want a support that deals damage? Sure, give the character high base damage, but don't give 'em scaling on their abilities through itemization, etc!\n\n@ItemsGuy: This begs the question. How is it that some of your Redesigns could actually function as both support and midlane? I mean, Redesign Soraka and Karma are always going to be that support, just like Alistar, Edmund and what not. But what about Zyra? Isn't she not going to be too strong when in lane, or isn't she going to feel underwhelming compared to other supports if she's actually played as support instead?\n\nPlease elaborate.\n\n**SilverSquid: For some reason I find Sion to be more boring if all he offers thematically is \"undead brute\" and the bloodshield is gone. In terms of gameplay I would prefer your propositions though.**\n\nGonna do the post I accidentally deleted yesterday (gonna try and make it much shorter, too!):\n\nSion's an undead warrior. Sion should do undead + warrior things, which are two theme's that can fit perfectly in the space that is available for a moba design character (generally a passive and 4 abilities). Delivering on this to the best of your ability is what is going to make the design feel as powerful as it can be in terms of gaming experience, and exploding a magical shield is not really helping with that.\n\nAnd to tell you the truth (something that hasn't really been said by either one of us in this thread so far); there's a reason why Redesign Sion wouldn't feel like current Sion at all. Both Riot and ItemsGuy consider current Sion to be a better design because his kit ties much better together and seems to have more of a defined purpose, instead of his old, scattered design (Do I want to get a little beefy and durable to chop people's head off with my ult (AD) or do I want to stun people and blow them up? (AP)).\nHowever, his theming is still a little off, and you can easily discover this by taking a good look at his passive in relation to the rest of his kit. Does his passive tie to his other abilities similar to how Darius's passive ties to all of his abilities all the way to that scary executioning ultimate? \nUnfortunately, it doesn't. Currently Sion's abilities are all about being able to do stuff right in the enemies face, with his ult enabling him to actually get there. His passive is more random as of now, actually, in terms of gameplay, he just gets to do stuff a little longer even when you've killed him ''because he's undead, you know.'' Thematically it fits really well, but it doesn't really tie to the rest of his kit. But as you might have guessed I'm about to say that it's not the passive here that is the problem, but rather the fact that all his abilities say ''Juggernaut'' only because Riot decided ''we wanted him to be (a juggernaut).'' Sion gets to be a juggernaut because Riot decided they wanted him to be one and do that, similar to how Lissandra got this weird E/teleporting ability because they shoehorned ''we want her to be the initiating mage'' onto her.\n\nThis goes to show how often they have treated theming more of a cherry on top of the cake rather than the thing that holds the entire kit together. Lissandra's kit is cool and all and definitely works, but it probably shouldn't be on a champion that's supposed to be the (first) ''Ice mage'' of League of Legends.\nJust as Sion's kit is kind of cool; charging in _really fast_ and then being able to screw over people is fun and all, but is this really something an undead warrior should do? The most characteristic things of the undead are that they are slow and they don't die that easily (zombies don't give a fuck if you snap a finger off of them, they'll keep chasing you, they don't really need limbs to keep going)\nCurrently the only thing that really captures one of these two is his passive, all his other abilities have to do with ''Juggernaut'' which is more of a role within League of Legends rather than a characteristic or thematic aspect. A champion's function shouldn't build up the champion's identity, the identity should imply a fitting function. This is why current Maokai is more of a tree that performs well at the ''tank role'' with his generic *this-is-what-a-tank-needs-in-order-to-funtion-abilities* rather than giving you that ''angry forest'' playstyle that would make sure he'd be able to excell at the tank role in his own way due to the fact he's a strong, sturdy tree.\n\nIn case of Old Sion: Undead warriors should do undead warrior things. Stunning people and blowing people up magically is more of a wizard-like thing.\nIn case of new Sion: Undead warrior should do undead warrior things, not just charge into people and being able to devastate them. (besides, we always have had Malphite for that! See how his identity/character implies such a playstyle instead of the other way around? Malphite is supposed to be that rolling rock coming at you, building up speed. So that's what he does! And even moreso in [Malphite Redesign](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-malphite-shard-of.html) )\n\nBefore Sion was reworked there was a time I actually played him a lot, and I ended up trying to make AD Sion work because it just felt the most fitting to play him that way. Not paying attention to anyone but the enemy carry, trying to charge through the enemy team and getting there eventually to do some chopping felt great, if only Sion had been given the tools to actually be able to do that properly, because as it happened, most of the times when you tried this you ended up being blown to bits yourself. \nSure, his stun allowed you to lock someone in place (and the stun couldn't be longer due to the fact that it was ranged) but you were only able to get off about one auto attack on average the moment you actually closed the distance between the range of being able to cast your stun and the point where you were close enough to do auto attacks. Just as his shield was supposed to be a tool were he could charge through the enemy team and take hits more effectively to keep on going, mindlessly walking towards that enemy carry not giving a sh*t about anything (like a true undead, even though limbs are being blown off!), but the ability didn't mean a whole lot for him seeing as you needed AP to actually get the durability you wanted. \n\nHis old, two-button, AD gameplay was the most ''undead warrior'' he has ever been. Give his old design his new passive and you even have more of an undead warrior: sure, he'd still suck, but atleast you his passive would also reach the same goal: keep on trying to reach that target and getting rewarded for it when you do.\nTake his current passive and his old AD playstyle, but give him 4 abilities that try to reach this goal, and you have a true undead warrior.[ Redesign Sion](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2013/01/champion-redesign-sion-undead-champion.html) does this well, even if it is a very simple design, it gives me feelings of nostalgia and has me going: if only I could actually get to that target more effectively back then, before Sion got reworked!","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2016-03-24T18:45:37.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">@ItemsGuy: This begs the question.

Isn't she not going to be too strong when in lane, or isn't she going to feel underwhelming compared to other supports if she's actually played as support instead?\n\nI've designed champions like Zyra, Heimer, etc. with some sort of flexibility in mind, but this still comes from meaningful decisions rather than just giving them everything they need to thrive in both roles simultaneously (like high base damages AND ratios). \n\nFor instance, a support Zyra would be maxing her E and W over her Q, and while her plants would still be equally strong as they scale off of level, she would prioritize making the ones that slow (utility) over the ranged ones (damage) because the slow does not scale with anything. She would also be focusing on CDR at the cost of mana, so she can throw out more CC from her E (which doesn't scale with AP), meaning she would not be doing as much damage compared to if she dedicated herself to being a midlane mage that game. Similarly, Heimer as a support would be focusing on his healing inventions over his turrets, and would be building some durability (which makes his machines tougher), but less emphasis on AP and turrets means his strengths would be different, and he might be using his turrets for vision and utility (Rylai's) rather than a territorial damage threat. \n\n>Sion gets to be a juggernaut because Riot decided they wanted him to be one\n\nThis is actually something that bugs me more about his update than the passive (as it could be argued that it at least rewards him for getting killed first, as his abilities draw a lot of aggro), since not only does Sion not look like he should be running across the map (with his massive axe and peg leg), but it undermines why undead things are scary.

I'm seriously missing strategic diversity in League.\nIn other games players can invent new strategies and completely obliterate everyone.\nIn League however everything that isn't splitpushing, objective control or good old ARAM style teamfighting, is considered cheesing and will probably be nerfed within 3 patches.\nHowever I don't know how to change this. Maybe it's time for some seriously crazy items or champion kits, and I don't mean crazy as in you need 5 hours to fu**c**king understand what the hell this ability does, but maybe as you suggested, let Yorick be the minion master he always wanted to be.\nSeriously, how is AD Malzahar considered to be the Pokemon-master instead of Yorick?

Hope you enjoy reading his replies and be able to make some sense of them. His answers are much better than I could have ever given you.\n\n> I am sometimes not sure what needs to make sense in a game of magic. Most caster's abilities in Runeterra don't really get explained, so I guess magic is just something people use to a bigger or lesser extent. Probably even unvoluntarily. I don't know if I would rather remember a Sion with or without a bloodshield. I guess it depends on what exactly you would replace it with.\n\nMagic in a competitive MOBA game shouldn't be an excuse to let characters do very random stuff, but rather, let them do stuff that make sense on their character but would be impossible in the real world!\n\n> I agree on Quinn's backflip though.\n\nCool! Falconers actually have a pretty hard time getting their falcon to listen to them. What ''magic'' or runeterra as a fantasy/videogame world does for Quinn, is to allow her to be able to have extremely/unrealistically strong communication with her bird Valor. So in League it's totally fine a falconer can be picked up by her shoulders by her birdy and fly around! It fits and therefore it makes sense, eventhough it's a little unrealistic.\n\nFor this reason Maokai should not be able to do ''random magic stuff'' but rather ''magical stuff that a magical tree would probably do'', which isn't teleporting!\n\n> I personally enjoy charging into a fight, doing my things and stuffs... and repeat it 2 minutes later. Just spinning is nice, but thinking about when to engage is also interesting to me. And it becomes more often available lategame, no matter how I build. I guess Garen is a restless fighter, that fights a lot of battles in a war, instead of a single, bloody and glorious one, like Darius.\n\nItemsGuy has explained this way better than I ever could. But I'd like to add; just from a mechanical perspective, all the things a champion does should tie together. All the things Darius does ties together from his passive all the way to his ult. Can't say that for Garen and his passive, Lissandra and her passive, or let's say Kindred, whom has a passive with a very clear purpose, but ends up getting an ult that conflicts with this entirely!\n\n> Maybe that's me, but I really like working on my build, adapting to the game and coming up with something that makes sense. Which I enjoy more than just the chaotic first few minutes if people keep getting caught. But hey, people enjoy different things after all.\n\nWhat ItemsGuy said!\n\nYou probably would like to read the quote by following this link (it's a very short one!): http://imgur.com/KPPZdUg\n\nThe current lack of strategic diverty makes sure about every game feels very much the same as the game you will play after or the game you had played before. Also while seeing the same champions over and over again, all with the ''best''/same old masteries, items, etcetera.\n\nWhat I meant to say is that if every champion is as unique as he or she could possibly be, the combinations of teamcompositions are endless, and no team composition could ever be ''the best team composition'' ever. This is where you truly have to adapt to every single game instead of having to deal with the status quo. \n\nSo yeah, get flamed right now if you run something like Alistar Blitzcrank botlane, whereas in ''League of Legends 2'', or a game such as ''DOTA2'', these things are so much more acceptable, because about anything can work/be viable!\n\n> I am still sceptical about whether we can remove ALL hurdles from your everyday life's person to watch this without prior knowledge. I have to think about MY mum, and I just can't imagine it. I mean, there is violence in there and how can violence be good, this is stupid, yadayada....\n> \n> And even if you are open to all of this, I think you still have to learn what particles go to which champion, what they mean and following 10 characters you don't know is pretty confusing too.\n\nThat's why I say in the video: ''Due to the nature of videogames League of Legends might not ever get to be as easy to read as a game of soccer, but this shouldn't be an excuse to not make the game as readable as it could possibly be!''\n\nSo despite that fact, it's also a fact that the more you lower the accessibility of a game, by improving on the readability, you improve on the game and allow it to grow! (more people that don't get turned down by the learning curve of the game, more people being able to make more sense of the game whether they know about the game or not, etc,) All this makes sure Riot ends up profiting more.\n\n> It's not that I am against the idea of having the game more... well... intuitive to watch, but I am not yet convinced it's something achieveable, or worth sacrificing other things over.\n\nWhat ItemsGuy said! It'd rather be an extra that people who aren't familiar with the game would be able to make more sense of the game. In the first place it's for the players and no sacrifices have to be made! (except if you'd say that removing things that people have grown familiar with would be sacrifices, which Riot has started doing now anyway, so yeah... that's kind of a bummer for some people, eventhough it's for the better of the game)\n\n> Oh boy, that's really one stupid passive right there. I mean, it's interesting from a gameplay perspective, but thematically? Does Lissandra want to think about how to spend her powers carefully? I don't think so...\n\nExactly! Lissandra wants to cover the world in ice just as Brand wants to burn the entire planet! Give her a passive that actually matches with the rest of her kit! Instead of ''here, have something that is a little useful, but doesn't really make you give a shit about it at all.''\n\nBtw, yes!

His catch potential is the greatest and most reliable of the 3. Jinx on the other hand fires away with impunity. Her snare and slow are intended to help her zone off enemies while she does. I can't believe you'd call SuperMegaDeathRocket generic, even if it doesn't fit into her kit all that well. There's the fun factor to be looked at. Cait methodically pushes you into your tower and preemptively puts traps down to make sure you don't stop her. Naturally, this is a means to an end.

Player skill in League would be the most important factor. So, yes, sure, some champions against other champions might have an advantage over the other (which exists in current league as well), but the game would still be very much playable.\n\n> Purely in terms of champion matchups though, the RPS analogy falls off ... thanks to us.

Quinn doing a backflip takes up 20% of her space, which makes her less of a falconer, which in result would mean, if playing as a falconer would be the most thing for me in the entire world, her doing a backflip would rather be more dissapointing to me than satisfying.\n\nTo quote myself from someone I've replied to earlier:\n\n> Could be a matter of opinion here, besides the fact that characters with resonant, unifying playstyles are healthier for the game in terms of readability, accessibility, and counterplay.\n> \n> But besides that, my opinion about a champion such as Zyra, would be the following:\n> Maybe, similar to how you probably wouldn't like Quinn as much if she'd be solely about doing Falconer-stuff, I was very dissappointed to see Zyra, the nature mage of League of Legends, being somewhat more of a bursty, teamfighting mage, that feels very generic and similar to other champions such as Brand (their play-pattern simply is ''hit your CC ability so you can hit your other abilities and combo people down in quick succession), where her plants more seemed like an addition to her kit, rather than her focus.\n> \n> As of right now, the Plant mage of League of Legends doesn't actually deliver on truly giving you that playstyle that's all about plants. Isn't that sad?\n> Champions should all have very resonant, unifying playstyles, so every champion truly delivers on what it was intended to deliver and every champion lives up to the expectations of what their theme hints the champion would be able to do. Like this, Zyra would become a plant mage that's all about her taking care of her plants and growing them until they are strong enough to wreck balls.\n> \n> As for Quinn, she'd solely deliver on giving you that falconer playstyle, which would have a big emphasis on mobility (which Riot has attempted to do with her as well), and if that suddenly wouldn't float your boat, perhaps an acrobat champion that'd have this niche of being agile would be more for the likes of you.\n> \n> As an aside, and perhaps a bit unrelated to the point of your post, I disagree with what seems to be the prevailing notion here concerning Quinn.\n\n> Why on Earth is Wukong more deceptive than LB? It's very obvious when he cast his clone and even if it wasn't, all he has over her is prolonged invisibility.\n\nEven if you think Wukong isn't more deceptive, it still stands as a thematic inconsistency that he's able to clone himself and go invisible. Monkeys don't do that, and saying how he was based on the ancients stories of Sun Wukong would be a simple matter of Burden of Knowledge. This doesn't mean Wukong shouldn't be able to be tricky and mess with you! Because that's exactly what monkeys do, and thus, [what Redesign Wukong does as well. ](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.nl/2012/12/champion-redesign-wukong-monkey-king.html)\n\n>  Meanwhile LB has you constantly on your toes with where she distortions.
