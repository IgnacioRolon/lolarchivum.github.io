With energy runes Zed feels no lack of energy. The difference is so significant I cannot play without them. The energy runes provide the same amount of energy at 18 that playing Zed on Dominion would give; this build is extremely effective upon dominion as well. Furthermore, once Zed reaches 40% CD reduction he can throw Razor Shuriken twice per Living Shadow.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-11-06T13:34:13.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay, thank you for your time I am going to try out your build it looks really fun thank you for sharing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-11-05T17:27:33.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this would be fun, but its not a viable build or strategy for ranked play","replies":[{"poster":"SparrowPriest","date":"2014-11-05T18:10:48.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is all ranked play footage and I score upwards of 10-20 kills nearly every game with very few deaths.

The bork build originated from the need for Zed to be able to apply damage after using Death Mark given that most champions could often just walk away from Zed due to either having faster movement speed or a juking ability. Moreover, some felt it was required to ensure a kill after Death Mark and have established builds based around rotating activates. Both of these points are satisfied completely by giving Zed movement speed, Zed not only can chase down any champion he has no problem securing kills on full hp champions with the use of Death Mark when he lands his Razor Shuriken. Furthermore, I prefer the Ravenous Hydra for the ad scaling, early game sustain which the bork build seems to lack entirely, the split pushing ability, and also it is essentially giving Zed another burst ability on a 10 second CD. When you have 400-500 AD Ravenous Hydra does a lot of damage and allows zed to life steal upwards of 200hp per hit when hitting multiple enemies combined with The Blood Thirster.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-11-05T20:49:42.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well I think your right on some things, I main Zed and here is my build {{item:3153}}  {{item:3142}}  {{item:3035}}  {{item:3031}}  {{item:3026}}  this allows me to 1v1 any one in the game most of the time and it is great for split pushing. and I like that your trying different builds and stuff that's cool, and I think im gonna try your build out. thank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"SparrowPriest","date":"2014-11-05T21:06:52.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to run a crit build myself but I found that Death Mark became useless late game given that they always died from the crits before it did damage. It was a good step through the shadows and and one shot them build but was not reliable or safe. Also, it does not synergize well with Zeds naturally bursty abilities but relies on melee auto attacks for meaningful damage. It seems to defy his kits design.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-11-06T04:24:49.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but if people get things like {{champion:10}}  {{champion:26}}  {{item:3157}}  {{item:3139}}  your screwed","replies":[{"poster":"SparrowPriest","date":"2014-11-06T04:35:07.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no problem dealing with those all you do is miss the kill. Kayle is actually really easy to kill you make her ult and after 1 to 2 seconds you ult and theres nothing she can do. Otherwise you just position yourself out of danger and kill them with melee or razor shurikens. Zed can easily kill people without the ultimate by the time they have those items. However, if you mean you make a bad decision that exposes you in order to assassinate someone with Death Mark and die for it you may die for nothing. Experience will teach you when to do what.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
