Zed's problem wasn't something that is fixed by a little item.  He had the 4th lowest winrate in the game, don't even try to call that a decent spot.  Their little bugfix made him feel like a clunky mess, and that is why he received buffs.

The rest were in a decent spot otherwise.\n\nOn the contrary, however, you're completely blinding yourself what I was really talking about: Riot hastily buffing champions, especially those not in dire need of buffs. You're tunneling on the fact you main Zed, and are being a little too passionate in defending him.

His problem was feeling clunky.  You don't add more damage (an item) to fix feeling very clunky to play.  Zed was in a worse spot than Kha Zix, he had litterally the 4th lowest winrate in the game.  Most pro players even said riot killed Zed at the time.  He deserved buffs and really needed them.  Especially the buffs that made his shadow faster and longer as they helped ease the clunky feeling.\n\nI understand what you are talking about completely.  While I don't agree with anything, I just found what you were saying about Zed to be so hilariously wrong that it needed adressing.  I hope you can actually read this time.  Its funny though the second someome like gragas falls to a winrate around Zed was he too gets buffs, it's like Ike they buff champs that need buffs or something, isn't that just wierd.
