After each game I normally just leave unless I see something worth mentioning. Example: we had galio, karma, swain, annie, and corki. Our corki went full ap. After the game I was like dude, you need to keep a balance between ad and ap, you should of gone ad. Then I get a message instantly saying \"we know everyone has bad days etc.\". from league. So I'm like ok guess he reported me or why else would I get that message. I play like ten more games after that and I get tons of honor from enemies and friendlies. What do I get? nothing. I have over 1100 teamwork honor, 400 friendly, 200 helpful and over 450 honorable opponents. I've never received any ribbons, no random messages ever popped up saying we like your attitude, the second I get a negative report from corki I get \"we know everyone has bad days\". What kind of system never rewards the kind people who make league fun and challenging, but is quick to punish for strangers reporting. A BS ONE! Have a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2015-10-21T21:00:13.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair I've gotten a free skin and a free summoner icon for good behavior.

It's like the old ELO system. If you were at, like, 2.2k+ ELO, you were good. If you ended up below 1.4k, it was near impossible to escape and it wasn't just because of how you played. You lost more points than if you won, like, you could lose 100 and only gain about 20, far worse than the current system that has some people losing 30 and gaining 15. Ribbons seem to work in the same way where you get a few points, but the second you say 'DAMMIT, KASS, PLEASE PRESS R AND FOLLOW YOUR LANER, MAN.', you're screeeeeeeeeeeeeewed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SoundwaveCanada","date":"2015-10-21T20:49:23.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Archon: My point is the league system is heavily lop sided towards punishment and almost nothing to do with promotion of good behavior. Example: Did you know players who curse lose 13% more games. What about players with good communication skills win 87% more games. My comment to corki wasn't post it was after and it wasn't item build related it was ad rune setup vs ap rune setup due to the fact we had four champs that had to be ap, it's an aram issue between veterans and newbies. Corki chose ap when we had 4 obvious ap's already (unless galio went pure tank), that's why I commented to him about balance. But to reply to you Archon I've never seen anyone banned from their post-game banter either :)\nBanter: the playful and friendly exchange of teasing remarks.","replies":[{"poster":"SoundwaveCanada","date":"2015-10-21T20:52:11.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I want is a ribbon :) and maybe a cookie.
