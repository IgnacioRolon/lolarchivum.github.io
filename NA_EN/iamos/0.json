I know it's happened a few times in the past weeks for you, but they're normally pretty rare and you won't ever get punished for \"leaving\" those games that crash.","replies":[{"poster":"iAmos","date":"2017-07-13T03:07:24.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's good to hear for myself and the teams I left behind! \n\nHopefully we can figure out what is causing these!","replies":[]}]}]}
