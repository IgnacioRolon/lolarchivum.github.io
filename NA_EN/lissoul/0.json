Both AP items basically JUST provide spellvamp (gunblade has AD which is useless for most casters, active which isn't bad... WotA has 10% CDR and AP of course)\n\nThen we have the AD choices...\n\n{{item:3139}} provides both lifesteal, damage, AND a cleanse.\n\n{{item:3156}} provides flat ArPen, MR, AD, + a shield for magic damage and lifesteal at low health.\n\n{{item:3072}} allows you to overheal, giving you an additional shield to soak damage before dying.\n\n{{item:3153}} gives you %HP physical damage, aspd, lifesteal, damage, and the active!\n\n{{item:3812}} makes you take less damage, has AD, regen ALL physical damage, and has 10% CDR\n\n(you could also note that Gunblade is really for both classes, but I definitely think you need AP due to the higher AP and lower AD stats on Gunblade).\n\nWhat's the major difference? Every single one of the ADC items with lifesteal on them has some form of survivability or defensive use outside of JUST having lifesteal. BotRK is the only one that's less obviously defensive, but stealing someone's MS can make it much easier to kite them.\n\nMeanwhile, mages have literally no defensive item that also give spellvamp. None. Nada. Zilch.\n\nAnd while your idea of \"ADCs are closer to the fight than mages\" is kind of true, it's also kind of not. Sure it used to be the truth when mages like Karthus and Veigar were popular - Karthus being someone who wants to be at max range at all times and Veigar standing back until he can land a combo. But now that the game has evolved, mages NEED to be able to option select into spellvamp, and it really NEEDS to be a viable way to get health back. Playing midlane against stuff like Jayce with TP is literally torture for any mage, because if you beat him he can just buy a vamp scepter... Sustain in lane until he can't anymore and TP back, there's basically no appropriate response from the mid laner unless you manage to kill him. You can't possibly keep up with the sustain, unless you also took TP you can't back as freely, and you have 0 itemization options that will fix the problem unless, again, you get strong enough to just oneshot him. It removes a lot of the impetus from players in advantageous matchups to even play, as an AD vs AP with the advantage for the AD is much, much harder to play against than the reverse.\n\nEither AD champs need to lose some of those defensive lifesteal items, or mages need some defensive spellvamp items.

It isn't that fair imo.\n\n---\nthis part contains alot of salt and hate towards ADC, you don't have to read it. I wrote it to just throw it out from me :)\n\nI'll tell you about my experience versus ADCs:\n\nI was Talon in yesterdays game. I'm rather bad Talon, Know only the most basic combo E-Q-R-W-Hydra + Thunderlords + sheen (if i manage to get it). This combo heavily damaged my main target which was Kallista. But she survived with about 1/10th HP. From that she started to just AA me in 1 spot, going 1v1 manly mode.\nShe outhealed my damage. She outhealed my lifesteal from Hydra. \n\nIn older game I was playing as Xin. 300 armor (about 200 bonus) with thornmail and 3k hp. Enemy Draven was critting me for 450-500 and healing for 200~, while thornmail dealth about 30-40 dmg to him in return. Couldn't do jack shit. For him to heal back 1->100 took 2-3 minions. \n\nAnd even older game (like 2 weeks ago) enemy Graves was the king of the game. I think I was either tank Garen or Nautilius. If you come in close you get critted because pellets, when he crits you just see his HP bar shot up totally negating all of your damage.\n\nIn different game Kindred was shredding our team while healing like mad. It was quite funn because ONCE we dropped her below 50% hp (sudden gank), she used her ultimate and then.. She outhealed us leaving her ultimate with 100% hp while getting double kill. I was Teemo i think.\n\n\nAnyways, whenever I happen to stumble against good ADC players, the game never feels as unbalanced and pathetic. And it's because that they are allowed to outsustain anything and anyone, even when it's 3vADC, if they play smart they'll win. What can mage do? use his spell rotation, use Zhyona and then get butchered because his dmg comes from spells which are on CD..","replies":[{"poster":"RoodToob","date":"2016-03-26T21:54:38.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saianna,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cQ00vzAQ,comment-id=0001000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2016-03-26T21:08:49.708+0000)\n> \n> {{item:3156}} = i have seen LOTS of ADCs surviving because of this sudden steroid.\n\nHave to agree, i miss when it was Assassin and bruiser only type of item, too much tankiness for an ADC \n> Those items, youmu, 3force, duskblade, etc are all important, yes but the fact that ADC has 2 early game and 6 lategame choices for Lifesteal means something.\n\nCant forget about Warlords bloodlust mastery either now {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\n> Imo it's caused of powercreep, where every next champion has to be better than old one, or items have to be shinier than before.\n\nIDK about shinier items, but at this point they kinda have to make super different champions so they are unique and all have a reason to be picked, its also why we got stuff like the marksman update.  \n> And those shields..

Spell Vamp's potency is increased based on how much AP you have and it is unmitigated by Magic Resist since it counts a % raw damage dealt with your abilities and converts it into instant health.\nThere are also champions who deal critical damage with spells:\n\n* {{champion:34}}  when applying a slow and using E on a target.\n* {{champion:30}} when using his Q on a isolated target.\n\nYou've also Included a Cutlass, BorK and Gunblade, which build out of it, so i guess i'll penalize you for that as well.\n---\n##Food for thought\n\nI guess ADCs can build a Gunblade so MF is a prime candidate, on top of a Bloodthirster.\nThanks for the idea.\n\nAnd you're absolutely correct. Spell Vamp is very limited for mages, as most of them are prime candidates for WotA and not a Gunblade. Gunblade is more suited for Jax and Akali, so it's very limited too.\nExcept WotA offers just Spell Vamp (we'll disregard 80 AP because every finished AP item gives on average the same amount) and 10% CDR which can easily be replaced with another item - like a Morello , Lucidity or Frost Queen's.\nBasically, it offers stats that mages can use but also lacks the stats that mages will need to use more of - 10% more CDR and no mana/MP5.\n---\nI won't ask Riot o make it available on more items, i prefer that it remains a stat to choose from among others but at least WotA getting buffed, becomming an attractive option for all mages or mages who will need to scrap with others a lot.\n{{champion:55}} {{champion:131}}","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-03-27T22:27:11.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I think we all know how broken this stat can be when you get 600+ AP and your all abilities are single target and you're an assassin mage with low CDs + a passive that offers Spell Vamp and Lifesteal.\n\nThis is exactly why i think the item needs to be changed. When you think about it, it would actually make more sense at this point in LoL's life to have spell vamp work more for aoe and dot and not single target. \n\nMost of the single target mages just blow up people and giving them something with 80 ap which also lets them regen a bunch of that high burst just makes things worse (see brofresco's annie spell vamp video, may not be viable normally but its still ridiculous) but its also not needed because people just build more useful high dmg ap items on them. Same goes for champs like Akali who can one shot. Spell vamp should be a staple for kite or dot mages to actually allow them to be played other than assassin like mages. Its partially why ahri was so unbalanced after wota fell off as she had/has a kite mage's kit but dmg (especially true dmg) and mobility beyond what should have been acceptable with the items of the time.\nAlso its really the kite and dot champions who build tankier or with more cdr and therefore would be better synergy with wota.

It's possible that one reason Akali is so badly nerfed is that she works too well with {{item:3146}} and Riot is afraid of her getting out of control.\n\nUntil recently ADCs had few choices for survivability *other* than lifesteal, which is very little help when being 100-0'd by an unpeeled burst mage or assassin (their intended counter classes) and no help at all when hard CC'd.  Having them get a bit too much benefit out of {{item:3053}}  {{item:3156}} in otherwise offense-focused builds is what makes lifesteal too good; if you can't burst them down *and* you can't beat them in a long fight where they can lifesteal, then you can't beat them at all (or only with ignite available, which is rare in a double TP meta).\n\nThat's why I think those two items should be rebalanced to work better as the offensive part of a mostly defensive item build on someone like {{champion:36}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:54}} (juggernauts or tanky initiators) than as the one defensive item in an otherwise glass cannon build.  And judging from recent and PBE balance changes, Riot agrees.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-03-27T17:31:20.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's look at something though.\n\nYou've got {{item:3040}} ... The closest equivalent is the ADC {{item:3072}} as far as the shield... And the BT shield has NO COOLDOWN and refills with lifesteal while Seraph's Embrace has to be stacked to 750 mana before you can even activate the shield (and it has a 120 second cd on the shield itself... and the shield is based on how much mana you have when you use it.) BT is more expensive though, at 3700 total gold to Archangel's 3100 gold, but BT (imo) is a much better defensive item (though Seraph's is a better offensive item, due to the scaling potential).\n\nThis is just an example of the way that ADCs survivability items really just offer them a lot more than mage items. Mages definitely have a lot of access to flat MR/HP/Armor, but the ease with which they can access sustain or defensive items is lowered considerably. I think one of the biggest problems is {{item:3157}} to be completely honest with you - it's a very situationally strong item as a defensive item and I think it's basically cockblocking any other serious defensive mage items. But I'd really, really like to have access to an AP version of Mercurial Scimitar for games where a cleanse would be better than rooting myself for 2.5 seconds... And I think AD should have a version of Zhonya's. I don't think there should be this dichotomy where everyone has uneven access to defensive options, because it creates this world where we get items (like sterak's) that have AD on them and suddenly AD's have crazy access to defensive items, but I don't think Riot would ever introduced an AP themed survivability item like that because {{item:3157}} exists...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-03-26T21:22:51.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If ADC gets lifesteal only from {{item:3139}} then:\n\na) he doesn't need more\nb) enemy team kills him too fast for life steal to matter\nc) he doesn't work well with lifesteal in general ({{champion:42}} ?)\nd) he simply sucks and follows some pros builds","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hella Kaiser","date":"2016-03-27T00:40:22.244+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seenan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cQ00vzAQ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-03-26T19:25:55.590+0000)\n>\n> 250 is assuming you can crit constantly without fail\n\n{{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-03-27T02:57:43.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the shit that with just 1 item (IE) was dealing 440 dmg to my face (me = tank Xin around 140 armor).\n\nWith 2 items he could have tanked me and assassin from my team\n\n(by tanking I mean outhealing my damage with fking 2 dorans swords!)\n\nAnd while we were working on our 3rd item he had full set with Consumable potion & Oracle (even though we didn't had any stealth champs).","replies":[{"poster":"Hella Kaiser","date":"2016-03-30T21:04:53.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"draven's actually really easy to counter in lane... but if he gets fed... oooh boy...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2016-03-26T23:41:07.772+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's acknowledged in the past that they don't want mages to be able to have the burst heal that comes from spell vamp.\n\nWhy they don't just buffer the healing so it's granted as a HoT is beyond me.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-03-27T00:21:05.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst heal would be fine, since mages can't have it sustained healing for eternity like Lifesteal can.\nSpell rotations can't last forever.

But once teamfights start, as a burst mage, you are trying to avoid damage and deal as much as you can in return - making it a completely wasted stat after late mid-late game. Once damage get so high that you risk getting 1-2 shotted, the stat is worthless.\n\nI propose a change like this:\n\n* Spell Vamp is still just in WotA, still _**Unique**_, same effect\n* _** New Unique effect**_ - _**Vampiric Infusion (Aura):**_ Heal your teammates for 3% of the raw damage dealt by your abilities. Start with 5 stacks, gain + 1 stack/10 sec, spend 1 stack per ability used.\n\nThis way, you'd actually have supportive capabilities as a high damage burst mage and in my opinion, having it limited to stacks and static 3% damage (not split for AoE abilities) will also limit how much you can team heal at a time. You won't be penalized for not doing big AoE damage (you can fully use the effect on a single champion to heal you team up by a 5 spell roration) but it's not a better heal if you suddenly dump your abilities into a team - thus making AoE mages better than solo damage for team healing and damage mitigation from the champion select.\n\nI realize that Spell Vamp from WotA used to be an Aura but it was simply the same bonus granted to all champions which wasn't a good idea. An Aura is good idea but Aura's effectiveness is solely based on your contribution to a fight so your allies can't abuse it this way by having high damage or frequent spells.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2016-03-26T20:03:34.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"It's 1/3 because it's a multi-hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2016-03-26T20:15:24.438+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tombdragon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cQ00vzAQ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-03-26T19:31:23.452+0000)\n>\n> I believe they said it was due to it being multi-hit?
