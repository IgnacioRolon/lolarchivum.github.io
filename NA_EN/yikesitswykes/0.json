I recently bought a new laptop that had a 4k resolution and made the game look quite beautiful. However, I seemed to notice 4 things, the cursor size, minimap, chat size, and healthbars were all drastically scaled down even on highest scaling settings. I was wondering if there is an easy way to fix this as after a few games with it I have found it near impossible to play like I could before. All help is appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Souji","date":"2017-08-26T06:22:02.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately league still doesn't have any proper support for 4k resolutions. I too have a new 4k laptop with the same issues. So I have my resolution set A LOT lower like my old laptop so I can see my cursor, chat, mini map and names. Hopefully Rito can start working on supporting 4k in the near future...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lurantis","date":"2017-11-14T08:58:34.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been owning a 4k Screen for like 2 years. And there is still no update going that way. This makes this game unplayable in 4k. Anywhen a teamfight start there is noway to know where that cursor went to since its just too small to follow. This is Gamebreaking. Cant even use the minimap correctly wich is one of the morst important thing in the game. And Now i cant use my second screen while playing league on 1080 because the second one also 4k. i've been waiting forever for this to be fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-26T22:30:38.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice Charm is correct here! We don't support 4K at this time. I'm not saying it won't be a thing in the future, but as of right now we don't have  any support for it.  Fixing the Res as Nice Charm stated, should get your cursor to show back up for you though. <3","replies":[]}]}
