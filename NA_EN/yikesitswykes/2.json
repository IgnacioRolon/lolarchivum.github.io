So 5 days later and I'm still having the same issue. Awhile ago I made a post about how my wifi connection was fine and every programed worked well except for League (out of nowhere). This still seems to be the case... I have gone through all the procedures on the connection issues help page and nothing has worked for me. I tried going through the support ticket process and the best they could come up with was to use an Ethernet cable which bugs me when I have, and I will highlight this detail immensely, been playing this game for 2 years now on a wireless connection with no previous ping issues. My ping used to be 80-100 then they moved the servers so the east coast got better ping, aka I started getting 27-37 solid ping, now for the last 5 days as soon as I enter a game I am greeted with 130-2000 ping, never really staying consistent whatsoever. I really love this game and have put lots of time and effort into fixing the problem. Please help me so I can continue to play the game I enjoy so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T22:29:12.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that you're still having these connection issues, but I appreciate the steps you've taken so far.
