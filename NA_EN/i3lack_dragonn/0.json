But for your issue, it sounds weird; I just want to make sure you fulfilled all the requirements first before suggesting that you reach out to my colleagues to have it looked into. First, the requirements:\n\n1. You have four chest slots in your profile..\n2. Once you earn a chest from achieving S rank on a champion, you won’t be able to earn another with that champion until the beginning of the next season. You can see which champions you’ve earned chests with in your profile’s Champions tab. This chest cap resets each season.\n3. If someone in your premade group earns an S rank, you’ll receive a chest as well! This doesn't apply to you since you said you got the S rank yourself.\n4. You can only earn chests if you're playing a champion you own.\n5. You're not Honor Locked from one of the following:\n\n\n- Two week suspension: Drops your level down to 0 and lock your Honor progress, making your account ineligible for hextech crafting rewards.\n- Chat restrictions: Knocks your Honor level to 1, or 0 if you're already at level 1. Honor progress will be locked, making your account ineligible for hextech crafting rewards.\n\nIf you've fulfilled all of the requirements and aren't Honor Locked, hit up my colleagues through the Support Site so they can take a look at what's going on: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nSource:\n- [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide)\n- [Honor and Hextech Crafting Restrictions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463)","replies":[{"poster":"TimX24968B","date":"2019-05-16T01:14:03.712+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"we need a trading system.  so the ones who get too many keys can trade with the ones who get too many chests.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rikirie","date":"2019-05-15T22:39:25.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a keys problem. 25 chests over the years but not a damn key","replies":[{"poster":"Tahngarthor","date":"2019-05-16T01:40:37.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rikirie,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=ynf3Rbnn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-05-15T22:39:25.110+0000)\n>\n> I got a keys problem. 25 chests over the years but not a damn key\n\nI have the opposite problem.
