This set I deleted from the legacy client, but it still shows up when I'm in game on the new client. Am I missing something here? The new client doesn't seem to have item sets available to create/delete so how do I get rid of it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T00:59:53.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to resolve this by jumping back into the *Legacy Client* and ensure it's deleted from that end before hopping into a custom match (while still in Legacy) to force an update to the Item Sets file saved server-side, which should delete this item set for good. Basically, you have to hop into a custom match to confirm Item Set changes if you want those changes to show up on the Beta Client.\n\nLet me know if this worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightshade36","date":"2017-02-14T05:28:49.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!
