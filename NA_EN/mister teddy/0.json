Im just wondering if i have the only problem with missions. I played one game where we got baron and dragon but it didnt count towards my mission even if i have the worlds icon and we won. However after i restarted the client i now lost all my missions and i cant view completed ones. Let me know if you have the same problem or if it is just some temporary bug please.
