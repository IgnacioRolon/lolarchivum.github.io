Unless it's a limitation with your hardware, my suggestion would be to make sure that your [drivers are all up to date ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)to ensure it is making the most of your resolution.  Things like youtube videos that aren't officially supported by us may actually cause you to run into more problems too, especially if you are manually modifying your config files- don't do that.  I suggest resetting your config to default and starting over:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
