Randomly the lobby closed and said I was the one who left, needless to say I did not close the client or exit the lobby in any way, I got kicked basically. Now I have a -3 LP score for a game I never voluntarily left. Is there anything that can be done? Also my internet did not crash because I had a stream running at the same time and it did not close, nor did the wifi cut out.","replies":[{"poster":"rcrc0526","date":"2017-01-19T04:41:57.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Translation: We couldn't have our devs boosting themselves to challenger","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-19T04:33:42.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ouch, sorry to hear this happened in a ranked queue and messed with your LP! Unfortunately, we're unable to modify your LP for any reason. The system was designed this way to prevent any chance of abuse.\n\nMost disconnections in champ select are caused by an *unstable connection* to our servers. While you may not be experiencing a poor connection to other servers or services, since each one is located in a different geolocation, you could only see issues with one particular service or set of servers. We may need to look at your network routing to find the cause of these issues, but before then, I suggest working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are A-Okay.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
