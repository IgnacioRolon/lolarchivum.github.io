If that doesn't solve the issue, it's possible it was removed due to a chargeback. \n\nIf a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf you believe that content you have received (Heartseeker Orianna) on your account has gone missing and is not due to the scenario above, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  We can look into your account and investigate further!","replies":[]}]}
