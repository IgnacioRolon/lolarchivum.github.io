A E-W combo meant around half your mana. He had to try to harass OR farm, and farming was way less efficient in AP gaining. He was more reliable at oneshooting someone, but that was the only thing he did in a fight. He was known to make the teamfight instantly a 4v4 from a 5v5, cause after doing his combo he was useless. He had higher cooldowns and to be able to OS properly, built no cdr in his builds (apart from DFG, building grail delayed him a lot). Was hardcountered by any MR item ; basically insanely vulnerable with his cooldowns down. Was somewhat good midgame, but kinda bad lategame because everyone got banshees and Veigar was weak against banshees.\nNow he has much more manageable cooldowns and manacosts and is much more of a teamfight control-damage lategame mage, nothing like the reliable burst-one-guy mage he was.\n\nBut for some reason, people view him as a terror prerework because he had an instant stun. It's sad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-06-06T10:58:23.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has no mobility boosts.  He has to have something.

Still, that's his job, if he lands a stun, he can use his W and Q to at least chunk if not kill.  If you can avoid it, it's much harder for him to get kills.  Lux is the same.  Dodge all of her poke and she lands one binding and deletes you unless you're a tank.\n\nThere are so many champs that are way worse in my opinion than him.  As an ADC, basically the support (assuming they don't build AP) and maybe ADC is in the only one who won't insta murder me.  Any gap closer murders me.  At least Viegar I have a chance at outplaying by dodging his abilities, but good luck dodging that Highlandering Yi or Nasus who withers and then stacks you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TankofGod","date":"2016-06-06T11:32:37.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-06-06T11:02:34.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well putting out 100 E in a game to have an average of one hitting means at least 15 good minutes on trying while spamming it on cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demon King Maou","date":"2016-06-06T10:50:17.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes everywhere \"Support Ranked\" \"Definately not tank toplane\" \" Maybe jungle..

That stun is like impossible to hit.\n\nVeigar is a champion that is good in 1v1. In teamfights, he either is good (if the enemy team his stupid for not focusing him) or is does almsot nothing. That's because he has a short range, so he has to get close to his target to kill him. He also has no mobility, and his only defense is on a ~15 seconds CD. in lane, try to bait his E, then engage him while his spells are on CD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-06-06T11:03:32.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"at least you can actually avoid veigars stun.\n\nit could be worse. it could be flash/q/tibbers.\n\nif she has a belt, annies counterplay is not being within 1400 units of her.","replies":[]}]}
