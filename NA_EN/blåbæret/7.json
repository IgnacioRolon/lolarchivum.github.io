He has his Q to poke, E for dodging skillshots and probably farming under tower if he gets pushed back that far, and W for blocking important projectile attacks since he doesn't have any way to respond at the ranges in question without having an empowered Q and getting poked too much would force him out of lane and make him unviable.  His two-part passive serves to give him a little extra wiggle room around taking damage and performing all ins while also encouraging him to build like an autoattack-heavy ADC, and his ultimate, while it can be set up by himself, can also be set up by teammates.  His resourceless nature is likely because Yasuo was going to be using his abilities far more than any ADC in order to return poke, farm, and dodge, so his abilities are gated behind long cooldowns (wind wall, and yes, it is on a long cooldown relative to a lot of basic abilities) low cooldowns but long on-target cooldowns (sweeping blade) and the need to stack it up before it becomes relatively long range (Steel Tempest).\n\nOf course, people found that his kit was far stronger in the mid and top lane and moved him there, where his kit can cause more problems for his opponents, but I'd assume that's the origin of his resourceless nature.","replies":[{"poster":"Hinagiku33","date":"2016-07-24T22:13:38.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds about right from what I remember of when Yasuo was released.\n\nRiot has wanted to make melee botlaners work for a while now but it has never stuck because Ranged Carry + Support is just too powerful. This is because melee champs have been weaker than ranged champs since LoL was in Beta and they need to have all kinds of special buffs and overpowered numbers/overloaded kits to make them even worth playing. Literally, at the start you were hurting your team if you didn't pick a 5 Ranged Champs comp. So over time melee champs have been buffed to ludicrous degrees to make them even viable - naturally Riot sometimes overdoes it and creates monstrously overpowered Tanky DPS champs.\n\nThis has been dubbed \"the Irelia Problem\" even by Riot themselves since Season 2.\n\nManaless champs are almost all melee, and it's usually done because melee champs just cannot use their melee basic attacks without getting poked to hell and back if they have to lane against ranged champs. Since ranged champs can poke from a very safe distance for no resource, melee champs get forced out of lane and starved for CS since they have to use their abilities to do anything at all. Since ranged top laners like Ryze and Quinn basically make melee top laners useless, Riot has made a lot of melee champs with no mana bar so they can have a chance in lane phase to spam their abilities to farm up.\n\n***Thus Yasuo, and a lot of other historically problematic melee champs, is just a symptom of the great \"Melee vs Ranged Laning Problem\" that Riot has been trying to solve since Beta.***","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2016-07-24T22:03:34.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Show me one official thing stating Yasuo was meant to be a bot lane carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-07-24T20:24:43.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no way to respond to range without empowered Q 0.5 cd e","replies":[{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2016-07-24T20:27:56.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using e to engage in a duo lane where the target is ranged is a lot harder than in a solo lane, due to facing two enemies worth of damage and the potential exhaust headed your way.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-07-24T20:47:07.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wind wall and your ally if anything the extra target to e off of makes it easier to engage. now what you said effects surviveing not engageing which is more effected by if you can play with your allies and how you use your skills seeing how 1 of not both of them will be ranged and susceptible to complete damage nullification","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Swiftstrike4","date":"2016-07-23T22:57:09.684+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"He is one of the few champions I think that needs either an energy or mana based pool for his abilities.

Riven would go OOM in a few rotations, Rengar's needs ferocity to function as that is where his strength comes from. katarina might go oom while attempting to do her resets so that would ruin her entire reset mechanic/passive. energy based champs like zed/akali are gated by cooldowns to prevent them from spamming abilities in an all in on cooldown. they are assassins designed to go in and go out rather than just get on your face and spam abilities. same with lee sin. \n\nYasuo's problem is not that he is resourceless (even if it as annoying as a mana user) is that its extremely hard to trade with yasuo properly and control the wave. between his flow shield and windwall a lot of your abilities will be negated so its hard to pick a good time. once he gets level 2 you can't just blindly try to auto down the shield as his ability to close the gap on you is huge. \n\nthat said, I hate yasuo. in lane he is cancer to play against, but he is balanced outside of lane. if he builds bruiser he does good carry damage, but isn't cutting through you like butter. full damage yasuo can ult and destroy everyone in a team fight quickly, but also will get locked down and explode in no time. \n\ni think if they removed the flow shield passive altogether that would be fine. thats really all he needs to feel less oppressive in lane phase and it wouldn't affect him much in team fights as his flow shield does hardly anything for him there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-07-24T03:34:15.515+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"because mana champs don't have to hit their minions 3 times to sortof-shove a lane\n\nif you really want yasuo to be a great splitpusher just give him mana","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Go Pew Pew Pew","date":"2016-07-24T13:25:59.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because that guy that likes to make OP champs made him.","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2016-08-04T21:59:20.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This makes sense.","replies":[]}]}]}
