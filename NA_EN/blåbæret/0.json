By contrast, we've had difficulty getting players to queue as premades, for a few reasons: we prohibited queuing of 3s+ before, it's difficult to play with someone with a huge skill gap, and it's just inconvenient. I think for most of us if we see a friend is already in a game, given the length of League games, we will probably just queue ourselves rather than wait 20+ minutes for them to finish.\n\nNow again, some players have no interest in queuing as anything other than solo. The barriers above don't apply because they aren't interested. But we also have a lot of players who are interested, and the incentives are help overcome those barriers.\n\nI don't think we are in any danger of most players queueing in 2s-5s, but if that happened, solo incentives might be more necessary.\n\nNow all of that said, we are also *not* trying to send the message that we don't care about solo players or they aren't important to League.

As of right now and the past few months, Premade Groups receive better rewards. Solo Players that are forced to group in a Premade Group do not get the same rewards a premade does when they win a match. You are forcing Solo Players to actively be put on a team with Premade Groups, so wouldn't it make sense to give them the same rewards since you are forcing them to be \"just a number\"?\n\nNo matter how you explain this to me, I cannot get passed the idea of giving Premade Groups more rewards than Solo Players. If you are forcing a VERY SPECIFIC group of players to fill in spots for Premade Groups, they should receive the same rewards if they win a match. As of RIGHT NOW Solo players are going to be placed with Premade Groups regardless. There is no reason why a Solo Player should be queing because they have the same que times as a Premade Group. You are not having trouble with Solo Players queing by themselves because regardless they are being paired with and against Premade Groups. That entire statement is irrelevant.\n\nWhat incentives do solo que players get RIGHT NOW? You are forcing them to group with Premade Groups and you have no systems in place to make it easier for them to find and communicate with Premade Groups. I'll answer the question for you then. The answer is you don't intend to give Solo Players any reason to que by themselves and you will continue to give Premades the rewards they do not deserve. Dynamic Que matches Solo players with Premade Groups without their permission, so the rewards Premades get is not deserved. \n\nMaybe you should have left everything alone until you came up with a system that doesn't take the entire ranked season to figure this out. We are half way through the season and the problems involving Dynamic Que and Solo Players will not be addressed until 2017. You guys have single-handedly made this entire ranked season irrelevant. This ranked season feels very one-sided and unfair. You guys have yet to do anything about it and we are half way through the season. I really hope you guys are considering giving everyone that has participated in ranked this season, all of the rewards regardless of their rank. It's not fair to punish the players because you guys decide to release a bad matchmaking system that is completely one sided.\n\nAgain I am not trying to hurt your feelings and make you feel bad.

We didn't have enough buy in with players, we didn't justify why we thought it was a good feature, and the feature itself had a lot of problems at launch. Another mistake was launching it so close to the start of the season. We should have delayed the season or had the entire feature slip to mid-season or next year. If I could do it all over again, I would strongly advocate that we launch the new champ selection, deal with all of its problems (such as long queue times and failure to get your primary role often enough) and once that felt stable and players felt pretty good about it, then start to explore increasing premade size.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2016-07-15T16:40:21.772+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"> GhostCrawler kinda just proved whats wrong with riot atm with what he is writing... after his first \"funny\" comment he should of just left.\n\nCan you elaborate?

I'm actually really disappointed in it because it doesn't seem sincere anymore as it is just a recycled phrase and there seems to be no real improvement overall in actually communicating features to the community. It's become a PR sentence that makes (in how I take it at this point) it feel as if you are behind a PR wall that separates the people who are supposed to communicate to the players from actually getting the information from the players so they are just doing the same thing over and over without hearing the player's concerns.\n\nI don't want to dismiss your concerns, so I hope this doesn't come across as defensive, but I will say that one of the things I love about Riot is the company's willingness to admit and own mistakes. I have worked at places where I would get in trouble for ever saying \"Sorry, we were wrong,\" for PR fear of the company getting a reputation as being sloppy or \"company admits error\" would make headlines on gaming new sites. So it's possible you don't hear that in comparison to some games you follow because those developers may not be able to tell you how they really feel. It's also possible they don't make as many mistakes of course. :)\n\nThere  is no PR wall here. Rioters are encouraged and expected to talk to players, pretty much as much as they want. There aren't people who are supposed to communicate to players. There are just people.\n\nBut we do have communication challenges. Riot was founded as a small studio with a handful of relatively inexperienced developers, and those guys spent a lot of time on social media, and especially Reddit, talking back and forth with players. The player base grew, and expanded into a lot of regions where English isn't the first language, and Riot grew as well. Suddenly it wasn't possible for anyone in the company to know everything that was going on. I get asked questions all the time about specific champion balance changes, or skins prices, or player behavior punishments, and I often just don't know those answers. That tends to make Rioters quieter, because they are scared they will look uninformed, or they're scared they will say something that contradicts something someone else says.\n\nMost recently, we have experimented more with videos and devblogs, because the reach of those is much greater and they can be translated into multiple languages. What those methods of communication lose though is the back and forth. As an individual player, you lose the ability to ask a follow-up question, express concern, or even call us on bullshit.\n\nPersonally, I have tried to experiment with a lot of different channels, from Twitter to Ask.fm to Twitch, as well as the videos and blogs. As I said, I will try to spend more time here as well (acknowledging that the reach is low), so that when we say something that sounds weird (in this case, maybe the message unintentionally ended up being \"We don't care about solo players and we want to broaden League's appeal\") you can just ask.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2016-07-15T02:26:46.609+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except it doesn't feel like there is improvement in communication over time.

Part of the problem is that it's some pretty old code and pretty fragile, so when we make changes at all, it's really easy to cause bugs. That's not acceptable so we are going to rewrite the code and the question is to what degree. If it's a medium size update, then there isn't much point in changing the current masteries because a new update might be soon(tm). If it's a large update that takes longer, then it probably makes sense to work on keystones again until the new system can come online.

When ranked feels like a clown fiesta because of premades and pro players are playing in private servers so they can have a decent match, doesn't it hurt the investment in e-sports and the feel of progression since the system isn't measuring your direct skills because it is heavily influenced by your premade? (See the Korean server).\n\n> \n> So far our data doesn&#x27;t support that conclusion though. We&#x27;re not dismissing the feedback -- just trying to understand why there is a discrepancy.\n> \n\nThere are two reasons why there is a discrepancy in the data.\n\n1) When a 4/1 wins, even if the player was left in the dark and did nothing to contribute for the win, there is no reason to report. While it stills left a bitter taste after the match, no one will report a winning team for \"lack of communication\" they will just proceed to the next match.\nIt is really sad when you finish a game and you feel the outcome would be the same if you were spectating it.\n\nSure, the same scenario could happen in a soloq match, but you  will get the feeling of carried while contributing, instead of \"irrelevant\". He will not vent on the boards/redit, but if there is a topic about it he will contribute to it. \"I felt like I was irrelevant. Played a 20 game with no chat and won because they were good\".\n\n2) The scenario where 4 hommies gank up on a solo q. There will rarely be a report. While toxicity was common in solo q and mutual reporting was common, when the player feels what is to blame isn't the players but the system that made him play with the 4 guys, that solo queuer will vent on the boards and redit. \n\nHe doesn't blame the premade. He blames the system. That is the reason  why the 4/1 made nightmare is rarely displayed in your charts but is popping on the boards.\n\nI suggest, again, to restrict the max 3s premade in all elos. That will shut up 90% of the noise and end with the 1/4s posts.\n\nA sign of which ones were in the premade, even if it is post match or post chat would feel great so players don't feel that riot is making up the statistics. Transparency works great and players can find one way or another with some API searchers that show \"recently played with\".\n\nCould you give the players that as a sign of good will? \n\n> We are looking at keystones.

We wanted to err on the side of making sure players could understand the new design, and it didn't help that selection often timed out in the first few weeks because players (understandably) thought that indicating preference was the same as locking in.

Duos could queue for ranked even before, and it's a lot easier to find one other player to play with than to try and form a threesome.

All the frustration and anger wouldn't be here if you hadn't shipped a shitty system onto us. No matter what you guys do to try to lessen the blow (do you really think crappy emblems will help at all? No!), people will still be forced to be playing in this awful system with premades. Thousands of people have left the game because of the state of this season, and more are doing it everyday.\n\nIf \"thousands of people had left the game\" then of course we would conclude it was a bad system that is hurting the game and we'd turn it off. But the results were actually really positive, which is why we considered it a success. Ranked participation is up. Number of players is up. Churn is down. Player behavior problems are down. (I will say again, that some of those benefits are from new champ select and some are from the premade component, and no they aren't all from really casual players who were somehow just waiting to be able to queue with friends in order to invest time in League.)\n\nWe don't trumpet those numbers a lot, because we don't think they do a lot to make players who hate the idea of premades feel any better. The analogy we use a lot is that if you don't like chocolate, it probably doesn't sway you if you show you all these stats about how many people like chocolate and how much they like it.\n\nThe feature definitely still has some problems, and as I've said, we think lack of solo recognition (or maybe skill expression is a better way to put it) is among them.

We were concerned that pointing out premades ahead of time might cause people to dodge or just tilt, but you can often tell from club tags anyway, and in the absence of confirmation, people tend to assume every lost game is a premade. Plus you can't really see things like the MMR adjustment -- it's invisible and does't do much to make anyone feel better.

I'm not afraid to know the strength of my enemy. In fact I'm curious and I WANT to know how good the enemy is. Please give me the option to see borders for BOTH my team and the enemies. This includes mastery level (So I know if i'm vs a yasuo main, or not).\n\nI think knowing the strength of my opponents will contribute to a better and healthier game experience. \n\nRemember this information is being shown in the Loading screen, not champ select.. I don't think it negatively influences us too much at that point. \n\n Is there any reason to keep this information away from us? Its making us use 3rd party websites to figure out this information, when you could just include it in the loading screen. \nPlus the loading screen would look MUCH nicer if I could see Borders for both teams. You could put this in options somewhere if you think people will be scared if they see a diamond border. I think it would actually be beneficial  to the game experience in more cases than detrimental, as we will be more prepared especially in ranked. What do you think? \n\nOther stuff:  \n\n2. Indicate premades in the loading screen. This will help players determine if they will be camped or not. If they enemy bot lane is on comms or not. Etc. Again basic information usually helps players. I dont think it should be 'hidden' (like the borders) because some people might get scared? ( Not sure what the exact reason was for removing the enemy borders... ).\n\nAgain don't shoe it in champ select to cause dodges. Blizzard does this currently, I believe. They use different colors for the various premades ( on both teams) it's useful for both allies and enemies . Good to know if your vs a 5 premade or not. You will play differently if that's the case. \n\nPlayers can choose to display their emblem, if theyd like,  while loading.\n\n3. Put something animated on the loading screen. At least a spinning circle. So we know that the application hasnt crashed. \n\n4. Cycle through tips (not just 1 static tip). Minor change that could add flavour. \n\nAgain, I'm not sure what the technical restrictions are on the loading screen. However I've always wondered how Hereoes loads up SO QUICKLY. I think they preload a lot of stuff in champion select. I'm not sure if this is a viable strat in this game, as you have 2 applications: 1 client, 1 for the game. \n\nhere is a picture of a nice looking champ select I found online ( someone's mockup) :\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rjlm26g.png\n\nI think you should put some resources into making the loading screen better in terms of appearence and information displayed. I think you're 'hiding' too much information for no reason, and you should strive to give us more to look at while we wait... \n\nAny thoughts?\n\nI think there are many positives for displaying enemy borders and masteries, and hardly any negatives. I think players would appreciate the honesty, and be better prepared in lane matchups. It will lead to healthier, more fun games If youo include enemy borders, masteries, and premades.\n\nPlus it will finally shut down the excuse that I lost because I faced a 5 man premade, and might go well into promoting transparency and trust with you matchmaking system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2016-07-12T21:12:59.759+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":8,"body":"> How the biggest issue with Dynamic Queue is that it CANNOT be an accurate measure of skill with so many variables in queue groups being a part of the equation.

But that is begging the question. We understand there are plenty of players out there who want to be able to measure (and display) their personal skill as accurately as possible. We are exploring things like filtering ladders by the solo/non-solo emblem and similar ideas. While we need to have a single queue for matchmaking purposes, we don't need to have a single list for evaluation purposes.

When we saw the reaction to the launch of DQ, several of the leads got together and made the decision to launch a solo queue as well. Lyte then communicated that decision. As we got into the implementation stages, we realized that the math just doesn't work out to support two queues. It would have been great to have known that before we made the announcement of course, but in this business (and probably any business) you often have to make calls with limited information.\n\nWe then made a couple of additional mistakes -- there was a tweet or something -- which also implied solo queue was right around the corner. We also accidentally turned on the old (and non-functional) solo queue for a short period of time. It was an embarrassing comedy of errors for sure. But the intent was never to lie to players. \n\nI've been making games for awhile, and it inevitably backfires if you try to lie to players.

I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but is it your intention to attract new players at the cost of veterans?\n\nI think it's a bad thing. It's also not a conscious effort on our part, and I think it's debatable if it is really happening. I think sometimes \"more casual\" gets used as a synonym for \"I don't like this design change.\" :)\n\nFundamentally, compared to a lot of games, League has never really struggled to attract players. We place a lot more energy in keeping current veteran players happy. Yes there are more niche games and more hardcore games, but overall, League has thrived because of its depth, not its accessibility. We have no interest in changing that model.\n\nIf you want to talk about individual features, I can discuss our philosophy about them. DQ gets mentioned as a casual feature a lot, but from the inside, I can tell you that feature was never about attracting new players. We wanted more League players to have the experience that pros have or that teams have in organized tournaments, where you get to build up a strategy around a core of known entities rather than randos that have to learn to communicate and coordinate every single game.\n\nFor me personally, this casualization claim gets applied from my tenure on WoW, where I was sometimes blamed for trying to make WoW more casual and approachable. That is an ironic turn of events, because WoW players also got angry at me for trying to make the game more challenging and hardcore. (For example, as a dev and player I preferred a dungeon and raid design that required a lot of group coordination.) Overall there is a phenomenon where players (and probably all people) like to blame those names and faces they know when they disagree with something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-07-07T00:11:49.006+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":7,"body":"1 just like what people wanted.

Runes and masteries were originally intended as a progression system, and as I mentioned (and it seems you agree) haven't filled that spot well. What they do however is give you a way to customize your champion before a game starts (meaning something outside of the item choices you make in game).
