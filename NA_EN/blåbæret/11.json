They said the moment Homeguard became a game mechanic, the rest of the boot enchants just enforced movespeed creep (which was kind of true, but imo it wasn't a reason to axe the entire system), because of how 'warping' Alacrity was and how Furor and Captain would have taken its place had Alacrity been the only one to be removed. Apparently in their eyes, Distortion was the only healthy one which is why it ended up being merged with Ghost.\n\nI wish the entire system didn't get the boot (heh) over that, but they did say the enchants could come back if they can figure out how to do them without enforcing MS creep, which hasn't happened as of yet.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-08-05T18:14:03.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They could easily add more enchantments in that don't just give movement speed.

The winning team would hardly ever have it on cooldown while the losing team would be using it pretty much off cooldown.  In those rare situations where the losing team turns it around, they won't even be able to pick up more than an outer turret because they don't have more than a few seconds controlling the map.\n\nI also don't think they want just straight stat bonuses on boot enchants either.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-08-05T21:26:10.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reread springy.
