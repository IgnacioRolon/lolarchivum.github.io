High pick rate means more people are new to the champ, dragging down the winrate below the actual power.","replies":[{"poster":"Murl0ugh","date":"2017-03-26T23:46:12.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes alot of sense thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-03-26T03:37:36.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For one, 51% is pretty balanced, although a bit on the stronger side of balanced.
