Yas has players that feed because he's hard to play, but remember when the Fiora rework came out! 10/10 players couldn't stop themselves from feeding. As for lose rates, Zed actual,y has counter play to him now, which is great, it just so happens that his counter picks are the meta right now.

Sure yasuo has a wind wall but if he dashes at you, just CC him, it's simple, for zed his R will actually always make him appear behind you, so CC him. For karma and any other Utility mid Laner, you really should just play safe and try not to die because they deal extremely high damage with usually one ability (their only damaging ability usually) and more often then not just are really hard to kill whether it be because of a sheild or in Zilean's case his revive ultimate. And it becomes especially difficult as a melee mid laner, it's almost impossible to dodge karma or zilean's Q's with a melee mid laner because not only do both of them have really high range and large blast radius's, but CSing as a melee is very VERY difficult in the first place.\n\nI'd argue that karma and other utility mids are just really solid picks if you want to not feed, sure you might not get a kill and you almost certainly won't get fed but you most likely will never loose lane with them.

Yasuo can mitigate all of Lux's kit save for her R and the first pass of her W. A good player will know to Q behind when a Zed goes in so I accept that, but generally Zed is designed to counter and burst down immobile backline (which Lux is) and Yasuo is a skirmisher who relies on outplay to actually win. Ahri is a good counter to both (I like her as an anti-assassin champion) as is Lissandra (invulnerability+multiple CCs.)

Yes, she's an easy, safe pick against MAGES.  But assassins destroy her.  Hilariously.  Even if you bait out WW, it's hard to tag Yasuo with a snare unless he dashes towards you.  And his DPS is insane compared to hers, so if you miss, you die.  Any Mage that has a skillshot as their only hard CC is not good against assassins.  Especially when it's a snare.  Also, Lux has very long base cooldowns.  They scale down quickly with level, and Lux stacks CDR, but early on her cooldowns are really long.  15 seconds on Q at rank 1, 10 seconds on E at all ranks.
