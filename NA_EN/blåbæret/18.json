People say that no champion deserves to be gutted; I disagree. When a champion gets a passive _aura of cancer_, we have a  problem. \n\nThe problem with this _aura of cancer_ is that it basically empowers the champion, yet is not considered a passive ability by Riot. The question becomes: why is this cancerous aura not considered a part of the champions kit? \n\n{{champion:99}} sees {{champion:157}} gets locked in - automatically tilts and recieves debuff: **Aura of cancer**: _This champions cancerous presence disempowers and tilts you until you lose._\n\nMy suggestion: Make this ability explicit and nerf/buff accordingly. {{champion:64}} and {{champion:157}} would be on top of my list, since Yas in specific now has three passives.\n\nJust my 2 cents. This is not a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-05-13T01:15:27.657+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Aura of cancer: This champions cancerous presence disempowers and tilts you until you lose.\n\ncountered by chemo {{champion:27}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"GG ShiningGundam","date":"2017-05-13T02:34:28.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"just remove {{champion:17}} hes the one really pulling all the strings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-05-13T01:14:11.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just {{champion:33}} when i see that squirrel-haired champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2017-05-13T01:56:01.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let the downvotes pour down from the Yasuo and Lee Song mains.
