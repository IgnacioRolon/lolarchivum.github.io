Obviously don't dive her if you know it's up. And if you are actually considering her to be hard to fight, by not just ADC standards, but by standards of all champions in the game, idk what to say.","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2017-09-30T10:07:58.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao.

Still I think she's certainly easier to focus than Vayne, and her auto range is a tier lower than standard for ADCs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2017-09-30T04:49:38.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:67}}  < Marksmen version of Yasuo except she has a point in the game where she isn't completely annoying asf to play against. \n\nVayne is the Yasuo/Riven of botlane lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Ir0n Tomato","date":"2017-09-30T04:56:28.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+Bledded1990 Vayne is I think more similar to the master yi of bot lane.

When Xayah is building IE in more games than she is ER, it's a little concerning. When I played Xayah top lane(when she didn't have that silly lockout on Q+autos), my autos would hurt but they wouldn't do 1/3 of someone's HP, but with the right setup of my skills and placement I could still deal tons of damage to them. Now when you're running back from a Xayah you're not actually using her weakness to your advantage because her autos while following you hurt more than her combo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-30T04:39:40.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"what? lol","replies":[]}]}
