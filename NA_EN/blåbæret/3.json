The fact that tanks only buy ONE magic resist item and can effectively ignore all AP damage.

AP itemization is literally the most one-sided in the entire game.\r\n\r\nLiterally every time I pick a tank, I laugh at AP champs - I can stand still in a spot and tank a mage with {{item:3135}} for 15 seconds and not die with one MR item. Yet, with 4 armor items, {{champion:236}} will kill me in a couple of autos with his {{item:3153}} {{item:3071}}.\r\n\r\n**SOMEHOW** Riot figured out that AP champions were the problem and gave them yet another set of unjustified nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-04-12T02:06:58.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"They build 1 MR item because Mages have to burst and are then gated by their CDs.\n\nAD champs keep attacking with AAs.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2017-04-12T02:11:17.613+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrHaZeYo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YBZue7Em,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-12T02:06:58.877+0000)\n>\n> They build 1 MR item because Mages have to burst and are then gated by their CDs.\n> \n> AD champs keep attacking with AAs.\n\nLol no.

If you're not playing something that's tanky or has a lot of built in sustain/shielding you will get fucked 100% of the time.\n\nI get that you like playing DPS tops but they're all late-game oriented and when they get to lategame they dumpster everyone.

Less than 9 for sure but Rumble's in there too so that's another for APs, Naut too if you really wanna be picky.\n\nAnd then jungle is like Rengar, Kha'Zix, Ivern, Lee, and Elise. 1 bruiser, 2 assassins, 1 AP tank/support, 1 Elise\n\nSo yeah for competitive diversity that's a lot of champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2017-04-12T02:34:02.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much every champ you list here apart from Elise, Malz and Zyra run support builds and are not reliant on AP to be useful.
