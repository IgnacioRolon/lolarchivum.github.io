What can i else say maybe he can lately. To be truthful since i ban zed whenever i go mid i really dont remember how a lane goes against him. \n\n>  Every spell deals low damage early on?\n\nIndeed but the thing is that most mages have their spells on bigger cd than assassins (usually). More spells more dmg more push. \n\n>  Aha, did you include the buff on the mana regen?

So even more rotations in order to deal damage!\n\n>  Also, almost all mages get the blue in the late game.\n\nNo role should ever require a temporary buff in order to function.

The same applies to junglers too.

Outside of aybe a Zhonyeas.\nYour range is really long, a Bruiser could say \"Why do I have to go tanky to do  less damage than the mage, have less range and pretty much have the same cc? Why do I have to be gated just for being short ranged?!\"\n\nMarksmen need protection otherwise they get blown up, mages don't need protection that much.\n\nEveryone has their own problems they need to take care of and mages have mana.\n\n> Which top laners?

Besides mages can only go mid safely because on general mages are immobile, so a short lane will help them more than a big like top or bot.\n\nA lof of bruisers are XP dependant (Their base stats are the best in the entire game) so leveling up gives them huge advantages.\nYasuo is more item/gold dependant yes because he was originally designed as a melee ADC in the bot lane.... didn't really work out that well.\n\nThese bruisers can't go mid because they would be sitting under their tower and get poked 24/7, they would never have any priority in lane, which is something very important in the early game.\n\n> To be totally fair, gp has a lot better laning phase than most make him to have.

Divers and juggies. Divers have damage coupled with mobility to engage. They however cant get out when they engage. Juggies have a shittons of dmg, shittons of base stats on general but no mobility whatsoever. Those btw are called strength and weaknesses.  Every class have them. \n\n> Marksmen need protection otherwise they get blown up, mages don't need protection that much.\n\nThats false. Mages need protection too, if not more (though it depends on the mage, but this applies to adcs too). For example both vayne and ryze need almost no protection. Actually almost every hyper carry (either ap or ad) need little to no protection. On the other hand, a lux and a ashe are going to need heavy protection to do their job. \nBUT, adc compared to mages (and apc on general)(usually) can fend for themselves better than apcs. Mages on general have skillshots or other telegraphed spells, giving the enemy the possibility to play around them and thus kill them. Adc, however have no such things. Their most dangerous weapon in their arsenal is impossible to evade and scales with 100% of bonus ad. The only real way to play around them is to not get close.\n\n>  Everyone has their own problems they need to take care of and mages have mana\n\nIndeed, but no other role has such a gamebreaking problem as mages with mana.  I mean at least the other roles dont get about mana or hp.

Here let me prove it to you \n\n>  A Lux has a shield, a snare and a slow in her kit.\n\nLets take this scenario (in this scenario there are no summs), lux is running away from lets say a zed (build is rather irrelevant lets just say that zed can kill her even if she has zhonyas since it will only delay her death) zed can pretty much evade her whole kit with 2 different skills.   The moment zed reaches her with his ulti, lux is dead.  Zed can also use his w to close the distance.  Though lux might survive his initial burst since she does have a shield. Though the snare wont stop him for long enough ( or at least until lux is in a safe place) and the slow does nothing to blinks.  Lux can try to burst him down but chances are that she will not kill him. Zed also has the advantage of being able to aa her to death.  \n\nAshe will also die in this scenario UNLESS she builts specifically to deal with zed. ( G.a, death dancer, phantom dancer, tabi, ie, yeah i know terrible build but this way she can survive and kill zed, now that i think of it i think g.a. is a bit too much) Lux or any mage for that matter cant build something similar. (yes yes i know this wont ever happen in a real game, im just trying to prove that adc on a general level can fend for themselves better than mage's. Mages main source of damage can be evaded thus making the act of defending themselves a lot more difficult) \n\n>  Every other APC has either a range advantage / self-peel / cc in their kit. Hitting a Morgana Q point blank isn't something telegraphed or outplayable.\n\nThe problem with range advantage is that it cost reliability. Most of the times the cost is more than it is worth. For example, my main xerath's e rewards hitting it at max range. Its difficult to hit it (im going to be honest with you idc what you personally believe about skillshots you cant hit them unless the enemy doesnt respond in time), most of the times my e hits someone because they run quite literally on it. The other times i land it is when they are under effects of movement impairment.(also quite irrelevant, do you think its worth for a spell to have impressive range, if the delay is so big that its almost unlikely to be usable in a real game? Im asking that because xerath's ulti at max range is nigh impossible to hit the time it takes to land is huge even with hard cc is difficult ) Also not everyone has the cc potency of morgana's snare.  \n\n> Using that Q on a ranged target though is going on the offensive, in which case you don't need to protect yourself but rather un-alive the enemy.\n\nWhat if that target is coming to kill you? Im pretty sure that counts as a way to defend yourself.  \n\n> The most dangerous weapon in the ADCs kit however doesn't have any other additional effects other than damage (too much damage as of right now).\n\nIf only this was true. Xayah, aoe snare and strong zoning capabilities. Caitlyn, multiple snare traps and quite pontent zoning capabilities especially when defending a siege or when sieging. Varus, aoe slow, aoe gw and aoe(?) snare if the enemies are close to each other.  Jinx, strong single target slow along with a kinda aoe snare traps that also knock down dashes.  Miss fortune, surprisingly good aoe slow along with some terrifying zoning capabilities. Ashe, strong slows, awesome scouting capabilities and an global ulti that stuns and knockdowns dashes.  Sivir, aoe speed buff for engages or disengages. Kog maw, decent  scouting capabilities along with a decent aoe slow. Twitch, an a deceptively  aoe slow (which is also what i personally hate about twitch i left the damn area let me move ffs). Kalista, strong scouting capabilities good objective control and an aoe knock up. \n\nThe days when adcs where only about dmg have passed.

His job is to kill Lux.\nAlso that Ashe is beyond dead, even with GA. Zed can land a rather easy double Q or even a triple Q on an Ashe, if both are lvl 18 and full build, Zed would rip her health bar apart 3 times.\n\nRather imagine this scenario, Darius charging Lux with righteous glory, Lux throwing E to slow him down and stop his movementspeed buff, then throw out snare while he is slowed to secure the disengage. \n\nIf it gets spicy she can hold onto that snare until Darius hooks her, she shields and throws out snare to disengage, slow gets up again, trap Darius in slow zone to generate more distance.\n\nAshe has a stupid slow and like a 1 second stun on an ult.\n\nWhat I want to say is, mages generally have a bigger puffer zone to stop incoming danger than ADCs and generally more tools to do so, thats why I would say they need less protection than ADCs.\n\n> The problem with range advantage is that it cost reliability.

People are in danger in a range of 1100 units around you, they have to care when approaching you (unless they are a tank but thats another problem).\nThat zone is the place where your safety lies, giving it up means your safety drops to nigh zero (since Xerath stun is like one of the best designed stuns in the game, good for range so synergizing with your kit and at the same time rewarding for the opponent if he manages to get close to you).\nVel'Koz has the same problems, so does Ziggs.\n\nThey ability to protect themselfes lies in the huge range they become a threat to enemies.\nADCs don't have that, if people get in the danger zone of Sivir then they are basically in her face.\n\n> If only this was true.

People are in danger in a range of 1100 units around you, they have to care when approaching you (unless they are a tank but thats another problem).\n\nYeah about that.

The only real \"dangerous\" spell is his w which even that can be evaded.  \n\n>  That zone is the place where your safety lies, giving it up means your safety drops to nigh zero (since Xerath stun is like one of the best designed stuns in the game, good for range so synergizing with your kit and at the same time rewarding for the opponent if he manages to get close to you).\n\nWhile his stun design is good, its kinda useless in the current environment, where all other cc have a duration that is irrelevant with the range. Besides its useless on melee range. 0.5 second is hardly anything. Even knock ups have bigger duration and they cant be lowered. \n\n>   Vel'Koz has the same problems, so does Ziggs.\n\nNot really. Vel koz is surprisingly good at kiting thx to his q and e.His e btw is also knock up that lasts 0.75 second. As for ziggs he has his w which is knock up/back for both him and his enemies, one the best (in my opinion) peel abilities in the game.  \n\n>  ADCs don't have that, if people get in the danger zone of Sivir then they are basically in her face.\n\nLike i said before, mages have bigger range but way less agency. Their enemies can literally walk out of their spells like its nothing. On the other hand, you are within adcs aa range? Prepare for a barrage of undodgable hits.  And hell the range isnt something small. 550 isnt something to laugh about. \n\n>  Yeah but that is Caitlyns kit, not her auto attacks, she can do that yes but not just through usage of only auto attacks.\n\nOh when you said additional effects i thought you were talking about utility.

I dont play mages so i can herd the sheep.  I pick mages because i like mages. I like cool effects and stuff. And i like seeing these cool effects deal damage. I dont like them missing.

Imagine if we did same when they nerfed {{item:3147}}.\n\nIts the begin of the new cycle, and repertoir already say they plan to changes adc in 8.8-8.10. \n\nSeems like using brain/skills isn't well received here{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2018-04-18T12:59:25.967+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryuumoku no koke,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FkE6kRER,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-04-18T12:14:27.426+0000)\n>\n> Spamming ability mindlessly is an issue. \n\nYah man, but ADCs are the most widely complained about issue in this game; why are mages being worked on before them?","replies":[{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2018-04-18T13:08:39.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Riot has been working on big ADC changes for a while but wants to wait until mid season because they are big changes?

Gonna talk more problem statement stuff than exact details but those&#x27;ll be coming in the next couple weeks. \n> \n> One thing to note is that we&#x27;re doing less of a giant midseason release this year. Changes will come over a couple of patches, and it&#x27;ll be smaller scope - there&#x27;s no Runes Reforged or Elemental Drakes in this one. The changes that are there are likely to be significant, though. Likely to see changes aimed directly at Marksmen on 8.10 or 8.11, possibly both depending when work is finished, and then possible (but definitely not guaranteed) Fighter work in a follow-up patch.\n> \n> We&#x27;re looking at Marksmen with a few values:\n> \n> 1. The mere fact of getting to two items shouldn&#x27;t guarantee they&#x27;re the most valuable champion on a team, but getting ahead should matter a lot.\n> 2. They need to be able to buy early items that ensure they can be fun, have responsive inputs (shoot-step-shoot is pretty unpleasant with no AS), and contribute appropriately. I take that to mean they need to get Attack Speed, potentially movement speed (though less required), and at least some punchy, powerful hits.\n> 3. We&#x27;re going to be looking for ways to play up the difference between a snowballing champion and one that&#x27;s merely on the curve - that includes Fighters, Assassins, ADCs, and Mages (though we think Mages are actually more correct than the other three - if they&#x27;re behind, they provide primarily utility, if they&#x27;re ahead they can be great damage carries). We&#x27;ll especially value any time we can hit multiple of these classes with shared items - e.g. items that help both Fighters and Marksmen, or Assassins and Marksmen.\n> 4. Some opportunistic stuff - e.g. reducing the burst damage of very late game Infinity Edge builds to other squishy champions.\n> \n> This will probably mean significant reworks to Infinity Edge, Essence Reaver, Last Whisper/Lord Dominik&#x27;s Regards, cost changes to things like Phantom Dancer, possibly a new item, likely buffs to some underperforming items, plus some ADC base stat changes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2018-04-19T12:02:48.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lcs","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChisatoShirasagi","date":"2018-04-18T17:11:55.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mages are in no way overpowered rn, but they sure are annoying to deal with as an assassin main (looking at you Orianna mains)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-04-18T07:22:46.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Welcome to the assassin meta, where kill pressure level 3 is your only hope.
