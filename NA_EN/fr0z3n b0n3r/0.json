Winrate is below 30% now.\nFirst got placed to fucking s1, like all the other years before and dropped ever since - cuz &#039;fuck you, you have to play through all these cancerous assholes every season.&#039; Of the 6 Wins, I had to carry at least half of them solo.\nI&#039;m a fucking Plat 2 Smurf, I played with other Plat/Diasmurfs. We can&#039;t carry these games though.\nIt&#039;s basically 3v7 or 2v8. I&#039;m not even joking. And I&#039;m not thinking that P2 is great or anything.\n**\nA professional Player, who &#039;proves&#039;, that there is no elo-hell by playing games in lower Elo doesn&#039;t understand the concept of it. It doesn&#039;t mean anything, if there is some dude who does it for a job, whose like 3 or 4 Tiers above the Elo he is playing in. **\n\nNoone ever listens to calls, pings etc. - last game i pinged botlane back, since i had vision of bluebuff (cuz i was the only one who warded), but they didnt care until the enemy jungler was right in their face. Every game is a fucking stomp. \nIt doesnt matter, in which position we are playing in. Every 2 games we get AFKs or Intentional Feeders. \nAnd do not bullshit me with &#039;statistically&#039;, I don&#039;t have the time to play 24h to hopefully get the braindamaged players in the enemy team for only once. \n\ntl;dr1: I get fucked by mmr as duoplatsmurfs in silver\n\nI have **NEVER** had winstreaks similar to my losstreaks. I am playing this shitty game since Season 1. \nI have seen everything. I have heard Robot Amumus laugh, when he was in the bush, I have seen the Ult-Range on Zyras Release, I heard all the &#039;better nerf Irelia&#039;-jokes, I&#039;ve witnessed all the Kata, Ryze and Evelynn-Reworks,  I made the &#039;perfect leash&#039; by irritating the buffs, I have seen Yasou not losing health on the PBE, I was part of the Tribunal, but I have never had a winstreak above 7 in ranked.\n\n&#039;Toxic Players lose 17% more games&#039; is so full of shit. &#039;Players who lose 17% more, than the avarage player, flame more&#039; should be correct. Ever since I started Ranked on this account, I only get frustrated and pissed off - after the first 5 losses. I&#039;m forced to waste time with people who do not want to win, else i get punished by the leaverbuster or some other stupid invention. \nI played b4 the first serversplit, when &#039;drink bleach&#039; and &#039;i hope everyone you know dies in a fire&#039; was common. But even then, people tried to win and listened to the two pings you had. They used wards, cuz everyone told them to. Yeah, it kinda sucked to be support, but at least you were able to ward the whole map.\n\ntl;dr2:I&#039;m so fucking frustrated.\n\n\nI have not played on this account for a few months, so I'm still Honor Rank 2. Does that have anything to do, that I only get matched with feeders and afks? ","replies":[]}
