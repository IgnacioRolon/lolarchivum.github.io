I do realize that, yes I do deserve a ban, but 2 weeks? I have not even gotten a warning for toxic behavior before. I do realize it was really awful what i wrote, but was just wondering if I could get it cut down to a week, since it was my first offence. I am sorry that my behavior got to this, but was kinda mad at the Yasuo at the start.\r\nI know I made a HUGE mistake, but would love to be able to play the game in a week instead of 2.\r\n\r\nChat Log: \r\nGame 1\r\nBokiCar15: nope\r\nBokiCar15: wraiths and golems do 3x the dmg\r\nBokiCar15: wont get lvl 3 before recall\r\nBokiCar15: nice\r\nBokiCar15: their support got both so that is huge\r\nBokiCar15: Yasuop\r\nBokiCar15: do you mind helping\r\nBokiCar15: Yasuo next time come earlier ffs\r\nBokiCar15: wtf\r\nBokiCar15: that shield again?\r\nBokiCar15: ahahahaa\r\nBokiCar15: perfect\r\nBokiCar15: yasuo\r\nBokiCar15: you are so useless\r\nBokiCar15: its insane\r\nBokiCar15: worst yasuo world\r\nBokiCar15: gg\r\nBokiCar15: fizz\r\nBokiCar15: YASUO\r\nBokiCar15: SO DUMB\r\nBokiCar15: JUST FUCKING TP EARLY\r\nBokiCar15: GO HELP TOWER\r\nBokiCar15: AND WE KILL AL\r\nBokiCar15: BUT NOW\r\nBokiCar15: WE LOSE\r\nBokiCar15: GG\r\nBokiCar15: GG\r\nBokiCar15: GG\r\nBokiCar15: G\r\nBokiCar15: im afk if you dont stop\r\nBokiCar15: being so dumb\r\nBokiCar15: OK U WANT ME 2?\r\nBokiCar15: look at yasuo\r\nBokiCar15: fucking gya %%%%\r\nBokiCar15: im gonna find out where he lives\r\nBokiCar15: and im gonna fucking murder him in his sleep\r\nBokiCar15: sleep well %%%\r\nBokiCar15: im fucking coming after you\r\nBokiCar15: bitch\r\nBokiCar15: fucking %%%\r\nBokiCar15: youre dead\r\nBokiCar15: and you dont eve nknow it\r\nBokiCar15: fucking dead\r\nBokiCar15: %%%\r\nBokiCar15: YOURE DEAD\r\nBokiCar15: SO I DONT CARE\r\nBokiCar15: YOU DONT LIVE MY ACCOUNT BANNED\r\nBokiCar15: GG\r\nBokiCar15: you wont live to see it get banned\r\nBokiCar15: dont try me morgana\r\nBokiCar15: i will kill you\r\nBokiCar15: (irl)\r\nBokiCar15: (ing)\r\nBokiCar15: can we fucking group up mid\r\nBokiCar15: and winj\r\nBokiCar15: or are you to dumb=\r\nBokiCar15: gg ez pz\r\nBokiCar15: all mid now\r\nBokiCar15: lets enc\r\nBokiCar15: this is 2 ez\r\nBokiCar15: report me for shutting you down nerd?\r\nBokiCar15: ez","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-02-03T22:46:40.463+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> BokiCar15: fucking gya %%%%\n> BokiCar15: and im gonna fucking murder him in his sleep\n> BokiCar15: sleep well %%%\n> BokiCar15: fucking %%%\n> BokiCar15: youre dead\n> BokiCar15: fucking dead\n> BokiCar15: %%%\n> BokiCar15: i will kill you\n> BokiCar15: (irl)\n\nReal life threats and hate speech earn immediately escalated punishments.
