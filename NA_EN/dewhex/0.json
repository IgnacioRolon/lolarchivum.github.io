This probably has more to do with the chroma packs, but I don&#039;t have time to do tests. I assume that once I&#039;ve found a team I can probably fix this manually if I remember, but it&#039;s just confusing to select it once, and then have to select it again, it doesn&#039;t occur to me immediately to check that.\r\n\r\nNot a huge deal, just thought you ought to know.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-16T21:26:00.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DewHex,\n\nThanks for the report! This is something we've been aware of, but unfortunately don't have a solid repro for. :c It's definitely an issue with the chroma packs. I personally use the Nami chroma pack often, and I've found that clicking off the chroma and re-selecting works - I've never had this issue when I do those steps. It's not the best workaround, but it's the best way I've found to get around this issue.","replies":[]}]}
