I ended up falling into it when I joined my current teamspeak community.  It seemed like the people I played with were very interested in playing top, adc and support, and as I was a poor midlaner and had Sejuani, I started jungling with her before patch 5.2 came out.   It helped a bit that I started out jungling for friends, but I soon learned that a lot of players will complain about your play.\n\nAnd often its not something you can do much about.  I played one game where the mid on my side was a Veigar.  He was facing Pantheon.  Veigar pushed the lane very hard, so Pantheon was hanging out under his turret and farming.  At the same time Veigar was constantly demanding that I come and gank even though there was absolutely no way for me to do that without turret diving Pantheon.  I told him multiple times that it was not a good gank, but Veigar blamed the situation on me.  (only for the ADC and top laners to jump on him for his attitude.  It wasn't a happy chat.)\n\nHeck last night I was in a game where I played Amumu.  (Sejuani was banned as always happens now.)  I was farming hard, but also ganking whenever I was near a lane.  The other teams toplaner both complimented me and complained about her own jungler in all chat saying something like.  \"Man Amumu, you are ganking all over the place, I wish our jungler would use you as an example.\"  (Sadly, their team eventually outscaled ours and my side lost.)\n\nI've learned to have a very thick skin when jungling in solo queue.  Some players are very patient, but many don't want to accept that they make mistakes and find the jungler to be a convenient scapegoat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gingivits","date":"2015-05-04T15:05:14.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to think jungling was hard.  Now I know its not just hard but really tests your patience.\n\nI jungled as Nunu for a little while and I knew his ganks were pretty bad but his counter jungling was insane.  The enemy jungle was Amumu so I proceeded to steal every big monster from each camp and about half his buffs to the point where he was 2 levels behind me and was struggling to get items.\n\nEzreal (mid) dies to Ahri once and then cries because he should be getting ganks and snowball passed her (I had tried ganking before but it was Ahri with a Nunu and Ezreal, was not going to happen).  I then tell him I will try once more and ping that I'm on my way.  He dives in and dives while I'm still running towards there.  Then he tells me that I am a terrible jungler and shouldn't jungle anymore or just uninstall because he could only imagine what I was like in lane.\n\nAmumu ended up rage quitting because he couldn't get a single big monster and when he ganked, they almost gave up a double/triple kill every time because he was so under leveled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shogunai","date":"2015-05-04T15:03:57.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungling is all about decision making an map awareness, so best thing you can do is understand what your doing an focus on that. Don't get me wrong you should be ganking but when the opportunity presents itself. Remember your in full control of what your doing and no one else. People will complain but let them, if it gets annoying, hit the mute button. Focus on your game an try to make as much of an impact that you can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karlyr","date":"2015-05-04T14:37:43.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do I do it ?

I noticed a trend of losing games where the junglers had no map awareness and no objective control (silver OP). The ganks were usually good, or their powerfarm to 6 was fine. But would chase for kills top instead of securing dragons, wouldn't push towers, etc.\n\nI'd rather have dumbass laners than a dumbass trying run the map lol.
