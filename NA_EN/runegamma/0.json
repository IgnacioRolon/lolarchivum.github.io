I have played **4500** thousand hours of DotA 2 and have been playing it for around 3 years now. Now I started playing League **WAY** back before I even know what a MOBA was. Never played it seriously though, just some 3v3 old twisted tree line with some pals and got bored eventually then around 2 years later I stumbled into DotA 2, After playing it for 3 years consistently just about every time the game doesn&#039;t get patched for a few months I get bored and slow down log in times and play other games like Team Fortress and Counter-Strike. However since Valve has been SUPER lazy over the year with their games I got bored of them as well, as DotA came to stand still with little to no interesting content being added I grew bored of gaming. Then out of the darkness, was League of Legends\n\nMy opinion of League was like any other biased and ignorant DotA player, reading off Youtube comments on what game was more &quot;Hardcore&quot;  and better E-sports and just about every little thing about gameplay. I assumed League was a game that was designed as a casual game, lacking in skill and thought while being heavily tied to the meta, making a more restrictive game, only certain Champions can play certain roles and would overall diminish the overall depth of the game, making it a shittier DotA\n\n**_How fucking wrong was I._**\n\nI came in with some Platinum and Diamond friends introducing me back in and I instantly loved the support role, which is also my most hated role in DotA, irony. Playing champions like Blitzcrank since I mained Pudge in DotA making me feel right at home in an unfamiliar environment. My Platinum friend playing ADC every game we were unstoppable, and I loved it. Now, even though it was very fun to just destroy people game after game, it felt like the looming factor was there. Champions being too similar and not being accounted for as _&quot;Good&quot;_ because of the meta. Making me feel just a little depressed realizing this is probably going to be the most I am going to get out of League, soon after around 15 games of straight Blitzcrank I put some money on RP for some skins, and ended up buying Bard as my Silver friends told me how useless and trolly the character was while my Diamond pal bought me Thresh. As soon as I played Bard that was it, im sold. Im in love all over again. Playing such a difficult champion that needs timing, effective team work, while also being cautious just in case you help the enemy team out made me feel tension, made me question my desicions if they were correct, and if made me feel like I was playing DotA all over again. \n\n**_Now I am Level 21 and a Bard main with a decent win rate and wish to improve. _**\n\nI want to understand every role and know how to play it efficiently, don&#039;t give me answers you would give to someone that&#039;s never played a MOBA before, I know what is to be expected of me with my attitude and how I portray my allies in games even when we are losing horribly. \n\nJust wanna say thanks as well to all the people that I play with and have had awesome games with, this is my first step through becoming a better League player and my first step of my **Magical Journey** _(Kek)_\n\n_**Oh my god.

Making bad players choose between farming or harass/trade keeps a lane healthy) I think there's something every game could learn from each other, and Heroes does have it's moments (have you played Abathur? He'd be _impossible_ in any other game) it also has it's extremely annoying parts as well (Oh joy of joys, I'm playing against a Nova... Time to takes some Mentats-oh wait, _I can't artificially enhance my perception to notice very minute details,_ guess I'm screwed.) and it definitely has those boring moments (Oh boy, I'm against Brightwing... _yawns and simultaneously kills them five times in lane_ **Did I leave the Oven on?**)\n\nI think there's something League could incorporate from Heroes (even though the semblance of Balance between the two is based on entirely different things, with Heroes being a far more team-reliant game than League) (mainly fuck kills/assists, there might be something else in there though...) but the same could be said of nearly any game. \n\nAn advanced skill in marketing is trying out an opposing product, see what you like and don't like about it, take note of any strengths while remaining mindful of the flaws, and then adapt or re-design your product keeping in mind the strengths of both and mixing what you feel is appropriate while trying to remain loyal to those customers who have been loyal to you. I think the Pre-Season did a bit of this (we did see several champions have base-buffs while slightly nerfing scaling, which Heroes recently attempted in order to slightly counteract early snowballing. Unfortunately, Riot isn't understanding the context behind Heroes having 20-30 minute games and added many ridiculous snowballing mechanics that have absolutely **ruined** the game for any late-game scalers, significantly wounded mid-game carries and uplifted early-game snowballers _far beyond the point of Overpowered._)\n\nRiot has kinks to work out, comes with any Pre-Season (though I tend to be inactive at these times, either unintentionally or, in this season, by choice) I am hoping however, Riot does eventually realize what they've done and revert the more snowbally mechanics...","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2015-11-23T13:54:56.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HoTS is very nice gameplay-wise, but when it comes to characters, stories and a world they feel cheap.

It is the highest skillcap role in terms of strategy and thinking, rather than straight mechanics.\n\nWhen I play jungle, I spend more time looking at the minimap, looking at the lanes and thinking about my strategy than actually looking at my screen. If you've played gankers in DOTA, you'll know what I mean. There's no reason to watch your Clinkz or Nyx walk across the map when ganking; it's better to watch the lanes you are targetting and plan your entry.\n\nThere's also a greater emphasis on positioning, IMO, than in DOTA. In DOTA, blink dagger makes it so that sub-optimal positioning is not punished as heavily if you have good reflexes. In League, if you burn your flash or don't take flash, positioning and choosing what terrain to fight in is of paramount importance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2015-11-24T06:09:10.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You main Bard?\n\n__You have chosen wisely__","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eboksba","date":"2015-11-23T17:37:39.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing as you have followed the footsteps of great and mighty supports before you by picking up Bard, I feel obligated to introduce you into Riot's incredible movie team and give you Bard's release teaser.

I doubt I need to explain much of anything in this role, other than simply not feeding and try to open up windows of opportunity for your ADC/APC. You know this though, but I just wanted to say that. Something to know, though: just because a Champ can top doesn't mean it can't be a Support; I've lost plenty of Bot lanes because my opponent's Support was {{champion:106}} or {{champion:35}}...sometimes, the best defense is overwhelming offense and absolute strategy, it depends on who your Carry is. Also, buy plenty of Wards...don't make your Carry do so, they need to build other things.\nADC or APC (depending on the road you want to take, though ADCs are much more common) are the ones who deal as much damage as possible in short-to-long bursts and (as the name implies) attempt to Carry the team. The most common and most effective (at times) generally tend to be part of the Marksman class—ones like {{champion:42}}, {{champion:18}}, and {{champion:51}}. As an ADC/APC, you need to know when and not to push your lane. Having so much damage potential, especially with Champions like {{champion:18}}, Bot lane is the most-Ganked lane in SR. You tend to only see Ranged Champions on Bot lane, because Supports can do things like Stun or Root, but it really depends on what you're going for.\nMid Lane is like a mixture of Carry and Support. You need to build both offensively and defensively, or with Utility like with Wards, but you mostly need to prepare for Teamfights. Typically consisting of Mages, you need to Gank regularly (or at least on occasion, or when they need help in their lane) but your real role is Control. Champs like {{champion:25}} and {{champion:45}} excel here, but {{champion:238}} and {{champion:157}} can control things by overwhelming offense and strategy.\nNow for Top and Jungle...you normally will never see Top Lane with more than 1 Champ there at a time. Normally consisting of semi-bulky to Tanky champions, their job is to get up in the opponents' face...well you know this fact. Some ADCs and Mages can work here due to their Ranged nature, but because they're mostly-fragile you tend to go for ones like {{champion:14}} and {{champion:86}}. Not much else, I don't really main Top.\nJungle is the hardest, imho. You need to constantly watch out for enemy Ganks (either on you or on Lanes), where the Jungle Buffs are and when to get them, and so much more you probably already know. They typically tend to focus on Ganks and Control, but more on Ganks so the Laners can find openings to push and win their Lanes. I find it hard because if you don't know how to Jungle you'll end up falling behind in terms of Level and Gold. Champions like {{champion:9}} and {{champion:203}} are great to use, but {{champion:31}} and {{champion:104}} also succeed because most of the Jungle monsters consist of 2-4 enemies each (don't try Tristana JG, though...she's too fragile for Jungling, even with her E doing nice blast damage).\nAnything I haven't said can be explained by others...and you did say you know how to play MOBAs well so most of this will already be known.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}<Don't do anything I wouldn't do~","replies":[{"poster":"RuneGamma","date":"2015-11-23T02:12:32.690+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers dude, thats some awesome insight and advice right there, il take them into account in my games :D cheers man, Since I main support though I havent got that many top lane or mid lane champions, so I end up picking Heimerdonger in most cases :D","replies":[]}]}]}
