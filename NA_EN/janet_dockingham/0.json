If Rengar was this strong, then why was he almost never picked/banned in the LCS? I mean if even the highly skilled players can't react to him, why haven't teams thought of using him and getting all the kills onto him and then just destroying their opponents in pro play? Seems like it would be an amazing tactic if Rengar was indeed this strong.\n\n>Still, I don't think any of those champions were on the same level as Rengar.\n\nSame problem as above. Kindred, Fiora, Graves, Mundo are top tier picks right now in pro play and people are actually proving how strong they are, yet they seem to remain untouched so far. I honestly wouldn't care about the Rengar nerfs because I can see how he can be anti-fun, but these other champs are arguably worse and we have received no feedback on them besides on Graves","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-02-09T16:32:23.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"If Rengar was this strong, then why was he almost never picked/banned in the LCS?\"\n\nBecause the strategys that shut him down are tons of vision, safe play in lanes, team coordination and grouping, and early game strong counter jungling. All of which are what dominate the LCS fairly hard right now, especially with the current meta of constant lane swaps to tower trade. Additionally he's been non meta in pro play for a long while now and pros are slow to change champions.\n\nDespite all that he is still seeing occasional pro play. But Riot doesn't balance mostly for pro play, they balance mostly for diamond+ non pro play. And there he's not only seeing a good bit of play but also has above average success and is very hard to stop once he gets even a little ahead. The counterplay to Rengar is to never let him get that little bit ahead, which requires that team work and safe play I mentioned above.\n\nPros aren't very interesting in champions who are feast or famine. They like safe picks. Picks that do a lot of work whether ahead or behind. If behind, Rengar falls off really hard and doesn't do much of anything.\n\nThe changes Riot made to him both nerfed and buffed him in ways that ideally make him less feast or famine. Giving him more damage in a longer fight, which can happen if he gets behind and builds a little tanky. But it also took away some of his extreme burst, meaning that even while ahead he doesn't just instakill people so easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Left Hook Larry","date":"2016-02-09T22:49:32.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Because the strategys that shut him down are tons of vision, safe play in lanes, team coordination and grouping,\n\nSo you agree that Rengar has plenty of counterplay and that just because low elo kids who can't adjust their playstyle and lose because of it doesn't mean we should nerf that champ\n\n>Despite all that he is still seeing occasional pro play.

My point was not about balancing around pro players.

They like safe picks. Picks that do a lot of work whether ahead or behind. If behind, Rengar falls off really hard and doesn't do much of anything.\n\nAnother reason why Rengar was fine the way he was. He requires the enemy to make mistakes, so nerfing him because he one shots someone after being fed free kills makes 0 logical sense when you leave shit like Kindred or Fiora alone who don't need to be fed or capitalize on mistakes to win games\n\n>Giving him more damage in a longer fight, which can happen if he gets behind and builds a little tanky.\n\nDo you not see what is wrong with this sentence? Rengar isn't a bruiser. He is an all in single target ASSASSIN. Meaning he goes in, kills someone, and goes out. He has clear counterplay and is useless without kills/ult advantage.

Also he could easily make an amazing bruiser with a few simple changes.\n\nI disagree. He would make an OK bruiser, but his Ult would be pretty useless. His kit revolves around him going in, killing someone, getting out.

No one should ever use it as an effective build unless they're 100% they will get fed, which is usually when you're against lower elo players. Rengar would make a terrible bruiser.

Alistar just requires your team to do what they already want to do, but while getting to ignore some of the potential negative consequences. Abilities that let you survive are generally much easier to play with, especially for your team mates. Abilities that let you kill people but don't let you do it completely alone require your team to hit the same target with damage or cc, which is simply much harder.\n\nLocking someone in the right place at the right time with a Morgana Q to secure a kill is like 50 times harder than walking under an enemy turret and pressing R while next to an enemy on Alistar. Luckily Alistar's R is on a much longer cd.\n> \n> Show me a clip of a pro getting one shot by a Rengar while being grouped with his team and his team placing pinks once they see the ! and try to peel for him. You won't find one because usually those clips are the pros walking around by themselves in the jungle or csing alone.\n\nAre you trying to say that the way to not get killed by Rengar is to just permanently stay grouped as 5 with pinks and peel at the ready as if that's something you can actually maintain all the time? Seriously?\n\nMost of the time early on you're not going to be grouped as 5 because it's not correct to do so. If you did you'd lose to doing that. Later on you should be grouped a bit more but you still can't be 5 people ready to go 100% of the time, and even if you are that doesn't necessarily stop a Rengar with some kills from one shotting one of your carries. I'm not hunting down specific videos for you, sorry.\n> \n> What about it? Doesn't change anything. He's still a champ that relies heavily on mistakes being made against him. That is why he is good in solo que, but  you will rarely ever see him in pro player. People are less likely to walk around alone in pro play against a Rengar\n\nThe game isn't balanced solely around pro play. The vast vast VAST majority of players are not pros. Even so, you can't just assert that Rengar is fine because grouping as 5 with pinks is technically possible. Also Rengar with Ghostblade and swiftness boots can R and leap on you with almost 0 warning from the ! over your head. Well he could, but that's why they increased the range at which it appears now.\n> \n> Do you know what a bruiser is? Rengar's kit isn't like Zeds. Zed can press r, do his combo, then press r again and he is out free. Rengar jumps in and relies on his one shot or he will otherwise not get the kill because he will just get insta cc'd\n\nRengar can press R, do his combo, and just walk away because you're dead. Or flash the wall and leap to a minion/jungle camp with his passive. Or just leap because you were near a bush and camp/minion when you died. Or stay because it's now 5v4 and the top damage carry on the enemy team is dead so Rengar isn't going to die before getting off another bit of damage.\n\nRengar pre nerfs was better at getting to your back line and killing your carry than Zed was. Zed can do it way too easily in my opinion, but Rengar could do it even better, which was very much not ok.\n> \n> I disagree. He would make an OK bruiser, but his Ult would be pretty useless. His kit revolves around him going in, killing someone, getting out. A bruiser Zed would get shit on by most champs\n\nGoing in, killing someone, and then getting out is exactly what bruisers try to do... The difference with them and most assassins is that bruisers tend to kill you a little slower and be a little tankier. That's it.\n> \n> Um what? 5 dorans blades is suicide unless you get fed with it early. No one should ever use it as an effective build unless they're 100% they will get fed, which is usually when you're against lower elo players. Rengar would make a terrible bruiser. It means his ult would be somewhat useless and just wouldn't make sense with his kit. \n\nI've seen it work in diamond games. It's not 100% going to get you fed, but it gives you a pretty good shot. I specifically said \"except for his ult\" when I said he'd make a decent bruiser.\n> \n> And he is 100% not a \"extremely good split pusher.\" Champs like Fiora and Jax can 1v2 late game and have a ton of mobility. Rengar thrives in 1v1 cutting people off and no escape if you buy pinks.\n\nRengar may not be a Fiora or Jax level of split pusher but he's still pretty good at it. He can escape a lot of 1v2s and even win some, ulting to get away if things get even worse than that.\n> \n> Look, I would understand if they nerfed Rengar AFTER nerfing all the actual broken shit like Fiora, Mundo, Tahm, Kindred, etc. But Riot completely ignores how strong these champs are and focus on Rengar? This is pathetic and shows how shitty their balance team is\n\nExcept they did nerf Mundo, multiple times in recent patches in fact. They also nerfed Tahm last patch. They nerfed Fiora a while back and are nerfing her again next patch. Kindred has been nerfed a couple times, including in 6.22. I don't agree with all of the balancing Riot does, but I'm honest when they do stuff right, even if it takes longer than I'd like.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-02-16T18:45:48.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Savage Bear,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yR62KYr1,comment-id=00050000000100060000000100000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-16T04:15:01.082+0000)\n>\n> My argument to this is the same. Why is Vel Koz not being nerfed? Clearly broken in highly coordinated teams!\n\nThe difference between Vel'Koz's ultimate done by a coordinated pro team and it done by a regular solo queued player isn't that big. A big part of this is the counterplay possible against his ultimate, which scales with player skill. Skilled players use Vel'Koz's ultimate better and skilled players play against it better. Alistar's ultimate leaves very little in terms of counterplay for the enemy team.\n \n> Definitely not.  But that is how you play against a FED one. Or you can always keep the entire map warded and back off when you see him.\n\nThat 100% grouped as 5 for the rest of the game strategy is NEVER reasonable. You lose to a split push, even if it's just from a banner of commanded minion. Or you lose to Rengar STILL killing your carry despite your efforts, because he COULD do that in many cases. Also it's never reasonable to \"keep the entire map warded.\"\n \n> You don't have a team? So a squishy walkign around alone gets caught out by Rengar... you do realize that is what rengar is intended to do.\n\nYou don't always have ENOUGH team with you to not die. Sometimes your entire team isn't even enough. Other champions, even when fed, simply don't have the back line diving power of Rengar (at least before the latest changes to him). Why don't they? Because it's stupid, annoying, unfun, bullshit. That's why they changed Rengar. Get over it.\n \n> That's what assassins do. Bruisers built half dmg half tank and focus on dueling more than one shotting the carries.\n\nAnd that's what Rengar can do if built that way... shocker! /sarcasm\n \n> You've seen Ryan Choi, which is a challenger OTP of Rengar succeed with it in Diamond games on his smurf.

At best they typically let you see him just as he leaves the pink's range and gets away. If not... then Rengar kills one of you first. Yeah, he could do that, despite your pink. Hence the changes.\n \n> I named you literally a small portion of champs that are broken. And do you know how long it took for them to nerf these champs? They prioritized rengar nerfs of this shit. Pathetic from Riot\n\nActually several of those champions were nerfed before Rengar, a couple at the same time he was nerfed. and I think 2, maybe 3, were done ONE PATCH LATER. Rengar was less fun to deal with than those champions anyways. Except Fiora. Riot should've nerfed Fiora further like 3 patches ago at the very latest and they have no excuse for not doing so.

If a champ synergizes  very well with teams that have an assassin, and a tank, in an assassin meta, they are going to be really strong, since assassins are always used in an assassin meta, and top laners are usually tanks\nIf a champion is only powerful with one item, they are still likely to be powerful, cause they will just build that item every time they play.
