This has happened 3-4 times now. I can't reconnect, it just disconnects and leaves it at that. I close and reopen client, still can't reconnect. I'm not trying to play ranked nor can I but if I get leaver buster that's really ridiculous considering I don't control what happens server side for me to disconnect from these games. I know I'm not the only one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T15:14:13.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having some issues reaching the game server.  We currently have ongoing maintenance for ranked games, but it shouldn't impact you unless you're routing to an unstable node.  As a first step, run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to clear up any blocks.\n\nShould the issue persists, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a route to 104.160.131.1.  This will help get us an overview of where you're routing and if there's any snags along the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"a rabid cupcake","date":"2017-07-19T13:45:15.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this issue as well. I managed to reconnect to the game proper, but I can't move, I can't chat, it just says \"Attempting to Reconnect\" forever and a day. I pray I don't get reported for this.","replies":[]}]}
