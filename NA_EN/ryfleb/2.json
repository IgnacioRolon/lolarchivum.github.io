Me and a jungler in the game both kept randomly d/cing while the WHOLE enemy team stayed in the game and obviously got the upper hand. I find it really unfair and a stupid loss that I lost  LP for something that wasn't even remotely my fault on my side.\r\n\r\nI understand that you're working on it but it really isn't right if people actually lost LP because of server problems that we can't control and the other team walks away with a free win and 20LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T23:18:20.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a recorded service outage a few hours before you posted this that were resolved by the time you posted this discussion.
