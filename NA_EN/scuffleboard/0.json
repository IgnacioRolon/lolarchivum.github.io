People have tried to report me and others for intentional feeding in many games I&#039;ve seen.\r\n\r\nHave I had some bad games in my time?  Yeah.  I&#039;ve been 1-11, 5-14, and 5-17 in one Crystal Scar game.  And on each of these occasions, I&#039;ve been flamed or had people threaten to report me (even though I had 30 assists in the 5-17 game.)\r\n\r\nMy point is that this community needs to get better at recognizing intentional feeding.  The 2-7-5 Brand that&#039;s made plenty of mistakes but has had good plays and isn&#039;t continually rushing into stupid situations?  Not inting.  The 0-10 Corki or whatever that bought a tear and five boots, then proceeded to rush into 1v3s and spin in a circle?  Probably inting.\r\n\r\nWhy would Corki need boots anyway?  He&#039;s never walking anywhere.\r\n\r\nCare to agree, disagree, whatever?  Lmk in the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-09-14T22:52:26.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just do your best and mute the assholes so they don't tilt you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stay Close Dear","date":"2017-09-14T22:46:28.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they know you re not doing this on purpose, they re just angry and looking to place the blame ( which is obviously right to some extent if your score is really bad ) If you re not actually feeding on purpose though, you have nothing to worry about.

More than half the players I see accused of intentional feeding are not doing so as far as I can tell, simply losing. That being said, you are unlikely to be punished for feeding (especially unintentional feeding) while the accusers are likely to be punished for their accusation if you report them for harassment.","replies":[]}]}
