They&#039;are also all Assassins. No one besides the people that play these champions like to fight these guys. Stealth is a &quot;Fun&quot; mechanic only for the ones using it, to the rest of us we fucking hate it because it&#039;s only on Assassins with Insta-burst. When was the last time you&#039;ve seen a Tank with Stealth? Perma-Stealth in particular is especially cancerous. Evelynn is the only one (That I know of) that has it and she has 100-0 potential. Yes, she has counterplay, like the massive ass range on her W makes people want to use it before they&#039;re in range to follow up, and the fact she&#039;s made of tissue paper, but still. It&#039;s a seriously bullshit mechanic, she only comes out of stealth once you&#039;re 2s charmed and basically dead before you can react.\n\nb4 anyone asks, no, this is not my first account and no I'm not new.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-08-19T03:19:55.703+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Perma-Stealth\n\nper·ma·nent\nˈpərmənənt/\nadjective\n    1.\n    lasting or intended to last or remain unchanged indefinitely.","replies":[{"poster":"NotAPurpleFrog","date":"2018-08-19T04:21:01.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WhoIsThisDude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7XMjJpIl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-08-19T03:19:55.703+0000)\n>\n> per·ma·nent\n> ˈpərmənənt/\n> adjective\n>     1.\n>     lasting or intended to last or remain unchanged indefinitely.\n\nIndefinitely, undefined.

You're actually trying to claim LB has perma-stealth LOL. Also looked and saw you got your ass beat by an Eve right before making this post.
