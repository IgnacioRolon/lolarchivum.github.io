I think that you shouldn&#039;t lose anything because it&#039;s just champ select and not in-game. Sometime people are exiting out because their friend just log on or you have to go somewhere and that isn&#039;t fair cause you are deciding to leave champ select which doesn&#039;t affect anyone. I mean there can still be consequences of leaving champ select but i don&#039;t think you should lose LP in rank champ select.\r\n\r\nIf you agree thumbs up so riot can see thanks!","replies":[]}
