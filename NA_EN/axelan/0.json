Back then rank was based off an elo system where it showed a number compared to leagues and divisions today. I was introduced to LoL by a friend and I grinded the hell out of it when I first started playing. I hit level 30 pretty fast and like a lot of us do, I instantly queued up for rank. Results? 1100 elo by the end of the season. That was considered unrank and below bronze. Before unrank was the lowest rank and bronze was the 2nd lowest. My all time low was around 500 elo which some would consider bronze 10 today. So I just kept playing, with time I improved without even realizing it. By the end of season 3 I was Gold 2 or 3 I think. Regardless I was gold. Gold took my a lot longer than silver. I barely reached platinum by the end of the season. Ended with plat 5. There was times I promoted to plat 4, but I would demote shortly. \r\n\r\nHere comes season 5. This is where things slow down by a lot. I finished my 10 placements, got placed in plat 3 which I was happy with since i was plat 5 last season. However, I actually demoted back to gold 1 after few months. I went on a HUGE losing spree. After about a week in Gold 1 I got back into plat. I slowly got my way up to plat 2. Once I reached plat 2, that was when I hit a brick wall. I would often times get demoted back to plat 3, back to plat 2, and down once again. It just kept happening. The highest I ever gotten was around 70 LP in Plat 1. I thought I would finally hit diamond, but soon I demoted back to plat 2 then 3. Currently just demoted to plat 3 and I just don&#039;t know how to get better.  I can play 10 games a day and get nowhere in a month. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing wrong. I don&#039;t flame or rage or any of that. I try to focus on my own gameplay. \r\n\r\nWhenever I do bad at one roll, I switch to another. I keep doing that because I get frustrated. For example, if I can&#039;t get a gank off a game, I would think I&#039;m really bad at jungle and switch to mid. Then when I play mid and get solo killed I straight up think I suck at mid and go back to jungle. Jungle was my role since I started playing. Name any role and I&#039;ve switched to it before. I&#039;ve never stuck to a role longer than a month max I&#039;ll say. Except for playing jungle from bronze V to Gold 1. I got frustrated with jungle and played top to get into plat, however when I demoted from plat, I went back to jungle to get back in. It&#039;s just that I get really frustrated easily in the jungle. I feel so useless when I try to gank a lane, but it is warded or when my team pushes and its hard for me to gank. I&#039;m also frustrated when I play jungle when my team gets solo kill. When that Happens i just think about switching out of jungle.\r\n\r\nOne of my friends said something that really got to me. He is around the same rank as me and he said, &quot;You&#039;ve played way more games than me and you are still plat.&quot; That really got to me. I&#039;ve played over 500 games when he only has around 150. We are around the same ranks. I really want to get better and prove that I am better because he is extremely cocky and toxic. He thinks he is really good and he blames his support a lot since he is an ad main. He doesn&#039;t rage in game, but in voice chat, I find him extremely annoying when he rages. He takes normal games way too serious. If me and one of my friends are trying to have some fun and he is playing serious, he gets really mad and just curses at us. I try to avoid playing normals with him because I just want to have fun and relax in normals. Anyways, I want to prove I&#039;m better but I don&#039;t know how to get better.\r\n\r\ntl;dr I&#039;m stuck in plat and can&#039;t get any better. Started season 2 500 elo lowest(bronze 10) and now plat 3 approaching end of season 5.","replies":[]}
