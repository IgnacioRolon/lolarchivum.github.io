I would be the European version of Kirby Cake. I'm a soraka addict with more than 2000 ranked games on her. My best ranking on Euw was 72 in preseason. \n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/20776961#ranked-stats\n\n**I greatly support Canastus. Everything he said in this thread I agree on:**\n\nhttp://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/twua1Wzz-morello-what-to-expect-from-soraka-in-49\n\nHe perfectly explains how Riot broke soraka to the point where it simply insults her playerbase. For the European playerbase I beg for a buff within the next 1 or 2 patches. Soraka **can not** stay in her current state until her rework. \n\n\nIn the patch notes riot claims that the changes address sololane soraka. However the changes hurt her supporting just as hard. Soraka needed the damage on her q in order to be able to trade. Her balance in botlane was about fine because **she lacks hard cc and has no escape.** \n\n\nYou need to look at what makes soraka \"toxic\" in the sololanes. That clearly was her ability to push waves quicker than most others at early levels. Her free silence wasn't really the problem. So why not just give her the rumble treatment and reduce the damage that starcall does to minions by X%? \nThen, if the trading power still would be 2 good: Reduce her q dmg by maybe 10 flat all over. But instantly nerfing q by 33% at all ranks? That is just pure hate. \n\n\n**Now my personal suggestion for a quick rework.**\n\n**1)** revert the changes from 4.8\n\n**2)** Limit the number of stars that fall down.\n\n- rank 1: 3 stars hit the closest enemy units.\n\n- rank 2: 6 stars hit the closest enemy units.\n\n- ....\n\n- rank 5: 15 (or inifinte) stars hit the closest enemy units.\n\nOne star/enemy of course and arguable whether starcall focuses champions over minions. \nThis change would tone down soraka's shoving ability in early ranks, giving her opponents in sololane a chance to get in the game. \n\n**3)** If soraka still is the most strong evil toxic champion in the game as she apparently was before, tweak her numbers **mildly.**\n\n\nI know that you are trying to rework soraka into something new. What I fear though is that you will take away a unique champion and replace her with a skill-set that we already got so many of. I love the current skill-set of soraka. I don't want another karma or lulu...\n\nThere were plenty of champions that countered sololane soraka well. They just weren't played much in the current meta. Let me name some:\n\n- syndra\n- cassio\n- darius\n- tryndamere if he knows what he is doing\n- karma\n- quinn, vayne\n\nOn top of it junglers like:\n\n- fiddle\n- rammus\n- udyr\n- xin\n\n... will own her hard if she tries to push her lane. And these are just her hardest counters who will be fine without any help. Also there are safe picks like ziggs who just farm from distance. Champions like twisted fate, ryze and veigar who cc soraka when she pushes so she easily dies in a 1v2. \n\nOn top of everything her so called \"op waveshoving\" is also her weakness. Let soraka do 1 q into the enemy units, then force her to retreat with a gank or hard engage. The result is soraka being zoned from the minionwave. She will lose the farm and possibly even exp. The worst thing that can happen to a soraka is a jax/nasus/irelia/darius/tryndamere freezing the toplane. \n\nOn top of that, **soraka is not able to freeze** a lane while efficiently harassing the enemy. Her so called op ability to push while harassing also has its weakness ;) Just nobody seems to realize it...\n\nI agree that soraka might have been a bit too strong. I just don't understand this hate she received from Riot. A mild nerf should've sufficed at first. \n\n**Hoping on an answer and a reasonable reaction to the situation!**\n\nRegards, Temestokles\n\n(angry European soraka addict)","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-06-03T21:53:01.796+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thanks for the post. Looking at it, here's what our analysis is;\n\n1) Nerfing Solo Soraka was needed, and we think this was the right decision. \"Countering\" based on a specific pick limits the pool of picks additionally - let's not confuse hard-countering and counterplay. Solo Soraka, pre-nerf, had a 58% winrate, which does cause us to ask questions.\n\n2) Support Soraka was already weak, and this is an additional kick to her. We know this feels bad, and we may look at this. \n\n3) Soraka will get a rework this year. There's [this thread](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/HsnUWEuK-morello-its-really-time-for-that-soraka-rework) in where we talk a bit more about our plans here.\n\nSoraka is overdue for this - we do think she's a bad experience for people who want to play her, and we need to fix that. That being said, her current kit cannot be powerful and healthy simultaneously - exactly why we've reprioritized her rework to this year. We're going to do everything we can to keep her as a healer - though that will require MAJOR shifts to her kit.\n\nA healer may be able to work under a different model. The MMO Priest model cannot be what it is (I've written litanies on why this is the case). If anyone can do healer in League, it needs to be done on Soraka.","replies":[{"poster":"Scoobert Doo","date":"2014-06-04T00:00:03.648+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"when u gave the nerf to her e u did not compensate it. i do not mind it being a weak ability with a silence and no mana cost but now it has a mana cost with no justification in numbers. u could have  keep the mana cost and shorted the silence and gave it more damage. u could also gave soraka the karth treatment like his q( less damage if it hits more than 1 traget). you obviusly did not look to hard into this u only wanted to knock the champion back into trash tier","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2014-06-05T10:47:08.556+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Nerfing\" wasn't exactly what you did there, it was a complete removal of any remaining viability. **I don't see how she's healthy right now**. But you're already familiar with my arguments, after all the creator of this thread cited mine as a source before. **Our goal is to make the current Soraka somewhat playable again, we're not here to discuss the rework.**\n\nHer main issues still remain as evident as ever - her **overbearing mana-costs** and the vast **cost-inefficency of her abilities**. As I said before, increasing the cdr on her W from using Starcall won't make a difference since Support Soraka (the very direction you're aiming for) will not level this ability for a long time. \n\n**I'd also like to know why you nerfed the cdr-cap on her Q to 15%** when it was supposed to be 17% in the first place, I already asked you on the rework-thread about it but you didn't reply. What's stopping you from implementing any of the suggestions we've made so far?\n\n**Just from reverting the nerfs on her Q and by adding a damage-reduction to creeps/minions you'd make her so much better** without making her the farming monster she used to be. I've been saying these things for over a week now and you still didn't consider it, how else could you go through with those \"changes\" on 4.9?\n\n**It's quite ironic, really. Soraka, the face of traditional supporting, can't support anymore.** Heck, she can't even sustain herself anymore. Please, if you refuse to make her playable in any way, you're better off by disabling her until the rework is done. Just spare us the massive disappointment from having to play her in this awful state and save others from doing the same mistake.\n\nI've got the feeling **you only come into those threads just to tell us to wait for the rework** and that's it. You don't respond to actual solutions nor do you make the impression of even wanting to fix her right now. We, as Soraka-fans, feel totally alienated from this. **Don't you realize we don't want to wait several months just to play our favorite champion again?**","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-06-05T21:23:02.630+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'll answer a few of these questions - sorry to ignore your previous comments, I've just been limited in my forum time. \n\n1) We're not confident we can get Soraka changes that move the needle from \"bad\" to \"not completely bonkers. This is the reason this is hard to focus on right now, and most of this is due to testing bandwidth problems right now. \"We may look at it\" is contingent on us being able to get changes that make sense for Support Soraka, but not ones that allow her to be a top pick (which we cannot do right now).\n\n2) The 15/17% was for item clarity. CDR is most efficient in buckets of 5% since items follow that pattern, and there's a hard cap of 40%. \n\n3) Soraka is the traditional fantasy of support - she won't hold up to that with this current kit. THAT requires a rework (though I think there's a fair comment on the more-healthy Janna not being up-to-par, who doesn't need a gameplay rework). \n\n4) I am mostly coming to talk about the rework because, from my POV, that's the strategy that matters to me. Incrimental patch-by-patch changes are something I'm much less focused on personally, since I'm highly concerned about the mid-term strategy that fixes bigger problems more holistically. I have brought this up and the balance team is pretty worried about a strong Soraka in this state (and this revolves around point 1). I will tell them about your suggestion though - there might be undersirable side-effects or implications I'd need to understand.\n\n5) If you want to play Soraka, play Soraka - the amount of LCS use isn't indicative of the possibility for most players to be successful with a champion. But, the expectation we can't have is that Soraka will be a balanced top pick - because her kit disallows a state in which that works and doesn't completely shut down a lane. That's why I'm very focused on ensuring **that** gets fixed. \n\nThis might not be a popular answer, but I think it's a straight-forward one.","replies":[{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-06-06T02:23:13.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if Janna's W passive granted less passive MS, but gave you more MS right after casting an ability?\n\nIt might also help her kit cohesion/fun factor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Toad","date":"2014-06-05T22:04:41.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just curious (Maybe it's off-topic), but what do you think Janna needs to bring her up-to-par?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"20776961_DEL","date":"2014-06-03T22:25:36.472+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying. \n\n1) Where did sololane soraka have 58%. In the lcs, in diamond/challenger, in all ranked games? Over what period? The problem is that she just counters the current meta to well. People are greedy. They just see a 1000 hp bar and forget that they might want to proc her heal before they dive. Where is her sololane winrate now. Lolking tells me that her winrate is about 43% in diamond. \n\n2) Support soraka really is horrible now :( The manacost on e is such a burden!\n\n3) A complete rework of her skillset as it is intended will take at least 3 months is my bet. Probably we won't see it until the end of the year. Can't you buff her a bit again until that rework happens so she at least becomes playable? The manacost on the silence harms botlane soraka more than sololane soraka in my eyes. Reverting that change could already help. \n\n4) I did read everything in the other post, but I assumed that it died and that soraka would be left untouched until December. And I don't want soraka to be at 40-45% winrate until then. If you could provide us with more info on how you intend to change soraka along the way I would be grateful. Only increasing the cd reduction on w when hitting q (on PBE) will most likely not solve the current situation. Soraka just runs oom faster. \n\n5) Guess we continue this in the other thread then.\nThough, why does a 58% winrate legitimate an approximate 15% winrate nerf. \nWhy couldn't just the damage dealt to minions be reduced by half? \nWhat do you think about limiting the number of enemies that starcall hits at early ranks like I suggested?","replies":[]},{"poster":"HemiPoweredDrone","date":"2014-06-04T05:00:24.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You keep saying that you want to keep her as a healer and honestly that scares me. You say \"healer\" so much that it seems like all you thought Soraka as was a healer when she was much more than that to many players, myself included. She may have had two heals, but there was so much more to her kit that made her more than just the archetypal healer, she was a full mage. With the way you're using the word \"healer\" so often, though, it makes me scared that any changes you make are going to shoehorn her as a support and as a pure healer with little damage upside. Don't get my wrong, I love supporting, I main it, but in a game such as this, designing a character so it can only fit one role is just daft. One of the great things about this game is that it encourages creativity, but with Soraka it seems like you want to keep that down and leave her as only a support.\n\nOne of the things that has added to this fear comes from the recent patch notes.\n> In our zeal to reduce solo lane Soraka's obnoxiousness, we kicked her a little too hard in the shins. These changes may not get her up to par, but we're committed to *supporting* her beyond these buffs.\n\nThe emphasis on \"supporting\" is in the patch notes. This seems like you're trying subtly/not so subtly say that Soraka is a support and nothing else. Am I reading too far into this? Is this really what you mean? Or is Pwyff being a dick and making us worry over nothing? \n\nI guess what I'm asking is, please, please let Soraka still work in solo lanes. Please let her still be viable in the jungle.

That is what Soraka will become if we can solve it. \n\nShe won't ONLY heal, but that would be her key strategic and differentiation factor. This is because we have to choose what strengths and weaknesses, which gives her an identity.

I agree. She removes/reduces counterplay while having very little real decision making in lane. However, I'm not sure that the nerfs did this correctly and I think it's disingenuous to bring up winrate while also holding the position that winrate means little without context. In this case, the context is \"people don't know how to deal with her\", and the correct nerfs would have (in my opinion) been a reduction in her early safety. That way, the play of \"ask for ganks, all-in when her heals/escapes are down\" would be rather obvious. Nerfs to movement speed, base health regen, base mana regen, and Q's cooldown would have been solid. The E nerf was also fine, imo.\n\n2) Yes, Soraka is getting a rework, but so is Nidalee.

It is kinda ridiculous how she can just spam q and it requires no skill on the players part.  I would suggest something similar to{{champion:45}} ability. I don't know what its called but I think you know what I mean. Just lets starcall be a meteor like ability that lands after .5 seconds. And possibly have it also heal, that would be intresting right? You can either use it to heal your teammates or hurt enemy champs or help push lane. But I can also see this possibly being used to deny creep kill to a point of raging. So how about after the meteor lands leave little rocks that can be picked up and give a bonus health regen (possibly 5%?) and picking up more would just reset the health regen rate (possibly even the enemy could pick it up to heal as well). I Don't know but it's her Q  as it is right now that is causing so much fuss.","replies":[]}]}
