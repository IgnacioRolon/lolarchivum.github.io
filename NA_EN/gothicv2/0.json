Just how {{champion:412}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:412}}{{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}}   is like. (Shen isnt a support but he is played as a support and can do a good job.)\n\nThresh is such a perfect example. He looks cool, he is cool, he sounds cool, his kit is epic, and he gets a well deserved recognition when plays happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Banbutsu Sozo","date":"2018-02-28T21:56:57.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are all the full enchanters female?","replies":[{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2018-02-28T22:42:05.365+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:44}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3174}} He'll enchant you all night long.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-02-28T22:44:13.788+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:427}}{{champion:432}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Tokogawaruf","date":"2018-03-01T00:57:25.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:26}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Banbutsu Sozo","date":"2018-02-28T23:07:56.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah good points.

With all the changes to vision systems (Sightstone active moved to support quests, Tracker's Knife removal... etc.) it's progressively getting harder and harder to get vision down in your average YoloQ game... \n\nSometimes i truly don't understand Riot's stance on the vision game","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2018-03-01T15:30:28.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get the Tracker's Knife removal either. The Sightstone quest thing on its own is fine, but combined with this removal and we're heading back to supports being the only ones who ward, which is what they were moving away from way back during the big ward changes. Only this time it's worse because a support can't light up the whole map with only 4 wards.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-01T01:07:29.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GothicV2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XMgBcTM5,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-02-28T21:38:21.278+0000)\n>\n> It&amp;#039;s obvious, it&amp;#039;s been a while since we got a support.\n\nFirst of all this is extremely presumptuous. You are essentially begging the question, and claiming the absence of something is evidence of that something being done. This just rubbed me the wrong way, and it needed to be called out.\n\n> I hope that this new support doesn&amp;#039;t have a basic kit like  {{champion:89}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:223}} \n\nhttp://s2.quickmeme.com/img/3b/3bc13f1858415cbb2317657f61b69115e82cedcd2b5c0936e5cc6720d4aba641.jpg\n\nTahm Kench is far from basic. Leona must balance between diving targets and peeling for her teammates. And Blitzcrank, while definitely having most of his power in one ability, has been re-designed to make him more complex.\n\n---\n\nI don't have issue with the rest of what you said, they're your opinions and you are entitled to them.
