Back then terms like Off Tank and Bruiser were common, where as now things seem a bit jumbled.  There are a lot of players on the Boards who don&#039;t even know what an Off Tank is.\r\n\r\nSo when the Juggernaut update came around  I didn&#039;t really know what to think.  I&#039;ve played Bruisers since I started, but now the term Juggernaut has been thrown in and covers part of what Bruisers are.  With the Classes &amp; Subclasses blog showing that some fighters are being moved into the Assassin category it got me thinking about what exactly my champion pool consists of.\r\n\r\nAnd that lead me to the following question; why Juggernaut?  It&#039;s unquestionably applicable to the type of champion it refers to, but there are other terms around that also fit those champions just as well.  Why the new term, rather than reuse and older term like Bruiser to describe the fighter/tanks?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-19T18:29:24.118+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"We wanted to avoid terms that had been previously used in really unclear ways like bruiser, brawler and off-tank.

Assassins are now a subclass of Slayers along with Skirmishers (with {{champion:114}} and {{champion:157}} as skirmishers even though they (or just {{champion:114}}) were primary fighters).  Does this mean that you'll be renaming primary assassins and some fighters (like {{champion:41}}) as primary slayers?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woook3r","date":"2016-04-19T18:37:16.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you guys going to update the champion pages to reflect this?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alüe","date":"2016-04-19T18:57:17.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You guys have mentioned that some champions fall under subclasses, such as lux was listed as a burst mage.

They both build the same way, they both fight the same way, but they are not as slow as juggernauts. Riven has to go in this category anyways. I'd be all for them just putting the Skirmisher tag under fighters and making assassin its own category. \n\nShen is apparently now a defensive tank when he has been nothing but an offensive tank the history of his entire existent. Here in lies the problem with the tank class having two sub categories is the fact the class is completely universal in how it plays. Doesn't matter how you want to label them because their cc is used both ways almost every single game. I will say braum fits the warden tag but he is still capable of making the action happen.\n\nTop lane used to consist of three classes: Tank, Bruiser (think not slow juggernaut), fighter. Now you are going to have Vanguards, Wardens, Juggernauts, Skirmishers, Divers, and the occasional battle mage.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-04-19T21:48:08.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For you, Yasuo and Fiora build the same way as Vi and Xin build the same way?
