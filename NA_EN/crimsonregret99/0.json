I have contacted tech support but they don't know how long the fix will take.\r\nHopefully a new Patch will fix this has it has only happened recently and I have been playing Yasuo for a long time with no problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiphess","date":"2015-01-03T18:34:21.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solution here (Found it with the tech support) : \n\nNavigate to the following directory: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete both the game.cfg and input.ini files.
