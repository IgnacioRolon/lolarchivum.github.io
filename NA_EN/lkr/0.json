When will be appear the Neo Pax Sivir skin here?: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins\r\n\r\n2. In the client (collection section) why written for Neo Pax Sivir skin MYTHIC? Its a LIMITED skin, no? I cant crafting anymore this skin.\r\n\r\nThx for answer!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T03:51:12.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe any of the Mythic skins are listed on that page, since they aren't considered Legacy or Limited. Neo Pax Sivir IS a little unique however, considering she's not available anymore. It was meant to be a way of allowing players who couldn't attend PAX a chance at the skin without having to upset the special uniqueness around the normal PAX Sivir.\n\nTLDR; Neo Pax Sivir is a Mythic skin (she was obtainable by gemstones) but is slightly limited since she's no longer around. I'm not sure if she will ever be brought back to crafting or not at this point in time.","replies":[]}]}
