Getting a lower queue isn't fun, so I recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this, and a custom game for testing.  Once you know you're in the clear, you can clear out those games.","replies":[{"poster":"AzureDarkNESS","date":"2017-08-18T18:18:17.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean i think its pretty stupid that you should even get them, because i literally just got out of a ranked before that game were i had the problem loading in. My game went so smoothly too. But then out of no where it said I couldnt connect multiple times even after i would try to fix it..

Queuing up for another matchmade with an unstable connection like this is only going to escalate [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) and degrade your rank.
