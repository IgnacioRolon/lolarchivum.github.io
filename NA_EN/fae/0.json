It has been since your last update to the client. I go through champ select fine. Load game fine. After the game starts, and I have bought items and start moving around, I get a pop up  from windows that states the client is no longer work. This closes the game client, but the background client is still active and I am able to reconnect. The duration for this event to proc varies but is under 1 minute consistently. This is frustrating and leads to me being in poor places when it occurs and vulnerable to attacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T17:05:05.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there is something that's causing the game to not render properly.
