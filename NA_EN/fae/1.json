VETERAN USER.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As of yesterday, I have been unable to play league of legends. When I opened the client at first, I was met with a message telling me I was not online and would have to be online to play. This was a common issue from users yesterday. Stupidly, I didn't listen to my friend and instead tried by switching regions. This is where the real issue started. Once switching from NA server to the Oceania server to try to fix this issue, the Oceania server NEVER loaded. Thus causing me to have to uninstall league completely because every time I opened the client, I was stuck on the downloading new region screen. For an hour max I waited for this to fix itself, but it didn't. Now with the biggest issue, once installing league I am now struck with a RADS error when trying to install the client. PLEASE help me. This is frustrating and I've never had so many issues with a game client like I have with league.","replies":[{"poster":"ŁυΚª    ˆˆ","date":"2017-06-19T17:24:28.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.\n\nAfter seeing the \"You are not online\" message i tried to switch to a different region, and like you the update never started (left my computer for a couple of hours and it had not started when I came back)\n\nSince then I also uninstalled league and I can't reinstall it as I am getting this frustrating RADS error..\n\nTried everything with no results, and my ticket had been answered with only an automated message with basic FAQ support and asked me to send them some logs which I did and still waiting for a helpful reply.\n\nPlease sort us out!","replies":[{"poster":"ŁυΚª    ˆˆ","date":"2017-06-19T17:36:42.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so i got the solution: \n\n\"Just did the following from antorher forum:\nFix'd!\n\nfor anyone getting the same issue;\n\ngo to your C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers\\etc\n\nopen the 'hosts' file in a noteblock\nDelete everything on the bottom (things with IP's)\nsave it\nstart LoL\n\nI can install league now, dont know how it will go further\"\n\n\nFrom an other post, i don't know why Riot support can't seem to be able to tell us this and copy past this to all their tickets.\nWhatever","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aerolus","date":"2017-06-19T04:04:13.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DUDE I had the exact same problem as you did and I also changed servers, realize i fucked up, tried to uninstall and reinstall and now am having this RADS error.

Now that you've gotten the client switched to the OCE server, that RADS error is a pretty good sign that your OS is blocking League from opening correctly. With that being the case, you should be able to get that RADS error to go away by updating your [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fae","date":"2017-06-18T20:18:10.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
