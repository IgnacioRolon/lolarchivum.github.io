Of course these were indirect buffs similar to how Yasuo and Tryndamere both benefit greatly from Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust but I&#039;m shocked barely anyone has complained about her yet. The one time I fought her she basically made her ADC immortal throughout the laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Iris Watson","date":"2015-11-15T00:15:00.640+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're quite late.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kal Vas Flam","date":"2015-11-15T00:52:54.168+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sustain supports did seem to get a buff this preseason, and that's OK with me, even as someone who's not really a big sustain support player.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-11-15T01:48:51.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All Sustain Supports got buffed but I think Soraka got buffed the most by far.

There's no point in trying to poke a soraka lane. Meanwhile, a soraka lane doesn't have much kill potential unless you make the mistake of all-inning her ADC, since she lacks lockdown. All you can do is farm up and hope you're better at last hitting than the other dude, and that maybe your jungler comes to gank before theirs does. \n\nSoraka is a champ that should always be kept intentionally weak, because when she's strong it just results in stagnation in the bot lane.","replies":[]}]}]}
