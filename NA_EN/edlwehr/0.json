Anyone else having same issue since new update?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T16:25:34.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be happening for a few reasons, that include third party programs not interacting well with league or a corrupt config folder.  As a first step, disable any apps you might be running like play.tv.  If the issue persists, resetting your config to default should help:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHopefully, that will get things fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"edlwehr","date":"2016-10-09T06:13:51.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i tried this and it didn't work. I even deleted the game and reloaded the entire thing. Still same problem. Rune pages and Item sets cannot be changed. This is really frustrating as I have a new character i want to play but can't get runes to work. Not sure what else to do.","replies":[]}]}]}
