Similarly Blood Stone Taric was framed in a castlevania/gothic kind of setting.\n\nIf they did comprise some unique world where magic is drawn from crystal power a'la Tekkaman Blade, what would that world be and what is the significance of the different crystals?","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-04-21T15:00:56.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense, but I never would've connected Emerald Taric to the Elderwood world.\n\nIn my view, maybe the gem world is more of a kingdom? Maybe two? Ashe could lead one, and use her gem to protect others, while Lissandra could be another queen or witch who uses blood stone (could be a living, parasitic stone, or made out of blood) to cover the kingdom or world in it. Blight Crystal could be a parasitic stone that corrupted Varus into trying to cover the world in that brand of crystal.\n\nHave you thought about expanding the Arctic Ops skins?

There's so many projects at Riot we do our best to align on things but at the end of the day we have to trust everyone is working towards the same goals. So as I said, Elderwood _adjacent_ which is actually cool because it suggests that the Elderwood exists in a bigger world, a world that might have multiple woods (I'm thinking of Blackthorn Morgana) and perhaps even [crystal castles](https://youtu.be/zl0kc1EQ1js).\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts about it, I think there's something really cool there.\n\nEvery year I pitch some arctic ops concepts, so I think one of these days it'll be time to give Varus some backup. It's definitely a cool theme. I actually worked on the concept for Yellow Jacket Shen when Shen had his update as luck would have it, I tried to add a wasp motif and the subsequent splash sort of depicts him in command of a **swarm** of ninjas. While I know this wasn't originally part of the design (a design which I loved) we decided there needed to be something _original_ added to the old recolour.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-04-21T14:14:01.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Combine:\nhttps://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/b/bf/New_MC_Banner.png/revision/latest?cb=20160910182705\nwith:\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/5/5e/Amethyst_Princess_of_Gemworld_4.jpg\nAnd you will have a solid gold thematic world to operate in.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-04-22T02:06:18.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget the [secret ingredient](http://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/flashbakrocklord2.jpg).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2017-04-20T17:25:37.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we should get get the voice actor for kled back and have them do a Don Quixote themed VO, that would be awesome.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-04-20T18:28:34.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=desertcroc,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=VuxK7ybZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-04-19T18:53:24.812+0000)\n>\n> Kinda like how poppy has Noxus poppy?\n\nI don't think Noxian Poppy really delivers on that theme at all, she just has Juggalo facepaint, black armor, and black hair.
