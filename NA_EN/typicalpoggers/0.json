Each time that I try I get the immediate message telling me that I am unable to connect to the login queue. I have tried every one of the few recommended fixes, including re-syncing my clock, changing regions, checking firewall, dns, antivirus programs, and everything listed in riot's guide. The problem began with the retiring of the legacy client, for weeks I had used that to play league, although not without its own issues. With the legacy client I was able to login In, but never able to connect to the chat servers. So no inviting friends and no chatting with them either. Even at this point I was not able to login to the beta client, and now with beta being the only option, I am, as you would say \"screwed\". If anyone could help me I would be very appreciative, I have tried using the hextech repair and reinstalling, all to no avail.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-13T18:04:33.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network settings are off, so now you're unable to prevent to either the login queue probably pvp.net as well.
