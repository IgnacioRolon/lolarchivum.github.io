We have a[ pinned thread ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/uxE7avEp-622-connection-issues-on-eu)about it here, but we don't have control over ISPs especially those that aren't on the peering network.  As an alternative step, try the Configure DNS step in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to see if re-routing might help or using a VPN.  \n\nYou can also get us a better overview of where the hiccups are coming from by downloading [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and routing to 31.186.224.42.\n\nHopefully that might help in the meantime.\n\n\n**Update**:  It looks like Eambo [made a post ](https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements-en/9aupEmoP-23-06-17-issues-with-bulgaria-and-surrounding-regions)on this over at the EU Boards.
