It seems to me that op.gg is completely wrong with my MMR.\n\nI had a long (6 game) lose streak due to a mix of bad play and inting Teemo adcs and my MMR tanked to bronze 3 or 4. I demoted from silver to bronze. However, I started winning again and went on a 3 game winstreak followed by a 6 game winstreak which included 2 S grades. I gained 12-13lp per game, and I still managed to climb to 100 LP and won my promos so I&#039;m in silver 4 now.\n\nHowever, even after my 6 game winstreak, I am still gaining 13 LP per game, signifying I have very low MMR even though my op.gg says that my MMR is high: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=xMiliana. (I do not know how much LP I am losing because the only games I&#039;ve recently lost were when I was at 0LP silver 4) Can someone explain what&#039;s happening here? I&#039;m really confused.","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2018-12-11T07:13:59.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Miliana.\n\nCurrently, there are some bugs with the recently released Ranking system that may be affecting LP gain/loss. You can view the bugs and their updates through this [post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/8j7wEnk7-ranked-changes-week-one-update-known-issues) by SapMagic. Keep in mind that MMR shown on third-party sites like op.gg are not as accurate as they seem. Riot has never allowed a way for third-parties to get access to that information so the rating shown on these sites are estimated based solely on gameplay and should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you continue to win games and rank up, but still only gaining 13 LP, you are definitely being affected by the bug, and in this case, you will have to wait until the bug is fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"xMiliana","date":"2018-12-11T13:34:57.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you take a look at my op.gg stats (the KDA, vision score, damage done, etc) and can you tell if I'm doing well enough to raise my MMR or if I'm still playing like a lower elo?","replies":[{"poster":"Wendy MarveI","date":"2018-12-13T06:56:31.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xMiliana,realm=NA,application-id=okOuNvuT,discussion-id=gbzirRGI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-12-11T13:34:57.016+0000)\n>\n> Could you take a look at my op.gg stats (the KDA, vision score, damage done, etc) and can you tell if I&#x27;m doing well enough to raise my MMR or if I&#x27;m still playing like a lower elo?\n\nThe game seems to be putting newbs like me immediately in iron without remorse or leeway.  You're still better than me, but my guess is the game is pairing you with people who got ranked way lower than they should be and the game now thinks you're a lower mmr than you were last season even if this op.gg disagrees.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
