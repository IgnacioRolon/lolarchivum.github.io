Is there a way to enforce having an afk on your team without penalizing the whole team. If that player does not re-connect by the end of the game I feel as if we should not be forced suffer even more after dealing with a 4v5 in a 20 minute game. Just thought I would ask if anyone else thinks about this or if I am just being stupid and should get over it.","replies":[]}
