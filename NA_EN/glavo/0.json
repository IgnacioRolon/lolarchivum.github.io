I got fed off of their enemy fizz, started snowballing until my entire team died at rift hearld pit. I snuck up behind them and got a 5 man ult, 4 of them died and one managed to escape with flash. I pushed up mid lane and saw my pentakill waiting for me under the tower. I got the delayed pentakill, and their riven said through all chat that I was fed, to which I replied to, and instead of saying Zero Esper (Yasuo) next to my response, it said Zero Esper (Seal) for that one chat in the message. I do not have a screen shot of this, since I didn&#039;t know how to take a screen shot on my computer.  However, if there is any way to read through the chat log of my most recent Yasuo game, I recommend looking at it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-05-18T06:39:09.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was there a Lulu on the enemy team? If so, that may be why. When Lulu polymorphes a champion, and that player says something in chat while polymorphed, the champion name will be replaced with whatever they were transformed into (different for each skin). So maybe you responded to what the Riven said while you were ploymorphed by Lulu.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-20T20:34:13.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!
