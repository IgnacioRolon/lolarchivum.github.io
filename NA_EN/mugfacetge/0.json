This is exasperated by the fact that the jungle does not give as much gold as a lane, so his build comes out much slower than a laner's.\n\nBut once Skarner gets 6 items, he's unstoppable. He's a much better late game Juggernaut than most, better than Darius, better than Illaoi, brings the damage of both while being more durable, faster, and having more utility, but it relies entirely on him getting 6 items.

I love Skarner, he's my favorite champion and I play him all the time, and it is imperative to build Trinity Force before Cinderhulk. If you rush Cinderhulk, you're a poor man's tank who has no damage. Trinity Force gives you the damage you need to do what you need to do.\n\nAnd nerfing his early game would make that rush significantly more difficult, since Trinity Force is a very expensive item and the jungle is not a lucrative source of gold.\n\nSkarner needs a buff to his mid-game more than anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"MugfaceTGE","date":"2017-08-10T18:22:14.433+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol sorry  I meant buff his early game .","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-08-10T18:23:38.482+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buffing his early defenses (Mostly Armor, maybe HP too) would go a long way in letting him actually duel with enemies.

Let me give a quick take on his current state. \n\nOverall Skarner right now is indeed very balanced and strong statistically, for mains and even newer players. Which is amazing as newer players might not optimise Skarner's kit. For anyone who is new to Skarner, a couple optimisations are as such:\n\n* Q before autoattacking to get it off cooldown quicker.\n\n* Try to not only flash ult, it behooves you to tag the enemy with E first (then maybe wait 1-2 seconds max), ult them back towards the team, flip them around at the last second to gain extra range, then autoattack after ult wears off (and E is still on them) to proc the stun a second time (2.75 seconds of stun/suppress). \n\n* Itemise heavy/max CDR. After the circumstance described above, the E is coming back up and you can tag them again from close range and stun yet again for 3.75 seconds total CC within the space of ~5 seconds. \n\nNeedless to be said, I of course I hate the spires mini-game as compared to his previous Q which gave him stacking movespeed and attackspeed ala Udyr, which lets him choose the terms of engagement. The power being shifted to 6 zones that can be taken away is very frustrating, but all together the changes have Skarner in a very very good place. IMO his damage oriented builds with warrior into trinity scales much better, and he can health stack for a significantly better shield on W. \n\nHowever, he must hit his E and ideally build trinity or some real semblance of damage (warrior into trinity seems the choice for diamond/master Skarner mains). Iceborn is just not worth it and only for cases when the enemy is full AD and you will stack it with randuins and tabis etc. If you can't afford to build trinity 1st or 2nd item and need durability, buy sheen early and sit on that. I personally like to go black cleaver, which gives more oomph to his Q and R when compared to trinity's 25 AD. It also benefits my ADC in cases where we have no other black cleaver user. It has it's uses and I think it's worth consideration, especially since it gives you more HP and the same amount of CDR as trinity while being 700 gold cheaper.\n\nSkarner is weakest in early game like you said, and scales really well into late game as both a damage dealer and damage absorber.

A greater shift towards resistances, the sustained buffing of defensive items, and the introduction/buffing of specific items that help Skarner overcome his weaknesses have generally improved him, if only slightly.\n\nAlso, \"worst state he's ever been in\"? Come on dude. Do you remember the early days of season 3, when he was a 46% winrate urgot-level meme champion? Do you remember how bad the first rework was, and how he had to get buffed twice only to get reworked again literally 6 patches later? He's actually viable now, which we couldn't even say back then. Hell, beyond that, he's competitive, which almost no other champions in his class can say. Or to be more accurate, he would be competitive if he had anything unique that made him worth playing, but Riot decided that \"generic\" would be his defining design trait in the third rework, so he doesn't.\n\n>Stronger then average?! Compared to what bruiser/tank? \n\nWell, he's the only immobile bruiser to see any professional play, and he strikes a better winrate, so pretty much most of them. That's what \"stronger than average\" means. He's not beating out a Maokai or other S-tier picks, but he's more than holding his own against everyone else.\n\n> Boring is subjective so to each his own, \n\nOne way to tell a champion is boring is when they feel weak and pitiful despite outperforming other champions. That's a marker of really, really unsatisfying gameplay, and it's a great reason to petition Riot to hurry up and start working on the inevitable fourth rework.\n\nHe needs a full gameplay update. He's in a balanced state, so Riot isn't going to touch him until they get time to work on that, and they've already said that a lot of other champions are ahead of him in line.

Sure he can duel everyone and their mother in his spires, *when he's in his spires.*\n\nSure he can become a late game monster with items, *if he reaches late game.*\n\nIts the same discomfort players have with kindred, their system is hit or miss and like skarner he's a hit or miss champion where you either feel like there's nothing you can do or you feel in complete control of the game. Kindred feels great to play!... with marks.. if you get them and the enemy jungler isn't an asshole from your perspective, but in reality they're just good and you lose comfort in your draft decision. \n\nSkarner same issue.. dueling the enemy is great in your spires but that's if they're not in complete control of the map with better ganks/counter ganks and have your spires and camps with them.

He's an immobile bruiser with no interesting unique mechanics. He won't be popular unless he's the strongest thing in the game. He's not, so he's unpopular. Above average is just ignorable for Skarner.\n\nWe have and have had plenty of champions who are strong, but still have very low playrates. This can be due to a niche audience, or just boring, insipid champion design. Skarner is the latter. If you want an example of the former, check out Aurelion Sol.\n\n>The issue is on rift, skarner is just super unreliable and there is no reason to pick the champion even when he is strong.\n\nYou have the right idea, but this isn't really the right wording. Skarner's problem isn't unreliability. He has very reliable outcomes, particularly since Skarners play expecting to never get use out of their shrines. His problem is a lack of agency and control. You get very reliable outcomes, but those outcomes are limited by Skarner's immobility combined with his need to stick to enemies makes him frustrating. There is very little that makes Skarner.\n\nYou even express this very well with this quote \"their system is hit or miss and like skarner he's a hit or miss champion where you either feel like there's nothing you can do or you feel in complete control of the game.\" This isn't unreliability. It's a lack of agency. Skarner doesn't get influence over whether he succeeds or not. Either the enemy has high mobility kiting heroes with peel and fuck Skarner, or they don't and he can fight. Either Skarner's enemies are stupid enough to fight in the spires, or he never uses them. Skarner doesn't choose. Skarner is just along for the ride, because nothing in his kit gives him influence over the game or any way to alter his play. \n\nEven though the average of these outcomes comes out to \"above-average\" in strength, people don't like it because they don't feel they're making choices with Skarner. Everything that happens with Skarner is very reliable, and very little of what you do as a player influences it. That's why his design is so terrible.\n\n>Evidence by the trinity force update last season where skarner was actually sleeper op but still hecarim made him unviable.\n\nHecarim didn't affect Skarner's viability at all. Skarner was perfectly viable. Hell, he's pretty much just better than Hecarim right now. The reason don't play Skarner and won't play Skarner is that Skarner is so boring that you'd rather be doing something else with your time. Whenever Skarner isn't so good that he's a must-play, he'll be unpopular.\n\n>Personally I'd just like if riot added spires in better locations \n\nI very strongly disagree. I don't want Riot to waste more time on small reworks that don't accomplish anything. They've been doing that since season 4, and it needs to stop. They could implement your proposed changes today, and by next patch he'd be the least-played champion in the game again. Nothing would be accomplished, because the spires are boring, the reward they give is a boring way to implement a reward, and the rest of his kit is boring around them.\n\nHe needs a full rework. He needs the spires scrapped. He needs his Q to have a reason to exist beyond effectively being a damage aura that procs triforce. He needs his E reworked, because there is no reason why an immobile bruiser should have 100% of his success tied up into hitting a linear pass-through skillshot. That's the most generic mechanic in the game. They need to decide whether they want to really design his kit around his ultimate, or if they want him functional outside of it. He needs something that actually makes him interesting to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Funkin Dunkin","date":"2017-08-11T13:49:34.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I don't feel like Skarner is a jungle fighter anymore.

I have 1,6 milion maestry on him, reached Master tier eune in the jungle and D3 or D4 EUW on toplane, so i think you can trust me. \nI gave up with this useless champion and i think people who says that he is strong have never reached higher division than platinum, because skarner is really good champion to diamond. But since diamond he has really big problems and i would say he is useless and it's almost impossible to reach master euw on skarner [ except the beggining of the season]\nOfc i hope i am wrong and maybe one day a simple guy will reach master on him. \nHe has the most useless passive in the game beause he hardly never fights on the spires, he is slow 335MS and offers super low damage in early game. For example morde is very slow, but offers a good damage. ,Skarner has a super boring Q aka sheen machine, poor ganks [same problem like old warwick], bugged E and i can give you more reasons why u should play this champion in  the high elo, but u can just read my previous posts about him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDonar","date":"2017-08-11T19:03:48.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner always feels OP to be because I see him about once ever 6 months and forget every ability he has. \n\nBy his underplayed nature alone, I'd agree he needs 'something' (buff, adjustment, rework etc) to get more people interested in trying him out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-08-10T22:03:51.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limeheart XI","date":"2017-08-10T21:14:05.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[](http://imgur.com/a/gzP0C)","replies":[]},{"poster":"J5Cld2hgRx","date":"2017-08-11T00:17:47.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"ur waifu dont need buff","replies":[]}]}
