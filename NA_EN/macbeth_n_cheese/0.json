My comp is more than good enough to run the game and I've never before had any frame rate issues besides for 1/2 of a second when I turn on DJ Sona music at the start of a game.\r\n\r\nToday, my first time playing since 6.15, I've been having issues several times each game with sudden frame rate stuttering that lasts for a second or two. Like, the game's running perfectly fine for a minute, then two seconds of stuttering, then back to perfectly fine again.\r\n\r\nI tried restarting my computer, and I don't have any unusual programs running in the background. Any idea how to tell if this is a me issue or a game issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-30T16:33:46.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be an issue with your drivers or game files that's causing the game to not render properly, and cause this stuttering.
