Perhaps this means that you don't actually get banned for chatting by itself but rather using chat to abuse, bully and/or harass other players instead.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-02T21:32:34.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I never raged in all chat.\n\nYou just raged in team chat.

I&#x27;ve seen much much much worse.\n\nThe question is whether it is *punishment* worthy, not *perma-ban* worthy. Few behaviors earn an immediate permanent ban, but *all* toxicity *can* earn a permanent ban if you haven't shown proper reform after going through the escalating punishment tiers.\n\nSo let's see if it is punishment worthy.\n\n> befatal: ur bad\n> befatal: u must b a marshmellow\n> befatal: ur soft af\n> befatal: this janna\n> befatal: threw so hard\n> befatal: janna cancer\n> befatal: IM TRYING TO WIN\n> befatal: AND THIS JANNA THROWING\n> befatal: lol stfu toxic\n> befatal: u did stupid shit\n> befatal: 4 times in a row\n> befatal: when ur the one doing stupid shit\n\nThe above is all problematic, and I've even given you the benefit of the doubt and removed a lot of unnecessary complaining, belittling, score-shaming, etc.\n\nThis is definitely a valid punishment and, if you recently had a 14-day ban, a valid perma-ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sett a trap","date":"2018-06-02T22:36:56.889+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I suspect OP has been on numerous chat bans and at least one 14 day ban.

This game has gotten progressively worse, this patch did me in, I am done and leaving for good.\n\nAlso, you shouldn't have bothered making a post, people that play this game and Riot basically treat permabanned people as second rate human beings because they all believe it is \"righteous and correct\" they also being, at least from what I see and have always read, it is \"deserved and leave already\". Do yourself a favor, this game isn't worth the heart rate increase, it isn't worth the problems it may cause on your own mental health.

I'd also like to point out for your restrictions Riot does not really give recommendations on how to deal with your frustrations or anger, or good outlets to deal with it after a hard defeat for you. Riot doesn't care about \"dickheads\" in this game and has shown they actually do not want to deal with people with mental problems.
