Make it so allied turrets can&#039;t be attacked for the 3 seconds, same as it&#039;s active duration now, and have the same lockout so it can&#039;t be stacked etc. Feels like it would make sense without really being broken.\r\n\r\nI was just thinking of this the other day. If you&#039;re ahead and diving, it&#039;s a great item, but what happens if someone screws up and now you gotta def for a while? It&#039;s basically a wasted slot without its active. Just a thought *-shrugs-*","replies":[{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2017-08-29T17:14:38.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"could make it work kinda like the old Summoner Spell **_Garrison_**:\nenemy tower cannot attack for X seconds.\nallied tower gains health/shield and deals AOE damage for X seconds.\n\n\nOR\nwe could just give the Azir passive.\nCreate a temporary tower on top of a dead one?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2017-08-28T20:12:18.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that the only time I ever have enough gold to make it is later in the game, and by then, turrets aren't quite as scary any more. And it's a support item from my POV, but there are far higher priorities over it and the stats it offers.\n\nIn my personal opinion, I would increase the cooldown (maybe to five minutes at the very vey most) and make it cheaper so it can actually be viable item when it's actually needed. If that would make it too powerful by making the towers too vulnerable, then maybe rework it so it instead puts the towers in stasis. In which case, it could even put your own in stasis too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-08-28T18:37:48.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea too, though I can see the problem with it in this situation.  Are you winning lane and need to dive?  Build an Ohmwrecker.  Are you losing and need to defend at turret?  Build and Ohmwrecker.  It would drop the item into that weird spot of being a good item, regardless of your situation and as far as I can tell Riot want to avoid making items that fit that generalist nature.  \n\nPerhaps making the item more interesting to activate?  What might be interesting to see on it?  I would not mind seeing the active that becomes a channel effect that disables nearby turrets that would be disrupted by incoming damage or player input with a 1:30 minute cool down or so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sleeperbat","date":"2017-08-28T18:16:05.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very interesting, I like it.","replies":[]}]}
