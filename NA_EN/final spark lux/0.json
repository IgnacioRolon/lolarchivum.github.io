If you take the time to read through some threads, you'll notice the majority of them are all saying the SAME exact things, and there have been multiple responses to these threads from reds. They aren't going to take the time to respond to hundreds of threads that say the same thing when they're already working on that problem, and have stated such in another similar thread. They will however take the time to help when a new problem (like mine) crops up, regardless what it's about. It just so happened to be about buying RP, but that doesn't influence if they reply or not. Also, I hardly consider 1 (same question to one other person from the same red) reply to be \"the most riot response\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hectik Deka","date":"2016-11-17T02:22:11.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had the same issue and all I did was restart my client.

You can launch the old client with the new one at the login screen. it says \"Launch legacy client\" with a yellow/gold'ish color.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nZalmez","replies":[]},{"poster":"unwelcomediet","date":"2016-11-19T22:22:11.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having problems with buying RP, im on the Eu nordic server","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProjectDue2Moro","date":"2016-11-18T00:41:27.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem and im on NA","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmeraldSpark6","date":"2016-11-17T00:49:53.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, same for me, really scary XD probably just spaghetti code {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zephylion","date":"2017-05-26T17:11:07.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I gave money to my friend to purchase rp for me using his credit card due to the fact that I don't have a credit card.
