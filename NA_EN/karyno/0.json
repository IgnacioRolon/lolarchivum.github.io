What I mean by that is, sometimes when you have 180+ CS, going 7/2 in mid as Zed, you might get an S-.\n\nBut if you go 180+ CS, 7/2 in Top as Zed, you might get a better grade.\n\nIn fact, because I couldn't get any S in mid as Zed, I went Top and Jungle when I was going for Mastery 6 and then 7. Jungle wasn't successful, mostly because I kept messing up my ability maxes, yet toplane was extremely successful for Mastery 6. But Mastery 7 was more difficult, and I think I only got one S from Top, and the others were from Mid after a lot of trial, error, and gitting gudder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnyperWulff","date":"2018-03-26T01:43:06.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For csing, at 20 minutes for example, you need to have like 180 to 190 CS, help with objectives more. Baron, towers, inhibit, drags etc. Your KDA doesn't mean as much, but if you can get more kills and assists, and like 1 or 2 deaths it will help boost it up. \n\nAlso ward, warding is important. You need to be warding with stealth trinkets every chance you can, and buying Control wards nearly every back to lay down. Taking out enemy wards helps contribute as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2018-03-26T01:42:45.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Choose Master Yi, Yasuo, Zed... If this game's mastery system has taught me anything, it's that this player base overwhelmingly goes for the low-hanging fruit. Those (and a couple other) champions have an overwhelmingly higher M7 rate than any other champion in the game. If it's accolades you're after, rolling out with one of those seems like a statistically good bet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-26T01:08:59.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get less awful CS, ward more in places that matter, contribute to turrets/dragon.\n\nKDA seems to have little to do with your final score, and 3 assists kind of suggests you mostly did your own thing while your team won.\n\nYou never touched dragon/inhibs, barely warded, and got most of your kills early game or in jungle.","replies":[]}]}
