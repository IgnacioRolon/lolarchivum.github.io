I actually max this first against heavy pushers mid. I feel W is in the right place, but it is due to E that it feels a lot weaker.\r\n\r\n**E - Event Horizon:** I am not sure how I truly feel about this ability. I miss being able to catch and stun people with accuracy. But the E being delayed actually works very nicely as zoning tool so you can say its better for team fights and tower dives. W is hard to hit when E misses, and with new E it misses a lot by design. \r\n\r\n**R - Primordial Burst:** I really did feel the nerf in dmg after the rework especially w/o dfg. When he is fed and ahead it is very punishing and very toxic ... but then again so is Zed&#039;s, Syndra&#039;s, Annie&#039;s, Talon&#039;s, LeBlanc&#039;s, Kat&#039;s, Yasuo&#039;s, etc ultimates. Wouldn&#039;t mind some power back here.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Thoughts:**  I think what Veigar needs is more consistency. Sure in the right hands Veigar is a scaling destructive force that almost seems unbeatable at times. But people need to realize that he is weak against all AD mids and suffers in lane due to mana costs, lack of a reliable form of trading, no escapes with no mobility besides using E.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Possible Solutions?**\r\n\r\n**E and W Changes:** Make E more reliable at stunning targets. If that&#039;s not possible make W easier to land possibly with some form of interaction with E. Possible increasing the AoE of W inside of E.\r\n\r\n**Q Changes:** Make his trading more reliable by making Q have diminishing dmg but can pass through multiple monster, minions, and champions or an interesting idea where his Q after passing through/killing the first minion then successfully killing the second minion hit pops Baleful Strike out like MF&#039;s Q and prioritizes Champions dealing extra dmg.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\r\nty4reading\r\nur boy\r\nbarry bordeaux","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-09-01T07:29:10.141+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"What we're currently testing: \n\n* Q grants AP for champion assists as well as kills \n* W starts at the beginning of Veigar's cast time, not the end","replies":[{"poster":"Squidblimp","date":"2015-09-01T18:12:29.158+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are great changes Meddler!

On the other hand, Veigar sacrifices so much in terms of survivability or any means of a reliable engage/disengage in order to have the kind of reliability that  his ult does. In my experience, Veigar's ult is one of the less frustrating examples of a point and click because of how risky it is to use on a preferred target in a teamfight. If either you or Veigar are roaming and he hits you with it upon meeting each other then I can understand the frustration since there's little way to punish him from getting close to you. In teamfights however, his options for getting to the enemy AP carry (his optimal target) mostly involve landing his stun, having a path made for him by the fighters, or flash ulting and expecting to die.","replies":[{"poster":"JudasLover","date":"2015-09-01T21:14:43.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are right but you can have a nuke ability that is healthy in all possible scenarios and Primordial Burst definitely isn't one right now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WzvVgeNXs2","date":"2015-09-01T15:24:51.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was a veigar main in season 4, who quit playing veigar alltogether in season 5. I played in platinum 1/diamond 5 season 5.\n\nThe problem of veigar is his E. Q already got buffed, the damage nerf of the ult doesn't matter that much either. His E is what totally destroyed him. Veigar is extremely reliant on landing his E: both early, mid and lategame. In lower elo I guess people still walk into it, in higher elo veigar is unplayable atm. Good midlaners punish veigar for missing his stun, while hitting it is more up to your enemy than up to you. I suggest that the delay becomes shorter (0.25s at most to make it anything reliable/worth playing in higher elo).\n\nI also like to remember you of the reasoning behind changing veigar, which in my opinion still is an incredibly poor argument for changing veigar: Counterplay. Again, I feel like veigar is changed to a low elo champion because his E is unreliable and the reasoning is something lower-elo-players used aswell.\n\nThere is plenty of counterplay against veigar. Let me give you some: \nCleanse - (barely used in soloQ and never used in lower elo. Great counter to veigar. You miss having ignite which makes up for it alot)\nMerc treads - Basically means veigar it's harder to hit his W. For tanks/bruisers this means they can kill veigar quite easily because of veigars lack of escapes. VERY hard counter for tanks and bruisers. On most midlaners they are well worth it too. Gives a bit mr too.\nBanshees Veil - Great item especially for ADCs. means they can't get stunned and the HP + MR means they can't get oneshot for the biggest part of the game. Most adcs only pick it as 6th item which heavily decreases veigars chances of winning lategame. \nQSS - I prefer Banshees on ADCs, but champions like riven who build QSS can shit on veigar extremely hard. Again, punishes veigar for having only 1 defense ability.\nAbyssal sceptre - Magic resistance counter veigar pretty hard because it means he can't get early kills once he hits lvl 6/11. For midlaners like fizz, diana this means they can 1v1 veigar untill he gets alot of stacks. Good players either deny veigar's farm or get fed by killing him. \n\nThe reason I think Veigar has become a low ELO champion is because when I played in season 3 in gold, people barely built above items. In higher elo they do which already means veigar struggles against people who know how to COUNTERPLAY veigar. \n\nIm extremely pissed for 'ruining' my favorite champion while I think he was extremely balanced; based on whether or not players are willing to sacrifice some items (sorc shoes, etc.) for items that counter veigar in order to win the game. \n\nI really hope you can make his E so that veigar becomes playable again in higher elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Folonee","date":"2015-09-01T12:19:08.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Omg!
