Last 30 games have had 25 AFK players. That's not fun at all. And you guys don't do shit about it. A slap on the wrist long enough to grab a drink and some food to AFK and ruin another game. Just ban them for 30 days and watch how the number of AFKs shrink. Or continue to let them ruin games. You guys are making millions anyway so I know you don't give two shits about the user experience. But AT LEAST PRETEND to care and actually PUNISH AFK players.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-08-08T23:19:17.282+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of your past 5 games I only could spot 1 person who was noticeably afk for any decent length of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-08-09T22:30:01.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know we can check if youre lying about your games right?
