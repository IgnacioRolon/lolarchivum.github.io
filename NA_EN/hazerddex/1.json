The very few that still plays him are doing it because they have been mains of the champion for years, not because he is good or anything. His winrate constanty fluctuates between 47-53% because one day one of them can get a winning streak and win 5 games in a row, toppling the percentage by 1-2 instantly. If a champion has so few games, it's not weird for the winrate to fluctuate that much.\n\nEx: toss a coin 10 times. It would be perfectly normal that the percentage of heads is far from 50%. You can easily get 3 or 7 heads out of 10.\nNow, try tossing a coin 1000 times. This time I can assure you the heads amount will be a lot closer to 50%, probably between 450-550.\n\nHis playrate alone speaks for itself. There is simply no way that a champ that is doing good has such a small playerbase. Even ugly boring champions have huge spikes in popularity the moment they are good. Skarner rarely crosses the 1% pickrate, to the point it has become a joke. More often than not, whenever someone mentions him either here or on Reddit, you have always another guy asking sarcastically: \"Skarner? What's that? A new champion?\", because there's people that hasn't found a single Skarner in the entire Season. He has become the new Yorick/Urgot.

I read A LOT of nonsense on the subject. \n\nI don't know what Riot actually intended to do but it only looks obvious that if jungle farming does not pay in terms of exp and gold junglers are going to gank.\n\nTo go more in-depth this new jungle meta is ALL about early aggression. Pick a very strong lv3 champion that can bully the enemy jungler and apply pressure immediately. First Dragons spawns when you're level 4 and you need to take it after your first back. You need to take scuttles on respawn and you need to gank to insure the lane priority necessary to take the following dragons. \n\nThere is NO TIME TO POWER FARM, IT IS NOT A VIABLE STRATEGY, NOT BY A LONG SHOT.\n\nHaving a champion CAPABLE of farming efficiently, on the other hand is very important since you need to clear fast and invade quickly on your way to and from your main objectives in order not to fall behind.\n\nThe only ways to not fall behind in the current jungle are ganking HARD and bending the opposing jungler 90 degrees or a combination of the two.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waka FIocka","date":"2019-12-04T08:00:07.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"all i see now is {{champion:64}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-12-05T00:31:52.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You see Lee ?\n\nIronic, he can't","replies":[]},{"poster":"8 Lamar Jackson","date":"2019-12-04T17:08:23.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is because the meta has shifted to short burst games.
