Maybe she got favored by the nerf-bat for some time but I don't agree that she needs just a simple buff. The problem with Elise imo is that she lacks a clear identity. She is branded as a Mage with Fighter elements but she performs badly in both, and instead is good at being an Assassin, but even that falls off really hard starting mid game and completely at the late game.\n\nAs a Mage she can't provide anything useful to the team, because besides for the fact that her W, which is her biggest damage source in Human form (I might be wrong, correct me if I am), is useless (team fights, always) unless you choose to Spider Q to your target so he can eat up all the damage, you, a squishy mage, just jumped in the middle of the enemy team and you are going to be killed in the blink of an eye.\n\nAs a Fighter, even though you can take ***a little*** more punishment from the enemy, you'll be doing no relevant damage anyways and you'll still die fast.\n\nPlaying Elise as an Assassin, which is the most viable route to take in her current state is lackluster because of how hard she falls off starting the mid game. You'll be doing damage but your victim will nearly always escape with at least a 1/3 of their health or a little less.\n\nSo I was thinking about two ways in which Elise can find her proper identity and become stronger at the same time. Make her either a pure Mage or a pure Assassin and remove her Fighter branding because she clearly lacks in that area.\n\nAs a Mage, allow Elise to be able to Rappel (higher rank) to allied champions as well as enemy champions. This will allow her to combo someone from the enemy (while jumping on the enemy team, so there's a clear weakness here) and then get back to safety through Rappel. At higher levels Rappel's cooldown should be short, on par with other mages abilities. I think this wouldn't make Elise unbearable in lane or as a jungler as I don't think that anyone goes for leveling Cocoon first or second on her. It would just give a much needed boost to her late game.\n\nAs an Assassin, make Elise's Spider Q (on higher levels) have **refunded cooldown** on the enemy that Elise used her previous Q on **if** that enemy fell below a certain amount of health, like maybe 30% or 40%. I think that this way she will be able to properly assassinate enemies on the late game without having them escape with 1/3 of their health and have them recuperating with LifeSteal, Heals or whatever while she herself dies afterwards due to Rappel not being usable on an ally and letting her team on a 4vs5 fight. I can see how this might end up buffing up lane Elise a little bit, but jungler Elise will be unaffected, me thinks. You can test it and if it ends up being overbearing, then you can probably tone down Q on early ranks and buff it (yes, buff, as in bigger numbers than the current live values) on the higher ranks, a nice and well deserved transition from a toned down early to a strong late.\n\nSo yeah, that's about it. As a Mage, Rappel will actually play an important part on Elise's playstyle and it will give her a clear weakness, if she uses it, she is vulnerable afterwards. At the moment Rappel just serves as either a jungle escaping tool if there are are creep nearby and if the jungle is warded, of course, or as an ability to delay your inevitably getting burst by the enemy by a couple of seconds. As an Assassin she will be the current Elise, but actually viable in the late game contrary to her rather useless current state.\n\nThematically the changes would make sense as well. As in her Mage change, a deadly swift spider lady attacks her target, deals as much damage as is possible and then escapes, spiders are supposed to be slippery. Classy Elise. As in her Assassin change, she is a deadly swift spider lady but she is persistent on killing her target (Q, jumping on the target twice), because you know, big ass spiders like Elise might be persistent on killing someone no matter the consequences. Leeroy Jenkins Elise.\n\nYeah, that's about it. TL;DR is not coming, if you find a suitable TL;DR for this you are welcome to suggest it and I will add it.\n\n\"Not even the spider is safe in her web.\" (current Rappel) - {{champion:60}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-22T16:43:12.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play her as a tank and she's perfect. :p haven't used her since her buff but...

Webs, damaging you?\n\nBut really, if they would buff her Q I think she would be rather overbearing to play against. Elise's laning is not the problem, she is probably one of the best laners in the game, her mid and late game as well as her team fighting is what she needs a boost in. No matter how well you did, how much you got fed, she falls off so hard.\n\nEdit: But, if they did buff it, I can see how it would work by toning it down in early ranks and then buffing it up on late ranks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-03-23T01:26:36.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I think they should lower the mana on her q in mage form, for a skill with such low damage and high cooldown and no utility it really ought to cost half mana or have a mana return function or give her passive spellvamp on level. \n\nQuick question, were you here for her Elise?

Unless her damage was utterly obscene and/or her stun duration was even longer she will still fail as an assassin once mid game rolls around. \n\nAs an assassin she'd also have to go glass cannon since tanky assassin are insta-nerfed. Unless you want to completely alter her kit to igve her the mechanics to do this and not suck, no amount of small tweaks will ever make this an optimal strategy for Elise.\n\n\nThat said, Mage/Fighter is just fine for Elise. Her optimal plan is, and should continue to be, building some Health/Resistances and some AP. In human form she throws out ranged damage and help lock down a target and when she transforms she has some tankyness to soak damage while she jumps on and scratches people to death with her spiderlings. \n\nI think her ratios need to reflect that Elise can't go full glass cannon AP and be meaningful, a decent AP ratio on her Spider!W's on-hit heal could be good too, and if needed some tank stats applied on her ult (I think she had this when she was released) could help and gate the power to levels 6, 11, and 16.","replies":[]}]}
