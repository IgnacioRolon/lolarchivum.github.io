In fact, Cleanse not working on Malz's ult is such an unintuitive feature that at least one actual Rioter mistakenly recommended the spell as a counter to the champion, completely ignorant of the fact that suppression was, in fact, one of the very few CC types Cleanse didn't counter. As a spell that is already largely outclassed by itemization, to the point of not even being picked by CC-vulnerable champions while CC in the game is at an all-time high, Cleanse could very well use a touch-up, such as a more complete range of CC it can remove. If that can't be done, then it might be time to do away with the spell entirely, and make QSS available to more classes as a result.\n\nThis, by the way, is also one of the reasons why I think special-casing any mechanic is a terrible idea. Perhaps it might make sense as a quick fix in a very specific balancing context, where a particular set of champions, items and spells are strong and others are weaker, but once the game changes (and it always does), that \"fix\" turns into a problem instead, one that forces players to memorize more trivia just so that they don't get screwed over by some unintuitive hidden feature. Even when that special-casing existed, it still didn't make sense, because QSS was a thing too, and to this day we're seeing the negative impact of that design decision with Malzahar remaining as binary as ever. Malzahar and perhaps Skarner are the only two champions that truly get screwed over by QSS, and both are notorious for having design problems, so if generalizing Cleanse's counters hurts them, that is all the more indication that the problem lies with their kits, not with the summoner spell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-02-21T11:03:11.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If cleanse worked on malz ult, the champion would be ruined.
