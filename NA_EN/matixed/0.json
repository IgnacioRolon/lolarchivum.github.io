I don't have much time on my hands and can't play that many games.\n\n**EDIT:** Now it says in the client that they're working on missions issues so it will be hopefuly resolved soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Kittenmews","date":"2019-01-28T19:02:20.704+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"On NA same thing happening.
