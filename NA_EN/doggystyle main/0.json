Big shocker.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time I try to log in the client gets stuck at \"Authenticating\" and sometimes I'll get a message that says an unexpected error has occurred but usually it is just an endless \"Authenticating\" message. I've runWinMTR and have not been getting any packet loss and my internet has been working fine. I have reinstalled the client 3 times now to no avail. I haven't had this error until the new patch. My log ins are nearly always crisp and instant. And I have disabled my Firewall completely trying to get it to connect. Any actual solution other than pointing me to the connection issues guide that I already know exists would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\r\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\r\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n|                             192.168.1.1 -    0 |   15 |   15 |    0 |    0 |    1 |    0 |\r\n|                             72.243.58.1 -    0 |   15 |   15 |   25 |   27 |   30 |   30 |\r\n|                           209.192.1.249 -    0 |   15 |   15 |   28 |   34 |   39 |   30 |\r\n|static-207-222-35-25.earthlinkbusiness.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   33 |   36 |   44 |   34 |\r\n|static-209-178-132-189.earthlinkbusiness.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   37 |   47 |   57 |   48 |\r\n| h172.82.138.40.static.ip.windstream.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   35 |   40 |   51 |   35 |\r\n|                          169.130.169.14 -    0 |   15 |   15 |   38 |   43 |   52 |   41 |\r\n|et7-0-0-0.cr02.atln01-ga.us.windstream.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   36 |   41 |   49 |   37 |\r\n|                  atl-bb1-link.telia.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   36 |   41 |   52 |   41 |\r\n|                  dls-b21-link.telia.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   56 |   63 |   69 |   63 |\r\n|      riot-ic-315570-dls-b21.c.telia.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   85 |   91 |  103 |   93 |\r\n|                          104.160.134.35 -    0 |   15 |   15 |   79 |   87 |   92 |   86 |\r\n|          ae35-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   79 |   89 |  103 |   89 |\r\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |   15 |   15 |   77 |   80 |  103 |   78 |\r\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |   15 |   15 |   81 |   85 |  103 |   87 |\r\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\r\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"weeps","date":"2017-06-30T15:53:05.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tell me if you find a solution to this i am still unable to play","replies":[{"poster":"Doggystyle Main","date":"2017-07-01T15:38:05.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=big floppy clit,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=XyqBubzc,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-06-30T15:53:05.349+0000)\n>\n> tell me if you find a solution to this i am still unable to play\n\nI was able to fix this by using a VPN.
