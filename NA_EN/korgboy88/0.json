While I&#039;m taking a break from ranked for a while to wait out whatever this meta is currently, I&#039;ve been playing a lot of normals. My last handful of matchups:\r\n\r\nMy bot lane: S3/G3 Their bot lane: P5/P2\r\nMy bot lane: S3/unranked Their bot lane: G2/D5\r\nMy bot lane: S3/B2 Their bot lane: G5/G2 (Their team also had a diamond 5 top laner)\r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s my question: Why the mismatched? And before you start flaming me, yes I know it&#039;s normals, and yes, I know you get better by playing against better people. My response: It&#039;s still tilting, and middle school level baseball players don&#039;t face college/minor league/major league level pitching in order to &quot;get better&quot;\r\n\r\nHas Riot recently changed matchmaking?","replies":[{"poster":"DU Baymax","date":"2018-08-05T21:01:37.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because it's normals.

Most people are trying new/stupid shit and playing things outside what they normally play and also aren't as focused/determined to win the game.\n\nI'm a plat player and i have beat masters players myself in normals but also had my own masters/diamonds teammates practically hard int into golds.\n\nEDIT: Although i have ran into SoulMario a lot normals. That has not been a fun time, that dude is a monster on Kled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cptn Han SoloQ","date":"2018-08-06T07:28:02.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"^this. I do not understand how people still have not grasped that yet. Ur normal and ranked mmr has nothing to do with each other. I just ranked up to D5, but have been Gold all season. Do you think i am suddenly turning into a god in normals? No i will keep feeding my ass off as APC Teemo, or crit Nunu. It is called having fun with friendos. If i wanna tryhard i step in ranked, if i wanna just chill with mates we will go normals.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KÃ zzy","date":"2018-08-05T21:11:12.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"take it as a compliment riot thinks you're a diamond player \n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItalianStallion5","date":"2018-08-06T04:34:53.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because people from higher elos always make friends with low elo people (who'm would most likely have their normal mmr at the same level as their ranked) and queue with them and it balances out (but very unfairly for their opponent)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-08-05T21:09:18.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a challenger Rakan on my team one time in norms and im only Plat.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[]}]}
