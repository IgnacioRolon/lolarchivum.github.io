Is this ok? I pretty much only play blind normals so I can&#039;t take dc&#039;s, afk&#039;s, and remakes into account. well I could take remakes, but I&#039;m not going to sift through my entire match history, just looking for opinions.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-11T21:33:09.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if wins / total =  0.45, than yes, you have a 45% winrate.\n\nIt is only meaningful over a large sample size, say 200+ games.","replies":[{"poster":"D3M4L1S","date":"2016-10-11T21:36:07.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"470 games, a handful of premades and never a full 5 members. thanks for reading but is 45% good? I'm obviously asking people that have played a lot of solo blind normal because well it has it's circumstances, heh.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-12T01:14:14.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well.. the average is 50%, logically. It cant be anything else.\n\nIn order to get 45% after considering random luck, you have to be consistently dragging down your team somehow, or just clowning around. It is pretty bad, but nowhere near as bad as a lot of people i see freefalling through silver.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
