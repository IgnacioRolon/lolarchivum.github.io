For other lanes I can't say much since I don't know much.

If you do believe you'll get through to 6 without issue, then scaling is probably the better choice (although consider you might be better able to start snowballing sooner if you had the flat version).\n\nAnother thing to consider is how much you actually need the raw stats early on. You almost never see scaling AD runes on adcs for example, since people want to be able to last hit effectively early on\n\nI don't feel mixing flat/scaling of the same type is worthwhile. I'd rather plan for the snowball or plan for late and actually be good there, rather than be just ok. (Although tbh the impact of runes onm the whole is probably pretty small compared to raw skill differences.)\n\nQuints are generally viewed as most useful as flat bonuses, just since the size of the raw stats given by a quint makes a relatively big impact on early game more so than the smaller numbers involved with the other rune types.\n\nedit: For those with lots of rune pages for micro-optimization, scaling versus flat defenses can eb a choice made based on your lane opponent(s). If you're against an AD opponent, you're probably better off with scaling mr instead of flat mr for example since by the time teamfights (involving an AP opponent) start, you'll be past the cross over point, and similar for versus an AP with armour runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-11T22:39:45.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically, scaling runes beat flats by lv6, so they are especially good for solo lanes or anyone who has a passive early game.\n\nScaling HP runes are standard vs AP mid/top, scaling CDR or MR glyphs are standard for mages.\nArmor, mPen, aPen are the commonly used flats i can think of, outside quints.\n\nIf you play a lane bully or someone who needs an advantage pre-6 to snowball, flats provide more of a benefit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-10-11T22:36:34.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you get to the break even point, they are. For example, scaling hp seals break even at about level 9 or so with flat hp seals. Considering majority of games you're generally going to always be past that point, scaling hp pays off more. \nThat doesn't mean scaling hp is the must, you could just prefer the early benefits of having 72 HP from the start. It's preference really, do you want more benefit later into the game?
