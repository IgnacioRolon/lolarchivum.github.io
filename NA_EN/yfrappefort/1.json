I then proceed to do 3 ARAM in order to meet the requirements.\r\n\r\nThen I go to the progress tab again. After waiting 2 minutes (like written just below), nothing happens. Waiting several more minutes, I then decide to close the client and go open it again.\r\n\r\nNow, it asked me AGAIN to choose between Graves and TF. Does that mean I need to start over? Seems like a bug to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2015-07-30T04:57:20.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Yfrappefort. \n\nThis is something like a bug. Sometimes, even though the mission says it's started, it fails to start :( so you will have to choose it again.\n\nIf you could choose it again and let us know if you have problems, that would be great. If you are still unable to \"make a choice\", we can help out with that on the back end.\n\nSorry for the inconvenience. I know it's a pain :(","replies":[{"poster":"Yfrappefort","date":"2015-07-30T19:36:39.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Stephiroth,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=Bpsd8VF5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-30T04:57:20.197+0000)\n>\n> Hey Yfrappefort. \n> \n> This is something like a bug.

I will attempt the \"make a choice\" again, but won't have the time to do so before Saturday.\n\nI will then keep you in touch if it's working out for me or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2015-07-30T21:21:15.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay!\n\nI'll look forward to your reply. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Yfrappefort","date":"2015-08-10T04:54:30.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Stephiroth,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=Bpsd8VF5,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2015-07-30T21:21:15.170+0000)\n>\n> Okay!\n> \n> I'll look forward to your reply. :)\n\nSadly, I had PC issues, so could not play for a week. Tried to do some ARAM tonight. It seemed to count for the part I, but now I won't have time to complete it anyway since the event is about to end.

Because if you had not earned the gold, you should not have been able to get assists in the Black Market Brawler's game you played.","replies":[{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2015-07-30T22:44:27.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its possible that i earned the gold before my brawlers game started and it didn't update till before the game ended :) TY","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2015-07-30T23:26:40.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course <3\n\nIf you have any more problems, let me know and I can try and help!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-07-30T06:50:25.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happened to me too.
