He has been harshly nerfed so many times and got little compensation in return. I can understand why Riot is afraid to buff Teemo because his kit is considered \"toxic\" by many, but still it's no reason to be THAT careful when giving him buffs considering all the nerfs he got. \n\nI also used to LOVE warding both rivers and get objective control. It's what made Teemo unique and was fitting with his \"scout\" theme. The stupid crab ruined that, and now with the duration being only 5 minutes and weak ratio, the mushrooms sure don't feel like an ultimate anymore.\n\nBefore, I would pick Teemo for a few reasons :\n\n1. If they had a team heavily focused on AA\n2. If I wanted us to have more vision overall\n3. If we needed an AP, I would play AP\n4. If we needed more hybrid damage, I would play On-hit\n\nNow, why would you pick Teemo?\n\n1.? Nope, when the enemy is marksmen heavy, you are way better to bring a marksmen top over Teemo.\n2.? Mmm, mushrooms only last 5 minutes now and can't be placed around Dragon and Baron anymore...plus sweeper...next!\n3.? Errr, his mushrooms ratio are so low AP build is not very good anymore...combined with the duration cut...next!\n4.? On-hit build? Sure. But...then you realize you could have brought Gnar, Vayne, Quinn, almost any ranged top with better range/utility/self peel and they would do better then Teemo with an on-hit build...\n\nSo yeah, I currently don't see any reason to play my main anymore. Because of this, my interest in playing this game has slowly phased out.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2016-04-22T15:35:46.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't count the number of times players have asked Rito to make the crab ignore setting off shrooms.
