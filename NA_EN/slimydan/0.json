This thread is just about what champions are able to clear the new jungle because there are a lot of people that worry that the jungle is no longer able to be done by a lot of the junglers with less sustain.\n\nI’ve sorted them into 2 groups; champions that can clear 4 camps, and champions that can clear all the camps.\nThe reason I went with 4 camps is I figured that’s enough to buy the hunter’s machete upgrade and some health potions and maybe a vision ward.\nI also haven’t bothered with some of the junglers that never really had trouble surviving like Fiddles, Nunu, Warwick, Olaf etc..\nAnother thing to note is that I do not play most of these champions in jungle so if you think that you can do a better job than me at clearing the jungle with certain champions then you’re probably right.\n\nFor all of these champions I only use 3 rune pages. Also I’m only level 28 so I’m pretending I have all the masteries.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/flSzSEc.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X6sIf5W.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ov1QQlF.png\n\n---\n\n**Champions who can clear 4 camps**\n\nAnivia\n**Notes**: After succeeding with AD Vel’Koz jungle I thought I would try AD Anivia. I had 21/9/0 masteries. The problem I found with her is she had huge mana costs and I could only clear 4 camps\n**Skill order**: E, Q, E\n**Camp order**:  Krugs(smite), Raptors, Red(smite), Wolves\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1UaySfH.png\n\nRengar\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focused on attack damage with a 21/9/0 mastery page. Use your fury for an empowered W because it is your only sustain. Regar was a close one, I nearly cleared the entire jungle multiple times but everytime I would die at 4 ferocity with my Q half a second off cooldown and the camp nearly dead.\n**Skill order**: Q, W, Q\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iHpw7EU.png\n\nSivir\n**Notes**: For R&M you’ll want to focus on AD with a 21/9/0 mastery page. Sivir has high mana costs and she can’t use her spell shield in jungle so it makes it very difficult to do a full clear. I only managed to do 4 camps. Her clear style is just like all the other ADC’s to be honest.\n**Skill order**: W, Q, W\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Raptors, Red(smite), Wolves\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TBIoQdD.png\n\nWukong\n**Notes**: For R&M you’ll want to focus on AD with a 21/9/0 mastery page. Wukong isn’t too complicated and doesn’t really need too much explanation.\n**Skill order**: E, W, Q\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Gromp(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AzQvrLd.png\n\n---\n\n**Champions who I cleared the entire jungle with**\n\nAlistar\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focus on attack damage with a 21/9/0 mastery page, the reason I don’t go AP to begin with is that his CDs are too long and his passive isn’t effective enough to make use of the AP, I tried to go AP a couple times but it just wasn’t effective. Also the reason I get W at level 3 is not so you can headbutt the camp over the wall it’s for ganks because with your heal you can usually heal to around 60-70% health on your way for a gank and it means you have some quite scary ganks because you show up at high health and ram them into your teammate.\n**Skill order**: Q, E, W\n**Camp order**: Gromp(smite), Blue, Wolves, Red(smite), Krugs, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bTxKgsC.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Kbq8qgx.png\n\nAmumu\n**Notes**: For R&M I focused on ability power with 9/21/0 masteries. Try to kite the camps around a bit to lower the number of attacks it gets on you but otherwise it’s not too bad.\n**Skill order**: W, E, Q\n**Camp order**: Gromp(smite), Blue, Wolves, Red(smite), Krugs, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RIRboOj.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/m7pMcsF.png\n\nCaitlyn\n**Notes**: For R&M you’ll want to focus on AD with a 21/9/0 mastery page. Caitlyn was the first ADC I tried jungle because I thought that if I lay down a bunch of traps before the camps spawn I could get through much more easily. I then found that the traps didn’t work on monsters. The difference between whether you make it through the whole jungle or die to the second camp is whether you can effectively kite the camps. You can negate damage by going outside the leash range but don’t do it for too long or the camp will reset. For Raptors and Wolves go outside the range and kill the little ones first then the big one is easy. When you can try to shoot from inside the bush as it makes your passive stack faster. Use your net toss when it gets close and try to hit the monster with it because it will slow it and make it easier to kite. Don’t use your net toss on small monsters or you’ll run out of mana.\n**Skill order**: W, Q, W\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Raptors, Red(smite), Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IZ0Jxrz.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dPJbLPU.png\n\nCho’Gath\n**Notes**: For R&M I focused on attacks speed with a 21/9/0 mastery page. After taking wolves you’ll get to level 3 but I find that for taking gromp I don’t need to use my W and it just drains your mana so wait until you get blue buff before you start using your W.\n**Skill order**: E, Q, W\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZdmOJX0.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/O3IfoiQ.png\n\nGangplank\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focus on attack damage with a 21/9/0 mastery page. Your Q applies on hit effects so cast it in between aa animations to build up stacks on the gift of heavy hands faster. Also one thing to note with the picture is that I forgot to take a screenshot at 4 camps so I instead have a screenshot at 5 camps.\n**Skill order**: Q, W, E\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Blue(smite), Gromp, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EXviNq0.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0rUwwJp.png\n\nGraves\n**Notes**: For R&M you’ll want to focus on AD with a 21/9/0 mastery page. The difference between whether you make it through the whole jungle or die to the second camp is whether you can effectively kite the camps. You can negate damage by going outside the leash range but don’t do it for too long or the camp will reset. For Raptors and Wolves go outside the range and kill the little ones first then the big one is easy. I found that by the time I had finish red buff I was close to full health and had only used one potion. Use your dash when the large monster is about to get to you so you avoid the shot. I found Grave was really easy and after I cleared the whole jungle I then cleared raptors, krugs, wolves, then gromp. \n**Skill order**: Q, E, Q\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Raptors, Red(smite), Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bZRlrR9.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nM4se7c.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WVxekNl.png\n\nJax\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focus on attack damage with a 21/9/0 mastery page. Use your counter strike just before the large monster hits you to maximize the use you get from it, other than that he’s pretty easy.\n**Skill order**: W, E, Q\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Blue(smite), Gromp, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/22LiLFb.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qZMYHI0.png\n\nKayle\n**Notes**: For the Runes I focused on attack speed but for the masteries I focused on ability power with 21/9/0 masteries. I didn’t try going for a full AP jungle Kayle but this worked so I don’t care that much. \nWhen you’ve activated your E make sure to try to kite the camps so you take less damage\n**Skill order**: E, W, Q\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Blue(smite), Gromp(smite), Raptors\nhttp://i.imgur.com/h2rn4xc.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/z74PnsZ.png\n\nLee Sin\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focus on attack damage with a 21/9/0 mastery page. To be honest I didn’t think he would be able to clear the whole jungle and when I did do it as you can see on the mini map the mid lane was pushed to the tower and because I was almost level 4 I accidentally stole enough lane experience to get to level 4 before taking the Raptors, but I think even if you only had a single quint of experience that would be enough to get to level 4 from 5 camps so for that reason I allowed this accidental experience stealing. \nFor Lee Sin remember that you get spell vamp from your second activation of W (because why not) so make sure that you only use your smite then so that you get the healing. Try to make good use of your passive by having 2 auto attacks between each spell cast.\n**Skill order**: Q, W, E\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nAkKYX7.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LJ56tuQ.png\n\nLeona\n**Notes**: For R&M you’ll want to focus on AD with a 9/21/0 mastery page. With the gift of heavy hands you have 2 stuns but keep an eye on the counter so you don’t use both stuns in one attack and try to use your shield just before the large monster hits you so you get maximum use of your armor. When fighting the Raptors focus the little ones first before killing the big one.\n**Skill order**: Q, W, W\n**Camp order**: Gromp(smite), Blue, Wolves, Red(smite), Krugs(smite), Raptors\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4jzWPxF.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xiuxZZt.png\n\nLucian\n**Notes**: For R&M you’ll want to focus on AD with a 21/9/0 mastery page. The difference between whether you make it through the whole jungle or die to the second camp is whether you can effectively kite the camps. You can negate damage by going outside the leash range but don’t do it for too long or the camp will reset. For Raptors and Wolves go outside the range and kill the little ones first then the big one is easy. Lucian’s jungling is quite similar to Graves’ except you want to try to aa between powers so you get more damage from your passive.\n**Skill order**: Q, E, W\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Raptors, Red(smite), Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dyT5fJI.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/e5poBJ5.png\n\nMalphite\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focused on ability power with a 9/21/0 mastery page. It can help your survivability if you wait for your shield between camps but it hurts your clear times. I did try AD Malphite but I found that AP was better for survivability and it's better for damage\n**Skill order**: E, W, E\n**Camp order**: Gromp(smite), Blue, Wolves, Red(smite), Krugs, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/a2bbFPJ.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C8OV95l.png\n\nMaster Yi\n**Notes**: For R&M I focused on attack speed with 21/9/0 masteries. Try to use your Q to dodge the attacks of the large monsters. Against wolves I found I could make a net gain in health when meditating and I think I also meditated temporarily with the raptor camp.\n**Skill order**: Q, W, E\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nNNVMFU.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/V9yPmYg.png\n\nMorgana\n**Notes**: I know what you’re thinking, that I’m all talk and that Morgana couldn’t possibly clear the entire jungle but hear me out. For R&M I go with the AP rune page and I found that 9/21/0 masteries worked best. I was able to do 21/9/0 masteries but it got very close and I nearly died.\nSo lets start at the beginning, your passive gives you 10% spell vamp and that applies to smite so when you start Gromp only smite him after his second attack. \nWhen taking blue you want to keep moving between attacks and if you can, try to keep him in your pool, don’t go outside his leash range for too long or he will reset. \nFor the wolves you want to start by attacking them and then running outside the leash range, while they run back and forth use your powers and kill the small wolves. Once the small wolves are dead start kiting the large wolf, he should be easy to solo and you should have gained health while they were in your running back and forth in your pool.  \nFor Red and Krugs use the same tactic as used on blue.\nFor the Raptors you use the same technique as used on the wolves. Once the mini chickens are dead the big one is easy to solo.\n**Skill order**: W, Q, W\n**Camp order**: Gromp(smite), Blue, Wolves, Red(smite), Krugs(smite), Raptors\nhttp://i.imgur.com/n8MfKIw.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jDu3kKK.png\n\nNautilus\n**Notes**: For R&M I focused on attack speed with 9/21/0 masteries. While your shield is up your attacks deal extra damage so try to use it just before your aa so that you can get maximum damage out of your shield before it’s destroyed.\n**Skill order**: W, E, W\n**Camp order**: Gromp(smite), Blue, Wolves, Red(smite), Krugs, Raptors\nhttp://i.imgur.com/EZvH8SD.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VG3cVhb.png\n\nPoppy\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focused on attack damage with a 21/9/0 mastery page. Poppy is fairly straight forward in jungle, but only use your W at the start of a camp otherwise you’re just wasting mana. By the time you get to doing blue your mana is a little low so you could instead do blue before Gromp.\n**Skill order**: Q, W, Q\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xIaSYsl.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fUjNB9s.png\n\nRenekton\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focused on attack damage with a 9/21/0 mastery page. Use your fury on your empowered Q so your get more healing. You have to wait around 10-15 seconds after red for your smite to be off cooldown\n**Skill order**: W, Q, Q\n**Camp order**: Gromp(smite), Blue, Wolves, Red(smite), Krugs(smite), Raptors\nhttp://i.imgur.com/g6f4ZaD.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Dvctem1.png\n\nShen\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focused on ability power with a 21/9/0 mastery page. Shen is really easy in jungle because I knew he could do the whole jungle just I didn’t know he could do it with almost fully health, basically you can’t go wrong with him. \n**Skill order**: Q, W, Q\n**Camp order**: Gromp(smite), Blue, Wolves, Red(smite), Krugs, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wCSQZHs.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qvR2jrW.png\n\nTristana\n**Notes**: For R&M you’ll want to focus on AD with a 21/9/0 mastery page. The difference between whether you make it through the whole jungle or die to the second camp is whether you can effectively kite the camps. You can negate damage by going outside the leash range but don’t do it for too long or the camp will reset. For Raptors and Wolves go outside the range and kill the little ones first then the big one is easy.Use your jump defensively as it will save you more health than you will have dealt. When taking blue you can actually have it follow you all around the other side of the wall.\n**Skill order**: E, Q, W\n**Camp order**:  Krugs(smite), Raptors, Red(smite), Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aNEQfXA.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/31Hzg5D.png\n\nTryndamere\n**Notes**: For runes & masteries I focused on attack speed with a 21/9/0 mastery page. I went with attack speed so I could get fury faster so I would get more healing. Taking 4 camps isn’t too bad but to clear the entire jungle I felt was too based on whether I landed a crit or not, I managed to get through on my first attempt and I’m not Tryndamere player so its quite possible that there’s a better way to get through without risking your life too much.\n**Skill order**: Q, E, Q\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Red, Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue, Raptors(smite)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0eVZM4S.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6rYZftu.png\n\nVel’Koz\n**Notes**: Ok I was initially trolling around with this one but I went AD Vel’Koz and it worked well. I had 21/9/0 masteries and basically you play him the same way as any of the other ADC’s. AP Vel’Koz might also work but I haven’t tried it.\n**Skill order**: Q, W, E\n**Camp order**: Krugs(smite), Raptors, Red(smite), Wolves, Gromp(smite), Blue\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nfkYHKU.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hzDiBv2.png\n\nXin Zhao\n**Notes**: For R&M you’ll want to focus on attack speed with a 21/9/0 mastery page.

After red I can usually clear 2 more camps before having to back.\n\nFor a build I'm liking trailblazer into devourer enchant for more sustain and AS. After devourer I go vamp or double daggers ending with a BORK. Double daggers are nice to kite the camp around(@ 1.35 AS i can kite the wolves and krugs and take about 200 dmg) while vamp is good for the sustain. Also I would suggest doing this when you duo with a friend and try to get them to go top and build tank because with 2 items + your jungle item you can generally duo baron if you have any type of sustain to deal with the aoe of baron. A tankier teamfight based jungle build might be closer to Machete into devourer into runaans into Frozen Mallet, grabbing a vamp scepter during Runaans to aid in sustain. This build will allow you to take more punishment and generally assist your team more by utilizing the passives synergy, however you will lack for damage that you would otherwise have with the greedier Bork build.\n\nWithout more extensive testing, I'm not completely sold on this but I do think jungle kallista has a chance, albeit not a good a chance as ADC Kallista","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-02-06T01:03:46.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am pretty sure every champion can clear now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulric Greatsword","date":"2015-02-06T00:04:18.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo can clear the whole jungle if you build him right.
