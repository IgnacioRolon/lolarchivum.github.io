I have autofill protection because I always pick support.  And yet, I somehow ended up as ADC?\r\n\r\nWhy am I getting autofilled when I have protection?  Why didn't the game just wait 5 more seconds for one of the hundreds of current matches that are trying to autofill people into support?  I'm so confused.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T00:59:26.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to see you figured out what happened with that autofill. Just like you said, it seems like this was a weird occasion where the order in which you selected your roles ended up not giving you autofill protection =\\ . \n\nif you run into anything else that seems weird with autofill, you can always check [**here **](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207267266-New-Champion-Select#h2q1)to see if it's intentional and then report a bug if necessary!","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Gary","date":"2017-05-01T18:28:45.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it says autofill is not always on, i play 10-12hrs a day and its constanly on... id rather wait 45 min to get my role then fill every 4 games","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FancyKiddo","date":"2017-04-02T05:41:51.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, figured out what this is.  There's a very strange workflow involved here:\n\nSet your Primary to Support\nSet secondary to Fill\nNow change Secondary to Support\n\nThis, I assume, swaps around your primary and your secondary, turning your primary into Fill and your secondary into Support.  This results in you having no secondary showing.\n\nI assumed, since I had selected Secondary, that the single icon must be for Support, not Fill.  My b for not checking more carefully, I suppose, but still not the workflow I was expecting.","replies":[]}]}
