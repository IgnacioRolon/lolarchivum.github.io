I know this seems like a weird time to start playing rank and trying to climb but i really havent had an interest in playing ranked at all in my 4 years of playing until just recently. I played placement matches last year and got put in silver, but i didn&#039;t play any more ranked after getting placed. I was just curious to see whered i be put IF i tried. But now Im just getting deeply tired of throwaway casual normal games with throwaway casual normal players whos excuse for literally anything and everything is &quot;It&#039;s just normals&quot; and i feel i would enjoy playing serious games right now and rank is the only place for that. I won 8 out of 10 games (solo if that matters) and got placed in silver 3. Do i have a chance to make it to gold in time to get the benefits? Is there still enough wiggle room left to get from silv 3 to gold 5 at least? I dont really really care but it would be nice to upgrade my boring silver trim for a gold one. I don&#039;t even like maokai much but that would be nice to have a victorious skin for all the ones i missed previously.","replies":[{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2016-10-12T00:06:49.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At a win 2 lose 1 game ratio you could make it there in about 70 games. You'd need to play about 3 or 4 games a day in order to accomplish this. Definitely doable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-10-11T23:42:50.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on how good you are. There are 3 weeks left in the season. Assuming your MMR is average, you would have to win around 20 times in a row for Gold V. Of course, you won't have a 100% win rate, so you have to factor in losses. Depending on your skill level, you'd have to put in at least about 50 games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Poetic Zed","date":"2016-10-11T23:42:42.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It took me about two weeks of dedicated playing to make it to gold. I did queue with a few friends to avoid trolls (actually most of them were lower elo than me), so that helped. But yeah, you definitely have time to do it still.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-10-11T23:42:25.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really all depends on you, there are people who play 500 games and don't climb and there are others who climb 6 divisions in 2 weeks playing less than 50 games.  It's definitely possible so just try and see how it goes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LitAF","date":"2016-10-11T23:41:04.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres a chance you still have a couple of weeks.
