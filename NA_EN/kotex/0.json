No matter what it is, its validity is only measured by the rank of who it comes from even if it has valid points that can be considered from person experiences and personal takes on them. I am going to say this outright hurts my feelings. I want to feel like i am a welcomed part of the community and it people can hear other people out. But instead nobody cares about other people because of their rank--doesn&#039;t matter what kind of person they are, what they say, what they think, how they play for certain.\n\n* A challenger player can say the sky is blue and people will nod and agree because their rank is high. Not because of what they said, but because they said it with a high rank.\n\n* A silver or lower player can say the sky is blue and will be degraded for being silver or lower ranked. They can make their point politely, amicably, but that doesnt matter because of their rank. Not because of what they said, but because they said it with a low rank.\n\nThis genuinely makes me sad as someone that comes here to be a part of the community, and is made to feel completely unwelcome because I dont have time to play to raise my rank--i dont have TIME for it, nor do i enjoy playing for it. I&#039;d like to think i am a nice person that people would get along with (granted they arent being dicks, i still am human), but that doesnt matter to people because of my rank. I could have a bad game and be dogged for deserving it because of my rank (in an UNRANKED game no less). I could have a good game where i deserved to win, and i will be dogged for being lucky because of my rank. I am overlooked scoffed at and treated like a pariah because of my rank. People look at my rank first and judge my entire character as my rank. That is terrible. That is a terrible thing to do.\n\n*My Rank in a video game is not my worth as a human being.* Being bronze doesnt mean i dont have feelings. Being bronze doesn&#039;t mean im worthless. There is a human being behind this moniter and when you tell her shes worthless, her opinions don&#039;t matter just because of an arbitrary rank it HURTS her feelings. \n\nWhy must i be a professional just to be a part of the league of legends community? Why can i not have anything i think or say be considered because im a lowly bronze? Why do i have to appease people to feel good and be treated with respect when i&#039;ve done nothing to deserve such disrespect and discrimination other than be bronze? Im not allowed to talk about ANYTHING because im low ranked? \n\nI have spent 7 long grueling years with this game, i have sat through a total of 101 ryze reworks, Rally summoner spell, \"Singed's Best Friend\", Soraka jungle, before there actually WAS a jungle, Pizza feet, Katarina's original voice (dear god), Tons of damage, Krepo when he was an ADC, Bjeregsen when he played with Deficio before even coming to america, Reginald when he was a Top laner, Blitzcrank when he was a top lane pick, voyboy being voyboy, Shaco mid, Master yi mid (in season 2 long before faker made it cool), when you could stay permanently invisible as Shaco with a sunfire cape, Atma's impaler, Deathfire grasp, Zhonya's ring, 100% ban kassadin, spirit of the elder lizard/ancient golem being a rush item on LANERS, and much much more. I have experience with the game, but in those 7 years i just simply dont care to play for rank, and i recently only davvle with it from time to time just to get a rank because i enjoy more serious games sometimes, but not caring to climb in and out of them.\n\nThis will probably be ignored, overlooked, this is an unpopular opinion that nobody will care about because im not platinum at least. But i wanted to get it off my chest. Im sure others have been told things like this.

Maybe I do; my point, &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;experience&quot; does not always equate to &quot;skill&quot;.\n\nExcept skill is a mix of Experience, Knowledge, and Ability. You have about 1400 games and you are Silver 4. If you have an account in Gold I guarantee it is Gold 5 and you probably struggle on that account. This is because you got lucky and floated an account slightly above your true skill level. With that many games played you should easily be a much higher rank if you had the knowledge that you think you have. And this is the problem a lot of people run into. They truly believe that what they know is high elo level knowledge when the reality is that their knowledge is low elo. You might truly without a doubt believe that you have a high elo understanding, but what empirical evidence do you have to prove that your knowledge IS high elo and not low elo? There is not any. No observations can be made to prove you know what you are talking about because you have simply not proven it. This is how science works. \n\nWhen I look at your match history and look at your builds what I see is someone that is still guessing which items to buy. Your builds do not make sense for the champion you are playing, for your team composition, for what your team needed, for the enemy team composition or for what it looks like is going on in the game based on all of the players stats. I bet you think you know builds pretty well but I can tell you right now that builds is definitely a very weak point in your knowledge. \n\nI also looked at your GPM, which is a very important stat and has one of the highest correlations when it comes to rank. Your GPM is that of someone in Low Silver / High Bronze, which is what your rank is. You are averaging 300-350 GPM (http://lolstarz.com/summoner?name=+B%C3%B4%C3%B4sted+Bonobo+&lo=na )which tells me that you do not know how to farm, do not know how to rotate, do not know how to plan for objectives, do not know what to do between team fights and because of this you will not be able to consistently single hand carry games. It is extremely easy to maintain 500+ in wins and 400+ in losses. You have to have a terrible game to dip into the 300s, yet this is what you average. \n\nhttp://lolstarz.com/summoner?name=superpew8812&lo=na is my Gold smurf for reference, and that is an account I literally only play on when I'm too tired to really concentrate or I want to watch a movie but also have something to do.\n\nhttp://lolstarz.com/summoner?name=RIP+AS+20072016&lo=na is my plat smurf for more reference. I use this account to try out builds that I theorycraft while I'm not playing. Even with pretty inefficient builds I can maintain over 400 GPM consistently, even in the majority of my losses. This means that even when I am having a bad game going vs mid to high plats I would have had enough gold to completely stomp the elo you are playing at because people in your elo are averaging 300-350 in GOOD games.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-03-31T17:52:25.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I seem to be hovering between 450 and 600 GPM outside of support (~300 on support champions).  \n\nGood to know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ch√∏nklord","date":"2017-03-31T11:24:38.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I also looked at your GPM, which is a very important stat and has one of the highest correlations when it comes to rank.

Divide that by an average game length of 30 minutes, and you get around 420GPM.\n\nNot to mention these stats are skewed because I only play off-meta champion lanes on this account, and mostly play low farm / low 'carry' champions (My main roles are top/supp). So the gold income is going to be much lower, on average, for many of the champions I play (especially lately with Ivern), but I still have a high objective taken win rate.\n\nAdditionally, http://www.lolskill.net/summoner/NA/B%C3%B4%C3%B4sted%20Bonobo/champions shows the stats on each of my champions played with data compared to the averages of those champions played in general.\n\nPersonally, my favorite site is http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/73799613/B√¥√¥sted Bonobo, because it gives easier to read graphs which you can compare the various tiers, by champion (although only for the past month or so).\n\n> When I look at your match history and look at your builds what I see is someone that is still guessing which items to buy.

Oh right, only your subjective opinion on 'proper builds'. You say a lot, but you're not backing up your words with hard facts in this regard. Point out _exactly what build on what champion_ \"doesn't make sense\" to you; otherwise you're blowing smoke out of your ass, as the saying goes. I have no problems choosing items or following proper \"suggested builds\" from high elo players; however as I stated before, I enjoy playing off-meta, and I enjoy experimenting with builds. You can see this evidenced with my Fizz top lane bruiser build (which has netted me a fairly high win-rate in top lane overall).\n\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-31T06:42:44.572+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jungle Fiddle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FR9lB1EE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-31T05:06:50.202+0000)\n>\n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/jLGvQ3Wk-before-you-make-a-post-about-balance\n> \n> ^ this\n> \n> rito usually weighs plat+ opinions as much more valid than gold and below.

This was a topic about my feelings that you dismissed because the person that feels them is bronze.\n\nI went back and read your post. Everything in my post still applies. It has nothing to do with you personally or your feelings. It has nothing to do with you as a human being. It has to do with the fact that at your rank you do not know enough about the game for your opinion on game balance to hold any weight. \n\nImagine if someone just moved to America and had no idea what football was prior to coming. Now this person thinks they have valid points on how football should be played, but in reality all they are seeing is a bunch of guys throwing a ball around, they don't understand all the ins and outs, they don't understand how each position (role) is played, they do not know why they are doing certain runs with certain players (champions) but not with others, they do not even notice these things or have any clue that these things exist. \n\nNow that person wants to play football and plays in a very casual way, where him and his friends, all new to the sport, with no prior knowledge,, in order to learn off each other. None of them actually know the game, so really none of them are capable of teaching each other the game. Now after playing together for a year they think they are pretty good, even though they do things that make absolutely no sense when you consider how real football is played because they simply do not know better. Now that they think they know the game they apply for careers in the sport. Some want to be coaches, some want to be a referee, umpire, head linesman, line judge, back judge, side judge, center judge or field judge. They do not even know what these titles actually mean, they just watched enough professional games to know these things exist and they think from playing with their friends in their backyard that they have knowledge that is in some what comparable.\n\nHow do you think it is going to go for any of them when they put in an application? Are their feelings going to be saved and they are going to be coddled and told they are good enough for the job and just given a chance? Are they going to be told they are pretty good, but just a tad off from the mark? No, this is the real world, they are going to be told they barely earned the title of amateur and to get lost.\n\nThis is why people don't listen to or take the advice of low elo players seriously when they talk about anything balance related which takes game knowledge. Watching a bronze/silver/gold game is pretty similar to watching people that just moved to America try to play football when they come from a country where football did not exist. Even if they were a pro baseball player and an athlete from their country, not enough of the skills will carry over to make them worth a shit in football. \n\nYou mentioned that you do not have the time to climb in ranked. If you think it takes long to climb out of bronze, silver, or gold then you do not know the game very well. With casual playing I can get an account from unranked to plat if I actually try harded it. By putting in absolutely no effort I can get an account into gold 5. I can legit watch a movie on my second monitor, missing out on what would normally be vital map awareness type of information, and it would not matter one bit, because the other players that are actually focused on the game aren't focused on the right things. \n\nPeople make all these cry baby posts about their  feelings, and that is what it is, a cry baby post, but they do not take a second to look at it from the perspective of the players that actually play this game competitively and have consistently been around the top 1% of the population. We know the game and we all have smurfs. None of us play in bronze/silver/gold and think \"Damn, these guys are pretty good, I wonder what is different between them and people on my main.\" We legit shit stomp the games and laugh pretty uncontrollably about how much fun it is to smurf because it is like playing vs an easier version of beginner bots since there is so much human error it is ridiculous. \n\nI see build paths that make no sense, I see people making judgment calls that make me wonder if they have ever actually carried a game, I see no real play set ups at all. All I see is people that make mistakes and other people that occasionally pick up kills off the other player's mistake. I see people that get handed free kills because they are playing vs someone that is pretty much first timing a champion (when really they have like 50 games on that champion, but still haven't grasped the concept), yet even with all the free kills they get they are unable to carry because they do not farm correctly, rotate correctly, pressure the right lanes at the right time, go for objectives, challenge objectives, roam, etc. I see so many mistakes in low elo I am not surprised at all that those players are in Bronze/Silver/Gold. \n\nSo while you may think you are entitled to an opinion because you are a human, you have to realize that this game is a science and it is a science that you do not comprehend. If you did comprehend it your normals MMR after around 900 games wouldn't be around Bronze 1 and your rank on your 4th season of playing the game wouldn't also still be around high bronze / low silver.\n\nYou may think it takes hundreds or thousands of games to hit a certain rank, but I can assure you it does not. Anyone can hit Gold 5 by just playing completely casually and pushing to Plat 5 just takes having basic game knowledge. If you think differently then I am telling you right now that you are wrong. I am not telling you  this with 100% certainty just because I've been Diamond for the last 3 years consecutively, I'm telling you this because I have experience climbing the ladder. I have climbed the ladder multiple times on multiple accounts, Every Single Season that I've played ranked. I know what Bronze to Diamond has been all about for the last 3 years. Some people try to say \"Oh but this season it is so much harder to climb through Silver compared to last season!\" They say this because last season they barely got to Gold 5 and now they are stuck in low Silver. This is because the game evolves and those that haven't grasped it yet are thrown completely off balance when the game changes while those that already fully grasp how to play the game are able to quickly adapt. This is why high elo pretty much consistently stays in high elo.\n\nIt has literally nothing to do with you as a person. It has to do with the fact that you are making judgment calls while completely lacking the knowledge and experience to have any sort of authority. It is nice that you want to be a part of the community. We welcome you more than you think, but you have to earn your spot if you want to start throwing around your opinion on what is balanced or broken, because the simple truth is that right now you do not know. Your experience in this game is very limited and if they balanced this game based off what goes on in low elo then people that actually knew how to play this game would be stuck playing **Clown Fiesta Simulator**.","replies":[{"poster":"Kotex","date":"2017-03-31T07:37:31.453+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thr34t,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FR9lB1EE,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2017-03-31T06:48:57.008+0000)\n>\n> I went back and read your post.

None of them actually know the game, so really none of them are capable of teaching each other the game. Now after playing together for a year they think they are pretty good, even though they do things that make absolutely no sense when you consider how real football is played because they simply do not know better. Now that they think they know the game they apply for careers in the sport. Some want to be coaches, some want to be a referee, umpire, head linesman, line judge, back judge, side judge, center judge or field judge. They do not even know what these titles actually mean, they just watched enough professional games to know these things exist and they think from playing with their friends in their backyard that they have knowledge that is in some what comparable.\n> \n> How do you think it is going to go for any of them when they put in an application? Are their feelings going to be saved and they are going to be coddled and told they are good enough for the job and just given a chance?

If something feels broken to you, that is a balance problem. If something feels too snowbally, that is a balance problem, if a certain champion seems strong to you, that is a balance problem. \n\nAnd you are wrong, I actually have plenty of bronze and silver players on my friends list. I give them free coaching, let them bounce ideas off me, play games with them and help them analyze their game play so they can improve, I stream for them so they can see my game in pretty much real time as I explain out loud what my thought process is through out the game, I do tons to help people out that WANT to be helped out and DO NOT have an ego problem which makes them believe they already know what they are talking about. Every single person that I gave an hour of free coaching to walked away saying \"Woah, I never thought of all that stuff,\" \"Damn, I never thought of it that way,\" \"Shit I never realized I was doing that wrong because I didn't even think THAT was a thing that mattered.\" There is so much depth to this game that it is easy to think you know a lot because you know A LOT but the reality of it is that 'A LOT' that you know might only be 5% of the total amount that is to be learned.\n\nI get having a busy schedule. I started playing this game when I was in the military. My second competitive season, first season I actually actively learned how to play, I had so much shit going on that I had no way of concentrating at all when in game. Last season 2 seasons I worked on my Bachelor's degree and this season I'm working on my Master's degree while being as active as I can in an honor society. I understand that its hard to concentrate because you are a mother, I live with my girlfriend and she has a 4 year old, he is distracting at times. But to me these aren't excuses for not learning. It is still possible to learn even if you aren't playing at your top. If your peak ability is Plat 5 then you will hit Gold 3 even if you are consistently playing in under desirable conditions. That is because in this game there is such a huge skill difference between ranks that you do not even have to try hard vs people that are half a tier under you if you are consistent and normally do not have to try AT ALL vs people that are a full tier under you. This is why in my opinion it does no matter how much you play when it comes to climbing because you will always climb to within half a tier of your skill level before the game even feels a little difficult.\n\nI don't go after YOU as a person when I reply to your thread, I go after your ideology that every rank is capable of having an equal understanding of this game because from my experience, which at this point is about 7 years, there is a huge knowledge difference between the ranks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-03-31T21:39:12.548+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thr34t,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FR9lB1EE,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2017-03-31T06:48:57.008+0000)\n>\n> It has to do with the fact that at your rank you do not know enough about the game for your opinion on game balance to hold any weight. \n\nAre you saying that game balance is the same across all ranks?

Game balance is just as important for those ranks as it is at Master/Challenger.\n\nYes, game balance is exactly the same across all ranks. Ryze in Bronze is the exact same as Ryze in Diamond. The champion does not change depending on what rank the game is that he is being played in. The experiences that differ, based on ranks, are due to knowledge or lack of knowledge. If something seems broken in Bronze or Silver because they do NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY AGAINST IT due to LACK OF KNOWLEDGE but it is balanced in high elo because people DO KNOW HOW TO PLAY AGAINST IT because they HAVE KNOWLEDGE, is it really broken or are the lower elo people just not figuring it out?\n\nYou don't balance things based on whether or not people in low elos have figured it out yet, you balance it on what is AVAILABLE in the game to EVERYONE regardless of rank. \n\nThe idea that something is capable of being broken in one elo but balanced in another is an absolute joke. We are all playing the exact same game. Darius is strong in low elo, I hear that all the time. Darius is weak in high elo. Is darius over powered just because he can stomp newbs that don't understand the basics of his kit? No. It just means people in low elo don't know how to work around it even though THERE IS A WAY TO WORK AROUND IT. If there wasn't a way to work around it, then yea it would be considered broken.\n\n\nThis is how balance works. If something can be countered effectively, it is balanced.\n\nThis is NOT how balance works: If something is strong against someone with bad knowledge or mechanics then their opinion, even though they bad bad knowledge, is important and that something needs to be changed!\n\nCome on, utilize common sense. Just because you are doing it wrong or playing against it wrong doesn't mean it is unbalanced, strong, or weak.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ch√∏nklord","date":"2017-03-31T06:53:59.393+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> It has to do with the fact that at your rank you do not know enough about the game for your opinion on game balance to hold any weight.\n\nDidn't need to read the rest of your post after this to realize you're completely wrong.\n\n**Knowledge and experience does equal ability; you can be knowledgeable and have years of experience on a subject, yet not have the ability to master that subject at a high level.**\n\nCase in point: Many of the shoutcasters in the LCS show knowledge of the inner mechanics and workings of league (even all the skill names) to a degree of any Challenger level player; many of them however are not at that high of a rank on their own account.","replies":[{"poster":"Thr√´at","date":"2017-03-31T07:04:12.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=B√¥√¥sted Bonobo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FR9lB1EE,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-31T06:53:59.393+0000)\n>\n> Didn&#x27;t need to read the rest of your post after this to realize you&#x27;re completely wrong.\n> \n> **Knowledge and experience does equal ability; you can be knowledgeable and have years of experience on a subject, yet not have the ability to master that subject at a high level.**\n> \n> Case in point: Many of the shoutcasters in the LCS show knowledge of the inner mechanics and workings of league (even all the skill names) to a degree of any Challenger level player; many of them however are not at that high of a rank on their own account.\n\nSo if you don't read my post because of one statement that is alright but if no one gives a shit about your opinion on the game because you are a ridiculously low rank that is wrong and requires you to stand on a soap box?\n\n\nAlso, you just proved to me that you do not know what  you are talking about.

Literally anything played in any way by a legit good player will stomp silver. This is why the opinions of low elos do not matter.\n\nI'm sorry, i've been playing every single day for over 5 years. I've read the forums and reddit every single day regardless of where im at. I think about the plays and things i wanna try while im working. Right now i have a 75-90% win rate in ranked. I'm Bronze 1 and i'ver NEVER made it to gold, not once in over 5 years. \n\nWhy am I bronze? Well simply put, I never queued up for ranked and it's taken me all this time till a month ago before I started playing. Im bronze and i'm winning almost every game by a landslide. My normals' games are much much harder. \n\nTo the OP, know your strength and limits and have confidence in yourself. If you know the objective truth about something, nobody can tell you you are wrong. Only fools (or assholes) deny the truth when it's put in front of them. Riot has some smart people that probably are listening, so i doubt your opinions are going unheard. Also keep in mind that it's in Riot's best interest to allow the mentality and culture surrounding ranked to play out like it has. Combining your humanly self worth and ranked together creates a situation where you feel you must play ranked alot (which means playing the game in all of its forms many times, learning alot of new champions, and buying skins for ones you've mastered) and you are only worthy if you win ALOT, because it takes an ass load of wins to rank up, and some times only a few losses to knock you down.\n\nDon't be discouraged op, for alot of men LOL is nothing but a dick measuring contest and god forbid you tell them you think their dicks are small.","replies":[{"poster":"Thr√´at","date":"2017-04-01T01:55:17.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Starilae,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FR9lB1EE,comment-id=00040002,timestamp=2017-04-01T00:05:37.275+0000)\n>\n> I'm sorry, i've been playing every single day for over 5 years.

The 75-90% is a lie.\n\nAlso, Flex is vastly easier than solo q. How do I know? Experience. I've climbed all 3 ladders to Diamond. Diamond 5 in Flex feels like low plat. Gold in flex felt like Silver. How do I know what those elos feel like? I smurf and climb through them multiple times every season so I can experience the whole ladder.\n\nIn your normal games you still have MMR. The MMR of your normal games is still around high bronze / low silver. You get the occasional gold  that is playing with their friend. Even though you have been playing for 5 years you are still getting matched with people that are new to the game, a bunch of them have a low amount of normal games played and no ranked games played.\n\nDo I think your opinion on balance should matter? No, absolutely not. Why? Because you haven't proved that you have learned how to properly play league of legends. Your build paths are ineffective which will cause certain scenarios to seem a lot harder than they should have. In one case you bought Black Cleaver on Kled when the enemy team had 0 Armor items.\n\nSome things seem strong or weak in low elo either because people do not have the knowledge to play with it or against it.\n\nExample:\n\nAnnie stomped low elo for a long time. Her stun seemed unpredictable to people. It would just come out of no where and boom people were stunned. There was a visual on her, a ring that went around her when her stun was ready. Low elo people always said \"Yea but she can just hit 2 abilities really fast and then boom she is stunned before you can see the visual.\" Annie was a huge problem in low elo.\n\nIn high elo people agreed that Annie wasn't an issue. Her stun was very predictable because if you clicked on her you could see how many stacks she had under her hud. In team fights it took a little bit of extra micro ability to click her mid fight.\n\nWhat did Riot do? They fixed the problem that the high elo players were having, they made it so her stacks were easier to see during team fights. Now she is pretty fixed in high elo.\n\nHow did low elo players respond? They say she is still busted because she can flash ult.\nHow do high elo players respond to that? They time her flash so they can predict when she is going to do it and when she has her stun force her to waste it to farm or miss out on farm due to her low built in AD.\n\nYou don't balance things around what people complain about because the people complaining lack ability. You balance things around what people that know how to play are saying is still an issue.\n\nIts the same problem with Darius. In low elo people think he is a monster because he does tons of damage. In high elo he is considered weak because you can see how many stacks you have and pretty much predict his abilities. His low mobility makes him really easy to gank. If he was balanced around low elo he wouldn't even stand a chance in high elo. You don't balance a champion because some people that are clearly still learning the basics don't like that something takes utilizing their brain to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kotex","date":"2017-04-01T09:07:29.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Starilae,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FR9lB1EE,comment-id=00040002,timestamp=2017-04-01T00:05:37.275+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m sorry, i&#x27;ve been playing every single day for over 5 years.

It's almost like people are forcing it now, being proud of it--being hateful and superior.\n\nI used to defend league when its brought up and people are like \"unngh league is the worst community on the planet, people there are horrible, its so shitty its the worst etc\" and i used to tell them i genuinely havent had those kind of experiences to the degree they express. Whenever i met a shitty person(s) i just shrugged it off, it happens, move on but theres only so much a person can take. And now in this generation league has hit its lowest point, its full of hate now more than ever, full of superiority, and these hateful superior people are in charge of the community. I can't defend that anymore, and they just create more hateful superior, judgemental people.\n\nIt's sad and disheartening. I used to genuinely--i mean genuinely love league. But it's been so corrupted theres no longer any enjoyment out of being a part of it. Im not that kind of person and maybe thats exactly why i can't fit into its community, because it has no room or use for people such as myself.\n\nThank you very much though, i like you <3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-04-01T15:42:18.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">A _challenger player can say_ the sky is blue and people will nod and agree because their rank is high.

That is real, and that will always be real no matter where in the world, you are, where in the world *i* am, and whatever method we are using to communicate over long distance without speaking face to face.\n\nYou said it yourself though. You don't care about being here, but you don't have anything better to do--which i mean you could maybe watch netflix, play Happy wheels, read something, clean out your PC... i can think of a bunch of things that you would probably find more interesting to do between games than being here to talk about how uninterested you are about league beyond casually playing it. Thats just me though... :o","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
