The MLB and the NFL have 2 \"leagues\" (American and National league in baseball, and the AFC and the NFC in football). Each league is divided into various divisions loosely based on geography. Each division sends a single team to the playoffs, and there is a wildcard team from each league that is chosen from the team with the best record of those that remain. Each league then plays their playoffs amongst themselves, and when each league is down to 1 team remaining, those two teams play in a championship game/series. NEVER can two teams from the same league play in the finals, let alone two teams from the same division, and by allowing a Korea vs Korea finals, that is EXACTLY what Riot is doing, and it fucking sucks for literally the rest of the world.\n\nEdit:\nStop being so self-righteous.

We could call it the \"Bob Series\" if we wanted, the name is entirely unimportant to the principle at play here, and honestly your statement comes off as rather self-righteous. Stop arguing semantics, and start focusing on the actual substance of this discussion. \n\n>brazil has won the world cup 5times\n\nCorrect, but did Brazil play another Brazilian team in the finals? Of course not, BECAUSE ONLY ONE TEAM PER COUNTRY IS ALLOWED TO COMPETE IN THE INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT. That is the point I'm trying to make here. If Asia wins the LCS every year, well I guess that just sucks for America and Europe. But when the final match consists of one Asian team against another Asian team, that's just shitty management of the brackets. And it would be one thing if this year was the first time that this has happened, but it's been this way virtually EVERY year, and that is just dumb. You don't generate international interest in a \"sport\" when you allow one region/country to completely dominate it. Just look at baseball/softball. Both of these used to be Olympic sports, but were removed because of the general lack of interest, in that only a handful of countries from the general North American region could compete. In fact, I believe that the US holds every gold medal in Olympic Softball history (Japan might have 1), while baseball gold medals are shared by the US and Cuba. Meanwhile, sports like gymnastics limit the number of competitors from a single country so that more countries can participate in the event, thus generating more global interest in the sport.\n\nAnd before you yet again focus on the semantics of my argument and say something along the lines of \"Asia isn't a country\" let me point out that the tournament structure for the LCS considers region (NA, Europe, Asia, etc) and not country when forming the groups, so \"country\" isn't really a relevant term for the LCS.","replies":[{"poster":"LemurKick","date":"2016-10-31T16:03:35.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So are you saying there should only be 6 teams that compete in worlds?","replies":[{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-10-31T20:21:55.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. But perhaps instead of the bogus \"group\" stage, they could do a bracket system, where all the qualifying teams from each region play amongst themselves, and when only 1 team from each region remains, they create a new bracket to merge the winners of each region.
