It's animated too.  :D  The dynamic background should show your most recently played champions (hover over the mask icon on your profile), but it might need a moment to update.  You'll need to play a lot more Xayah games to get that updated, but keep in mind it will continue to change as you play different champions.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf82984997","date":"2017-05-12T08:53:23.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay it shows Xayah now. Guess all you need to do is play enough games. And i love the DJ sona animated background and i changed my name. Im a Xayah main now. Lucky i got the name of summoner icon as the summoner name.","replies":[]}]}]}
