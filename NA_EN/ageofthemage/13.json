I'd love to help everyone, but if I focused on replying to every single reply like this, a lot of other posts would go unnoticed. The best way to get our attention is to simply make your own post.\n\nThat response might seem a bit copy/pasted, but it's simply because the answer is the same for this issue across the board.\n\nAlso, this latest patch forced that option to turn on for some people I'm noticing. If you have that option on and the after match lobby takes awhile to load, it's because \"close client during game\" forces the client to close so then you have to wait for it to fully load back up. If that option is disabled, the client will never close and would pop back up much faster. If turning that off doesn't present any changes, then obviously the problem is elsewhere, but we would have never known that without trying something first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
