As far as I know, from what I've read, the League is gone. While this is sort of ironic, I'm wondering if this means the Institute of War has been removed as well, and if this is the case, what will happen to Fiddlesticks?\r\n\r\nI can totally see him as being related to the Shadow Isles. His original lore states that his existence came about when a mage, a summoner named Istvaan hailing from Zaun, entered the chamber in the Insititue of War to commit to a super dark ritual. This is implied as the birth of Fiddlesticks. This also leaves me wondering whether or not Fiddlesticks is Istvaan, or if Fiddlesticks was summoned by Istvaan, upon which Fiddlesticks killed the mage immediately. \r\n\r\nThis of course implies that he is not of the Shadow Isles. My only reasoning that he would be a SI champ is that he looks like he fits the scene. Also, I feel like he makes for a fun comp when paired with various shadow isle champs as well (Thresh Support, Maokai Top, etc). \r\n\r\nWhat are the community's and developer's thoughts on champs like Fiddle who seem to not have a real homeland, especially ones like Fiddle who have to be contained at all times unless they are on the fields of justice?","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2014-10-24T17:16:18.155+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hello!

Not from the Void, not from the Shadow Isles; these places seem too \"real\" (relatively speaking).\n\nThese characters are the physical manifestations of humanity's dread.\n\nThe Void is at the separation of the alien and the familiar.\n\nThe Shadow Isles are at the separation of life and death.\n\nShaco, Nocturne, and Fiddlesticks came from the place at the separation of fiction and reality.\n\n*Lore I made up for illustrative purposes:*\n\nThe world of ideas has no physical presence, but surely existed. Many theorized about visiting this place, but modern academics dismissed it as nonsense.\n\nOne night, a group of three sorcerers found an ancient text that seemed to describe a ritual that would open a portal to this world. Defying all rational thought, they sought to find it and control its power. After all, when one has control over reality, he is all-powerful. They performed the ritual during a mid-autumn's new moon, a particularly soul-shivering, frightful night where ideas of doom, darkness, and madness prevailed...\n\nThe sorcerers did not know what to expect. There was no portal, for ideas do not have a concrete form. Yet the sorcerers felt something heavy in the air regardless...\n\nThunder struck, and the ideas manifested themselves in each of the sorcerers, embracing their powers. The sorcerers' identities died that day, but their consciences remained. These beings, now known as Fiddlesticks, Nocturne, and Shaco, seek to rid themselves of this last shred of humanity that remains inside them...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emperor of Arima","date":"2014-10-24T20:20:37.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked these ideas:\n\n1.
