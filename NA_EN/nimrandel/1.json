The client sound (not anything else) lags out and eventually crashes/disappears altogether. Usually can fix by just restarting client but I dont like having to restart my client after virtually every game. have tried running low spec mode but that didnt help. In-game sound usually works just fine (ive had that crash once or twice but thats like once every 100 games or so). Any help would be good.","replies":[{"poster":"Nimrandel","date":"2017-07-14T09:05:46.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"usually when I start a new que after getting out of a game it will start getting all scratchy and laggy and then when I get to champ select it just craps out real bad and either after i select a champ to ban (in draft) or just select my champ it goes away entirely and sometimes it lasts to like the maybe the second champ selected in draft. in blind I can sometimes get it to go all the way through. But it starts in que and continues into champ select until I start the game and once in game the sound is fine in game but after game the sound will still be crashed client side and ill have no sound till restart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-14T03:52:36.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sound is becoming more and more prevalent in the game with the queues some Champs abilities give, so just thinking about this frustrates me. @_@\n\nI'm wondering if you can give me more information; you said that you have to restart LoL after every game to bring the sound back. When exactly does the sound go away though? Is it at a consistent point in game, or after something happens? Or is it most often / only in the client and only when you come out of game?","replies":[]}]}
