Really annoying cause i cant participate in discussion (sometimes a good thing in bronze though XD) or have to keep people waiting for me to join there game. If anyone has any advice how what to do let me know. thnx.","replies":[{"poster":"Nimrandel","date":"2017-07-04T06:56:14.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to be better with low spec mode... also tuned up my connection a bit.

I'll also try it in low specs mode and see if that makes a diffrence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-04T03:34:27.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to check, can you tell me if you're enabling 'Close client during game' in your settings? That's ok if you are, but it does come with a side effect of a slight delay between the nexus explodifying and you getting to Honors and postgame stats while it turns the client back on. It's a known issue though, one we're working to solve asap. :D If you'd rather not deal with the delay though, I'd suggest letting the Client stay on while playing.\n\nIf you're NOT enabling that setting, it's likely something entirely different though, likely a Connection error. For those, I suggest hitting up the troubleshooting guide for connection [**right over here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac). Those are solid steps for helping to reduce most lag in and out of game caused by connection interference. You can also run the client in 'Low Specs Mode' to reduce how much your PC needs to process in the client and speed things up! ^^ \nLet me know if trying any of these solves your delay!","replies":[]}]}
