Worked fine just last night and today suddenly wont work.\r\n\r\nProblem: I start client, it appears, I press \"Launch\" and it makes the sound, then shows a loading icon for maybe 3 seconds then nothing.\r\n\r\nThings ive tried: Deleting the RAD files\r\nRepairing the game\r\nRunning as Administrator\r\nFully uninstalling the game from my pc and reinstalling\r\nTurning off firewall\r\nTurning off all virus protection\r\netc...etc....\r\n\r\nI notice that if I attempt to run the game twice in a row, I get \"PVP.Net patcher kernel has stopped working. Which according to online forums the RAD file delete should work, which it did not.\r\n\r\nAfter I attempt to start the game and it fails, my task manager still shows LolClient(32 bit) and LoL Patcher (32 bit), but both are running at little to no memory so they are basically inactive. If anyone can give me a solution that would be appreciated. I expected a fresh reinstallation of the game would fix it, but apparently it does not.
