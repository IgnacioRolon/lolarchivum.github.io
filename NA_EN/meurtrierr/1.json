Elo Hell is Bronze 2.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lost a game where we were doing good. I have 4 or 5 kills top as ryze(we needed an AP champ). I kill the mid ganker, the jungler, the top lux. early on, i was rich.\r\n\r\nEventually, Draven left the game because he rage-quitted. He never came back and everything went downhill.\r\n\r\nIn an other game, Teemo in our team decides that will go ADC. We lost because there&#039;s no back-up damage dealer when a teemo chose to go ADC and he was building mostly AP, noy hybrid. He couldnt even kill a very low ADC and early on before the end of laning phase, he died 5 times. I was doing very good top as wukong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Behavior in Bronze: most ppl push mid, they don&#039;t let you farm lanes. Left and right side not warded, they don&#039;t care. They push mid anyway and they can caught. \r\nBronze match-making is mostly never balacned. You either easily win or you lose in a 10-45 score which is dumbfunded. \r\nBronze 2 is when you lose because your team get wiped when you did everything right. You&#039;re the only one left alive because you&#039;re the only one who knows how to pull-off and stay alive, but you alone is not enough to defend the towers and nexus.\r\n\r\nMy only advice is, pick a hero good enough to takedown towers and focus mostly on that. That way, if your entire team chose to wrecklessly push mid, at the very least, you can take downn top tower or force an enemy to go meet you top which will leave mid in a 4 vs 4 sitaution so it&#039;s a win win.","replies":[]}
