How can i climb back up.(My bronze guide).","subforum":"Tips & Tricks","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{item:3041}}  **My story**. \r\n\r\nI was never bronze. I&#039;m only bronze now because during my provisional games, i DC&#039;d in 5 out of 10 games. I was lucky enough to win a game where i DC&#039;d, but then i came back later on. Plus it was a 4vs5 with no ADC. \r\nNot my fault, i did everything i had to do to not DC. Today, it&#039;s fine tho.\r\n\r\n{{champion:14}} **What i did wrong? Why am i still stuck in bronze if my Connection is fine?**\r\n\r\nI thought i did everything right, but i was wrong because even if you&#039;re a beast in Silver, Gold and above, you can&#039;t possibly be as good in bronze. It&#039;s like a different game in bronze. \r\nYou think you know everything about league? We believe you, but you know nothing about bronze.\r\n\r\n{{champion:62}} **What is there to learn in bronze if i know for sure that i&#039;m already good in LOL?**\r\n\r\nFor the same reason that i don&#039;t know what Wukong learned from Master yi, i didn&#039;t know what i had to learn in bronze but now, i get it.\r\nYou need to learn what it means to be a bronze player, but you are not one, that&#039;s the thing. Because you are not one, you don&#039;t know how a bronze player react. \r\nLearning these will eventually make you figure out how to turn your newb teams into a winning team and you will also learn how to exploit the bronze players in order to win the majority of the time.\r\n\r\n**Up next:**\r\n\r\n{{champion:74}} **Learn about the usual mistakes that a bronze player make every games.**\r\n\r\n-They like to tower dive\r\n-They like to capture objectives when it&#039;s not the time and they like to secure them as-well only to feed with nothing in return.\r\nthey like to clump up.\r\n-Bronze players watch Top play videos so they will try to imitate what they just seen on youtube only to fail.\r\n-They do not know how to support and even if they got sightstone, they will not use up the wards for the map control. And that, even if you ask them to do it gently. \r\n-Bronze players, don&#039;t listen to orders most of the time so you can try to lead them, but acting as the leader is not reliable. You need to find an other approach.\r\n-They like to blame others, but when they blame you, the effect is great. For example, if they blame you for a fail gank when the enemy clearly flashed away, they will never gank for you again no matter what.\r\n-They do not like to reposition themselves(This is the more polite way to say that they feed).\r\n\r\n\r\n{{summoner:30}}  **So with that in mind, these are the list of things you should not let a bronze player do and things that you should not do for them.\r\n**\r\n\r\n-Do not let a bronze a player carry. (This mean pick a carry yourself and carry the game for your team since the bronze player will always die too early and you will lose every objective points for the late game.)\r\n-Do not over do it when you want to kick some knowledge. (Bronze players can&#039;t learn too many things at once so do not over do it while trying to teach them how to play or they will suddenly become confused to a point where they will do even worse than before.) In few words, *do not overcharge their brain cells. *\r\n-Do not upset a bronze player. Some bronze players play for fun and they can careless about you nor the game. So be polite the whole time. \r\n-Avoid plays that require your team to think a bit more. (For example, don&#039;t set up a surprise attack in the enemy zone. It&#039;s too risky and theres way too much bronze players with you. One mess and your whole team will start the fight instead of repositioning.)\r\n-Do not wave clear during an up-coming team fight. (You can destroy the tower if you&#039;re already at it, but if you&#039;re still wave clearing, go help your team instead because bronze players never look at the odds and they throw a lot.)\r\n-Do not die! (In bronze games, there&#039;s a lot of Aces. So you need to stay alive no matter what in order to keep the game going.)\r\n\r\n{{summoner:2}} **What role and lane to pick?**\r\n\r\n**Best lane?** \r\nTop. Jungle is highly recommended. Mid is good. You can win with ADC. Do not go support unless you have no choice and if you don&#039;t have a choice, pick a support who can carry.\r\n\r\n**Best roles?** \r\nCarries are the best, but champs that are only good late game are not at the same time. You need a champ who can do all of the following at the same time: Carry, initiate, tower destroyer, escape. If 1 of these are not listen, avoid this champ. \r\nSo you are left whit Wukong, Riven, Udyr, jax, Nasus...\r\n\r\n{{item:3078}} **What to do with these type of Hypercarry or how ever you call them?**\r\nFirst of all, i recommend picking top every games if you can. Take Teleport no matter what, even if you know for sure that your lane is easy and even if you feel you don&#039;t really need it based on team composition and everything else.\r\n-From 1 to 6, do your best. Make sure your TP will stay up at level 6. \r\n-At level 6 clear your lane as fast as possible(easy if you build up Hydra). Wave clearing does not mean destroying the tower.\r\n-TP bot lane when all your minions are getting killed under the tower of your enemy, but do not let yourself be seen while teleporing.\r\n-When you appear, again, do not let yourself be seen while you appear and position yourself to gank both their ADC and their Support.\r\n-Profit, GG.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s really all. I&#039;m really confident with this, i&#039;m still in bronze, i don&#039;t play much, but i know for sure that with this mindset, you&#039;re finally gonna get yourself out of bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-03-26T05:24:44.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol you can't win.\n\nNasus, Jax or Udyr?

So if you pick a riven and you go mid that early, it's on you. Beside, it's bronze. It's not because a champ can easily crush you that a bronze player can as-well. Think about it. I play Tryndamere and i never lost to a Teemo for example.\nBronze players don't kite BTW so this to me shows clearly that you don't know bronze players. You probably was never bronze or i don't know.\nLeblanc players in bronze, even if fed, they fall off once you buy Banshee. You overestimate Bronze Leblanc way too much.\nFinally, Kalista in bronze is a very rare pick. I don't see braum no more in bronze.\n\nSeriously, i believe you're gold and above and you think you can tell a player stuck in bronze what to do when you don't know what they have to deal with.\n\n\nWith that same strat btw, i was gonna win yesterday. My strat worked as planned. I had wukong top with TP. I TPed bot lane to gank both their support and ADC. That worked fine. Then we took the dragon.\n\nFrom that point, everything worked as planned. Not only that, we ganked their jungler early because he was trying to steal our red.\n\nI only lost because our ADC was very very very bad. She had 0 kill and plenty of death as Sivir. Our morgana never and i mean, she never warded, not even with the free ward. So it was hard for us to control the map. Morgana also didnt want to listen to anyone. She kept on insulting us everytime we were trying to tell her what to do.\n\nOur mid was very bad. He kept on pushing the mid lane solo so he kept on feeding the enemy as Viktor, especially their nasus.\n\nSo with that being said, i'm 100% confident in my strat. I just need an ADC who don't feed, who don't remain at 0 kills from the start to the end. I also need a support who can actually support, but really, i don't really need a good support since the enemy support most of the time, don't do better.\n\nAnd if Viktor wasn't a feeder too, we were gonna win this easy since the final score was almost even thanks to my good ganks and intervention. The only good guy in my team was the jungler, but that doesn't mean he was that good. He didn't gank bot enough when they were always badly positioned on front of the tower, but thanks to my TP, i took that job.\n\nAll this to say that while my strat was perfect, you just can't possibly win them all anyway, but you will win more games with that.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-03-26T15:57:18.848+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, you already have problems with your strat: you need the ADC not feeding.

Bronze players can be so bad that even if you go jungle, your enemies will get first blood before you can even position yourself for a gank(Which means before level 3). So you want to go top to prevent that from happening. The jungle don't often get ganked in bronze unless he is the type that gets himself ganked while trying to gank which is pretty rare.\n\nAt level 6 from there, you can TP and help bot win their lane then get the dragon at the same time. It cannot be better than that and this play never fails in bronze. It also demoralize your enemies while your allies will feel good about it and they will then see you as a great leader for the team so at that point, they will respect you. In bronze, you need that respect as soon as possible because these players are highly emotional.\n\nWhen you go jungle, you can't defend all 3 lanes and in most games, you need to be everywhere at once which means that you will also lose time to farm on your own which also mean that if you fail a gank somehow(flash, enemy escape, torch...) then it's a waste of your time. \nWhen you're top, you cannot possibly waste your time. You TP bot, you do your thing and you're back farming top again, but stronger only to TP bot later on if the lane phase is not over yet.\n\nAlthough, there is one exception to that. If you take {{champion:77}}  Jungle, you can pick Teleport instead of flash since your bear form allows you to move fast enough to escape anything or to close the distance just enough to successfully gank everytime. \nIf you can list me any other jungle ganker who can replace flash/ghost with teleport, then i'd be glad to see that. But he also need to be that HyperCarry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Godaren","date":"2015-03-26T18:33:14.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play top a lot.
