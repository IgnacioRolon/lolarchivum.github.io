Instead their timer goes to 0 and is stuck at it. This means that it never becomes my turn to ban/select a champ. I get kicked out, I get 5 minutes punishment. Then, sometimes it happens again and I get punished for 30 minutes.. or something around that time. Actually I just kill the game then and don't bother checking even for how long I am getting punished.. \r\n\r\nThe interesting thing is that it is possible that it happens only when my turn is later in the banning/picking order. When I am first pick and am not even banning, I think everything is ok. I will pay attention to this and update you if this is a pattern.\r\n\r\nOther info I can provide you is this: \r\nOS: OS X Yosemite 10.10.5\r\nLOL: 7.17.16_08_18_12_24\r\n\r\nI have repaired client yesterday but apparently it didn't fix the issue. \r\n\r\nBest regards, let me know if you need any logs or info from me. \r\nUrawa","replies":[{"poster":"Tntalized","date":"2016-09-03T03:25:40.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this same problem too, its only like 1/3 games that it happens. I have much more success when i'm running blind pick, but i cant deal with the trolls. I keep getting 5-15 min bans because i'm \"leaving champ select\" when really the client is disconnected. The first person to select a champ (after bans) wont load, and the timer runs to 0, then it says everyone has left the party. When i leave the match it wont even do that, i have to force quit, and the chat disconnects. I ran through all of the connection issue trouble shooting, and nothing. I just built this computer and am hard wired atm (although every other game i run through wifi) at 100mbps download 75 mbs upload 60 ping (other games are in the 30ping off wifi) to keep the connection on my end stable... i don't think its my end. if anyone has anything let me know!!","replies":[{"poster":"Tntalized","date":"2016-09-17T23:46:26.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: So I'm pretty sure its my ISP. I have called them and opened a ticket, but I'm positive they don't care and this will never get resolved (short of changing to some other demonic ISProvider). I fixed this by tethering my Verizon phone, and my ISP is Frontier Fios, quick as hell 100 mbps up and 70 down, but cannot connect to Leagues servers...","replies":[{"poster":"Tntalized","date":"2016-09-18T20:02:58.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so after even more testing I have officially concluded that it was my computers WiFi card that was dropping packets. All drivers were properly updated, switching my WiFi card to an Asus brand I am having no more troubles, and I can achieve an even better ping by running on 2.5 ghz instead of the 5ghz.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T21:27:07.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can be happening for a few reasons, and we can troubleshoot all of it!  One factor here can be third party programs that may interact poorly with the client.  If you have any apps running like play.tv or overwolf, remove them as a first step.  The next factor could be a network issue that's losing a steady connection, causing you to lose sync in champion select and leave you behind. \n\nFor this, I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for a resolution.
