However, it doesn't correlate to a huge or noticeable winrate increase in comparison to the alternative summoners. I believe that to encourage other summoners we'd have to buff ignite, cleanse, and barrier, instead of nerfing ghost. And if we must nerf ghost, nerf it for ranged champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2017-01-12T07:22:18.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look up, i said this already, and actually, annie has the highest win rate in mid lane when using ghost at nearly 57%","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-01-12T07:24:12.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xavanic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TKkN8qNE,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-12T07:22:18.478+0000)\n>\n> look up, i said this already, and actually, annie has the highest win rate in mid lane when using ghost at nearly 57%\n\n54% actually, but close enough.\n\nHer flash ignite has a 52.5% winrate, so I'd say the problem might not be the summoners but actully annie herself?","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2017-01-12T07:25:57.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"annie is an issue, shes in need of nerfs like now, but riot wont address it, but i agree ghost needed a nerf....but in my honest opinion flash should be deleted and mobility skills changed to not scale off cdr","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-01-12T07:39:29.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xavanic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TKkN8qNE,comment-id=0000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-12T07:25:57.330+0000)\n>\n> annie is an issue, shes in need of nerfs like now, but riot wont address it, but i agree ghost needed a nerf....but in my honest opinion flash should be deleted and mobility skills changed to not scale off cdr\n\nGhost is only as strong as it is because it needed to compete with flash.\n\nSo melee champions now won't take it,\n\nWhile it'll still be good on mages.
