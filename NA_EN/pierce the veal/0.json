(So if you enter with your Q in Valor form you can save your E to disengage, still the range is short, but allows you to go safe after risking it all!)\n\nAlso with this on Valor he could **trully fly** (isn't it the whole idea behind Quinn?), spending up to 190 mana to travel a good distance and pass through walls.\n\nLike this you can compense her gameplay withouth affecting her kit and her identity, I can even see her being played on the LCS at the toplane or in the jungle with my proposal!\n\nPlease don't reduce Valor to a taxi cab!

Towers do become more like objectives and less like hulking pieces of steel (that shoot you) and canmt be destroyed for a long time.\n\nI also find the rift crab really interesting, as it means that on a mobile champion you can help all the lanes push. This gives you many different options of play. And it also means adcs need to be more combat focused as towers fall faster (as opposed to being focused on taking towers).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-11-12T20:33:17.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DracoMTA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u3Y8YfGF,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-12T19:41:32.525+0000)\n>\n> It feels like I&#039;m back in season 2 again, where individual contribution matters, and games don&#039;t take 50+ minutes\n\nI'd say season 3, but I completely agree with the sentiment.
