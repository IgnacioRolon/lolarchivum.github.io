They’re simply too easy to take and lead to ridiculous leads between teams. The slightly ahead team taking elder at level 8 and now being 5 level 11’s with elder vs 5 level 8’s is absolute nonsense. It’s instantly gg there. If you’re good at killing turrets?

Nothing spells fun like back to back games with Zed, Shaco, and Yuumi vs Zed, Shaco, and Yuumi. The objectives are over the top, but they're extremely exacerbated on a team of 3-5 S tier URF champions.\n\nThe last ARURF lasted 3 weeks, and I couldn't stop playing it. Two days of this shit and I'm already back to playing other games. Riot should give us a week of ARURF when URF ends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gentleman Yasuo","date":"2019-10-31T06:13:11.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all of those things were not in the original urf","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Juve Homeer","date":"2019-10-30T02:23:16.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"community ask for classic urf \nTHE CLASSIC RIOT{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tr4shB4NSYST3M","date":"2019-10-29T18:14:20.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.
