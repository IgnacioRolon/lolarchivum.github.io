Ever seen a Fiora/Yasuo/Riven 1v5?  (Now dont even get me started on Tristana, her safety is bs)\n\nyes, but ranged champions general safety is usually more reliable and makes them scale better than skirmishers situational safety.\n\nthere is a good reason most skirmishers are played exclusively as split pushers. they suck ass in larger teamfights.\n\non the other hand you have champions like {{champion:18}}  {{champion:67}} who excell at both 1v1 and teamfight scenarios mid to lategame.","replies":[{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-08-05T03:20:41.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Well what use is range if you can just get up in their face? if youre in their face their range is useless, while skirmishers can ALWAYS use their defence","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-08-05T03:24:42.260+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bubbaman73,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vyPRnf5R,comment-id=00020000000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-05T03:20:41.708+0000)\n>\n> Well what use is range if you can just get up in their face? if youre in their face their range is useless, while skirmishers can ALWAYS use their defence\n\nyou cant really always get in their face.\n\nin cases of vayne and tristana its close to impossible in lategame teamfight scenarios unless they make a huge mistake. which is exactly the point i was trying to make, why they outscale skirmishers.\n\npoint and click disengages on top of mobility would do that for you. and generally speaking, ranged champions dont lose strength when theyre fighting in melee range.\n\nvaynes auto attacks wont kill you slower just because youre infornt of her.","replies":[{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-08-05T03:27:38.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"My point is, a skirmishers job isnt to lock down a carry, thats a tanks job.
