Top, Jungle, Mid, AD Carry and Support. Each is vital to the team and equally important, however a vast amount of players don&#039;t believe so. The Support is seen to be inferior, unimportant, unnecessary and a sponge for teammates&#039; hate, salt, frustration and rage. When something goes wrong in the Bot Lane, it is always the Support&#039;s fault, no matter the circumstances. If there is no map control or wards, it is always the Support&#039;s fault. If we cannot save a fellow teammate,  despite our best efforts, it is never enough. \n\nSupport Mains are rare for multiple reasons;\n1. Unpopular for it&#039;s lack of ability to carry and control the game.\n2. Highly dependent on teamwork from the early game, and communication between players.\n3. Perceived to be a liability at times. \n4. Considered to be a &quot;weak&quot; role while the &quot;strong&quot; prevail in other lanes. \n\nWe Support Mains have to put up with a lot, while trying to do our best for the team. In laning phase we protect and provide opportunities for our AD Carries. In Mid-Game we help in ward placement, map control and assisting fellow teammates. We provide so much yet are recognized for so little, to nothing. When we set up plays for our carries, they are praised for getting the kills while we standby and pray we are recognized BESIDE them (not instead of them).  The very nature of the game calls for Supports, those who are willing to provide glory rather than snatch it. We do our best to work with a team that is not guaranteed to be pleased with our plays. \n\nIf you agree with the argument that Supports are trash, garbage and are to blame for every mistake made during a match, give this post an Downvote and continue with your ignorant and arrogant gameplay.\nIf you disagree, and instead believe that Supports are essential, important and should have at least some recognition, please Upvote and share. Support Mains are rare and uncommon for many reasons. So please applaud the ones you find and assist any non-Main playing Support for that match.\n\nI&#039;d love to hear stories, feedback and comments down below. I wanted to at least share and speak for Support Mains in the shadows.\n\nLoving the feedback, arguments and opinions. You guys really progress this discussion and help me understand more.

But that only helps so much if your team can't capitalise on the oppotunity you gave them. That is why a support can't truely carry.\n\nIf you are still a support players chances are you don't need tha accolades or the reconition we do our jobs the best we can.\n\nThe abuse is mostly unacceptable (unless you didn't buy {{item:2049}}), that is kind of true for everything though.\n\nPart of what has made supporting so hard this season is the high mobility meta. I mean you have about half a second to exhaust a fed Zed before your carry is dead, Moakai's and Ekkos diving your carry with no chance for you to respond. Then there was the all TP bot meta, what can you do they will tower dive and they will kill you. (luckily that was nerfed) Then comes the warding negative snowball when the enemy has turbo taken out some towers (again nerfed for worlds) and you can't ward safely anymore. You go to place a ward then enemy lee sin jumps a wall and kills you, you are the only one warding you can't cover everything all the time.\n\nThen you end up 3 levels behind everyone else trying to be everywhere all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2016-09-20T07:28:33.003+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The support role is so unpopular because you need to be able to do a lot with very little. \n\nYour income is much smaller than the rest of the lanes and jungler, therefor what you can buy and at what point in the game you can get it is limited. On top of that, you absolutely need to buy a Sightstone and Oracle Alteration for a variety of reasons. Vision, true vision, map control, etc. Full builds on supports are rare, and that also makes the eye items not as enticing anymore. Slot efficiency isn't our problem.\n\nNot only that, but you need to trust a complete stranger, who usually is a diva that only uses their trinket early game when they forget to ban Blitzcrank. Seriously though, nobody likes how tied to the ADC supports are, and yes there are ways around it, but a huge chunk of your potential is tied to how well your ADC does. To a lesser extent this is true for ADCs, but they still have damage, which means so much in this game. If a support gets someone who is off their game (happens to all of us), then that's a huge blow towards their chances of winning. It's not impossible to come back from a unfortunate ADC plays bot lane, but should it be that difficult for the support? I often see ADCs carry their medicore support with sheer damage. I don't see that happen as often in the reverse.\n\nThen you are always 1-3 levels behind everyone else except the enemy support. This is the worst thing in my opinion. I hate seeing games where I recognize what I have done, even my teammates do, and yet it just doesn't show. I'm still a level behind the enemy 0/5/1 Sion with mediocre farm. How messed up is that?\n\nI don't need players to recognize my hard work. I want the game to do that.\n\nSupports do get blamed a lot for crap that's not in our control, way more than any other role. I don't care what anyone says about that. I don't care about the same 3 support mains that come on here and claim everything is sunshine and roses 99% of the time. It ain't. I've been to Gold, and it's not better, however I can't speak for any higher than that aside from what I see on streams. The highest friend I have that mains support is in Platinum, but the vast majority of us are Gold are below anyways. Overall, I do see supports get the most BS from their teammates. That's just the way it is folks, and it is actually not that hard to understand why they do when you take into consideration everything about the Support role. It is understandable that they're the most likely to get blamed. Players love passing the blame in MOBAs.\n\nBut you know what? That really doesn't bother me. The mute button exists and the likelihood of you running into that fool again is slim. That person that criticizes you for being 0/4 when your full score is 0/4/15 likely isn't going to make it very far, and if they do they'll look back on that moment and cringe. Same with the people who talk about there being no wards on the map when they've only put out 2 or 3 the whole game. **The support is always the easiest scapegoat because the score doesn't always reflect our influence on the game.** \n\nLet's just be honest about that, okay? I don't think that is the reason people give up on the Support role though. If people quit just because of toxic behavior, LoL would have died ages ago along with every other MOBA. Supports may get more of it, but you can come across toxic behavior in every role.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't bad supports, but honestly? Playing a basic functioning support isn't that difficult. Rarely have I seen it played \"badly.\" Meaning they don't even do the bare minimum. I've seen many supports casually sit there, babysit, and ward. When your ADC is demolishing the enemy on their own, that's enough to keep them going. You won't make any amazing plays etc., but I get why people can see that we don't do much when that's a huge chunk of supports I come across. It just won't be enough against a support and ADC that both are actively participating in the game. Half the time that doesn't happen. There just aren't that many true support mains in ranked for the reasons I just listed.\n\nMoving up playing as a traditional support _is_ difficult. If you have good teammates, you can make them great. If you have bad ones, then they usually aren't going to be able to use your abilities to their full potential, which impacts you so heavily. Turning the tides of the game isn't as clear cut as it is with the other roles and you need to be resourceful. You do need to put in a lot more thought to make something like that occur because you do less damage and are usually levels behind. Sometimes I don't think it is possible to do that as Support because the role is so team reliant. In Gold or below you can kill everything or farm and make decent progress. That's not to say you should, because certainly not all games are that one sided, but It is much more simple. If your concern is simply making fast progress in ranked, then I wouldn't look at the support role either.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-09-20T16:01:23.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The support role is highly underwhelming for the vast majority of players. If it wasn't, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.\n\nVery few players log in and want to play a game of \"League of Vision\" where you're trying to keep your wards on the map while also destroying the enemy wards. **That's not fun for a lot of League players, so why would they play a role where that's one of your main duties?**\n\nBeing tethered to another player can make you feel helpless and frustrated if the other player is performing badly. ADCs can subvert this to a point by carrying a bad support through laning phase by simply farming. It's much more difficult to carry a bad ADC as a support. **You can lead a marksman to CS, but you can't make them farm correctly.**\n\nLow gold income and low XP gain cripple the support's power nearly every phase of the game. Generally, a support will be underpowered enough that meeting any opponent in the jungle (other than the enemy support) is a death sentence. **It's not very fun being afraid to venture out alone because there's very little hope of you outplaying and killing (or even escaping) someone who's two levels above you and has double your gold in items.**\n\nThe support is there to make plays that set up kills for the rest of the team, and that by itself (carrying by proxy) makes it far less than desirable. People want to carry themselves most of the time, not ult the enemy team and hope their allies take advantage of the opening to win a teamfight. **Indirectly carrying isn't satisfying for a lot of players.** That's not to say you can't directly carry in the support role, but it's much more difficult most of the time opposed to the other roles.\n\nThe support role is often seen as the weakest link. Top, Mid, and Jungle are all high gold, full XP roles you want your best players in, and (as stated above) a good ADC can carry a bad support though laning phase much easier than vice versa. **The support role generally feels expendable and underappreciated by the team for all the work it does.**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-09-19T15:15:46.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Support is the least important role its also the most boring role \n\n\nSorry to say it but its truth\n\n\nAnd NO supports main get bashed the least compared to other roles\n\n\n\nSupports were more cruical back in season3 when they were just ward bots..

Mages and some tanks overwhelm the bot lane to the point where it's not your bot lane's fault. Sometimes matches are just that unlucky. I wanna point out that sometimes this issue focuses on those game changing supports. Missing a Hook (Nautilus, Thresh, Blitz) or a Bind (Lux, Morgana, Taric, Leona, Zyra) can lead to unnecessary rage. We understand that we missed and that it could've impacted the lane/game. I don't think it's justified to flame players because of it though. You bring up a major issue, I'll applaud you for that.

I still build support on all of them with Ruby sightstone and such to maintain my role as support but i make sure my output is enough to chunk the enemy to low hp so i can spoon-feed my ADC kills. \n   Yes, SPOON-FEED, because AD Cries are little babies who grow up to be beautiful AD Carries when they get items. So i spoon-feed them kills so they get there faster.

In fact even in my worst games where everyone is being toxic toward one another, I am usually the only one who isn't being called trash. Part of that is because I am fairly good at what I do. The other part is I typically don't say anything negative no matter how bad it is. Too often I find that supports (and everyone really) talk too much. That only leads to trouble when things start going bad. Don't blame, take sides, or tell someone how to play their champion and you will get a lot further.\n\nI will say that expectations are becoming increasingly unrealistic these days. I don't recall another season where I have ever had to bail so many people out of avoidable no-win situations. And the amount of healing required in some games is unbelievable. I used to joke about people not dodging skill shots because they have a healer. But people actually seem to be making plays they know they will take needless damage for these days with the assumption that the support will heal them. Going after that last minion knowing you will eat a Lux E for is just poor gameplay.

Or in most cases they're just too damn stupid to win with a broken support like Soraka on their team since they lack the necessary intelligence to kill a single person. These games have to be the worst and they taught me to never ever let someone else take on the responsibility of carrying a game again, since then I've been only playing mid and top laners.\n\nFor one, they'd seriously need to rework their role-system to ever make me consider picking support as a secondary again. Secondly, they'd have to rework the role into something with far greater utility or superior access to vision (maybe an additonal slot for pink wards?).
