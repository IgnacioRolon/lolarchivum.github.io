He made two people queue dodge and almost made me too and this is only what I saw. Seeing this made me wonder if there is any way to report this kind of behavior and if there isn&#039;t made me think there really should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-18T21:40:15.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just need to keep a record of the pre-game chat for when people report.\nEdit: Well, it would also be nice to be able to report someone at that time as well, though that has high potential for abuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Xel Meshif","date":"2016-06-18T21:42:24.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no, if the guy makes so many people dodge he eventually gets mid pick and plays his game normally he will never get reported for this behavior, also even if the chat isn't in the tribunal a lot of people will explain in their report. (but yeah it *would* help, the more the better)","replies":[]}]}]}
