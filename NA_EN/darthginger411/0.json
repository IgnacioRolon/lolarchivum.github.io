It spikes my cpu usage and lags horribly. The game doesn't load until I force close the program and restart it manually. Once in game, It runs ok. If I alt+tab to google chrome or spotify or any program for that matter (windows notifications as well), the game freezes. Once again, I have to force stop and restart. \n\n        All of my drivers are up to date and I've even uninstalled and reinstalled on my solid state M.2. Nothing is working and this problem didn't occur until today, Nov. 30th 2016. When the new client dropped I did notice some issues where the game would lose connection but I was still able to move around but no abilities would pop. Then about ten sec later, everything would pop all at once. I don't know what else to do and any help would be greatly appreciated.\n \n  Edit: I tried the downgrading of my graphics drivers and the problem persists.\nedit: Complete uninstall and removal of the program followed by a fresh install did not solve the issue.\n      I don't use any third party apps (i.e. overwolf, gamecast)\nping: 24\nfps: 264 (uncapped)\nNvidia GeForce Dual GTX 1070 \n32Gb ram\ni7 quad core\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T05:45:02.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The symptoms you described are commonly associated with *Packet Loss*, therefore these issues are related to an *unstable connection* to the servers.
