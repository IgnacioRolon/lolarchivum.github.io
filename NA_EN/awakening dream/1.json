Against it, I have had luck with heavy pokers and sustainers like Sona and soraka. They can heal off his crows while getting in a strong attack causing him to waste Mana on his heal or use pots.\n\nFor adc's auto attacking adc's can't punish well if he walks up, caster adcs and Cait punish him well for walking to e a wave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-30T22:02:50.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont stand near someone when the wave is low, or he can get free 4-6 hit E.\n\nTry to minimize bounces by leading it out of range during travel time, or to an isolated minion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-05-30T21:50:03.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can't, he has a point and click 750 range poke, no adc has this range \n\nwhat i do is I pick rengar adc, his AA from a bush has 700 range, with fiddle's E cast time you can jump on him and oneshot him","replies":[]}]}
