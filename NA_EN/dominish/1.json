Explain it to me? I questioned them something I feel like I had the right to do but there were maybe one or 2 sentences I said that could be considered toxic, yet you went and permanant banned me. This is not NEARLY enough for perma bans. Especially considering i have sent many reports on toxic players which the feedback system said nothing about any sort of penalties on them. Yet because of this you permanantly ban?

Your account was on its final warning, so any breach of conduct would result in a perma. \n\nYou're quick to claim that you weren't insulting, but you're just arguing pedantics at this point. Fact is, you put your teammates on blast the entire game, keeping a constant argument going and making sure that you made as many people upset as you were capable of.

You, me, and every other player in the game has absolutely no way of knowing who does or doesn't get punished. Don't dwell on it so much.\n\n Normal, positive players don't get punished for no reason. You got punished for toxicity (evident by your chat logs), don't try to separate yourself from people who break rules. \n\n>When riot won't try to help the players reform aside from straight up punishing them, how can they expect them to reform and see change in the community?\n\n Why does Riot have to monitor your behavior? At what point do _you_ take responsibility for _your_ actions? \n\n Nobody forced you to call your Karthus a dumbass, nobody forced you to go back and forth with your teammates all game, nobody forced you to even use the chat.

You still haven't been able to clearly deny that as long as you don't do extreme toxic things you have a high chance of getting away with being toxic. Not getting a 14 day ban and you will never get perma-banned. So just don't get a 14 day ban through zero-tolerance phrases and keep limits to toxicity and you can consistently be toxic. These few things is what I have managed to ascertain from your comments, my previous time as a league player before my 14 day ban.
