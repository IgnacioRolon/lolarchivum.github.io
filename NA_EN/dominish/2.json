I&#039;m not sure which one I should get though. I want to get someone that has high attack damage (or ability power) but not someone who would go down really fast when 1v1 full health trade or close combat. I don&#039;t want the champion to be super squishy. The only one from the assassins rework I have is Katarina, all the others I&#039;m comparing who I should get and also thinking about getting Riven. Right now I can only get one champion, so i was hoping advice could be given on best champion with those requirements.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominish","date":"2016-11-11T00:07:18.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would Zed  be any good for these requirements?","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-10T22:16:53.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pantheon\n\nhe acts like an assassin, builds the assassins ad items but is more or a fighter/slayer","replies":[{"poster":"Dominish","date":"2016-11-10T22:31:21.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I want someone from the new Assassin rework or riven.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-10T23:23:29.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then rengar or kha, the leaps are lots of fun\n\nim not too big of a fan of the ap assassins in the update","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2016-11-10T23:18:30.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali and Shaco are both pretty garbo right now so don't go with either of them.
