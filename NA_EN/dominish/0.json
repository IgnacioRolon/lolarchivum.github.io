There is no reconnect. Last game when I just waited, it finally went to the page and it was blank aside from the boxes and background, after a short time, a popup told me the game was no longer running and went to the page that comes after a game finishes. The game didn't actually finish though it just stopped. This was probably my fault but I could do nothing about it as the game doesn't allow me to forcefully go to the loading page. This doesn't happen too often but it could happen on my first game of the day, and again I need a way to connect to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-11T20:53:04.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repair the game by clicking the question mark icon to the top right corner of the patcher and hitting \"Repair\".\n\nLet us know the results.
