I have actually decided to stop playing league of legends until he is nerfed if you dont agree then thats fine but if you ever face him and youll know that nomatter who you play as you wont win in a 1v1 probably will also loose a 2v1 because he can kill you in 2 autos and you cant kill him because he is literally invincible so if you get him down to no health dont worry because hell live and even if your health was full hell still kill you. i hope this is seen. please nerf him because im actually not playing this game anymore because of it. im extremely disappointed in the devs...","replies":[{"poster":"1st Movement","date":"2016-01-21T01:09:05.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won against him 1v1 he's not strong if u know how to play against him","replies":[{"poster":"smartiesgod","date":"2016-01-21T01:22:42.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is im better than almost everyone i get in a game with because ive been playing with my upper level friends i am only lvl 18 but when i have low lvl players on my team feeding him its instant gg thats why i cant wait to be lvl 30","replies":[{"poster":"nerthy","date":"2016-01-21T02:17:44.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play support Morgana and laugh at him while he is stunned for 37272848829 seconds","replies":[{"poster":"smartiesgod","date":"2016-01-21T07:33:38.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i have but he gets so fast that i still couldnt even escape after the stun was over and then even if we attack him while stunned he still becomes invincible at low damage which in my opinion should be removed","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-01-21T01:14:28.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndamere, like a lot of the stat-check-y champs, is a relic of older design ideas that Riot's people had back in the day. There's admittedly something pretty inelegant about a champion just straight up not dying while he beats you down, but Tryn isn't the end all be all of problematic dudes.\n\nI'm going to assume you're a new player and not a smurf, so let me tell you, there are some plenty of ways of dealing with him. Try out Rammus, Malphite, Teemo, Pantheon, and/or Renekton.\n\nAlso, calling for nerfs on something you dislike is the exact opposite of helpful. Just because you'll get loads of upvotes for making hate threads for specific champions doesn't make it a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"smartiesgod","date":"2016-01-21T01:21:17.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright i get what youre saying but when i see match history where everyone else on the enemy team has 2 kills or less and tryn has 27 i get a little cringed","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-01-21T01:30:51.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndamere is something of a pub-stomper at low levels (as well as low elo), much like Yi, RIven,Yasuo, etc. They get much better when a team doesn't know how to deal with them. And let me tell you, the answer to that is \"hard cc and tanks.\" A lot of players don't really get that and make the mistake of trying to 1v1 them, which makes them get fed and then snowball out of control.\n\nThis is going to sound kind of shitty, but the problem isn't so much Tryndamere as it is the lack of knowledge and skill possessed by low level players. And don't worry, that'll come with time and practice.  But until then, if you'll have to find out how to counter these sorts of champions.\n\nThink of your pre-30 levels as a learning experience. None of this matters. Go into each game, try to figure out what the most successful dude is doing, and see if you can stop him from doing that. That might take some research though, which I encourage heartily. Actually, you should also consider trying to replicate what those successful players are doing. Maybe.","replies":[{"poster":"smartiesgod","date":"2016-01-21T02:07:31.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the imput ill keep it in mind","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rG Thundrag","date":"2016-01-21T01:47:16.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anything they should go back to crit damage per rage instead of crit chance.
