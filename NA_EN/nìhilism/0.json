This problem isn't fixed by clicking the 'Retry' Button (obviously) or by restarting the client and re-logging in or restarting the internet. I don't think it could be a problem with any sort of firewall that would affect 1 out of 25 games at random chance? And the problem doesn't seem to be time-specific as it can happen at any time of the day or night and the next game always goes through fine. Now I am put in lower-priority queue and have to wait 10 minutes to play. I would be completely fine with this happening if it just meant a little LP loss and my teammates could remake, but I guess I get reported for this connection issue and put in lower priority because of it. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any fix for this issue/ Has anyone else experienced this sporadic connection issue?\r\n\r\nAlso, I am using the Mac client which may have something to do with it.","replies":[{"poster":"PvtFlowers","date":"2017-08-19T03:39:23.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just had 2 people in the same game have the issue.

Your network sounds like it's degrading, so there's actually a possibility that you'll see more disconnections eventually without resolution.  As a first step, I recommend going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  This will help tune up your network to the game server and help clear out any blocks.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
