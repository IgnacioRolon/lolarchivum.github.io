It would be wonderfull if syndra got different parts of her passive as she leveled up instead of waiting till level 18 to actually have a passive? Please if you could do some testing on PBE, Syndra was an all time main for me last season but frankly is lacking against many champs now, and many champs i found she counters are now difficult to fight as her. {{champion:103}}  much more difficult to fight as syndra since her buffs although she used to counter the %*$& out of her","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-07-10T09:32:54.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about her R bugs?
