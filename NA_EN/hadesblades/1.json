I usually have the login screen muted  but after hearing that Kindred theme on Riot&#039;s SoundCloud.... ITS SO DAMN GOOD! I don&#039;t know who really orchestrates it, or who makes the score for it... but you all have some serious talent! I am so pump for the Virtuoso theme after watching the teaser! &lt;3 keep up the great work and produce more amazing sounds :D \r\n\r\n(time to turn on the login music!)","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-01-11T18:09:26.777+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Deaths Lotus and Tesla Effect,\n\nI wrote both Kindred's music and \"The Mind of the Virtuoso\" (as well as the corresponding Jhin login screen music).\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nThe five of us in the music department would rather sign our work with \"Riot Games\" instead of our names. We're a highly collaborative team, and while we're responsible for writing the notes on an individual level, the feedback that we get from each other is invaluable and helps shape the sound of League's music at large. \n\nCheers,\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"HadesBlades","date":"2016-01-11T19:08:21.724+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"<3 <3 <3 keep up the great work! And I totally understand the reasoning for signing your name with Riot Games, I just wanted to recognize everyone who is in the music department, you all did an amazing job with Kindred and now I'm super excited for Jhin. I just hope you all are getting the type of recognition you deserve! You all are truly fantastic artist. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LF Annie","date":"2016-01-11T23:41:36.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"more music that is like get jinxed pls, if i had a whole game playlist of fast-paced songs like that in league char voices i would have it on loop when playing league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Star GuardÃ­an","date":"2016-01-11T23:16:34.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any advice for a beginner composer?

It will teach you some things about music (not nearly as much as what you learn later on), and certainly not much at all about being a professional musician. Use school for what it does best, but seek out the rest of the story as soon as you can;\n- work on your production chops;\n- be a good communicator (unless you plan on writing concert music exclusively);\n- score reading is the answer to 90% of your musical problems (that too will become more relevant with time);\n- be curious;\n- I wonder what a Jedi knight would answer to that question... perhaps something not too irrelevant!  \n\nGood luck to you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-01-11T00:07:22.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, it would be great if they placed description on their soundcloud music, so that we know who actually made the track.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fuzzyears","date":"2016-01-11T23:57:53.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Diana song just blew me away.
