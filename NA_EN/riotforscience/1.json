However, a lot of it (besides cool details like waterfalls and such), really isn't graphically better. I think this is for 2 reasons:\n\n1) Much of the texturing is like a fairly **plain oil painting**. My thoughts are that this is intentional, as it supports the \"make champions and abilities pop off the map\" thing. So in my opinion that's fine.\n\n2) In many places on the map it looks like you are playing on a **flat game board**. I don't like that at all. It makes me miss the old summoners rift where the walls actually stick out of the ground! The reason I think it looks like this is because of the hand painted map texture that blends the ground into the wall with obvious paintings of fake grass. Attached is a screen shot showing an example of this. The screen shot is from the wall at the mid to wraiths entrance on the blue side.\n\nSo dear Riot, please make the walls pop out of the ground more and actually look like 3D models.

Can't wait for all the new upcoming preseason changes (they all seem wonderful).\n\nTwo little minor things:\n\n1. North of Red base, the shadows from architecture of the base are being cast on the painted background which looks a little strange. Gives the background a really fake \"Truman Show-esque\" feel lol. I'm not sure if this is an artifact with my specific video settings (currently have environment details on either medium or high, shadows on low).\n\n2. Could the minion shots (the little dots the shoot) be made brighter or more noticeable? They are very tiny and barely noticeable. Once again this may be an artifact of the video settings maybe?

Add the fact that** all details got removed** on the paths themselves (which creates gameplay problems e.g. range indicators for tower AA) and the game feels like I take some action figure and pout it on my desk, totally fake.\nRiot sold us so many times the (imo nice idea) of 4 different colors for the jungle, but implementing them and then decreasing the overall saturation makes no sense at all.\nI really didn't want to say it that harsh, but I actually **HATE **it. I'd rather play on the classic +3 years old map than this one and that's something to think about really.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it has **A LOT OF POTENTIAL** but **LESS IS NOT ALWAYS MORE**.\n\nI don't see why we get all this clarity speech every time we complain about it. It feels like Riot is trying to force us to believe that's a good thing. The only ones I can imagine that can't see what is going on in the game are potential new players that have never seen a single game before and watch a LCS match for the first time, we don't wanna get our experience as the actual players destroyed because of this. After playing a few games on it, most people in the chat agreed with what I said.\n\n\n**On the positive side**, the top left corner of the map looks amazing (unfortunately it doesn't matter since you don't play on it).\nAlso the new minions and monsters look awesome, but the minion projectiles look weird and need to be tweaked a bit. The Dragon and Baron animations are cool and so are the tentacles Baron shoots out of the ground. The towers are also very nice and in general I prefer the red side. The little things like the firefly in the brush are nice ideas, unfortunately in contrast to the grey bushes they fly next do, they look as dead as the pixels that they are.\n\nhmm, I didn't intent to make such a big post about it, but I guess that shows how I really feel about it and the constant clarity this clarity that speeches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"asdbnmrty","date":"2014-11-13T23:48:17.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A thing I noticed was positioning on Razorbeak chicken things (Wraith camp previously).

Here is my detailed 'issue' with the new update.\n\nMy problem with the new update is the 'active' vs. 'inactive' art.  \n\nWhat do I consider 'active' art?  Champions, NPC's, Turrets, Inhib's....\nWhat do I consider 'inactive' art?  The entire ground/floor of the map, most of the jungle...you get it.\n\nThe choice to go with a more washed out, colder color palette is fine. My problem is with the definition and depth of it all.  If you look at all 'active' art in the game, you'll notice that they all have various thicknesses of 'edge work' or an outline to them...to me this gives depth and make these objects pop!  \n\nBut if you look at the 'inactive' art, and lets use the ground here as a perfect example, its completely flat.  Although there is a ton of detail on the ground, it completely lacks any sort of 'edge work'.  This is especially apparent in both home bases where there is a ton of rock and stone and yet there is no black outline (edge work) to this art.  Its just flat.  Even the old map had good black edge work to almost create the illusion of depth to these objects...\n\nAll I ask is that this is read and considered, because of right now, it just doesn't match 100% and this game is to damn good to mess up its design cohesiveness.\n\nIf everything I've said has been addressed in other posts or there are updates that I have missed, I do apologize!\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Undeniable Logix","date":"2014-11-15T00:35:40.073+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just read some posts below mine and what do you know, this gentleman - CrucifiXion1337 - seems to see eye to eye with me.

The thick outlines are supposed to make champions pop because Riot said they wanted champions to be seen before the environment. A while ago, they said they wanted the map itself to be the last thing people see when things get crazy. To this end, they washed out the color pallet, and reduced/removed outlines and boarders on the environment while keeping these things on champions. This would make champions pop out during fights and put the map out of mind.\n\nedit: they also said that champion abilities are supposed to be the number one visual priority on this map.

The areas you can move should stay washed out for sure but the walls and boundaries could use a bit more contrast or color variety added to them. Walls and boundaries are just as important as abilities and vfx in certain situations. Many of the same values and colors can be found in the walls and floor, especially in the blue buff areas. Blue and green are to close together, they blend together to well which results in a flattening effect between the extruded rocks, plants, and features alongside the floor in those areas. If the rocks and plants in those areas were given some yellow undertones to help pull the greens further from the blues It could liven the terrain up a bit without blowing out the contrast. The red buff areas are great as they are though.\n\nCould you post a screenshot of the problem areas. We want to keep those boundaries as clear as possible, if there is progress we can make in that area we want to move on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-11-19T00:32:32.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are the 3 spots I see as blurry as to what is wall and what is floor. when just looking at them they seem pretty obvious what is walkable area and what is wall but in the middle of a fight when you are more focused on your  and the opponents spells and animations the floor and wall can start to blend.\n\n1. the path right above tribrush on blue sides blue buff area. the purple tones and their patterning are to similar to each other as well as the greens, you might get confused into thinking you can move halfway up the tallest tree before reaching impassable wall.\n\n2. red side blue buff area, river entrance closest to mid lane. the dark green tone that marks the end of the floor and the beginning of the wall flows right into the pine tree giving the illusion that you can move halfway up the tree before hitting wall space when it is actually the small shrubbery under the tree, which gets lost, that marks the start of the wall.\n\n3. red side blue buff area, The pine trees behind wolf den. Like number 1, the same colors and values can be found on the floor and in the trees giving the illusion that you could move halfway up the first pine tree again.\n\nThese are the 3 spots that I see as needing a bit more done. I ran around the entire map quite a bit testing the lighting and illumination effects and these are the spots that I considered grey areas in terms of floor and wall boundaries.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
