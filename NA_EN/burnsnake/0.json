The cursor (target indicator and how you click on things), minimap icons, menu, chat and the shop are about 1/4 the size of what they should be. This makes the game REALLY hard because its hard to read and things are very hard to click on. Can anyone please help fix this problem i'm having.","replies":[{"poster":"BurnSnake","date":"2016-11-11T01:58:54.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nvm i fixed it, THANKS SO MUCH!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurnSnake","date":"2016-11-11T01:04:36.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, i changed in game resolution to 1920x1080 and the DPI and it fixed everything but the cursor.

You may need to reduce your resolution down to 1920x1080 at most.  This can also be caused by any third party programs for league that you might have active, and removing that may help.  Finally, you can adjusting your DPI settings:  \n\nRight click the LoL icon -> Properties -> Compatibility Tab -> Check the \"Disable Display Scaling on High DPI Settings\" Box.\n\nIf those steps don't help, then it may be necessary to try another monitor.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
