Meaning she is balanced to not even have it in the first place due to the buffs she got on her R. It's just there to kind of exist for the sake of her dragon theme, although 25 armor/MR in a good game is somewhat substantial. That being said, if you have such huge dragon control to get that much armor/MR, you don't need them to win in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2017-09-05T13:15:36.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she got more different buffs from drakes people would complain that its even more rng dependend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-09-05T13:19:26.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her real passive is the bonus damage to dragons. It lets her solo the dragon at level 3 or 4, which is especially great in low ranks where nobody gives a damn about the dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2017-09-06T04:55:27.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She used to be able to kill dragon faster back when she had that 20% bonus damage on her W (especially before that hard nerf to her Q ratio) so really that added bonus damage is more of trying to give a little bit of damage back to her for dragon. She still doesn't kill dragon super fast or healthy at those levels and there are other junglers who can take dragon at level 3 (maybe even level 2 for some) without even losing as much health as Shyvana.\n\nWon't deny that it's good when in low ranks since people don't check the dragon pit as often but I'm sure when you get to at least Gold+ the dragon pit would be warded a lot during the early game to stop that early dragon stacking for Shyvana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2017-09-05T13:21:17.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also makes her and mordy one of the most obnoxious lategame \"duos\", as not only do their kits synergize super well together but the sheer amount of \"stats\" they get off one drag can often make objective-focused games impossible to win for the enemy.","replies":[]}]}]}
