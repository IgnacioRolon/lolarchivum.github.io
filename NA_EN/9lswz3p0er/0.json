Basically i was searching through the web and was looking to buy a league of legends account since i was once a player way back in season 2/3 but lost and dont remember my password and username. I didn&#039;t want to create a new account and grind to level 30 again because that just takes a lot of time along with buying champions and runes and all that. So, I went on onto this website saw this account for sale. The name had me hooked off rip because I like the Japanese Anime Naruto so the name Hyuga Neji was pretty awesome, and it was explained to have about 80+ champions and many skins on the account including the pulse fire ezreal skin. (ez is my main / favorite champion) The account honestly could not have sounded any better for me so I spent the requested 50 dollars on it and turns out it has been perma banned. Im beyond angry that their end of the bargin was fufilled but not how i imagined... Personally im really not one to hold a grudge though so i dont want to pursue anything serious i just want to play league again... Also, losing 50 dollars for nothing would really be an inconvenience to my bank account. I just want to continue on with my life and play some league. (with learning to never go on a website i dont know again lol #trolled). But if it was possible, i would like to know if the perma ban could be lifted since i did just spend my money on it (like a noob) , and i was not the original owner of the account when it was banned. I log in for the first time and the first thing i see is &quot;you have been permanently banned..... RITO PLEASE HELP ME ENJOY THIS GAME LIKE THE OLD DAYS #MakeLeagueGreatAgain  new ez splash looks good btw :D","replies":[{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2016-12-13T21:23:59.512+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if you still have the email address for your original account, you can probably submit a support ticket to get your original account back. Try that instead of buying accounts, they're sketchy and you can almost expect the account to be permabanned because of how they grind them (having AI play on the account). These for-sale accounts have AI play them in Normal games in Twisted Treeline, which means that they're probably getting reported nearly every game because it's beyond obvious when someone is a bot player.
