I strongly suggest reaching out to a tier 2 tech at Shaw while providing this trace so they can investigate.\n\nLet me know if you have any other concerns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"eXaltedReyA","date":"2016-10-25T21:28:14.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is also happening to me as well.

Same thing happened with Rogers for months, then fixed itself for a couple weeks, and then again happened and is still happening.\n\nHow fast can you change your IP address (restart your router) when you get into game? This will usually force it to take a better route (for whatever fucking dumb reason). I can do it fast because I use an APN and have access to two APNs. If I wasn't on LTE I'd be fucked and unable to do that.","replies":[]}]}
