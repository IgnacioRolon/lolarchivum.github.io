In average i disconnect once every second game I play, and it is really frustrating.\r\n\r\nAnyone have an idea of what I might be doing to avoid these disconnect issues? \r\nI have been trying to reset my router, but that did not have any effect..\r\n\r\nWould be really glad if anyone could help me out!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-31T02:12:10.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's some pretty good average ping so I don't believe this is coming from your internet speeds at all.
