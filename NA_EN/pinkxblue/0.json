In Janna&#039;s art she looks pretty sad (dead inside and serious). If you look in the background, you see 4 stars. This scene is from Janna&#039;s old team. She was watching as the last of her team (Jinx {{champion:222}} &#039;s spirit) died and is working on covering up the guardian spirit escape (to find the new guardians) as well as her own escape (to prepare the new guardians for the battle against whatever her team had just faced and lost to).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLux&#039;s {{champion:99}}  guardian spirit was the first to die and her star is the one farthest to the right. This is why she was seen first and was looking up as the rest of the team got to her location. Lulu {{champion:117}}  and Poppy&#039;s {{champion:78}}  guardian spirit died next and headed out. Jinx&#039;s {{champion:222}} spirit was the last to die and is why she was the newest member of the team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis leads to believe that whatever they fought was something that could consume the guardian spirit since Janna {{champion:40}} is protecting and concealing their escape to prevent them from being followed.\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, I thought this would be the first meeting with lux {{champion:99}} , but there are 4 stars in the background and the night they landed to meet lux {{champion:99}} there were no clouds. An argument could be made that Janna summoned the clouds to hide their arrival, but again, there are 4 stars in the background.\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts? Or am I just crazy?  {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"dragon1xx","date":"2016-09-20T03:01:36.042+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"We all know the old team....\n{{champion:6}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:44}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prynce","date":"2016-09-20T00:09:46.598+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"On further note, I theorize that Janna actually got her team killed.\n\nJust like she does in Solo Queue. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"ValentineVxx","date":"2016-09-20T01:04:33.861+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is the best moment to remind us that in Yasuo's lore, the elder was killed by a **wind** technique.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2016-09-20T02:03:07.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Early concepts of Aurelion Sol had an ionian storm dragon in mind that exists to spread chaos and imbalance over Ionia (see SG Udyr comic for reference).
