Squishies being able to dive turrets is the issue. \r\n\r\nDiving is an important part of a tanks job, and especially as a Gangplank player I get dived all the time. I don&#039;t feel salty at all if a jungle sejuani comes from behind my tower and her and the riven dive me, I can live with that and I shrug. But when a lee sin or kayn pops over the wall and THEY dive me at full hp under turret, take 5 hits and then make a clean escape at 10 minutes thus taking my tower, I just die a bit inside.  If I fuck up or I&#039;m low health whatever, but this happens ALL the time and its not hard. \r\n\r\nTowers should provide safety, and they don&#039;t. \r\n\r\nAlso I feel I am not given chance to group as I need to baby sit my squishy turret. A couple of games ago at about 15 minutes in I went to group with my team mid, and we won a 4v5 fight, killing two of them and losing one person and taking the mid turret. However, during that time their 1/4/0 Malzahar had destroyed both of my full health top lane turrets and just about escaped by the time I got to him. If he took the one turret I&#039;d be like fine because its a trade-off but they got the better deal because I needed to group to help my behind team.\r\n\r\nOne thing I could suggest is that at a start we need laser turrets back. Bases are so easy to siege now its absurd. Another thing I&#039;d suggest is maybe increasing the other towers&#039; rate of fire. I say this because tower agro is really easy to abuse, and if the rate of fire is up (even if the damage has to go down a bit to compensate) then maybe If a kayn for example uses his ult to drop agro it will be sooner before the riven/pantheon etc takes aggro and starts to be punished for diving me. \r\n\r\nSorry if I have repeated myself or explained myself poorly I haven&#039;t the time to proof read. \r\n\r\nP.S I have no issue with Riven specifically she is just being used as an example.","replies":[{"poster":"EkyonKun","date":"2017-12-04T18:34:57.956+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've suggested this before, but what if towers provided base armor penetration?

Though I'd honestly rather see an overhaul rather than just a minor edit. Riot seems to treat the system like a frail pane of glass they'd rather not risk breaking, and for a number of reasons, I can see why. But with the ham fisted approach many players are able to get away with in order to push the game into their favor, the current turret system is laughable at best.\n\nMy last Yorick game? I took away 25% of an enemy's turret's hp away with one Q, thanks to the new rune system. This isn't URF.

It feels like it takes them far too long to fix things. Look at ezreal or malzahar. I know nerfs are coming but Ezreal was easily hotfix worthy yet left to ruin the game for another two weeks. Towers have barely improved if at all (that 10% minions damage change was not at all necessary, the change p much cancelled the tower buff out). Bruisers have been in the gutter for ages now and they say they acknowledge it but have took one meaningful step toward it (new Sterak) and ironically whilst thats helped one issue (weak itemisation) its added to another (their items being super expensive). Same with ADCs, who have seen little to no changes and forced a PTA nerf because they were abusing it when it was a crutch for old Fervor users, without just thinking WHY NOT NERF IT FOR RANGED CHAMPIONS. They're also adding crit scaling to fleet footwork so that's now again being skewed to being adc specfic. \n\nAlso alarming that I feel changes during preseason so far have been very few and weak, and we are half way through it.

When you combine that into such huge chunks, the effect is too immediate. Imagine being the player at that tower, defending a seemingly healthy tower. Then suddenly, that health is gone that one instance, no warning, nothing. Yorick can tower push, but while I am aware of the meta that Riot is leaning towards, that's just unfair to the enemy team. I felt no joy in destroying their towers, I felt lazy. Nothing rewarding comes from playing against a team that can't fight back, and subsequently ruining what fun that team had as a result, due to how severely lopsided the fight was.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2017-12-05T05:05:01.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"On the other side though if you catch Yorick out in his split push....he HAS to fight you.
