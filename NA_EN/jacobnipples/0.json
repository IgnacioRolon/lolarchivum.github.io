With that said, I agree with the larger point, and I think that nerfing exceptionally powerful marksmen would increase the win rates of those who are underperforming: marksmen are perhaps the most isolated class in the game when it comes to balance, because they occupy a position on the map reserved for them, which they occupy on both teams in every game, and which pits one against the other. Effectively, the vast majority of marksmen are only balanced relative to other marksmen in terms of direct win and play rates, so their aggregated balancing tends to be zero-sum within the class, something that cannot be said for any other. With exclusively bot lane marksmen like Jinx, her win rate is low only because the win rate of other marksmen is so high, and buffing her to their level will only lead to more champions suffering indirectly as a result.\n\nBecause of this, I think it should be important to not only check the win rates of marksmen (which, in this particular scenario, tend to give off the wrong information), but also check the win rates of marksmen against teams _with no marksmen at all_. Though data for that currently seems to be lacking due to the extreme rarity of those scenarios (which should itself be worrying), I can safely bet that their win rates in those situations would skyrocket. While there are a lot of factors that could explain that (marksmen are the best objective-takers, and objectives are essential in League), the net result would nonetheless be that marksmen possess power that makes them essential to every team, which is detrimental to diversity. Imposing meaningful tradeoffs to that power, sharing that power with other classes, or otherwise establishing a situation where marksmen are no longer mandatory (but still viable and picked frequently) is a step Riot needs to take if they want to engineer a more diverse and balanceable environment.","replies":[{"poster":"jacobnipples","date":"2018-01-19T01:45:48.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try to avoid \"everyone complains about X\" myself, I hate to have used it here.
