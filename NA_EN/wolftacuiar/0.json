From the beginning, this game has been as difficult as NONE OTHER to play, and I don't mean skill-wise, but technically-wise. Patcher feelin' lazy today? Leaves you stuck at 99% forever. League isn't warming up to your ISP? Get bombarded with a billion issues you didn't even know exist.\r\n\r\nThis time, for me, it was packet loss. The kind of problem where you see the team fight going on, you see the enemy coming for you, your ping and the heavens are on your side and you know what you have to do, but no matter how much you click or pray, your champion just doesn't give a crap. After pulling several arguments with my ISP, performing hundreds of tests that only assure me everything is FINE, and getting blamed for something that's not my fault, I'm done trusting Riot and I'm done wasting my time raging over a marvelous game that simply doesn't want to be played.","replies":[{"poster":"Atharun","date":"2015-03-27T22:02:49.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dartagnan, I too have been experiencing this to much frustration.

Your trying to fix the single issue is only salt in the wound, because you guys can't keep track of what the hell you're dealing with. No other online game has such persisting issues with connectivity. On launch, sure, every MMO(FPS/RPG/MOBA) has issues, that should/will be worked out given time.
