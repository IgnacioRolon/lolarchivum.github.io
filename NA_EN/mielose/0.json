I believe Udyr is all about control and mastering spirits, using his acquiring to overcome the enemy, but I think his kit doesn’t frame the full potential of the champion hence why he is often left behind in the present and past metas. \n\nUdyr changes have been stagnant over the last seasons (I believe the last major change he received was in patch 7.8). As of right now, he’s pretty much stuck in the realm of the forgotten champions with a 0.91% pick rate in jungle, ranking 36 out of 39 on the play rate ladder according to op.gg statistics. My goal with this post would be to propose an overhaul that makes his kit more appealing in team comps while giving him unique traits that would bring diversity to his playstyle without drastically impacting his core. I strongly believe a full update would negatively affect the bond Udyr enthusiasts built over the years in addition to putting the champion in an unstable state similar to the one of the Darkin Blade we've seen in the past. \n\n\nAccording to his bio:\n>_Udyr is more than a man; he is a vessel for the untamed power of four primal animal spirits. When tapping into the spirits’ bestial natures, Udyr can harness their unique strengths: The tiger grants him speed and ferocity, the turtle resilience, the bear might, and the phoenix its eternal flame. With their combined power, Udyr can turn back all those who would attempt to harm the natural order._ \n\n\n Below are my ideas to render him a unique kit that suits his need for farming, individual plays and group plays while leaving weaknesses for the enemy to exploit and play around.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n** {{champion:77}}  ABILITIES **\n================\n\n**PASSIVE – Monkey’s agility**\nEntering a stance grants Udyr 10% attack speed and 5 bonus movement speed for 5 seconds. This effect stacks 3 times.\n\n\n**Q - Tiger Stance:**\nUdyr gains bonus attack speed for 5 seconds.\nWhile in Tiger Stance, Udyr’s first and every third basic attack after that are Tiger Strikes which deal an additional physical damage over 2 seconds. Successive Tiger Strikes against the same target will instantly deal all remaining damage of the previous instance in addition to applying a new one.\n\n**Q NEW – Perfected Tiger Stance**\n**On a second consecutive activation**, Udyr consumes the Tiger spirit, earning its wrath. Udyr **refreshes** Tiger Stance attack speed buff and his **next basic attack** will perform a **Tiger Strike**. The strike will impair the enemy champion, **reducing his damage dealt** from all sources by a certain amount. The ability then goes on a higher cooldown.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**W - Turtle Stance:**\nUdyr shields himself for for 5 seconds. While in Turtle Stance, Udyr's first and every third basic attack after that heal him for 2.5% of his maximum health, increasing to up to 5% based on his missing health.\n\n**W NEW – Perfected Turtle Stance:**\n**On a second consecutive activation**, Udyr masters the wisdom of the Turtle spirit. Udyr’s aura grants a **decaying shield** for him and his allies. The ability then goes on a higher cooldown.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**E NEW - Bear Stance:**\nUdyr conquers the bear’s destructive instinct, inspiring fear in his preys’ soul. Udyr growl slows any champion in its path. Udyr gains increased movement speed and ignores unit collision for a certain number of seconds.\n\n**E NEW – Perfected Bear Stance: **\n_Essentially the old Bear Stance, I felt it had a better synergy on the second activation instead of the first._\n\n**On a second consecutive activation**, Udyr **refreshes** his movement speed bonus from Bear Stance. Udyr dashes slightly forward when attacking a target while the buff is still active, and only when he stuns the target. While in Bear Stance, Udyr’s basic attacks stun the target for 1 second. This effect cannot occur on the same target for the **rest of the buff**. The ability then goes on a higher cooldown.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**R Phoenix Stance:**\nUdyr unleashes pulsing waves of fire around himself for 4 seconds, dealing magic damage each second to all nearby enemies for the duration. While in Phoenix Stance, Udyr's first and every third basic attack after that send out a cone of flame in front of him that deals magic damage.\n\n**R NEW – Perfected Phoenix Stance:**\n**On a second consecutive activation**, Udyr surrounds himself with the eternal flames, launching himself in the sky and crashing down after a very small delay, knocking up nearby **units** upon landing. The ability then goes on a slightly higher cooldown. The ability should look similar to old Aatrox’s Q: Dark Flight.\n \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**/!\\ NEW  PASSIVE – Overwhelmed by Spirits:**\nMy last concern is about adding a new passive (Overwhelmed by Spirits) **if need be**, preventing Udyr from overwhelming the enemy by his relatively low cooldowns or if his kit proves to prevail over the enemy in every situation.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Sync with Sylas**\nSylas should be able to choose between all 4 Perfected Stances.\n\n\n\nFinally, I believe it is time for my lasting impression. By adding a second layer of abilities to his kit, the player now must make a choice between empowering or switching stance, making the gameplay more thoughtful and interactive. These choices in critical situations will distinguish a good Udyr from a bad Udyr, but also give the player more purpose in team fights, either to act as an engage, an assassin, or a support.\n\n\nThank you for reading and feel free to notify me if you find any typo, I will correct it. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} .

Udyr's best aspect at the current moment is being able to chain forms and swap on the dot. This puts too much emphasis in consecutive buffs, not to mention losing out on Monkey Stance.","replies":[{"poster":"Mielose","date":"2019-02-28T22:41:28.022+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your point however I just wanted to clarify certain things. Depending on the mana cost and the cooldown of the consecutive stance, always going for the consecutive would weight him down, hence forcing Udyr to swap between tier 1 stance for a better sustain and jungling performance (because the tier 1 cooldowns wouldn't be affected by the change), therefore making a better use of Monkey's agility passive. But yeah, for teamfights and 1v1 you would want to give priority to the consecutive buffs for the max output. \n\nTL DR : tier 1 would be better on long term (jungling and movement) and consecutive would be better on short term (fights and ganking).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dessus lui","date":"2019-03-02T20:07:13.555+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This concept has really good potential.  Although, having the options between a damage reduction debuff, an aoe shield and an aoe knockup would be EXTREMELY unbalanced in the hands of players who master him or who have very good game sense.  Having all these different choices to counter different comps and champions would make him way more versatile than he needs to be to be balanced.  An idea cam to mind when reading this post: once level 6, Udyr would get a choice of 1 perfected stance, similarly to {{champion:121}} 's ultimate upgrade.  Although, unlike {{champion:121}} , {{champion:77}}  would choose 1 perfected stance per game (level 11-16 would just upgrade the stats of the chosen stance).  Therefore, making him choose 1 of the perfected stances rather than having all of them would leave options to the player without having too many of them, giving him a better kit in teamfights and far more fun and interactive to play with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quáx","date":"2019-02-28T20:09:46.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that instead of him being able to simply harness 4 primal spirits, they should give him multiple ideas. Lets say you level  your Q and it has 3-4 different types of stances you can choose from, you level up your W first time, you have 3-4 stances you can choose from, and same with E and R. I just want a bit more variety in Udyr since as a main of the man bear pig, I feel he's too restricted to abilities and their strengths.","replies":[{"poster":"Unionize","date":"2019-03-01T02:15:42.755+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case wont certain stances become the meta while others are simply weaker? Everyone will just go to the damage and tank stances, unless there is a major balancing factor then we'll just end up with more dead stances and that's not what Udyr needs right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-03-01T01:39:12.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"_**Trick2G would like to know your location**_","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightFalll","date":"2019-02-28T23:24:26.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know there is something that I don't get,\n{{champion:34}} =Pheonix\n{{champion:106}} =bear\nbut \n{{champion:516}} doesn't = turtle/tiger\n\nSo, if {{champion:77}}  gets a rework will we get goat stance?","replies":[{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2019-02-28T23:40:02.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ram actually and it says in his story that he can, in fact, take the shape of a giant ram.

This slightly reminds me of the enhancing power Kai'Sa and Kha'Zix currently have, although more temporary. A good idea nonetheless.\n\nMaybe something more in lined with deciding one path to master and based around it's ability for team-play. Essentially an ultimate ability.\n\n* Bear: A stunning (or displacing) charge attack.\n* Tiger: A leaping attack which allows Udyr to gap-close.\n* Turtle: A turtle which spawns and provides an AOE shield. The turtle can be killed, but will despawn after a while.\n* Phoenix: A target-able bird that does AOE damage. Basically the same as the turtle, but does damage rather than shield.\n\nRight now, he's in a decent spot from my point of view, but he doesn't seem to have enough team-fighting potential and the kit could be considered outdated compared to how most new champions and reworks have been going. \n\nOverall, I don't really think he needs any changes, except his sandals. Please buff his sandals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimlock840","date":"2019-02-28T21:47:25.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the suggested changes to bear stance would kill udyr as a champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"IkBenShteen","date":"2019-02-28T21:36:57.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason why Udyr isn't changed is because he's still kind of viable in the current meta.
