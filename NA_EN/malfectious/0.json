It restores 25% missing mana whenever the echoes proc pops against a monster.\n\nIt could honestly be better than it is, but I don't think that this is the biggest issue with the item. It lacks CDR (which _all_ of its predecessors, which were Spirit of the Spectral Wraith, Magus, and Runeglaive for those who don't remember, had), and Magic Penetration, two stats which mages both love just as much as mana. Given how abundant CDR is right now, I feel like the best way to buff it would be to give it Magic Pen, but that could send {{champion:28}} over the top (she's basically the only viable AP Jungler at all right now, which is pretty sad). \n\nIt would do a lot to help champs like {{champion:90}}, {{champion:134}}, and {{champion:245}} who have always had viable niches in the jungle in the past, and I think it would do to help struggling AP Junglers like {{champion:60}} and {{champion:9}} as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-04-21T14:31:51.560+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact, runic echoes suck and the secret strategy with coping in jg as a mage is to go lost chapter since it gives all the stuff a jg mage wants early, like AP and mana. For less gold than runic echoes. And no need for stupid things like hunter's machete and red/blue smite to clutter up your no-auto high CC mage.\n\nAnother fun fact: dorans ring will no longer require minion kills. And it's mad efficient. Healthier clears, decent AP, I think the mana regen stacks if you really need it.\n\nTalisman -> 0 - 2 dorans rings depending on how sucky your mage pick is with early game jg clears -> Lost chapter -> mana item -> sell talisman later imo is a lowkey op build","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2018-04-21T15:27:36.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've also done Tear of the Goddess on certain champions in previous seasons since the mana cost discount stacks really nicely with the passive regen of Hunter's Talisman, even though most of the AP champions I played in the jungle were bad with it.
