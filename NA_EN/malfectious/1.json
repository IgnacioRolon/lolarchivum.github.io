So mostly I play norms...but I do try out ranked when I&#039;ve had the chance to get a few matches in. It always feel like the attitude of the people in ranked is terrible,  it makes those matches so much harder then they need to be. I the 20 or so ranked matches I&#039;ve played this season, more then half of them have had loud mouthed flaming players who are making terrible decisions, then blaming everyone else.  I wouldn&#039;t think I have had half as many people act so childish is more then 100 norms.  Do I think I am a great player, no, do I think I&#039;m good enough to play in bronze without getting treated garbage, yes. Why is it rhat ranked seems to bring out the worst in people?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-01T14:04:50.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because everyone wants to be the carry and doesn't want others to ruin their games even if it means ruining others... some superior sense of self that comes from being behind a computer screen\n\n\nEtc... things things similar to what i said.. things things.","replies":[]}]}
