What is your internet speed normally? 2. Your computer says it is only using 10% of its power because your network card can handle 10X the data that is currently passing through it. \n3. your game isn't downloading slow, for having an internet speed of 9MBps/900kbps your game is downloading and installing at a pretty decent rate. \nIf you are downloading at about a megabyte per second. It would still take 1024 seconds which would mean 17 minutes to download a gigabyte. If the game is around 6GB then that would make perfect sense taking as long to download the game as it was for you because it would take 1:42 to download the game at a perfect consistent speed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-08T23:24:45.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nFirst off, welcome to League! :)\n\nThe patching process after installing the launcher can take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of hours depending on a lot of factors. These can include physical distance from the patching servers, the route your ISP takes to the servers, local bandwidth, ISP bandwidth, and disk speed/condition. My recommendation is to be patient with the patching process, and if you notice it hanging or crashing anywhere, let me know and I'll be happy to assist you in resolving it. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
