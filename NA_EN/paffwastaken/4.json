It had a lot to do with him insulting players on twitter, an odd SJW type of behavior, refusal to communicate with mains or players of champions he was working on while joking about them. He was responsible for the Rengar rework, the Leblanc Rework, the Akali mini rework, a lot of work on Karma, and a few others, but those three are by far his most notable. \n\nThe bias was obvious. He also worked on Ahri and I remember that he had *THREE* potential mini reworks for her that they said they wanted to see what Ahri players thought of. The Leblanc, Rengar, and Akali changes just appeared and were pushed despite nobody wanting them/thinking they were a good idea. In the process he actually used his twitter to occasionally trashtalk the players who complained about his ideas and balance changes. Older Karma mains also have it out for him because he is essentially the reason why Karma is as bland and uninteractive as today.\n\nI’ve done a lot of digging but it appears that Riot and he have done a lot of work to clear up much of what he said and did. You can still find a lot of complaints about his work in history but it’s really hard to find out the exact things he said that lead up to his being fired. Essentially he insulted a ton of players and then pointed fingers at both Riot and the players for being a patriarchy yada yada yada. Basically self destructed.\n\nEdit: there’s a decent chance this post might be deleted because it just airs some of Riot’s dirty laundry.
