I imagine the struggle the new players must go through today to buy the expensive champs who looks interesting to them. Like, they either want to get really really lucky in the level-up boxes or keep themselves from buying any other cheaper champions just to have this occasion. And now, if this happens, they&#039;ll have to either wait or rush to get what they want, their excitation of buying THE champion they wanted quickly murdered by this crappy system. This is not fun at all, this system is a direct downgrade, a frustrating concept and, most of all, less rewarding than before, like it has been proved several times by other players","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech OwI","date":"2017-12-27T00:37:13.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get some for free if you give Rito a LoL-related drawing.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-12-27T01:26:41.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"are they doing it for be i thought that was only for rp because rp cost real money","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobeyashi","date":"2017-12-27T12:47:55.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only works one time tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2017-12-27T00:45:43.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we take the same example mentioning new players, I don't think that those who just joined the community would know about this functionality","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech OwI","date":"2017-12-27T01:17:38.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe, maybe not.
