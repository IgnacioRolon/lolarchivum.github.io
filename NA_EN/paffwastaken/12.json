Yeah, that's what I'm complaining about actually: those buffs were actually pretty ok-ish compaired to things we've got in the past (think about Galio who got WAY bigger buffs but who got a pretty similar jump in efficiency when he got his AP ratios buffed), yet, the jump in her winrate and usability is insanely high. This is pretty much related to the fact that the biggest thing that those buffs brought to her was attention from players who'll try her out for once. everyone has been acting like she was one of the weakest things ever, but her pickrate was so abysmal that it didn't really matter. The biggest buff she got was the increase of pickrate, meaning that she was already pretty damn good before hand, before a certain Juggernaut was reworked into a brand new kit that pretty much anyone who lost to him didn't fully understand yet. The thing is that whenever Karma is not getting attention, her pickrate is low and people consider her bad. but as soon as she gets popular and utterly broken because of it, she explodes everything in the meta and nobody bats an eye and it'll probably stay this way until some major tournaments of pro-play gets a 100% pick/ban rate on her. This is literally the same thing that happened with top Viktor: he never had any direct buffs, but the more his pickrate rised, the more his winrate got insane. It stayed this way until Korea pro-players 100% pick/banned him and at this point he was already sitting on a near 56% winrate.\n\nPeople should stop putting champions who are under the spotlight alone under the nerf guillotine (Morde) when there's several others who deserves to be put under it too (therefore, not excluding Morde, but including him)","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-06-23T01:32:23.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you've got it entirely backwards.

Yes, Karma's winrate is obscenely high right now, but that doesn't mean Mordekaiser was in a balanced state as a result.\n \n Secondly, Morde **just** got hotfixed, his passive and base stats were reduced so hopefully he should fall back in line. Karma just received buffs and they were clearly too much, so given a bit of time she'll be hotfixed or nerfed accordingly.\n\nEdit: Hey, fun fact, here's confirmation of an incoming Karma nerf that you could have found yourself if you bothered to check: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/karmamains/comments/c1vcpt/karma_nerf_planned_for_913/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link","replies":[{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2019-06-23T00:48:03.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Edit: Hey, fun fact, here's confirmation of an incoming Karma nerf that you could have found yourself if you bothered to check:\n\nOh wow, I now have to search for every developpers who MIGHT share information on twitter or persons documenting the twitter posts on forum posts with limited visibility? Wow, how convenient, this sure is more efficient than the official information sharing medias that developpers should be using... /s\n\nAlso, this shares nothing on what will actually come out of this. Morde getting hotfixed nerfed doesn't exclude the fact that he'll be nerfed again in the next patch, and Karma getting a confirmed nerf doesn't confirm that she might have an ACTUAL nerf and not something more related to Riven's recent \"nerf\" or the classic Irelia \"-5ms\" meme.\n\n> So because one champion is strong, that means nothing else matters and no other champion can be problematic\n\nI wasn't saying that Morde isn't overpowered. He is. But the facts are that other champions are waaaaaay more problematic in a far more steady state than a newly released rework of a champion who's part of a champion class that was nearly forgotten about in the meta. What's the point of nerfing a problematic figure if other figures are even more problematic, but not getting any attention? AKA, why does everyone complain about an overpowered Morde, while willingfully ignoring that he isn't the only one who's ruining toplane?","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-06-23T00:58:31.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, you can literally just google \"Karma nerfs\".
