This has been a problem ever since the implantation of the new client and this applies as well to the patch cycle once the launcher is started. If I need to wait an extra 15 minutes every single minor patch, might as well indicate I need to wait that long and stop making me lose my time because its too hard to make a representative loading bar","replies":[]}
