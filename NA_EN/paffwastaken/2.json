Whether it got deleted by Riot employee's or the boards' \"\"\"volunteers\"\"\", this I don't know, but what I know is that I'm certainly not playing the 27th October, and so should you because they certainly don't want us to know about any boycotting intent, and that alone gives us all a reason to do it.\r\n\r\nIt's simple and everyone can do it. You have nothing to lose but a lot to gain from it, from free time to a slap on Riot's ass","replies":[]}
