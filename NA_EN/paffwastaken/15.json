{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2019-04-16T22:58:39.616+0000","title":"Riot recently made the best addition ARAM ever got just to remove it mere days later...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":232,"down_votes":54,"body":"...and this, based on the feedback of people who played ARAM only for the event. Don't base your actions on the same people who throw games because their ranked pocket pick happens to be OP in aram and get nearly perma banned to the point they get triggered every game. Most of them most definitely never heard about what are ARAM accounts and don't understand how bans were a vital addition to ARAM to satisfy the lack of balance who becomes more and more apparent the more ARAM accounts become popular and how much new tools we get to trade/reroll.\n\nBring back bans to ARAM, its players have been asking for it for years and now you are removing it as soon as people who didn't even play it regularly before complains. We deserve it, we need it and, most of all since we now know it exists (some people argued that random mode bans weren't possible before), we want it to stay.\n\nEDIT: a lot of people have been commenting about how themselves frequently played ARAM  pre-bans and still prefer they get removed. Understandable, but sadly the only actual argument that makes sense from what I saw is the fact that they make Arams longer (having to spend even less than an extra minute or mere seconds for a single game sure sounds dramatic either way...). A lot of people have been complaining that they can't play X champ or Y champ, both being often at a minimum of 55% winrate in ARAM. I'll just repeat myself over and over again by saying that **ARAM isn't supposed in any way to be predictable, hence why it is normal and in fact more balanced that you are restrained from 10 supposedly OP champions each game to force you to play the rest of the roster at 93% integrity**. If your objective is to make several games until you get THE pick you wanted for a guaranteed win, then just play another game mode. ARAM is meant for random picks allowing for experimentation and familiarisation with other champions. X and Y champions being hard as hell to get just means you still have access to about 140 other champions, if you are unhappy with that fact then why the hell are you playing a RANDOM game mode? Don't act like bans just forces your picks to be \"unlucky\" by removing your OP pocket pick from the roster: every picks should be possible and acceptable, if you aren't able to accept the fact that you can't get a champ from 7% of the whole roster for a **majority** of games (it's actually impossible to get a 100% banrate after all, and people playing ARAM tend to always possess the top picks for it, meaning you actually have very very high chances to be able to get what you wanted if it gets through bans) then don't pronounce yourself an ARAM fan since you apparently don't like its actual concept.\n\nAlso, little tip for you guys: you might want to grab another account before commenting some arguments in favor of the bans removal: it's actually very very easy to verify your account, and you can't imagine my surprise (...) when I saw that a lot of you suspiciously either get a free roll champion or one of the top 10 winrates champions in ARAM and that, for some of you, the actual rate of you getting those last 10 champions is insanely lower than before since about two weeks, dooming you to get those oh-so-horrible (spoilers: they aren't) free roll picks.\nYou fool no one, you gamemode cheesers\n\nEDIT2 : Some people actually brought up an interesting argument, being that banned OP champions just makes the \"second tier\" of strong champions be as OP as they are. The thing is, that because of how easy it is nowadays to manipulate picks in ARAM through normal means like rerolls or more advanced ones like ARAM-accounts, high winrate champions had an insanely higher pick rate than low win rate ones (quite bizarre to see in a \"random\" gamemode, no?). Forcing top winrate picks to have a much lower pickrate actually results in two different outcomes:\n1- Champions with lower winrates are getting picked more often\n2- Champions with lower winrates are fighting way less often against high winrate ones, meaning that they do now have more chances to compete, thus increasing their low winrates.\nSo, after all, there'll always be top picks in aram, it'll always will, but forcing them to be less frequent means they influence less the winrate of other champions, meaning that champions who were precedently trash can tier can actually be used with some decency without having to fear to get matched up against a 65% winrate opponent with they sub-40% ones, which results in a lot more balance than before.\n\nEDIT3: Guys, \"playing champs with almost guaranteed wins is fun\" isn't a viable argument in any kind of gameplay, ARAM isn't any exception to this either. Some of you are just plainly admitting not wanting bans because you can't play your main in a gamemode encouraging playing other champions that those you are used to, you don't make any sense.\n\nEDIT4: more than 24 hours after the creation of this thread, it still brings a fair amount of feedback. Problem is, this back clearly went downhill for some hours now. People went from simply either being sad about the bans removal,  explaining how they are almost vital or how they didn't liked it to simply insulting each other while trying to shut down the opinions of several persons at a same time by throwing insults or claiming entire point of views circle jerks or \"boards mindset\" (you know, the argument everyone uses whenever they are losing in an argumentation here?). What surprised me even more is that **There's an actual Rioter comment in the thread**. It sadly isn't related at all to the point of the thread, but it is enough to show there is at least some Rioter attention on here one way or another. Maybe they consider the feedback on bans. Maybe they find the activity on this thread questionnable (there really is a lot of alt accounts commenting here after all). Either way, screaming like monkeys that you can't play fiddlestick anymore and that anyone keeping you from doing so is mentally deranged is just sad. Either show actual feedback on your actual account and, if the points you are trying to make have already been mentionned by me in a way or another as biased because of X reason, then you might reconsider using it since it doesn't add anything new.\n\nEDIT5: Just a little heads up, some of you seems to STILL not understand that bans DON'T keep certain champions from being played at all. All champions can and will be played, since it is literally impossible to have the same bans every single game (and from the comments of people wanting bans, the actual champions that they seem to hate enough to perma ban are quite different from each other). I, personally, hate playing Ziggs but love playing him, so I just didn't ban him and banned someone else while thinking that if zigss isn't banned, there's a chance I get him. But what happens if I DON'T get him? I don't care, thats what I do, and this seems like something that a lot of people defending Riot removing bans seems to not understand: if you play ARAM, you are willingly accepting the fact that you will very rarely get the champions you want, and thats the charm of the gamemode. Don't like it? Don't play it and never come back, simple. In fact, by using some logic we can come to the conclusion that champions who were precedently banned the most frequently would've been less and less banned with time IF Riot just didn't touch the bans and just let them in. How? Because for the first time ever, Riot actually tried to balance ARAM and kept those balance changes (who aren't bad at all I must say) and will probably do more in the future. This means OP champions (those that you guys claim were \"permabanned\") would've become less and less OP, meaning that the actual reason to ban them would fade away, letting them be more present in picks. Before trying to claim bans in ARAM remove the random aspect from it, can you stop and think about what makes ARAM random, what bans do and what are the gameplay implications of the gamemode both before and after random picking??","replies":[{"poster":"OrangeMarine","date":"2019-04-16T23:26:07.603+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":8,"body":"what is the reasoning for removing bans? we should at least get context; because imo i saw the same 10-20 champs banned every game.\n\nand lookie it's the champs that are busted on the mode","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-04-17T04:19:55.980+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":14,"body":"Pretty sure because it was just an event and they said as much at the start.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2019-04-17T04:36:53.653+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"Considering this event was literally to test things, I really hope they're not removing bans because \"people stopped playing after finishing the missions.\" As I saw people on my friends list who never play aram, play aram for the missions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OrangeMarine","date":"2019-04-17T09:29:56.474+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Terozu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aGEgjlaR,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2019-04-17T04:19:55.980+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure because it was just an event and they said as much at the start.\n\nok well tell me why bans aren't justified when many champs on ARAM have 55%+ winrate, and multiple champs have 60%+ winrates?

You would also know that there is no gameplay differences at all between howling abyss and butcher's bridge. No width difference. No differences of eroded sections. No differences from towers except animations (which aren't gameplay-sided). The only things who did differ were the added items, but this thread is about bans who were a completed request that Riot removes. There were A LOT of changes in items in ARAM in its existence, but nothing breaks the gamemode like having to play against people who only have the top 5 winrate champions in their deck. Bans fixed that while giving the option to keep champions that you don't like away from your game after seeing them too often for your tastes.\n\nYou can't make the argument \"bans go against randomness of the game mode\" while it does, in fact, enhances it by keeping frequent picks from being played again (which is something that only kept increasing since there's more and more ease to get the champ you actually want through new additions like the reroll pool). There was nothing random at all in ARAM before because of aram-only accounts, several rerolls, trading, reroll pools and dodges being not punished enough, at least now we had some impact on how enjoyable the games were by keeping the cancerous and frequent picks away (simple math here, ARAM - frequent picks = more randomness).\n\nYou actually prove my point: you claim to know a lot about ARAM, yet you seem to ignore a lot of its problems and even gameplay implications and you use that \"ARAM experience\" to claim that bans are bad without even understanding their full effect. Riot looked at this kind of feedback without verifying the actual implications of such statement and simply thought that bans were unwelcomed. The worst thing that could happen with bans in place is getting your main and/or pocket pick to get perma-banned, which is in fact THE actual way to play ARAM: enjoy and experience a multitude of champions in a nearly infinite array of team comps, not relying on getting those 2 or 3 picks that you absolutely want.

Imagine SR being overrun by 60-70% winrate champions, and not being allowed to ban them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2019-04-17T08:54:55.605+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"First of all, Riot did say in the patch notes doing this removal that it was partially based on feedback and discussion between themselves. This does confirm that opinions from the community were taken in charge.\n\nNow, add the fact that an huge proportion of players were welcoming the bans with open arms (on here and Reddit at least) and we can already see a tendency in favor of keeping them. Even now, it has not even been a full day since the ANNOUNCEMENT  (not even the implementation!!!) of these changes that the hot section of the boards already have several threads including mine **showing exceedingly positive scores**, even if anything related to ARAM barely gets any attention in normal circumstances. From this, we can see a strong leaning towards the apprectiation of bans in the gamemode. You can always say that this represents only a vocal proportion and it doesn't actually represent the demographics or whatever, but literally anything can be negated by this same thing to the point it isn't relevant at all and is really tiring to always see here on the boards (such things as saying \"Riven and Vayne are perfectly fine, since the boards is the vocal minority and shouldn't be taken seriously at all\") Feedback IS feedback as soon as it is observable and should get the considerable weight its worth for, and the observation we can easily set is that *Riot went against the popular feedback to make changes that are unwelcome for the majority said feedback*.\n\nHow do I know that the negative feedback is coming from people barely playing ARAM usually? Well, I feel that you would simply point at an X player saying he is against the bans and point out his game history showing clear evidence of several past ARAM games just to say \"haha! I've proven your point wrong by cherry picking amongst an array of possibilities a single occurence that says otherwise!\", but I'll still explain myself. As I already said, the proportion of positive feedback against negative one was utterly crushing, meaning that the actual number of occurences of people arguing AGAINST aram bans is actually quite low, low enough that you can literally just show any occurences of \"Howling Abyss\" in one's match history and it'll show you information that can be applied to quite a big proportion of the feedback (lower occurences of said persons providing such feedback does mean that they represent a much bigger proportion of the opposition themselves when compaired to those going with the trend). So, by simply doing a research within the the match history of some accounts, you can see some pretty interesting things. What a surprise to see amongst most people some tendency to have between about a single game of ARAM or ten each months, depending on how much they play as a whole and still representing a very small proportion of their games played. Personally, I made the assumption that most people giving negative feedbacks and showing those kind of match history play ARAM as something to relieve frustration from normal gameplay. While this is quite understandable, this also means that those kind of people will most probably not experience what frequent ARAM players do experience, since a random game mode that you are unfamiliar with requires more iterations of experimentation to see a trend (such as ARAM accounts and frequent picks who were both aimed at by the ban changes), hence how their feedback is extremely, well biased. Try it: dig up some threads from the last weeks and identify key threads and comments providing negative comments about the bans, since most of them have a solid negative score, you can easily spot them by the furious red colored numbers. Check the users, and while you WILL end up with some results showing guenuine experienced feedback (after all, most feedback were in favor of the ban implementations, but it wasn't  under any way exclusively in its favor), you will also end up with some occurences that would bring some thought on \"do they really understand what the gamemode is about?\" This and, well, a \"new\" occurence of type of players. \n\nIn fact, I will kinda change my first statement that was \"based on the feedback of people who played ARAM only for the event\" to \"based on the feedback of people who most probably have no specific knowledge on its inner workings **and those who were actually aimed at by the changes**\", admitting that I was partially wrong in the first place. You see, while there's some people out there who do have an impressive ARAM history who are also against the bans in it, their picks in it are quite...odd. In fact, you see them playing, yes, an HUGE number of ARAM games, but their picks are, for someone who play as much, quite frequent and weirdly consistent. What a surprise to see people who usually get several champions from the top 10 winrates in ARAM, then get a very frequent number of free-rolled picks after the introduction of bans protest against them. Weird indeed, its almost as if...","replies":[{"poster":"Spoo","date":"2019-04-18T18:46:40.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a person who has only 1 account with THOUSANDS of ARAM games, owns every champion, and (when they were still tracking it) had about a 55% winrate in ARAM.\n\nI APPROVE THIS MESSAGE!\n\nBans are a necessary evil.\n\nSince last major set of ARAM buffs and before  the serious evolution of the game from a slow play poke fest while waiting on minions to a more fast paced mode where everything is allowed(improving item scale times like tear and ROA), some champions will ineviitably hit late game fantasy of death and destruction.
