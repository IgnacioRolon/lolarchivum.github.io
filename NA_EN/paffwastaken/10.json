This is very limiting on a lot of mages since its stats and utility could be very usefull for a lot of them, but they can&#039;t afford to build it early enough when compaired to some other &quot;necessary&quot; items that their kit needs more. However, with {{item:3003}} , you can just build {{item:3070}}  and then you can upgrade whenever you feel to, there&#039;s no immediate drawback to priotise other items over fully built Archangel.\r\n\r\nSo, I feel like we should have the option to add a new item to RoA&#039;s build path that could start stacking and share its stacks with the completed item, while having some kind of limit, like having a limit of 5 maximum stacks before upgrading. This way, a lot of mages could have more item building paterns while not necessarily becoming straight out op.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-05-04T18:30:50.721+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you could stack it with a component, it would either need to take longer to stack or get some other nerf.
