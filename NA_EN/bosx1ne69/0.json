When you finish a game, if you hover over the picture of your champ in the top right on the end game lobby you'll see a letter grade so you can see how you're doing with that camp and how close you are to possibly getting an S rank. It can be tough, especially for newer players, but it's totally doable. \n\nI'd suggest, if you really want to get an S rank, start playing one or two champs exclusively to really get good with them and that'll help quite a bit. You can also do things like playing them in different roles than they're intended (for example, playing Annie/Anivia Support instead of Mid) which make you more likely to get an S rank, but be aware that not all champs can really fill all roles and sometimes playing a champ in an off role can be more of a hindrance to your team than a help.\n\nIn addition, if you're playing with a party and someone in your party gets an S rank, then you get a box for that, though I believe you have to have not gotten a box for the champ you're playing in that game yet.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BOSX1NE69","date":"2018-04-05T22:11:19.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that how you get a skin ?
