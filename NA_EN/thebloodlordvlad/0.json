I gaurantee you any single one of those people would have thousands and thousands of reasons why its better, im going to point out something, that i have experienced first hand, and encourage you to experience first hand, hell, i even encourage the devs to do this. Make a new account, level it, dont turn off all chat, dont mute people. And tell me, that tribunal wasnt better compared to this. Tribunal basically never handed out perma bans, Shaclone has said at one point he got 5000 chat restriction games, which i would prefer over a peramban, because the only thing that will stop me from being toxic, is chat restrictions, I cant just not reply to someone who calls me a dog and tells me im so horrible and tells me to end myself or something, like you expect me to not reply to someone like that and just, \"mute them\" Yes let me get on my knees and let them feel they have the power to make me a pussy and let them think they have the power to force people to think of him as better than them, and you guys say, well oh he'll get banned! Well, Its a FREE TO PLAY GAME, it takes, 21 hours with win xp boosts and day xp boosts, to get to level 30, and they will be right back being toxic, That or they just spend 13$ on a new level 30 account that thousands, 10s of thousands even, people are selling online! and your going to tell me that perma banning people is going to make them not toxic? all its going to do, is make me, never spend rp on your company again, and make me even more angry with the game itself, my mental is so horrible, because if im toxic, for 15 games, out of over, 3000. And no i am not kidding, i was toxic on 3 different accounts 15 games, which is 1.5% Of games where i was toxic, and got 3 permanently banned accounts. For tilting and losing my mind on people in a VIDEO GAME 1.5% of the time. Id say i have 10 accounts permanently banned, over around 2000+ hours. And this is supposed to make the game less toxic? Hey your toxic in a tiny amount of games, level a new account, think of what youve done! well, if im leveling a new account, if its not level 30, and ive spent no money on it, why would i care about it? Tribunal made people less toxic, because chat restrictions ACTUALLY HELP, when im chat restricted i find that im 100000x less toxic, i cant type that much, so im forced to focus on the game and only use my chats on crucial information. Stop handing out perma bans for people who are toxic in a very small amount of games, your game is unbalanced, your game is the most tilting thing in the world. Of course people are going to be toxic, riot your balance teams mentality is \"If the games balanced it wont be fun\" What the fuck is fun about fiora being one of the strongest top laners getting a 40% attack speed buff!??!?! I would actually enjoy the game, if the better player would win, i understand how theirs matchups and things, but stop making champions where there is literally no out play potential against them, Garen, if you rework him the way you are planning too, Building certain items hard counters him, which is a good step in the right direction! but, for low elo, hes going to be broken as hell, and i think you guys really need to find a median. Please, bring back tribunal, stop perma banning people. The results of perma banning shows in low level games. You wonder why your games dying? People who just start playing the game are being told to uninstall and end themselves because of these perma banned people. That, is what perma banning does.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-08-31T09:29:31.635+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"On paper, it is indeed the best.

Those volunteers would then vote on whether to punish or pardon the reported player's case. This system's main flaw was that it simply took far too long due to LoL's huge playerbase. Participants would often be reviewing chat logs that were several months old, with a growing backlog. In addition to that, not every participant took the task seriously: some would spam the same verdict for every case without even reading the chat log, or even invert their verdicts on purpose.\n\nThe current system, called the Instant Feedback System, or IFS, is automated software that uses machine learning to determine what behavior should be punishable and when a player's behavior should be punished. It started with data from the Tribunal, and has been learning and adapting for years. It operates on the same basic principles as a spam filter: get a corpus of data (emails/chat logs), have humans categorize each item as acceptable or unacceptable, find patterns within each category, and then finally look for those patterns to automatically categorize new items without direct human evaluation. Each report is like clicking the \"spam\" button. When a new pattern starts to get lots of reports, the IFS recognizes it as a new form of toxicity.\n\nThe IFS is efficient and unbiased. The Tribunal was not.\n\nRiot's punishment system used to hand out stacking chat restrictions, such that consistently toxic players basically had a permanent chat restriction. Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nThe ability to play on a new account doesn't negate the benefits of permabanning toxic players. If every single one of them did that, then it would at least be a minor punishment, taking away their unlocked skins, icons, champs, and so on. Any who don't do that are removed from the game and the problem is solved in at least those instances. Quite frankly, Riot and 99.994% of the playerbase (people without permabans, according to Riot's figures on this, which I see no reason to doubt) don't give one whit for how permabanned players feel about being ejected from the game for consistently appalling behavior. Most permabanned players stop playing the game. It's extremely rare for a permabanned player to be so oblivious and/or unbalanced that they accumulate multiple permabans on a series of accounts. Riot does not have the wherewithal to prevent that except when a highly-visible player (such as a popular streamer) engages in this behavior, in which case they may issue an ID ban (Riot employees manually ban any account that such a player is seen to use).\n\nYou are certainly allowed to defend yourself from toxic chat, which is accomplished by muting. This is a 100% effective method. Flaming back is a 0% effective method that also constitutes unacceptable behavior and thus opens you up to reports and punishments. Read about this in more detail [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Pqc6PJUE-players-who-flame-back-in-self-defense-dont-understand-the-meaning-of-those-words).\n\n> For tilting and losing my mind on people in a VIDEO GAME 1.5% of the time.\n\nYou think people should be okay with letting you be toxic and harass them just because you're doing it over a video game? By the same token, why are you tilting and losing your mind on people in a VIDEO GAME? Why should people have to deal with a player like you when they're trying to enjoy a VIDEO GAME? Why are you making such a big deal out of being banned from a VIDEO GAME?\n\nHaving ten permabanned accounts is not normal, even for people with permabanned accounts. Most get the hint and just leave.\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"l Ryden l","date":"2019-09-01T05:24:00.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would suspect it wouldn't take long for the Tribunal to come to a point where a feeding roaming Teemo strategy was acceptable and therefore have them pass off as 'not guilty' or the equivalent. \n\nPoint being, if you keep players in charge of moderating themselves, it's almost certain that it can come to a point what used to be seen as toxic or negative can later be turned over to something acceptable, and therefore allow offenders to walk out of the judgement process unscathed. At the same time, small time offenders or blatant rage reports to a legitimate and non offending player could be punished without a way to plea innocent.\n\nAnd most of the time I'd reckon reports are made because of rage. So there'd be an entire backlog for what I'd argue would be the millions of players that get reported daily. I would like to think it worked back then when LoL was a very small game in preseason 1.\n\nFrankly, with the way the boards are and how rarely level-headed players come visit and actually engage in discussion here, I wouldn't want my account set on stage for a Tribunal for the time I DC'd because of something as arbitrary as a thunderstorm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tbh i am bad lol","date":"2019-09-01T02:51:12.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmm.
