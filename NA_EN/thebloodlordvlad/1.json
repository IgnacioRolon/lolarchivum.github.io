Why do we get less of a chance?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"So, just recently, ive been leveling a new account, I got permanently banned for one game where i was, \"toxic\" so to speak, aka this one guy and his 2 friends were sitting there im going to use the word \"bullying\" me because im a 9 year old army member. They were basically sitting there calling me trash and horrible and telling me to kill myself and stuff, so i responded back, harshly. I have a personality disorder which causes me to respond in violence against people calling me bad or something, does riot have anything that gives you the freedom to do that if you literally cant even help yourself because of your past experiences? No of course they don't. They want their game to not be toxic so your banned! Haha just spent 300$ on your account?!?!? we dont care! You were toxic in this ONE GAME, were going to give you ONE GAME chat logs! your banned! this was season 8, where i do believe they upped their anty on the ban system. In season 7 you got, 5 games, 10 games, 15 games, then 25 games, 2 week ban, perm ban, but you could redeem your account from a 25 game chat restriction relatively easy, i went through 2 5,10,15,25 games in around the span of 3-4 months, ultimatly, getting permanently banned, on the day after christmas, just after spending over 300$ and having the account for over a year and a half. Which the ban itself was probably justifiable i was reallyy toxic in that game calling people autists and autistic. And im surprised it took them that long to ban me tbh! Back to present, in season 8-9 you get, 10-25-2week- perma. Like what? why? does riot not realize that the reason most people are toxic is because their game is unbalanced and people are frustrated with it so to get their anger out they call people degenerates? And just to clarify, did i ever call anyone a degenerate, or an autistic ape, or a r%%%%%, or even just saying something like wow your bronze! No. I will quote what Skeletor, one of the better support staff have quoted to me that was the reason that i got this 25 game chat restriction, which is my LAST STRAW before a 2 week ban! And i quote. GAME NUMBER 1. \"Game 1\r\nTheBloodLordVlad: baited \r\nTheBloodLordVlad: idiot \r\nTheBloodLordVlad: ? \r\nTheBloodLordVlad: ? \r\nTheBloodLordVlad: ? \r\nTheBloodLordVlad: ????\r\n\r\nTheBloodLordVlad: talk more pleas\r\n\r\nTheBloodLordVlad: your literally runningit down in my game\r\n\r\nTheBloodLordVlad: our bot is throwing man\"\r\n\"baited\" \"idiot\" obviously bantering because the syndra just got killed while getting a kill one me, she said \"?\" So i responded with that, bantering in all chat was supposed to be allowed i thought riot? Kappa. Now, that is all he had, for game 1, thats it, thats what it takes to provide their \"evidence\" to give you a restriction. Now, game number 2 i can indeed say i was toxic, but i had press the attack on vladamir, basically playing like a iron 50000 player. I was doing horrible, what do you think my team had to say? oh good try keep trying you got this! No i got hurtful comments such as, imagine having vlad in your name and being this horrible at him! imagine inting on your main haha! dude this vlad is so dog shit please help! what did i say? Nothing like oh you guys are autistic, kys, degenerates! I honestly am not at a computer that can get these chat logs, but i was so called toxic\" but i never was EXTREMLEY toxic, i never ran it down, i never literally inted, i was trying my best but was just playing horrible with press the attack on a mage...  Now lets get to the game 3, where, i suppose you could argue this is pretty horrible? but, is it really? if you have the context, i dont really think its that bad, there is 2 people in the post game lobby sitting there saying all these horrible things about how bad i played (even though i had 60k damage and didnt even have a bad score) \"wow this vlad got into late game and pressed w e and thinks hes good hahah, \"Dude your horrible stop thinking you deserved to win\" (was like 16/7 on vlad btw) I had a 1/5 jax who basically ran it down to a gnar, i had, a draven, who was literally afk farming bot lane, telling me he didnt care what i had to say, walking into syndra, sitting there, not auto attacking her, and dying. But i was the one to blame for this game and i didnt deserve the win. So, i wanted to report these players without having to deal with their shitty messages, the enemy guy left, now all that was left was a kha zix who did pretty good early game, still talking trash to me, I continued, to spam chat with ? and say some things that werent really toxic, so i could report the kha zix and gnar without getting tilted over what they were saying about me. here is the quote he sent me. \"[2019-08-21 07:14:55 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:14:55 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:14:56 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:14:57 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:14:57 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: /\r\n[2019-08-21 07:14:58 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:14:59 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:14:59 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:00 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: /\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:01 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:02 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:02 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:04 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ? ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:05 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:05 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:06 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:06 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: /\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:08 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:09 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:09 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:11 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:11 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:13 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:17 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: maybe if you didnt give her a second kill\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:20 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: i wouldnt havel ost so hard\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:21 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:22 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:22 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:52 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ???\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:54 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:55 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ??\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:56 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:57 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:57 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:58 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:58 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:15:59 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:16:00 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:16:01 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:16:01 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:16:02 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\n[2019-08-21 07:16:03 UTC] TheBloodLordVlad: ?\r\nYea i had to do it that many times because its 1, post game and there is literally one person left in the chat.

And i only want to talk about how this really isnt 25 game restriction worthy, and the fact that riot has decreased the amount of chances you get compared to season 7, where the game was actually fun to play, not a coin flip on whos going to be sitting under tower farming.","replies":[]}
