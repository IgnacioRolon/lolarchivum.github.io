Sometimes when I go to my profile, it took a few minutes to load my stats. And when I queued up for a ranked, my client froze in champion select. Later in champ select, I hover over nami and locked her, but the chat read that all the other players left as I had no more time left to select my champion. I tried again to see if the problem is fixed, but as soon as I got into champ select, the client froze, and I could not ban a champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-30T22:42:36.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble all around accessing the variety of different services from the authentication server to the game server.
