I have a slight problem with this. Throughout the course of 3 games in a row, I constantly got blasted for not making dumb decisions such as not going in 1v3 as Zed with 300 hp. The bot lane started flaming me nonstop, spam pinged me all game, and repeatedly called me a troll. I then said &quot;I&#039;m P2, you&#039;re silver 5, you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about&quot; then said &quot;reported&quot;. I report those guys after the game (who were actually permad before for toxicity) and they report me. I am the one that gets punished. This is a common occurrence, I get flamed -&gt; say their rank is lower so they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing -&gt; and then get the punishment while there is NO instant feedback on my end for them flaming. After this 14 day ban I&#039;m done bringing up ranks but why am I seen as the bad guy for bringing up ranks after getting flamed all game nonstop? I even had a caitlyn go afk in a bush to flame me for the rest of the game while her karma said &quot;she&#039;s not playing because you didn&#039;t respect her&quot; and I was punished for calling her a crybaby who needs to stop being stupid and play the game. Why am I the one who never gets instant feedback for reporting someone who does things that are way more toxic than me but then receive the punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2017-11-30T20:47:12.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs or no one is gonna believe you, no editing or you will be exposed.","replies":[{"poster":"Shaita","date":"2017-12-01T01:19:04.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I was unbanned today so I don't have the chat logs.

I go bot lane->I get caught in jungle (as Zed) -> i get to 300 hp and run to bot tower -> enemy sej, jhin, and whoever show up and kill jinx-> I get flamed for not using w in and trying to \"help\" jinx -> they call me a troll -> I tell them running in 1v3 with my w on cd is stupid and that they're silver 5 so they don't know what they're talking about -> they say \"reported\" and spam ping me all game -> i call them dumb and also say reported -> I get banned. Whenever I bring someone's rank up it's a huge problem but they can say what they want or go AFK and not get punished which is the problem I have.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-12-01T02:02:45.789+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you seriously want feedback on them, I'm happy to post them here on your behalf.","replies":[{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2017-12-01T12:53:55.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=17oERVtf,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2017-12-01T02:02:45.789+0000)\n>\n> If you seriously want feedback on them, I&#x27;m happy to post them here on your behalf.\n\nDo punished players get to see their chat logs?

So you don't know if they're going to get punished or not.\nBut just because they didn't get punished right away doesn't mean they won't eventually. But this is your problem, you worry about other players other than yourself. You're so focused on players and not yourself. The more you do that, the more you'll likely get punished more.
