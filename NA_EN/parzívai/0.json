But yesterday when I played I was completely fine. After the champion select it usually goes to the loading screen for the game but for mine, it goes to the reconnect screen and says my game has crashed, no bug splat. I have tried to shutdown my computer, go and try to reconnect, fix the settings, detect viruses, but none of them have worked. Someone please help. (And though my icon is bronze I am not bronze and also I am climbing strong. Also both of these games were ranked.)","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-18T23:31:02.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you happen to be running/using LoLreplay?
