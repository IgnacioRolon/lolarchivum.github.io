It didn't even blink an eye during teamfights.\r\nBut since 4.20, I'm lucky to get 40FPS with low settings, and the frame rates constantly fluctuate. \r\nI can run many other demanding games at high framerate with no problem. \r\nThis game has been fucked for me permanently I fear. \r\n\r\nI checked the stupid FPS post and did almost all of it, and of course no change, which doesn't surprise me. None of these issues occurred until 4.20.\r\n\r\nThis combined with constant packet loss, champions skipping all over the place, makes the game pretty much unplayable on a 3 month old machine with dedicated graphics.\r\n\r\nMy fucking integrated card can run the game better.","replies":[{"poster":"BamBamxxxx","date":"2015-01-13T10:07:51.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Multiple people have been complaining about this problem.
