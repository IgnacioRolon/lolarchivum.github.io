If repair isn't resolving this then there may be other hardware or driver issues that could be causing this.  I recommend going over every step in our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to get this fixed.  You can also download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically perform some of the steps found there.
