However, normally I have about 36 ping, I was just wondering if anyone else on the east coast with Verizon has this issue as well? Also I would like to mention that everything else seems to be fine, like youtube seems to be unaffected when watching a video  or listening to music on spotify.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T04:02:39.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing an *awful* lot of Verizon issues today, likely due to the outage they're currently having =(. There's not much we can do on our end other than suggest trying to alter your DNS settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 in an *attempt* to get a better pin, but overall I don't personally think this will work very well. The best thing to do is try and stay out of ranked or normals (where dc's could get you LPQs).","replies":[]}]}
