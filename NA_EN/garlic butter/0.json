The following is true: I have Received the \"free box\" on reaching level 5(the one containing ashe and garen i assume) I did not receive the additional box, I used the \"free\" key for the promotional box on my S rank Hextech chest INSTEAD. I have received 0 keyfragments for the life of the account (I never earned any from wins pre, key nerf, have not received any passively post honor changes since the 2 weeks i have been back). I bought RP on the account before ever entering even the training mode(earning the strange and ubiquitous \"1 IP\" with purchase).\n\nDoes the \"promotional\" hextech boxes and their \"free\" keys subtract from your number of earn-able keys for the period? \n\nI am suspecting key fragments are calibrated based on number of champions owned, and whether you've \"opened\" your \"one\" S rank box on any of those champions. Just curious if this is a bug, working as intended, etc, the clarity is extremely low since there is no \"key/fragments available to be earned\" or any clarity on if you can earn a number of keys beyond the max number of hextech boxes you COULD earn potentially (all signs point to NO based on my experience of several months on EUW where I only owned 5 champions and 2 seasons of hextech loot (maxing out at 10 chests and 10 keys over regular play for 2 seasons, yes that's right, not a single key fragment extra(total of 12 boxes and keys including promotional swag i think).\n\nAsking for clarity, or if i should be submitting a full bug report if this is not working as intended or I broke something.\n\nEDIT: I should mention several weeks later, every day once or so, the \"head over and open your free chest!\" alert still pops up (so loose deduction is stating that I did indeed \"sequence break\" something important).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T03:24:15.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So.....I'm wondering if you were talking about a different account than this one, because this account currently has 5 keys at the time of me posting this comment. It looks like in the recent month alone, this account has been granted 11 of its 12 key fragments. \n\nTo answer your questions though, those free hextech chests do not count towards any type of grand total that you can acquire. From the looks of this account, everything has been working as intended, but let me know if there's any other confusion I could clear up such as where to see your keys.","replies":[{"poster":"Garlic Butter","date":"2017-08-01T22:46:58.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Correct its a Latin America North account as i mentioned in the post(wouldn't let me post on the forums on it for some reason?).
