I've been fighting bots and not pvp, mayhaps you don't get mastery for bots. Cause lookin back I haven't used Nasus sence I started practicing on bots.

So I was thinking maybe winning isn't how points are earned, maybe you have to kill champs or somethin? Or the increase is so tiny I can't notice it. Like 5 pts or somethin crazy like that.\n\nPs. My record champ kills is 2, average 0.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-10-22T00:45:11.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey The Lone Crusade,\n\nYou only gain Champion Mastery Points from 5v5 Summoner's Rift Normal/Ranked matches.
