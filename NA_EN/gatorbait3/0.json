Then after you have to do the automatic fix now that is goes through that takes 5-10 minutes, you get into your game just in time for your team to early surrender. Then because you were \"AFK\" you get put in a 20 minute fucking wait for your next 5 games because the game doesn't load properly...............................pretty awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-09T17:44:14.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be something corrupt with your drivers, hardware, or game files that could be causing these bugsplats.
