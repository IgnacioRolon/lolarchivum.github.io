I&#039;ve done it 1000 times. After this I started a custom game and spammed Q+E as fast as I could just to make sure, but the ball launched as it should have every time.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-12-08T18:59:08.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friend,\n\nSyndra Q+E has historically been buggy, but this interaction is known and intended. You can Q+E quickly and if you did it fast enough and your Q is close to yourself then the E will be long gone by the time the Q shows up. Your gif example cut it pretty close, but If you want to see this again then cast Q basically right in front of yourself and immediately cast E. \n\nSyndra Q+E combo has some other reports that we're looking into either way, but this specific interaction will not be changed most likely.","replies":[{"poster":"Corvine","date":"2015-12-09T02:37:31.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=M eye Abe,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=91p7P5nn,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-08T18:59:08.791+0000)\n>\n\n> Syndra Q+E has historically been buggy, but this interaction is known and intended.

It's clear that the intent to land Q+E stun fast is present but it fails if the ball is close to you? That seems like a huge flaw. Not only this interaction is not mentioned anywhere it literally cost me life in that moment. Now I don't feel like playing Syndra, I mean how do I know if the ball is in the right place for her core combo to work? I've tested it again as you suggested and the E skill range indicator clearly shows it's starting point, so if the ball is placed in that radius it shouldn't fail. \nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/xTk9ZZ80OXxWPLXHna","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-12-08T21:35:15.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you guys also looking into the one where her Q+E sometimes deals damage without stunning? I had thought this was fixed, as I haven't experienced it in a long time (And I play a lot of Syndra) but it happened earlier today. It was at very max range, if that helps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-12-08T15:45:42.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Melee range spheres often fail. I'm fairly sure it has to do with how narrow the cone is near Syndra, it's actually far more narrow than the visuals imply. If you're even a couple of degrees off hitting the ball dead centre her E will not connect with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akenero","date":"2015-12-08T12:00:43.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to remember that syndra is in the same vein as azir and orianna\n\nExtremely complex and have many parts to her which interact in all parts","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-12-08T11:33:51.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then it seems it was just random one-time bug","replies":[]}]}
