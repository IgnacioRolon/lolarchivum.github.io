{"poster":"The 99th Problem","date":"2016-10-19T19:21:47.648+0000","title":"This is how mage/ap mid vs ad mids has been addressed?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":56,"down_votes":14,"body":"So for a very long time, many mage/AP mid players have struggled with the fact that AD champs had the option to use Maw of Malmortius (Hexdrinker) and Mercurial Scimitar while AP champs only had Zhonyas to help in their mid lane match up. This has been complained about time and time again with no address from Riot. With Maw, they become fairly tanky (with both the resist and the shield) against AP and with Merc Scim, they became immune to crowd control effects, which almost mages have and rely on to reliably dish out their damage.\n\nNow, not only do they **NOT** help the ap mids/mages (and other ap champs that go against ad; rumble and heimer in the top lane for example), but Riot also gives AD users yet ANOTHER item which helps further turns the tides in AD champ&#039;s favor.\n\nEdge of Night (New)           \n Stats:\n+60 Attack Damage\n+35 Magic Resist\n\nMaw of Malmortius\nStats:\nAttack Damage lowered to 50 from 55\nMagic resist **increased** to 45 from 40\n[ADDED] Lifegrip now grants +20 Attack Damage (on top of what was previously there for this passive; life steal &amp; spell vamp)\n\nMercurial Scimitar (No changes)\n Stats:\n+35 magic resistance\n+65 attack damage\n+10% life steal\nUNIQUE &ndash; QUICKSILVER: Removes all crowd control debuffs from your champion and grants +50% movement speed for 1 second. 90 second cooldown.\n\nCombined, these items give 115 MR **AND** 175 AD. Jesus Christ, good luck as AP winning any fights after these 3 items have been built, if you&#039;re not already ahead. What&#039;s even worse, remember how earlier I mentioned that many mages rely on some sort of CC to safely dish out some of their damage? Well hell, now they have a free spell shield with an incredibly short cool down for such a powerful tool.(I understand that these are PBE values, not live; but how could these even make it into the PBE?) Active of Edge of Night (EoN):\n\n**UNIQUE Active** - Night&#039;s Veil: Channel for 1.5 seconds to grant a spell shield that blocks the next enemy ability. Lasts for 10 seconds. (30 second cooldown) (Can move while channeling)\n \nThey refuse to allow Quick silver sash to build into any AP item because they thought Zhonya&#039;s + QSS active would be too strong. **Now all AD champs can walk around with not only an CC remover but ALSO a spell shield.** How in anyway is this fair?\n\nNow before you say, AP mids/mages have other options that don&#039;t include armor but still help them, such as Rylai&#039;s, the hextech items(minus gunblade), etc., I would like to remind you that there are clashes between champ skills and these item&#039;s passives that render the item cost inefficient. How? Take Lux for example, she does not benefit from rylais at all except for her ult really. Her q is a root, which roots for the duration of the slow, her E is a slow in itself so the additionally slow is partially ineffective. As for proto belt, why would lux use that item, if you&#039;re using it to  retreat, you are not using the damage, and as a mage, why would protobelt&#039;s active used to get closer to your enemy? And as for GLP-800, lets be honest; how often do you even see this item built? Simply put, the item is lack luster and underwhelming. \nDon&#039;t believe only a few champions actually build it?   http://www.lolking.net/items/3030#topchampions    A sol with about 1/3rd of the time it being built is the most using champ of the item. Rod of Ages is only effective and cost efficient on champs with mana so it inconveniences many ap mids/tops (Katarina, Vlad, Rumble, Akali, Morde, Kennen, etc) . Banner of Command is being changed so that it gives no AP anymore.\n\nI guess you can say they still have Liandry&#039;s Torment, but if that&#039;s the case, you can also include AD/HP items which they also have a plethora of, such The Black Cleaver, Frozen Mallet, Titanic Hydra (if melee), Sterak&#039;s and TriForce (which I must add isnt used on champs lacking mana, although *cough* yasuo *cough*).\n\nTL;DR : This new item, Edge of Night, makes laning as an AP champ against an AD even more of a nightmare than it already was. And the passives/actives of these items stacking with each other will make trying to take them down even more hellish.","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2016-10-19T21:23:05.674+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":4,"body":"But what about the huge shield a mage can get from Seraphs?

The problem with mages is their last hitting potential if they are being forced to solo lane against an AD lane bruiser. Towers can way too easily deny a couple kills of farm if you are not playing passive -- as you are forced to in certain matchups, if not all, without a lead. And since they build AD, they can out push the next wave before it reaches your inner tower. \n\nAD just scales really hard in this game. But MR scales much less. by building hexdrinker and scimitar you are sacrificing a big portion of your damage scaling onto one source of defense, pure MR/magic shield. It's a bad idea but it pays off opportunistically, which arise to occasion more often the more chances you get through lane while being even or ahead.
