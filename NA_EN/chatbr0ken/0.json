Looking closely here, it looks like your routing is pretty much going all around the country- literally hopping to the west coast and circling back to our servers.  \n\nYour best bet is to contact your ISP and request a Tier 2 specialist who can review your logs.  They'll need to look into why you're bouncing to the west coast instead of your nearest riot direct node.  Hope that helps clear things up, and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"ChatBr0ken","date":"2017-02-25T16:55:40.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not normally like this now, and it just happened again, I lost my platinum promos because of this.
