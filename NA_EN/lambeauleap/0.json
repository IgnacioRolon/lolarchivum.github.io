Last year I would cap myself at 144 because 400+ would break my game. This year I am stuck on 90-110fps. Even if I put all of my graphics to the lowest setting and turn off every feature I am still stuck at 90-110.\r\n\r\nI don't have Window 10 Xbox feature like Riot suggested to disable, so I am trying to figure out what might be the issue.\r\n\r\nI am running a i5-6600k with a R9 390. Could it by my AMD Radeon settings? Could it be the culprit? \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"applejacks33","date":"2017-01-14T02:21:27.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same exact problem man, i made a post about it and got some feedback but yet still havent been able to fix it. used to get around 250-300 fps constant and now i can barely manage 80 and my fps will dip even into the 30s and 40s during teamfights, its highly frustrating and causes me to lose games. i've done literally everything to try and fix it and nothing has worked so far. hopefully this fps drop isnt on my end and its something the league will eventually fix. best of luck man {{summoner:13}} .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T00:07:31.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The xbox bar would cause a total freeze, so I don't think it's that.  Regardless of the quality of your specs, they all go through general wear and tear so it's important to tune things up.  Specifically for league, I suggest updating your drivers in addition to steps found in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide.  That should smooth things out!","replies":[]}]}
