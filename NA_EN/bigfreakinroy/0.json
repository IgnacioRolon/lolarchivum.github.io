I&#039;m pretty new so I don&#039;t know which one is right. One of my friends says I have to play more aggressive (since I have a passive play style) and the other one is saying that my play style is fine and he&#039;s just mad that he overextended on his gank and wants to blame me. (Since the one who says I should play more aggressive is a jungler. the one who says I should play passive is the ADC) Here is my play style: I play Blitzcrank and I only push when I land a hook or when the other team has less health or level than me. If they they are hiding behind a tower, then I back off. If both teams have the same health and same everything I never go in until I land the hook. I never push against top laners unless I have the support of a top laner myself. If they have more people than us, I will say to my ADC that we should retreat until help comes. (Unless they are all weaker than us)  I&#039;m open to criticism and tell me who is right in this situation. I genuinely don&#039;t know who is right.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-21T02:13:42.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Situational, but right now the whole state of support in general is damage and threat focused.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2019-01-21T02:20:50.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right now you either pick {{champion:143}} and bully the enemy out of lane, pick {{champion:89}} or{{champion:12}} and try not to get bullied so hard that you can no longer engage and win fights, or pick {{champion:16}} {{champion:25}} and try to counter engage against aforementioned engage tanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2019-01-21T02:06:27.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on the adc really.

And engage supports in general.\nAs well as a lot of mages that I can use (mid main after all) to harass the enemy team out of lane or make it unsafe for them to CS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2019-01-21T02:16:18.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither is correct. But they also not wrong.\n\nYou have to find a balance between offensive and defensive, Understand when you have the freedom to be aggressive and when you are forced into a passive stance. This usually changes many times during the course of the laning phase, Power spikes/Cooldowns/items/ganks ect...\n\nThere's no right or wrong when it comes to how Aggressive / Passive someone should be there are too many variables involved for any one answer to always be the correct one. Who your teammates are heavily impacts this and you'll have to gauge this on a per game basis. (basically are they trash players who wont followup? or are they amazing and have the capacity to react to your engages quickly).\n\nWhich stance are you more suited to? Personally i find i win more games when i'm aggressive and take action and so, I tend to try to play champions who align with this. I main wukong for this reason who has the ability to go full on aggro and force engages with a flash ulti. Others might not win games with this style of play so they try to play passive champions like Soraka or Janna who excel at stopping the opponents aggression. \n\nIf you think blitzcrank's hooks are fun, Try playing Pyke... So fun.\n\ntl:dr = There are times to be passive and there are times to be aggressive. Master the art of knowing when to swap styles and you'll find success.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-01-24T05:18:29.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is dependant on the match up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-01-21T19:29:47.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Entirely depends on the champ tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-01-21T14:05:52.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitz is tricky. You need to make the enemy _think_ you are playing aggressively by always looking for the Q angle _but_ only using that Q when you are very very certain you will hit it. While your Q is on CD you are basically a nothing champion so you want to have it available most time and you need to fake hooks etc to make enemy miss CS or back off when you actually have no intention of hooking. Also the best way to play the lane is to wait for level 2 or 3 run/flash on the enemy ADC and E them then while they are knocked up walk slightly backwards and then hook. Worst case you get a flash out the ADC and your hooking life got way easier, best case you got a kill. \nBlitz is an ALL-In champion so you want to have Q-E and Aftershock all up when you make a move.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aladoron","date":"2019-01-21T10:02:26.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, there is no right or bad tactic. The main point is that you and your adc should play the same. (He being aggressive while you are in the back will result in his death, with probably 0 result, and doing the other way around too.) I do not know how passive you are, but you might be able to zone a bit when your hook is up (not zoning out of XP, but at least some lasthits.)\n\nBut in the end, there is no better tactic, I mean there is, but not this general, it would depend on matchup, enemy/your jungler etc... But all In all, both tactics are ok, if you do it properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2019-01-21T03:19:29.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no better or worse as it is subject to match up, strategy, and skill.
