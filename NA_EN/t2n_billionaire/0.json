If I have one more mistake( bad behavior) My account is going to be blocked permanently. However I heard permanent block is not usual. Is it right?? I want to buy new skin but I'm scared block permanently. How can I do? I have to make new account? Just one more chance is too scared.","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2020-01-13T23:00:35.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. its called ban not block.\n2. a perma ban is totally usual. if someone ignores their last warning (the 2 week ban) they get a permaban\n3. you could improve on your behavior or just turn off team and all chat so you cant type anymore even if you wanted to\n4. in case you do get permabanned, yup make a new acc or dont and stop playing.\n5. ps: if you dont misbehave for a while, your acc statue will recover so you're not at the risk of a permaban forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2020-01-13T23:08:57.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To elaborate though, it takes a few months for you to work your back out of the danger zone. You will also be likely to be in danger from ANY kind of valid report against you, so I would advise you not to say ANYTHING for a few months in chat. Mute everyone - you won't see them talking and emoting, so you're not going to respond to them. This will be difficult if you're prone to exploding against opponents who are beating you, but just stick with it and keep calm.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-14T02:08:52.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As they said.
