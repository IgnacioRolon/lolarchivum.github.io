Best thing to try and do is watch the projectile animation as it fires and hear it trigger. Either that or force yourself to wait before clicking again.

They're glass cannons that require peel (protection/spoonfed) from their support/team inorder to survive and deal damage. \n\nPlaying champions like {{champion:22}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:222}} etc are all about dealing way too much damage while remaining back line, their punishment is getting focused/caught and thats exactly what the enemy team will atempt to do.\n\nKiting is simply walking away inbetween autos, like auto, click away, click them to auto, click away again, etc. Its called orb walking which you can find tutorials on, its not the easiest thing to do and will require a lot of practice, especially since ADCs scale in attack speed making the feel of it inconsistent.
