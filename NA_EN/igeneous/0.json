These were things that I had to do in the previous version of Apple's operating system for its computers, when I was running OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (15G1004).\n\nI have no issues playing in Summoner's Rift now. This is what I did to eliminate the issues.\n\nThis is what I am running at this moment in time. I was only running the League of Legends  version 6.19.16_09_15_21_03 game, Text Edit Version 1.12 (329), Curse version 7.0.6116.18425 Alpha, and Safari Version 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10), and initially in Safari I only had one tab open to this League of Legends boards page.\n\nmacOS Sierra version 10.12 (16A323)\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\nprocessor 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7\nmemory 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\ngraphics Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\n\n  Model Name:\tMacBook Pro\n  Model Identifier:\tMacBookPro11,4\n  Processor Name:\tIntel Core i7\n  Processor Speed:\t2.5 GHz\n  Number of Processors:\t1\n  Total Number of Cores:\t4\n  L2 Cache (per Core):\t256 KB\n  L3 Cache:\t6 MB\n  Memory:\t16 GB\n\nI had a wired Logitech mouse, a pair of Apple earbuds, the power adapter, and a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter with an Ethernet cable plugged into the machine. I wanted to keep the least amount plugged into the machine as possible.\n\nThis machine was on OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (15G1004). I had installed all updates on the machine prior to installing macOS Sierra version 10.12.\n\nAs a just in case I launched the League of Legends. Before I clicked on the large “Launch” button in the top middle of the screen, I clicked on the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of the page. I then deselected the “Allow Peer to Peer Transfer” check box. I then clicked on the question mark icon that was to the left of the gear icon and clicked on the “Repair” button and then I walked away. That process checks installed files for errors and if it finds any, it fixes them. That process can be hours long. In my case, since this was a fresh installation, it found no errors and only took about 45 minutes to complete.\n\nI opened up my “System Preferences,” went to the “Network” preference and then set a static IP address for my Thunderbolt Ethernet connection, since I use a wired Ethernet connection on this computer.  You should never game on a wireless connection, but some people still do.\n\nThese are just home use settings that are common to most people. I used 192.168.1.31 because I know that that number is unused on my network. Your number scheme may be a bit different from mine, but you MUST use a unique IP address on your network. Do NOT pick an IP address that is in your router's DHCP range of addresses. You don't want a collision on your network. Most home routers start at 192.168.1.100 and dole out numbers through 192.168.1.150 by default.\n\n￼IP Address: 192.168.1.31\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.0\nRouter: 192.168.1.1\nDNS Server: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4\n\nI went into the Advanced settings and set my DNS to 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4  These are Google's DNS servers.\n\nI also turned off my IPv6 configuration. “Off” is NOT an option initially. Initially you will have 3 options in the drop down menu. \n\nAutomatically\nManually\nLink-local Only\n\nYou need to enable “Off” by opening up your Terminal application.\n\nOpen up the Applications folder. Then in the Applications you need to open up the Utilities folder. In the Utilities folder you will find the Terminal application.\n\nOpen up Terminal and type or copy paste this in to disable the IPv6.\n\nOn a Thunderbolt Ethernet connection you would type in or copy paste in the following into the Terminal window then press your enter key.\n\nnetworksetup -setv6off Thunderbolt\\ Ethernet\n\nIn order to turn IPv6 off on the Wi-Fi connection you would type in or copy paste in the following into the Terminal window then press your enter key.\n\nnetworksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi\n\nIf you have a computer that has an Ethernet port and you do not need to use a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter as I have to you would type in or copy paste in the following into the Terminal window then press your enter key.\n\nnetworksetup -setv6off Ethernet\n\nTo reenable IPv6 you would type in or copy paste in the following into the Terminal window then press your enter key.\n\nnetworksetup -setv6automatic Wi-Fi\n\nnetworksetup -setv6automatic Ethernet\n\nnetworksetup -setv6automatic  Thunderbolt\\ Ethernet\n\nI then quit League of Legends, quit Terminal, and restarted my computer.\n\nI then started up League of Legends and played a few rounds without any issues.\n\nI do have to warn you though. Turning off IPv6 on a Macintosh computer is a double edged sword. I did create a secondary location with a static IP address separate from my normal location setting. On your computer you probably have a default location named \"Automatic.\" \n\nThis next tidbit comes from http://osxdaily.com/2014/04/18/disable-ipv6-mac-os-x/\n\n_\"Though most users don’t use IPv6 directly, disabling IPv6 is not without consequences, and thus should only be done by users who know what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. Some of the core OS X system services, like the discovery service Bonjour, use IPv6. Accordingly, disabling IPv6 may render AirDrop sharing unusable, certain print services will become unavailable, and some other convenient Mac features may turn inoperable as well. This makes it impractical to disable for many.\"_\n\nThere is one peculiar thing that I have noticed, but I noticed this in OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (15G1004), and I’m still seeing it in macOS Sierra version 10.12. When I launch the Activity Monitor /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor I have noticed that the I see UserKernel (Not Responding) in red, so I click on it, and I force quit it. The game seems to be no worse for wear by terminating this stuck process. The game works just fine both when I force quit the UserKernel (Not Responding) in red or if I just leave it alone. It’s just something peculiar that I’ve seen.\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that some of you that are having issues just plane don't have enough ram installed in your computers, and bumping up your ram may help you out tremendously. Launch your \"Activity Monitor\" /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor and check and see how much ram you are using and how much physical memory you have and how much memory is used. I have 16 GB of ram installed, and currently I am using 9.25 GB of ram. Most of your machines can handle 16 GB of ram even if Apple officially says that you can only run 8 GB of ram.\n\nDownload and install Mactracker. http://mactracker.ca It's a free database of everything that Apple has ever manufactured. It will tell you what type of ram and how much ram you can actually install in your machine. Make sure that the ram chips that you buy are made for Apple computers. Ram chips that are manufactured specifically for Apple computers have to meet a much higher standard than those meant for any old pos low quality manufactured machine. There are many good manufacturers of ram chips out there and many of them have memory scanners that are made just for you so you get the exact chips that you need. Ram chips are not hard to install on an Apple computer. Apple makes it really easy for you to install them yourself, and even though the chips for an Apple computer must meet a much higher manufacturing standard for Apple computers, most chip sets are pretty inexpensive in comparison to those sold for other manufacturers machines.\n\nOh, and dial back your in game graphics. You don't need to run your game on the highest graphics settings.\n\nI almost forgot, I shut my computer down each night, and I restart my computer when I want to use it to game. Many people NEVER shut down their computers and wind up having some weird oddities that a simple restart will cure.\n\nWell, I hope this helps someone.\n\n{{champion:17}} \n\nThe way I see it, we are ALL winners here, fore we are gaming together, and therefore since we are gaming, we ALL have already won.

The download of the actual files may take hours depending on your Internet connection. That \"League of Legends\" application will grow. On my computer it has grown to 6.46 GB and as Riot releases more updates, it will continue to grow.\nYou may want to read my earlier post above. Yes, it's long, but it solved my issues, and that's why I shared it with others. My hope was to elevate the stress of others.\n\nOh, I almost forgot, I shut my computer down each night, and I restart my computer when I want to use it to game. Many people NEVER shut down their computers and wind up having some weird oddities that a simple restart will cure.\n\n{{champion:17}} \n\nThe way I see it, we are ALL winners here, fore we are gaming together, and therefore since we are gaming, we ALL have already won. Now let's just enjoy our time together.\n\nSee Ya In The Rift ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Obi won Ric","date":"2016-10-07T11:24:49.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he item list can't be costumized because the drag items does not work. It creates and saves lists. It does not allow for dragging items inside the blocks. This is seems to be a client issue and has been reported in other threads without answers. Would be nice if someone from riot at least says something about it. If it is a bug or if we ar doing something wrong on our side.\n\nThanks for the help.","replies":[]}]}
