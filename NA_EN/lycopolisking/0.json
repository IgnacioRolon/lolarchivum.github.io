{"poster":"LycopolisKing","date":"2015-02-03T18:00:30.158+0000","title":"Riot, please don't limit Marauder Ashe from its full potential.","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","embed":{"description":null,"url":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ziWalO15AE8/VMgi4eFjtdI/AAAAAAAAiiM/1k9mtASHnTs/s1600/asheturn.jpg","image":null},"up_votes":147,"down_votes":6,"body":"After seeing the explanation in [this thread, ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/aHJkftZV-skin-team-why-does-inquisitor-nautilus-have-unique-particleseffects-but-maurader-ashe-doesnt?comment=0000) I have to voice my concern  about Marauder Ashe's place in her skin arsenal as well in the game as a whole. The skin fulfills a dark-themed Ashe skin in which she is not only battle ready, but she is looking for blood. It is a far cry from her usual, noble calling, as her armor and bow are wicked, and she has joined ranks with the Blood Hunter. \r\n\r\nAs far as her weaponry goes, the skin does not make thematic sense to continue to shoot blue arrows. **It can be seen from the skin's images that the arrow in her hand and in her quiver are black.** At the very least, she should be shooting black arrows, even as they are enchanted. **The same cosmetic change was made for Sivir {{champion:15}}  and Nautilus {{champion:111}} ,** without affecting a change in price tier.\r\n\r\nBut I am not concerned about a price tier; I am concerned about the skin's strength and uniqueness in Ashe's collection. Ashe currently has (4) skins, excluding her base, that have no color change on her abilities, and they are scattered through price tiers and themes. At the moment, there are quite a few skins that the player can choose from when hoping to see Ashe's base particles, and Sherwood Forest Ashe nearly encroaches on this skin in terms of using a hunting theme without a change in her arrow colors. However, this should not be the case in the slightest: in this skin, Ashe is wearing full armor and seems to have made a drastic change in her ethos; and I feel the skin should fully reflect that. For that reason, **I think, at the very least, a cosmetic change should be made to the color of the arrows that Ashe fires**. \r\n\r\nRecently, there have been several fantastic themes in terms of their thematic fits with champions and vastly different fantasies that they bring to life, such as El Tigre Braum {{champion:201}}  and Firecracker Jinx {{champion:222}} being skins that take the limits of their champions to new heights of imagination while remaining completely true to the champion's character. These new skins have been amazingly well done, and as dedicated Ashe player, I am thrilled to see her being chosen to be part of this new wave of deliberate skin themes. It pains me, however, to think that the theme is not seeing its fullest potential because of its pre-determined price tier.  Players should have no problem obtaining a skin for Ashe that is not 975 - she has two 520 skins after Freljord became Legacy. I do not think that players will object to this skin's price tier: I think they will object to its missed opportunity when compared to other recent skins. \r\n\r\nI, and most players will understand how this skin stands apart from Heartseeker Ashe and are not seeking for this skin to compete directly with it, as they fulfill two different fantasies - we just want the fantasy to be as strong as it possibly can be, and a simple weapon consistency would be a step in the right direction. \r\n\r\nI for one, would love to see frosted black particles, as if Ashe has finally been corrupted by the Blackfrost that claimed Anivia as well. I would be more than willing to support voice processing to account for the helmet Ashe is wearing, but that is another conversation. ;) \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am thrilled to see Ashe get love in this skin, and I love the direction of the theme; as an Ashe player, I love this skin for its darker theme. However, I think a small change would make it a fantastic skin.\r\n\r\n**TLDR: ** **Please consider applying a simple cosmetic change to Ashe's ability arrows for thematic consistency, such as black arrows to match the arrows in her hand and quiver, similar to the purple in Amethyst Ashe, to fully realize this skin's dark theme. Thank you for the Ashe love - please don't half-heart it. {{champion:22}} **","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2015-02-04T08:31:15.536+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to hop in and say, even if this change doesn't go through this discussion was fantastic to read. You have some compelling points in your argument for pushing the particles, specifically the arrows, further. \n\nI'm a huge fan of this skin as well.

I can't think of a single skin that I have ever wanted Riot to make more expensive so that it can get what it deserves. I love Heartseeker Ashe, I think it has been one of the best skins that Riot has made to date, but this skin blows Heartseeker out of the water in appearance, I could see this skin being at least being a 1350 skin if the rest of the kit required were added in.
