But the position is. The entire role is.\n\nI've always been an ADC main, and from time to time, I found myself wondering why was this role even played. When you get that bruiser in your face, who just walks to you, just press some buttons and leave you dead, with no reaction of your team, it seems unfair. When you get that assassin on you, who just one shot you and nobody even care, you wander how you're supposed to deal damage and carry the game. \n\nADC is team reliant. ADC is positioning reliant. \n\nAnd that's why Vayne is too strong currently. She doesn't even need her team help. That means something is wrong, because no ADC should be able to play freely without help. Even if she's intended to be a good duelist, the BOTRK buff made her too strong :/ The mobility  and the damage she already got in her kit, coupled with this item, make her way too strong.
