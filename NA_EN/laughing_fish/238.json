He posts in memes and games (which is perfectly fine) not anything else so if you were looking for another 'type' of post, can easily just use the buttons on the left to say \"hey, I'm looking for a team- lets go to team recruitment\" or maybe \"I want to see what neat meme's the playerbase came up with today!

Obviously the ADC will blame me, but there's such a stigma against them that nowadays teammates usually assume the ADC is to blame\n\nIt's like reverse role-ism I guess? :P Being an ADC main is like being a white cis-male in today's society lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH","date":"2015-06-17T20:20:24.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laughing Fish,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=f8cNLEyK,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2015-06-17T19:52:12.774+0000)\n>\n> Exactly.
