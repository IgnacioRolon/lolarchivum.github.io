Worked surprisingly well!\n\nNot only did I get to frequently top off other lanes, but if my _own_ lane was losing, I'd heal up my ADC, recall, then immediately teleport back in. That turned things around pretty well. Moreover, mid-late game, I found myself frequently teleporting to team mates that'd been caught out to spam heals and turn battles around. Helped a lot when my team tried to split push.\n\n10/10 would recommend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordFluffyJr","date":"2015-12-16T14:21:05.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too play much Soraka.
