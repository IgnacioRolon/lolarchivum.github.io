Phreak actually sounds like he enjoys the game of League of Legends.\n\nThe impression I get is that Phreak is less a fan of the game itself and more a fan of the culture surrounding it, which is why he makes so many jokes. I think he loves casting, probably more than most commentators, but I wouldn't say he's more passionate about the game. At least, I've never watched EU LCS and thought that they sounded bored or uninterested.\n\nIt might be that I have low standards for sounding interested and it's definitely that I just don't really have the sense of humour that a lot of the community has (Twitch comment stream is a mess to me), but I generally disagree with people whenever they complain about non-Phreak casters!","replies":[{"poster":"Naristracrates","date":"2016-03-07T19:52:38.220+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the top four casters, that are the most passionate about the game, are Jatt, Deficio, Monte, and Kreppo.

Phreak is still my favorite, because I really enjoy his humor, and his play by play actually gets me more into the game than I usually would have.  He gets really into it.  I also want to make it clear that I think Phreak is very knowledgeable of the game, but I'm sorry the four I listed know more.","replies":[{"poster":"Unskilledtroller","date":"2016-03-08T16:28:09.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THE QUAAAAAAAAA(voicecrack)AAAAAAAADRRAAA killll!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reynard the ƒox","date":"2016-03-08T00:39:49.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jatts annoying and Deficio is bland as fuck.

Phreak is certainly a big fan of the culture, possibly more than he is a fan of the game itself. The problem I have with the EU casters is that they sound almost robotic. They are hyper focused on the game, which has its advantages (from what I have seen the EU casters are better at keeping track of things like flash timers), but it can be harder to pay attention to them during slow parts of the game. If all 10 players are just farming, I would prefer the casters to make some jokes and talk about the game as a whole, rather then go into great detail of last hitting. Obviously this is personal preference, but that is the primary reason I prefer Phreak. To me he understands that at the end of the day, League of Legends (even professional league) is a *game*. \n\nAlso, the Twitch comment stream *is* a mess.","replies":[{"poster":"kaltenashes","date":"2016-03-08T00:08:07.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i watch all NA, a bit of EU (origen/fnatic/sometimes UOL) and LCK (ROX/SKT) \n\ni like casters in all these regions, but when the teams are focused on farming, i wish i could just mute them all and hear the game sounds","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WadeWilson1337","date":"2016-03-08T08:37:02.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frankly, i think Phreak does the perfect job.
