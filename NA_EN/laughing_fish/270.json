They are by far the two most brilliant inventors, they both created a line of robotic champions (Battlecast for Viktor, Mecha for Heimerdinger), and they both even have a robotic arm. In my opinion, this is ripe for one of the greatest rivalries in League of Legends, but Viktor doesn't even acknowledge the Donger's existence. If Viktor thought Jayce could be a worthy ally at first because of his intelligence, why has he not even tried to convince Heimerdinger of the Glorious Evolution? In-game interactions would be nice, but I also think more of the lore should mention this.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-03-05T18:36:33.840+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Putting aside the fact that neither had interactions prior to their updates, and in Viktor's case he still has none, I suspect the reasoning behind this lack of acknowledgement is due to their characters.
