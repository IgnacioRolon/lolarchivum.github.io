Even Renekton can easily tower dive when fed as well as Aatrox.\n\nI'll take a Jax over Riven any day of the week. At least Jax is actually vulnerable to poke and has just one mobility tool and telegraphed stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2019-03-25T22:01:24.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh certainly, there are a few that snowball as brutally as him. Aatrox especially (though I haven't seen a good one in awhile. Not sure if this is because of my elo or if he just sucks now) offers no way to play around him once he gets fed enough. Irelia isn't nearly as brutal when fed as she was before her nerfs. A lot of that has to due with that she feels pretty underpowered right now. That's not to say she doesn't snowball hard af (she does), but she isn't Jax levels of unforgiving anymore. \n\nSo with Aatrox and Irelia no longer being as dangerous as they used to be, of the best top laners I'd say only Riven snowballs as hard as Jax, as like jax she has combination of mobility, defense, and high damage to dive you, kill you, and offer little counterplay once they have enough of a gold/xp lead.\n\n###### Maybe Kayle too, but tbh I make a lot of mistakes vs her so that might be a personal problem that I'm just not used to her. So I'm not sure if she counts as Jax level of snowball or not","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2019-03-26T08:16:44.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ever seen what happens when Urgot, renekton, Camilie or Riven get fed? :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Febos","date":"2019-03-25T22:02:06.203+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"David Tennant best Doctor ❤️","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2019-03-25T22:05:21.354+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was certainly good.

But Tenant captured the idealistic principles of the doctor perfectly and for that reason and a few others his episodes just feel the best to watch. Also, the writing went mostly to crap right before Smith's farewell and didn't really improve much since at least imo.\nI've heard good things about Jodie, but I dont have time to watch her yet.\nWill admit the episode right after \"Face the raven\" in the castle was probably the best in his run. I think that is \"heaven sent\" but it may be \"hell bent\" I'm not sure. His regeneration special wasn't bad either to be fair (still doesn't compare to vale decem tho :))","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2019-03-26T01:16:21.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the episode after \"Face the raven\" is \"Heaven Sent\", which was his best episode and imo the best in the series. Capaldi's final season was *very* solid imo, with the majority of the episodes being great. Him, Bill, and Nardole were a great trio, and the writing was a lot more creative. The fact that 2/3 seasons though had sub-par writing puts him behind Tennant though. \n\n>  I will admit that Tenant was not as charicateristically developed as Capaldi for sure.

The thing is Capaldi I feel was simply the best actor to play the doctor, which added a lot more emotion. But Tennant was a more well rounded and interestingly written character. \n\n\n> I've heard good things about Jodie, but I dont have time to watch her yet.\n\nShe has potential. But that potential hasn't been realized yet, and things don't always land. But there is a new showrunner at the same time as a new doctor, so some mistakes are inevitable. I have high hopes for future seasons though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2019-03-26T10:44:00.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I found the weakest writing to be Smith's era, really.
