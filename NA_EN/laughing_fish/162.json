Then Laughing Fish introduced Odarth to my stream. And then we realized that we are practically identical in regards to our personalities (like it is almost scary). Even our ranks and career paths are the same. \n\nSo yeah, if I can get a bf, I am sure most everyone else who doubts it can. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-06-16T09:02:31.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'm a bit of an extreme case, imo.\n\nI literally (like, literally. I'm not kidding or exaggerating) have never had friends, not even when I was little -- and not even my family likes being around me, and acts like I'm not even there unless they need something from me. I'm not a psychopath, I don't smell, I'm a clean person, I'm stupidly nice, all that. There's no real reason I can think of for it. But, I'm halfway to 23 years old, and I've never had a friend (in person or on the internet), and never so much as hugged a girl, much less go on a date or find a girlfriend (I'm a guy, by the way, so it's not unheard of).\n\nIn person, people seem to like me, and I make people laugh a lot, but I just don't really connect with anyone. I'm not like anyone near my age, and get along better with older folk (40-50+) than I do other early 20s people -- but, even then, I'm very different from most people in my ideals and morality. I'm kind of a boring person in today's society, and I'm not willing to get drunk, high or anything like that, and I'm not a thrill seeker. So, after so many years, I just lost hope really, and stopped caring about people. I'm still nice, still talkative, all that, but I don't go chasing people down. I can go days without talking though, if I'm not at work or something.\n\nOn the internet, I tend to be a lot more blunt about things, and speak my mind easier -- not entirely a good thing. What happens most of the time is that I piss people off and make enemies with everyone just because I don't agree with some idea of theirs, or I think differently than they do, or something. I've been playing MMOs for close to 14 years now, and I never really had a guild, never had internet friends to play with, none of that. Just always done stuff solo, or pugged groups for things.\n\nAs for girls, I hear that I'm not ugly, even attractive, but I'm still anathema to them. I've had several dating ads / profiles for around four and a half years now, and I've never been on a date, despite messaging people I like and would get along with. Every girl I ever talk to in reality has a boyfriend, or just wants nothing to do with me -- the girl I had a crush on from 4th grade to graduation said, \"Sorry, I'm working on myself right now.\" \n\nSo, honestly, I don't really think I have much reason to have any kind of hope whatsoever. I've been alone all my life though, so I'm used to it at this point; doesn't really bother me unless I think about it too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Aír","date":"2016-06-16T09:29:21.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I was in an extremely similar situation to you. >.< \n\nThe only thing that i was truly lucky about is that the League of Legends community is mostly male, so it is easier for me to make good friends who are guys (which is a requirement before I can even possibly get a crush on anyone since I am a demisexual). And also, it helped me find people I match with. My first boyfriend who actually loved me I met on League of Legends and that was 2 years ago. And Odarth is the first boyfriend who's future I look forward to have with. :3\n\nBut yeah, when I was younger, I was never allowed to leave the house. I never hung out with anyone. My dad left when I was younger so everyone became abusive toward me, so I had no relationship with my family (aside from essentially a business one) and meanwhile I still had no way to talk to anyone who even remotely could be a friend to me. I was very much alone and depressed. I used to be very talkative, but then it got so bad that I even stopped talking in general at one point at school. I was also so different. I dressed in clothes I bought from the guys' section of the department store - guy jeans and t-shirts -, I had buzz cut my hair, wore a binder. I tried to be so much like a guy because of how guyish I was, so eventually I started to make a few friends, but it only remained friends since i did kinda friendzone myself... \n\nBut it was a place to start. I might not have been able to hang out with them much, but all I needed to do in reality was just open up to people more. I tend to trust people too much at times. I think over what I consider safe to tell people. Stuff that is generic, where if it backfired, no one could really use it against me. Like me telling you all of this is relatively generic and you still could not know who I am IRL and find me if you truly were another cyberbully (I got cyberbullied before because of how easily I trusted people). \n\nIf League of Legends is what you truly love to do, then play it and add people you enjoy playing with. And just let that person or people know a bit more about yourself. You can be surprised with how many people you can find that are just like you. :3 \n\nI know I was.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-06-16T23:05:55.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually asexual, so, even if anyone did take interest in me, they'd be done with me pretty quickly. But, like you said, gaming is mostly made up of guys, so that's not really an avenue for me.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought school would be a place I could find people my own age, and make friends. Was a super talkative, friendly person when I started Kindergarten, but everyone just seemed to kind of push away. After a while, people had little groups they always worked with, and the teacher would actually put me into groups since I never had one. After a few years of that, I just stopped trying. In high school, the only friends I had were those in books I read. Was never outwardly weird, was never some freaky person, was just normal -- but, for some reason, no one wanted anything to do with me. Every now and then people would talk to me, but then they'd disappear just as quickly.\n\nWhen I open up to people though, they run. A lot of the time, I think I'm an alien or something -- I'm just so different from other people, it's absurd.\n\nHonestly, I can't stand League. The only reason I play it is because my siblings do (though they don't play with me, so that makes no sense) and there just aren't many good games left. I played WoW for over 10 years and loved it, but then GC left for Riot, and the new guy took the game and simplified it so much that it just put me to sleep. Haven't logged into WoW since 6.0 dropped. Anything I do love is either long dead or isn't a group activity.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-06-15T22:35:38.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well thanks to you Fish i found my soul mate!\n\nOh _Malicious _ love.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ca/0f/05/ca0f05ecbf375ce95a5abd99d0e832bb.jpg\n\nP.S. hes the hot blond","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Aqualious","date":"2016-06-15T21:18:47.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, I was thinking about a math exam I just wrote...
