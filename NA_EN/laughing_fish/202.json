I used a random number generator to select the winners from a list of the 202 eligible candidates. The winners are:\n\n* a w1ld Bulbasaur\n* Athyarra\n* Embertine \n* DragonManSquid \n\nFriend requests have been sent to the winners, and the gift will be sent 24-48 hours after the friend request is accepted. I would also like to thank deoje299, who helped a lot of people correctly post their gifs. As such, I will also be sending him a gift as well. If the friend request is not accepted within 1 week, the prize is forfeit. Thanks for playing everyone!\n\n\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XIOSiVd.png\n\nIt is good to be King.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ur8vSIm.jpg\n\n---------------------------\n\nSince I began my campaign for complete domination of the boards, many things have changed. Some posters have disappeared, never to be seen again. Some slowly lost interest and just faded away. Some stood against me, believed themselves to be my rival. And a few have stood the test of time and raged against the dying of the light. But none of this has deterred me. This is my domain, and you are my beloved people. So, to show you all my appreciation, I have decided to throw this joyous event, and give away some free skins!\n\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/cfd039730669f89c064f69e57e0877af/tumblr_nj6ipiNACJ1t8s6eeo1_500.gif\n\n#How to play:\nAll you need to do is post a gif of an upvote! Oh, and say my name. I not joking. If you do not say my name you will **not** win a prize.\n\nhttps://m.popkey.co/b83c5e/lMEpZ.gif\n\nAt the start there will only be one mystery skin given away. But for every 100 upvotes this post gets, I will give away another mystery skin! (up to 7 skins, unlocked at 600 upvotes. I will be using FEK to check the total number of upvotes, so downvotes have no effect on this. \n\n1 upvote = 1 skin (Unlocked)\n100 upvotes = 2 skins (Unlocked)\n200 upvotes = 3 skins (Unlocked)\n300 upvotes = 4 skins (Unlocked)\n400 upvotes = 5 skins (Not reached yet)\n500 upvotes = 6 skins (Not reached yet)\n600 upvotes = 7 skins (Not reached yet)\n\n-------------------------\n\nOne entry per person, open to NA only (sorry EU folks). Ends Sunday, June 4 at 3pm EST. I will use a random number generator to pick between all eligible entries. I will send a friend request to winners, and gifts will be sent 24-48 hours after the friend request is accepted. If the winner doesn&#039;t accept the friend request within one week, their prize is forfeit. As I intent to share the winning gifs, I reserve the right to disqualify any participant whom I feel has posted an inappropriate gif.\n\n------------------------------\n\n> # **How to post a gif**\n>* step 1: Final the desired gif\n> * step 2: right click the gif and click &quot;copy image address&quot; (wording varies by browser)\n> * Step 2 alternate: if the URL does not copy correctly, open the image in its own tab and copy URL from there.\n> * Step 3: post URL into the comment. \n> * Step 4: Watch this video for motivation.\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0\n>\n>**NOTE: If you have a giphy gif, you need to need to obtain the image URL, and post it into your browser.
