I mean in general terms I think it is fine to expect a Diamond player to know about the game then a Bronze. But I don't think that higher rankings always mean that the player knows more about the game then a lower tier player. I am sure that there are low elo players that have a really good understanding of strategy, shot calling, and teamwork. But they are unable to climb quickly because they are lacking in mechanical skill and their ability to hard carry. And then you get the players that got to Platinum by playing one or two champions, but find themselves unable to climb higher as the competition gets better and teamwork becomes more important. \n\nBut I do tend to look at the rank more along the lines of what you said, a consistency factor.
