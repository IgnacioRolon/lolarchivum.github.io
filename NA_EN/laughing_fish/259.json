I'd be willing to wager rather sizable sums of money that your IQ is lower than mine, but I know that you, having said you have no intention of proving yours, will simply dodge such a wager. To do so is understandable, because to lose money over such a petty thing as what equates to little more than a dick-measuring competition would add insult to injury at finding out that you're not quite the special snowflake you always thought yourself to be. However, I don't need to do that, because your opinion of what I find amusing doesn't actually matter to anyone but you, as can be shown by your receiving downvotes for voicing said opinion.\n\nAs for who is the better league player, I'm certain that you are the superior player with your Silver 5, sub 50% winrate, poor winrates on half of your top played champions this season, mediocre average farm, etc.  Your sense of humor might be lacking, however, if you can't see the comedy in two immortal gods smacking eachother until they become bored with the exchange and decide to walk away like gentlemen, but then again I don't know you so I can't make any realistic calculations about what things satiate such a highly advanced intellect such as yours.\n\nMy ultimate point is, you can attack my character all you like (though if you're as intelligent as you claim to be, you'd understand that doing so is an ad nauseam logical fallacy, which by nature would invalidate your argument in any respectable forum of debate), but it doesn't change the fact that I am allowed to enjoy whatever I like to, and while you can puff yourself up to think yourself superior for not enjoying the comedy in the situation I described, your opinion doesn't actually matter to anyone other than yourself, and doesn't actually say anything about anyone but yourself. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-04-02T04:39:31.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, let's begin.  I test three standard deviations above the mean on both the Wechsler and Stanford-Binet tests.  I'm also a member of Mensa, though, frankly, that isn't actually a very high bar.\n\nI already said I do not harbor any delusion that I am good at this game.  I never will be.  Being physically disabled in my arm makes the simplest mechanics difficult.  I love it when people try to list my stats as though it will hurt my feelings.  The nice thing about the physical disability is I actually can claim to be WELL below my true MMR.  With two properly functioning arms instead of just one, or one and a half on a good day, I can easily argue that I should be much higher.  I'll never be able to actually reach my true MMR, since the disability I have is what remained AFTER surgery and therapy.  What's your excuse for your poor play, then?\n\nIf you were as intelligent as you pretend to be, you'd know that there is no purpose in referencing logical fallacies in a debate about an opinion on what is enjoyable.  I merely argue, and I maintain that this is true, that enjoying the wet noodle fight that is the tank meta highly correlates to having an average or below average IQ.  Stupid people are oft easily amused.  That's another thing I love, though--when people pretending to be smart try to use logical fallacies and fail so miserably at it.  Would you care to try again?
