Sharing his brothers love of metal and malice, he began maining the Iron Reverent. Unlike his brother though, he lacked the natural ability to handle such evil, and his skill with the champion continued to degenerate until there was nobody left in NA who was worse.

While other children completed useless tasks like learning mathematics or training in sports, Laughing Fish knew the truth: If a man does not laugh, a man does not truly live. Trying to understand what drives humor forward, the child opened his mind to the internet itself. The entirety of the world&#039;s cat puns and dank memes flooded his mind, and the boy realized something: The world is a dark place, but it didn&#039;t have to be. Taking on the identity of &quot;The Hero of Memes&quot;, Laughing Fish introduced the world to a new type of meme: The GIF (Pronounced Jiff). Determined to spread happiness and cheer wherever he goes, Laughing Fish has become a force for good in a decreasingly dank world.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-06-22T19:52:19.733+0000","up_votes":81,"down_votes":2,"body":"I want to approve of this post, but you mispronounced GIF","replies":[{"poster":"morayshark","date":"2016-06-22T19:53:50.797+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2013/105/0/7/wonka_thresh_blank_by_artsed-d61v5ys.jpg\noh hey, i see everyones getting thresh hooked to this thread","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-06-22T20:02:30.917+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pqsSc5H_uR8/VRS3FYM86PI/AAAAAAAAMKA/ZyWkGhjbQkw/s1600/nautilusmall.png\nam i doin it rite?","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-06-22T20:05:45.595+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://31.media.tumblr.com/6e9dadf9a75844e68dbe98a1b577942b/tumblr_mz5esgjAYn1r0ckzto1_400.gif","replies":[{"poster":"morayshark","date":"2016-06-22T20:07:18.775+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01834/cat-thumbs-up_1834999i.jpg#thumbs%20up%20lol%20cat","replies":[]},{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-06-22T22:00:37.957+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"what, NCIS Gibbs gif but no headslap?\n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/vampirediaries/images/3/30/Gibbs_head_slap_by_eib29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150406181914","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-06-22T19:58:10.435+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"I can't mispronounce it, as I define its pronouncation.\n\nhttps://www.altushost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_inline_ncwkcvxBij1skdz89.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Koalifier","date":"2016-06-22T20:02:58.401+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingWanahakalugi","date":"2016-06-22T21:23:39.479+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Laughing Fish just counter-smited a Rioter...\nhttps://memecrunch.com/meme/SXAY/talladega-nights-anarchy/image.jpg?w=1024&c=1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asyde","date":"2016-06-22T20:18:57.564+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Koalifier,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=Rtwgixlp,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-06-22T19:52:19.733+0000)\n>\n> I want to approve of this post, but you mispronounced GIF\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3oIm2JK.gifv","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"King Odin","date":"2016-06-22T19:51:19.976+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you mention a King, you must mention his Queen!","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-06-22T19:53:33.153+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Airman isn't a queen until you two get hitched. \nhttp://readeroffictions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gif-truth-glee.gif","replies":[{"poster":"King Odin","date":"2016-06-22T20:00:17.175+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well she is my fiancée until she changes her name to Queen Odarth then we're hitched officially in the league world.","replies":[{"poster":"Aír","date":"2016-06-22T20:02:06.260+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":">she is my fiancée\n\nI was not aware of this.
