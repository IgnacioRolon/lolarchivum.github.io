And I need to pay it, as I need the transcript to apply for internships. Which the university requires for a degree.\n\nGod I fucking hate this school... But what am I supposed to do, drop out and stop paying for all their ridiculous and unfair fees? I will need to pay back the student loans either way (loans that are only needed to pay this school thus far). I am not even learning anything here, am always miserable and can't even enjoy most things anymore, and my life is a quarter over with literally nothing to show for it. And I had to *pay* for this bullshit. \n\nFucking con artists is what they are, and like a goddamn moron I fell for it. I could have settled with my Associate's degree from the local community college + certificates, and been finished years ago with much less debt. But noooo, I had to transfer to a university, and let these parasites suck me dry while they smile and talk about how great they are.","replies":[]}
