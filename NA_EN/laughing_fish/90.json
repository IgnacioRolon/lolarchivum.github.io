I don't wanna see my leesin or Elise power farming for 6 fucking items.\n\nPeople need to get KDA out of their heads.\n\nA 0/0/0 jungler may or may not have ganked-there are such things as successful ganks without a kill-forcing someone to blow flash, and/or getting them low enough they have to go b, allowing your team to get ahead. They may have gotten dragon/Herald, counter jungled, etc. Quite frankly when I jungle, I find it annoying when one lane keeps pinging me to help. If you've died 4 times to ganks/your opponent, they're going to be too far ahead for me to do much anyways, unless they try to dive while I'm there. It'd literally be a waste of time to go up there.\n\nAs one who plays both top and jungle, I'm telling you-if you're in a bad spot and keep getting ganked, play even more defensive. Give up the turret if you have to. Heck, if it's that bad, try either a lane swap with mid or ganking other lanes/grouping. This sounds strange, but I've lost games when playing as top, because my opponent I was crapping on (I'm 3-0 or 4-0) decides to roam bottom, gets a double, gets dragon, then takes out a tower or two. The match is now even.\n\nI'm not saying there's no such thing as a bad jungler, that they are never to blame, that a 0/0/0 means they're always fine. Rather, I'm trying to impress upon you to look around at what they're doing, not just KDA, since there's so much more to it than that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wildfox9T","date":"2019-03-26T14:41:50.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*and yet somehow getting outfarmed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2019-03-25T21:51:45.855+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"^ along with being able to win lane without ganks if they are ganking another lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2019-03-25T21:55:15.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.
