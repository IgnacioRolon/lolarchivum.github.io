Honestly, he was picked because he was a relatively safe and neutral pick, who could survive most match ups, even if he didn't win them.  He wasn't much of a counter to anyone, and he also had a good few counters himself (Sion, Quinn, Panth, Cam, Rumble, Riven, YORICK, Jax, Rammus, Yasuo, Olaf, Irelia, Vlad, Kled all had favorable match ups, positive winrates, and better team contributions than Urgot on average when picked against him top lane.  That list just happens to include many META soloqueue top laners, and its almost 15 champions out of roughly 60 commonly picked in top lane.)  Losing to 25% of the top lane roster in solo queue with less than 2% pickrate, and barely over a 50% winrate in plat+ did not at all warrant these levels of gutting, and especially not to his only survivability tool as a juggernaut who cannot build {{item:3053}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3022}}  effectively, who gets less out of {{item:3044}} /{{item:3071}}  than other juggernauts, and who cannot use Conqueror or Grasps of the Undying effectively either due to the fact that his paltry 300 range forces him to be treated as a ranged champion, while Irelia's 200 range (which is 25 longer than the juggernaut class who is supposed to outrange all other melee champions, and who were given 175 range intentionally to outrange 125 laners, due to the limitations put on juggernauts) does not.  Bonus points for him also being the only juggernaut now without high base sustain or a tool to provide healing/regen/lifesteal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2019-03-07T01:29:42.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"###**_Then urgot patch 9.6_**\n\nMana increased from 300 to 340 \nMana Regen Growth increased from.6 to .8 \nEchoing Flames (Passive)\n[REMOVED] No longer deals reduced damage to enemies hit by it in the last 5 seconds. \n\n**Purge (W) **\n[REMOVED] No longer shields\nCost lowered from 65 to 40 \nOn-hit damage reduction lowered from 66% to 50%\nCooldown lowered from 17/15/13/11/9 >>> **8/6/4/2/0 **\n\n> https://i.imgflip.com/1otr4z.jpg\n\n\n**Disdain (E)**\n[NEW] Grants a shield for 60/80/100/120/140 (+200% bonus AD) on cast \nDamage changed from [60/100/140/180/220 (+.50% total AD)] to [90/120/150/180/210 (+100% bonus AD)]\nCooldown changed from [1615/14/13/12] to [14 at all ranks] \nCost cost increased from [50 at all ranks] to [50/60/70/80/90]\n\n**Fear Beyond Death (R)**\nCast time increased from .4 to .5 \nDamage changed from [50/175/300 (+50% total AD)] to [125/250/375 (+50% bonus AD)\nRange increased from 1600 to 2500 \n\n> https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/706/738/e60.jpg\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"SettDownShutUp","date":"2019-03-07T03:53:36.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHAHA!!!
