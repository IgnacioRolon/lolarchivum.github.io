From personal experience trying to fight this attitude in low elo, I believe that at least a significant part of this problem is a self-fulfilling prophecy. When people believe that the disadvantage creates an insurmountable gap (or one not worth trying to bridge), they're more likely to tilt and /ff. Tilted players play worse, and badly tilted players are often detriments to the team, creating a huge disparity in effective skill and snowballing the team with the advantage. When a team has four players who /ff when they're behind, then \"behind\" will always means a loss, further skewing the numbers.\n\nDon't get me wrong, being at a disadvantage is, well, a disadvantage. Just by definition you have a smaller likelihood of winning if you're behind. But... isn't this a competitive game? I mean, what kind of competitor gives up the moment their opponent gains the upper hand? Do amateur sports teams just shrug and walk off the field if their opponent scores? The very idea goes against the spirit of competition. Sure, you're less likely to win, but why does that matter? Why does that mean you should give up? Are you playing a game, or are you playing statistics? Winning is not the point of a game. Yes, you strive to win - but you do just that! Strive! Don't just give up and go off and play a new game because it's a \"waste of time\" to play from behind. At that point, are you playing League, or are you trying to maximize the number of times you get the emotional payoff of a win in a given time period? In other words, do you even want to play for the sake of playing?\n\nI realize not everyone has the mentality of journey over destination, but even players who are _extremely_ goal-oriented - who for whatever reason cannot enjoy something they don't win - should hopefully realize that, by giving up, they are looking at a guaranteed loss rather than merely a likely one. Sure, you can get into another game faster, but there's at least as good a chance of the same thing happening there. In fact, there's arguably a _higher_ chance of a poor start, since you're now tilted. Then the same thing happens, you give up again, and you've \"wasted\" another 20 minutes (minimum) to no avail.\n\nOne more thing! Learning. Why are you behind? What are their win conditions? What are yours? How do you prevent theirs and bolster yours? How can you change your build or work to avoid mistakes to prevent their advantage from getting worse? Where might they make mistakes that you can exploit? Even if you're wrong about _every single one of these_ in a given game, you can - if you're willing, and go into it with this in mind - learn from it, allowing a much greater chance for you to win otherwise-losing games in the future.\n\nWrote a bit more than I intended here. This sort of thing is a little bit of a pet peeve of mine. I lose far, far more games to toxic or fatalistically-resigned teammates than I do to enemies outplaying us or being at all competent. Hopefully I've gotten my point across in a clear - if not concise - and non-hostile manner. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-02-16T00:01:57.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aren't wrong, but you aren't fully correct either.
