The roster seems in place (a few people who left were re-added, but nothing big), and the ranks were correct. The only problem, however, is that I am no longer the leader. In fact, the club has no leader now. I do not know if it is related, but about 4 months ago I left the club for approximately 2 weeks. I was given leadership back when I rejoined.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-02T18:23:32.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be due to some club issues we've been seeing since clubs were restored after some [downtime](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/nMisJPK8-clubs-outage-oct-2016).
