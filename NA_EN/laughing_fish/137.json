Sure you might get punished by the League system, but it doesn't do much of anything else to you as a person.

Just to name a few:\n\n* There was El Shehaby, the Egyptian who refused to shake the hand of his Israeli opponent. \n* Hope Solo, the American Soccer player who called the Swedish \"cowards\" when they beat her, and went on about how \"the best team did not win\". \n* Joud Fahmy, the Saudi Arabia judoka who forfeit a match to avoid the Israeli combatant.  \n* Michael Conlan, the Irish boxer who flipped off the judges and said Putin paid them off after he lost to the Russian boxer. \n* And Ibtihaj Muhammad, the American fencer who has been trash talking her own country since she got there. \n\nThis is part of why it is so important to focus on the honorable people like Nikki Hamblin and Abbey D'Agostino. Just because there are a few unsportsmanlike individuals doesn't change that there are some truly respect worthy people competing.","replies":[{"poster":"WacingTheFind","date":"2016-08-16T22:45:33.706+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure this is the first time I see you commenting something serious.
