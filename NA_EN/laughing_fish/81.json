Vlad is another example of a champ thats incredibly strong in the meta but no one played  him because his playstyle is very binary (spam q or all in with his combo) and not flashy like all the new champs. \n\n If anything vlad is an example of one of the least gated champ in the game, he has no resources and low cooldowns on all his skills if you build him with half a brain","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-07-31T00:56:45.334+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:238}} is still an incredibly safe and reliable pick, even with his recent nerfs, a skilled player can work wonders with him.

That's like saying riven is gated because she has a CD on her Q lol\n\nI wrote cho is OP and you wrote he is too so thanks for agreeing with me?\n\nIf you don't suck you can't lose lane with vlad you just wait until 9 and then hyper sustain until the other guy is dead.. no one runs ignite anymore so it's not like people all in early. Late game you will never die and can do 2 full rotations with ult if you build zhonya with minimal or no counterplay because he's untargetable.\n\nThere's no such thing as overpowered done right, the champs just stay like that until they are popular and then they get nerfed. Zed isn't op post nerfs like I said because his entire kit is countered by zhonya (i.e. if you pop it he not only loses all his damage but his ult cooldown too and it's run by every mage in the game nowadays)","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-07-31T07:10:48.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You just said these champs were gated and now you're saying they aren't gated.\n\nI meant to say that their gating doesn't prevent them from being op.\n\n>CD arent a gating mechanism, mana is.\n\nActually, it is.  Could you imagine a Lux ult without a cooldown?\nPeople don't consider cooldowns to be gating, but the fact is they are, they are the very basis of gating.\n\nYou said Cho was op mid, I'm saying he's op no matter where you take him.  I've only run into a couple of match ups where Cho can't come out of lane ahead and they are few and rarely used.\n\n>If you don't suck you can't lose lane with vlad you just wait until 9 and then hyper sustain until the other guy is dead.. no one runs ignite anymore so it's not like people all in early. Late game you will never die and can do 2 full rotations with ult if you build zhonya with minimal or no counterplay because he's untargetable.\n\nVlad is susceptible to lane bullies early on, champs like Cass and Karth make lane a headache for Vlad up until he starts to really scale.\n\n>There's no such thing as overpowered done right, the champs just stay like that until they are popular and then they get nerfed. Zed isn't op post nerfs like I said because his entire kit is countered by zhonya (i.e. if you pop it he not only loses all his damage but his ult cooldown too and it's run by every mage in the game nowadays)\n\nJust because a champ can be countered doesn't mean they aren't overpowered.  Overpowered means they do slightly better than they should given an even state in terms of gold and exp.  Zed is a good example of this because he has so much burst potential, but he has to do things JUST right in order to pull it off.  He's not only got to use his ult, but bork active and drop his shadow so he can hit them with the triple shuriken plus an auto and E, all while trying to avoid getting CC locked.\n\nI'm not saying overpowered is bad, it's simply pointing out that different champs are slightly better off in a given meta or in certain situations due to how it buffs or nerfs them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-07-30T21:56:44.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this post is about those people who complain that something like {{champion:74}} or {{champion:3}} are OP just because they lost to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-31T01:16:52.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"oh lawdy people are dumb","replies":[{"poster":"TheVishual","date":"2015-07-31T01:29:18.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lane Cancer,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=Ibwe8K33,comment-id=00020002,timestamp=2015-07-31T01:16:52.336+0000)\n>\n> oh lawdy people are dumb\n\nThank you for your silver 3 input","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-31T01:55:06.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you for your obvious lack of functioning brain cells and/or chromosomes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jari","date":"2015-07-31T06:44:24.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheVishual,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=Ibwe8K33,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-30T18:22:44.707+0000)\n>\n> Implying there are no OP champs in league is just ignorant\n\nIt's for those that cry everything is OP.
