They discuss at length about the decline of good comedy, and how it's largely been replaced with unfunny memes. They come to a greater understanding of each other, though Twitch is somewhat harder to comprehend than Teemo, naturally, because his rework; while beautiful, it destroyed his dialogue's integrity. Now, Twitch merely demands sandwiches, as though it had any relevance to his character, and speaks like some mongoloid, joke voice actor trying way to hard to sound like a sneaky rat. Subtlety, though, is dead, which came along with the nerfs to Twitch's Q. Teemo considers that Twitch is what HE could become, perhaps, if he wasn't the sacred cow of shitty humour, and poorly-directed frustration. \n\nTwitch, having no way of finding a sandwich, chooses to lie down and die. Teemo watches, mildly intrigued by Twitch's perverse mind. He offers Twitch release. One mushroom, and it can be finished. Twitch considers for a moment, and takes the mushroom. He eats it, falls ill, and dies. Teemo slumps into a corner of the room pondering the morality of his actions. Assisted suicide is a dark and heavy consideration for some. Teemo sighs, takes a few bottles of Twitch's poison, and chooses to use them in the future. He waits until the door is unlocked. Nobody questions the dead rat. He was as good as dead, so they say, after the nerfs. Teemo walks out. He never uses the poison. \n\nYears later, Teemo will dust off those bottles in his house. His day on the Rift was difficult, and it left him feeling severely unhappy about his status in life. If he had a support of some kind, or if Twitch himself were still around, maybe he wouldn't be contemplating what he now contemplates. Maybe some friend could stop his train of negative emotions driven fundamentally by the horrible people still inhabiting the Rift. Toxins never die. For all the pain he's inflicted on others, he feels that perhaps it was his duty to do so, and that the toxicity on the Rift as it stands is more than could be justified by claims of duty. \n\nHe takes a bottle off the shelf, and pours the liquid into his tea. The evening sun wanes and submerges into the murky night. Stars gleam overhead as Teemo strolls over the wooded hills near his home. He sips from his cup slowly, feeling his nerves dull as his eyes glaze over, staring at the moon. Tears begin to form, but his face is nothing but wonderment - the gaze of seeing oneself in a crystal pond. He takes the last few sips, and he sits upon the hilltop. His trembling hands let the cup loose, and the remainder seeps into the earth. He lies on his back, falls prey to sleep, and dies.\n\nAnd when others find Teemo's corpse, he is mocked and denigrated as the scourge of the Rift, finally having met his death at his own hands, too weak to fight and die like a true warrior. On his tombstone, it reads:\n\n          \"Here Lies a Coward.\n The Lurker Dealing Poison Death\n Brought Death By Lurking Poison\"\n\nAnd not one person comes to see his passing.","replies":[{"poster":"Straley","date":"2015-03-19T00:35:14.771+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch is also my favorite champ and this is beautiful. +1 Don't know if the poison would be strong enough to kill though since they nerfed his passive too :(","replies":[{"poster":"Crate of Cobras","date":"2015-03-19T01:31:27.664+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"femmé","date":"2015-03-18T19:54:59.227+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"CAPTAIN TEEMO ON DU-\" {{champion:17}} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"CAPTAIN DRAAAAAVEN ON DUTY\" {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-03-18T20:01:03.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draaaaaaaaaaaaaaven cannot hit what he cannot see.","replies":[{"poster":"femmé","date":"2015-03-18T20:42:21.624+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea he can\nhe's just that good {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-03-19T00:17:22.880+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}} He's dead.\n{{champion:84}}  He's dead.\n{{champion:30}}  They're both dead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tentakill Myself","date":"2015-03-18T21:24:38.061+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:432}} Later Bitch.","replies":[{"poster":"DrathTurtle314","date":"2015-03-18T21:28:51.135+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We will just put them in a prison so that he will go past one wall into another locked room (assume teemo follows him each time) and make sure that no matter which walls he uses his magical journey on(and assuming he uses it off cooldown) he will still be in the complex for 24 hours.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"alcatrazEscapee","date":"2015-03-18T23:29:31.369+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Favorite Champion: {{champion:254}} \n\nPretty much this:\nhttps://vimeo.com/79953797\n\nAlthough inside a room, where teemo would be able to be endlessly bounced off of walls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-03-18T22:51:23.569+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:35}}  will just stand in the corner and stare at {{champion:17}}  while planting boxes in front of himself for protection and Shaco's clone is crying in the other corner.\nNot even a demonic jester can avert the Devil's wrath.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mathlete864","date":"2015-03-18T18:34:40.649+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:9}} Sluuurrppp Drain Drain Drain Drain","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-03-18T18:58:44.648+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't drain a soul that doesn't exist.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mirage Seraph","date":"2015-03-19T00:33:18.496+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:4}} \nPoker for the first 10 minutes.\nThen immediately Destiny out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-03-19T00:30:02.862+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:26}} would fast forward the 24 hours because he doesn't want to be in a room with that thing...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-03-18T20:57:23.222+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:101}} \"look what happened to {{champion:58}}\"","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-03-18T20:59:46.739+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}} would corrupt {{champion:101}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-03-18T21:03:43.179+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:101}} be like \"BITCH YOU CANT CORRUPT A PERFECT BEING\"","replies":[{"poster":"UncensoredAngel","date":"2015-03-19T02:21:28.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Than he would turn into a shadow and die","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-03-19T04:49:20.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:238}} Been there.
