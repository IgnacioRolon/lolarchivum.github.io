Gone are the days of effortless knowledge. Back then you could just press TAB and immediately compare yourself to your lane opponent. But now, now you need to spend time rearranging, sometimes several positions if you are ADC or support. \r\n\r\nThat is why I main top now, because the system still works perfectly if you play top.
