I believe TSM wins Game 5, but less confident in that prediction.\n\nWhy am I so sure TSM loses Game 1?\n\nSince Lustboy joined, TSM has played 8 Best of 3 or Best of 5 series (starting with Season 4 Summer Split Playoffs). Yes, TSM is 6-2 in those series, which makes me think TSM will eventually get the series win. But their 6-2 record is even more impressive once you hear this upcoming stat.\n\nDoes anyone remember what TSM's record is in Game 1 of the past 8 series?\n...\n1-7\n...\nYes, TSM won Game 1 just once during this current 6-2 run. Oh, and that lone Game 1 win? Against World Elite in the IEM Finals, when TSM was DOWN by about 7k gold until WE decided to dive mid inhib turret. 2 or 3 teamfights later, and TSM completes the comeback. So TSM could have lost all 8 Game 1s.\n\nBut yet, TSM won 6 of those 8 series, which makes me think TSM will win. They never feel out of it mentally, whether in a single game or a series itself. TSM just performs better when at a gold deficit than most other teams, able to hold the game close until the other team eventually screws up, gets over-confident, etc. Exhibit A: 1st game against CLG (the game that started CLG's Pink Age). Exhibit B: Keeping Liquid from winning the game for MUCH longer than it should have taken (and only losing because TSM themselves got over-confident and left the Rek'Sai backdoor wide open). Exhibit C: The aforementioned Game 1 vs WE.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-04-19T00:27:01.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A very likely prediction.
