This makes matchups against champs such as Zed very difficult, as you are forced to rush {{item:3157}} due to a lack of variety. But it doesn&#039;t have to be so! Indeed, on others maps their exists an item that is perfect for AP champs that need a little bit of tank to survive the ADC meta. But alas, it doesn&#039;t exist in the game&#039;s primary map, Summoner&#039;s Rift. I for one think it should be transfered over. Obviously it would need some fine tuning, but Rito pls.\n\nhttp://pa1.narvii.com/5938/134c6533cfc3db6e802bdfd8113d5fc325292814_hq.gif\nPRAISE THE MOON!\n\n> \n> http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/d/d5/Moonflair_Spellblade_item.png/revision/latest?cb=20131123191052\n> +50 magic resistance\n> +50 armor\n> +50 ability power\n> \n> Passive\n> UNIQUE â€“ TENACITY: Reduces the duration of all crowd control effects by 35%, except for Suppression, Stasis and Airborne effects such as Knockbacks, Knockups and Pulls.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-03-07T15:31:27.750+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:82}} hue","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-03-07T15:35:49.927+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:82}} hue","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2016-03-07T16:50:52.219+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:82}} BONK!!!!!!
