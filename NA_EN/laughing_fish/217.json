They proved it both during regular season by beating them twice and in the semi finals were they won 3-2. We will soon know whether H2K is better than SK on the 3rd place best of 5 matches.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-04-08T17:53:16.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the link man!

Find a team you care about.  If you don't have a preference stay with the \"honorable favorites\"... that is Fnatic for EU and TSM for NA.\n2.  Watch *every* game the team played this split... even the \"boring\" ones.  You need to learn everyone so you have appreciation for the game.\n3.  Watch all of the Prime Time Leagues for S5.  Watch this show each week... they do a good work summarizing LCS action.\n\nOnce you have done this and you have lots of time left over; you can start to watch other teams, or watch both EU/NA.  Also try to watch some of the matches of the \"lesser\" teams as well.  Once you do you will better understand and appreciate LCS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akeydel","date":"2015-04-08T17:48:14.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you want just good league games (with commentary) heres a few great ones:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUFmbdTksuo#t=3m20s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRAoZJolrYI#t=4m11s","replies":[{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2015-04-08T21:19:09.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I watched the first but not the second\n\nI'd say though the best game this season is either\n\nUOL vs TSM game 1 San Jose (dat TF jungle),\n\nUOL vs FNC Week 8 (its like a reverse xpeke if you know what that is) \n\nUOL vs GMB Game 2 playoffs (Man-bear-pig-flash-slap-first-blood)","replies":[{"poster":"Akeydel","date":"2015-04-08T21:31:16.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The second one is my favorite game ever played, if you watch the first 5~10 minutes you'll understand. but I'll probably watch the ones you posted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"3tyson","date":"2015-04-08T17:40:31.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uol watch all uol games they r fucking epic be sure to watch uol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reynard the Æ’ox","date":"2015-04-08T17:53:28.020+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The best way to get started is to just start.

Both NA and EU LCS are in the semifinals of the Spring Split playoffs, which basically means the first half of the season is ending and at the end of it there will be an NA and EU champion on top. \n\nTSM vs TiP should be a pretty good match. They are each fighting to get into the finals in a best of 5 match. TSM is usually pretty fun to watch, and its likely TiP is riding high after their dominating victory over Gravity in the quarter finals. \n\nNot to discourage you from watching LPL or LCK (Chinese and Korean leagues respectively), I just know most people don't want to be up at 4:00 in the morning just to watch a League match. NA LCS is usually at noon PST on Saturdays and Sundays, EU LCS is on Thursday Friday and starts at...9am PST?

I caught a few games here and there at Worlds but I didn't follow much before that. I knew most of the teams names though, couldn't go anywhere in League without seeing TSM, C9, LMQ(when they were still around), CLG, Fnatic. Worlds was probably the best time for anyone to get into LCS. Plenty of teams to choose for your favorites. That was where I officially became a C9 fan. But you probably don't want to wait for This year's Worlds. I'd say watch a few VODs of previous matches first to get a general feel for it(and to pick a team to root for if you want), Learn who the casters and analysts are. But if your deadset on getting into the matches this weekend, then I'd recommend either TSM vs TIP or TL vs C9. TSM is currently the #1 in NA and that's got to boost their confidence going into this match. TIP though is really strong right now and will put up a good fight. TL is finally looking strong with Piglet, the ADC who won Worlds a few years back, on their side. C9 had a rough start to the season but after taking down both TSM and CLG to secure 2nd place, their looking really strong. Hell, C9 were the defending champs for a long time until TSM beat them 3-2 in last years summer playoffs. It's your choice ultimately so do whatever you want.
