Her Q and E ensure that Fiora is going to fight you regardless of if you want to or not. She's nigh impossible to run away from\n\n2: Her W is pretty ridiculous. Being able to block a CC ability and then turn around and stun YOU with your own ability guarantees that you're gonna lose that trade, or worse, Fiora's gonna realize you just used a CC move and is gonna chase you down and flat out kill you.\n\n3: Tank Fiora is an issue. Because max health True damage, all Fiora needs to kill a squishy is a titanic and her ult. Sure she won't kill a squishy as fast as pure AD Fiora, but she's going to do respectable damage, while being tough to kill herself. And combine this with reasons 1 and 2, and Fiora becomes rather frustrating to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-12T14:28:49.304+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you play Pantheon.

The reason why people complain about champions is because they refuse to learn how to play against them, and complaining for nerfs on Riot's forum is a lot easier to do than deciding what to do and how to play against them.\n\n_\"But winrates don't matter!\"_ I hear a lot of people say.
