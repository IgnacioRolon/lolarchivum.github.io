Their company is in the process of a rebirth it seems (for better or for worse). They are slow, but they have also been quite thorough so far making sure to hit *everything*. The boards are costing Riot money to run, but were pushed off to the side and hidden in a sub-menu. \n\nAnd yet, the boards have received no attention yet. Quite the contrary, there has been a dramatic *decrease* in attention lately. Riot has completely given up on the boards. The mods have completely given up and are letting problem posts stay up for days at a time (assuming they ever get to them at all). Most the heralds are inactive completely. Riot \n\nWhy the dramatic decrease, right around the same time Riot has been one by one updating *all* their assets? Where is the Legends of Runeterra board? Where will the forum for their fighting game or other new games be? These questions and more can all be answered by one simple statement: Riot is planning a new forum structure (either moving to Reddit, or building their own). \n\n\n***\n\nI know Riot has been \"ignoring\" the boards for years. But things have changed. They went from acting like the boards are an after thought, to actively quarantining and avoiding the boards like the plague. The mods have often fallen behind like this, yet there are zero recruitment threads for new mods (suggesting they know something they can't tell us due to their non disclosure agreement). Things *have* changed here lately.

Such posts aren't fully protected, but if they don't break too many very serious rules (threats, slurs, etc.), they get a pass.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WyvernEgg","date":"2020-02-06T03:35:48.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/PFWlst_yWF8","replies":[]}]}
