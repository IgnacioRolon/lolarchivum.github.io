The complaining bout everyone not grouping, yet she is always over extended bot lane shoving, and complaining bout grouping at the same damn time. these chat logs are bullshit, since they only show my  words, and not what they were saying. Rito wants to say well we dont condone this type of behavior, but you guys put in emotes for the specific reason to &quot;flex&quot; aka bm. yes i swore a little, i wouldnt say it was excessive. and i obviously didnt feed or int, since i had 2nd most kill particaption, and died less. so why am i in trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-05-29T04:00:19.925+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're in trouble because you continually flamed people.\n\nThem \"starting it\" does not give you the excuse to treat them like shit.","replies":[{"poster":"sarkazum2","date":"2018-05-29T04:03:39.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"but they can continue to treat me like shit? im supposed to sit there  and let them do it. and try to continue to play nice to win the match. when they being toxic. like i said the chat logs dont show what they say, so you can not say im treating them like shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-05-29T04:21:49.695+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">but they can continue to treat me like shit? \n\nYou said it.
