What do I do.)\r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to league (lvl 33), I use Blitz for runes and whatever and I know most of the easy characters for each lane. I want to branch out to different characters such as Jayce so I practice them against bots, but literally every time I go into a game with a new character everyone get's super toxic over tiny things that you haven't learned yet. I might sound stupid to people when I say this but I have no clue on how to learn every aspect of a character aside from playing it and looking up things online, is that the only way to learn? or am I stuck with people being toxic until I master that character?","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-04T20:45:41.651+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ignore them and play the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bianca Colt","date":"2019-09-04T20:49:26.214+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much what Gatekeeper said.

I only deleted it because it was obvious there was someone or people sitting in new downvoting things they didn't like without even reading it. If you're supposed to be aiming to win, you're just as likely to get reported by people saying you didn't communicate with them, which means you weren't aiming to win. Since you seem to be casually ignoring other ways they can harass you outside of chat, I guess I'll have to ignore them too.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-05T12:58:57.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I downvote things I dislike **after** reading them.
