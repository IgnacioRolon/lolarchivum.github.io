This has happened in several instances, in bot games and PvP, on the Rift and Crystal Scar and Howling Abyss maps (I don't play Twisted Treeline).  I paid attention to make sure I wasn't being stunned, silenced, or that the abilities were on cooldown (they weren't) but when I would specifically play against bots who did not have a stun or silence and make sure I hadn't previously used any abilities, it would still not work for about 3-5 seconds after the ulti had finished.  There are a few discussion board posts and several bug posts about this and I'm shocked it hasn't been fixed yet.  It makes him a lot less useful to play than he was even a few months ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Womanikins","date":"2014-10-29T04:04:37.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot claims they have been looking into it for about 4 months now.
