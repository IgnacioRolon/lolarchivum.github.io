I live in mississauga  and they live in north york. This confirms that the issue does lie with teksavvy and riot. Ive been getting this issue a lot but have always thought it was my router or even just my internet. However i just recently played a game where the lag spike and brief disconnect has caused us to understand that this issue is beyond our control.\n\n\nI hope this issue can be resolved. ..or theres a how to fix it tutorial. ...because im about to switch service providers. ..","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-03-23T21:14:59.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am seeing a small increase in the number of tickets from TekSavvy users.

The drop happens somewhere between the Toronto Internet Exchange and 104.160.131.1. I feel like this is where most of the Southern Ontario traffic is getting routed through. I don't know if this helps any but I've also submitted a ticket with the network logs and analysis and process list. Hopefully we can see resolution to this soon as it's still happening and seems to be more severe tonight than previously.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I ChocoHeim I","date":"2016-03-23T23:35:26.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teksavvy cable user in TO downtown here.\n\nSame issues.

If you're disconnected from that, it also disconnects you from chat.\n\nSorry, but I don't think this is the right issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Relyne","date":"2016-03-23T06:54:36.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe not, I'm running a repair of the client now to see if that changes my issue.

An earlier post also had issues with TekSavvy customers, but not Rogers. (I also believe that if there was an outage with Rogers, there'd be a lot more complaints too haha)\n\nHere's the link:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/a5wLXrXQ-dced-and-cant-log-back-in-till-after-the-game","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shiekk","date":"2016-03-23T06:46:16.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting the same issue.
