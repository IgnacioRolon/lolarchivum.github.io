I've definitely gifted people before and I'm supposing it was too long ago to show. Is there any way I can review my old gifts besides the option in the shop? I've included a link of what shows in my gifting history. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-28T01:15:53.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your gifting history will only show transactions within the last 90 days, same as purchase history. Unfortunately, there's nowhere else you can review your old transactions.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"trolludpwn","date":"2017-03-23T21:04:46.610+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Where can i find my oldest history","replies":[]}]}]}
