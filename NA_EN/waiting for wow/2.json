A little more context on how this works below.\n\nThe Ultimate Hat reduces your ultimate's cooldown by up to 15% (also known as multiplicative CDR) - this is notably not the same thing as adding 15% more CDR. Whatever your ultimate's CD reads after applying CDR, multiply that by 0.85 and you've got your post-Ultimate Hat cooldown.\n\nThis decision was made so that the hyper-scaling properties of CDR don't impact the decision-making around whether or not you want this rune. Otherwise, the rune would be a worse choice on champions who didn't build much CDR (like Shen), even if reducing their ultimate's cooldown is clearly desirable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kasfas","date":"2017-10-02T13:09:42.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes\n\n24 second sion ults incoming","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustARivenMain","date":"2017-10-02T15:45:31.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, on the PBE Riv's ult goes from 36 second CD with 45% to 28 second.","replies":[{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2017-10-04T03:36:26.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"33 seconds with 45% \n\n- 15%\n\n- 4.5 sseconds\n\nso 28.5","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-10-02T12:45:06.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it does; and there's still the +5% max cdr rune, making it possible for anyone to have their ultimate with 60% cdr.
