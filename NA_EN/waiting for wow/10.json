Pepperidge Farm remembers. Also there was the fact that assassins (I don't really know about mages) had two options in that meta, they either got really fed and started one-shotting everyone at high speed or they would get underfed and when they attempted to assassinate, would get blown off the face of the earth.  What I'm trying to say with all of this is that being one-shot isn't fun, and on the other hand feeling like you can't contribute isn't much fun either. Am I saying the ADC meta is good?

Overall ADC items only buffed while everything else nerfed to the ground and support items were overbuffed as well instead of actually Making supports more enjoyable and buffing them instead. Now the already strong champions are even more broken.\n\nWorst part about this meta is that is the most unskilled unfun meta for anyone involved except for the adc.\n\nWhere is the skill in right clicking and dealing over 1000-1500 damage with 1 basic attack? (thats a {{champion:45}} ult worth of damage with each basic attack, you know the type everyone cries about dealing damage)Doing it of course with a big load of attack speed. Meanwhile healing back any damage done. (not to mention the support heal, shields, CC).\n\nIf ADC's are this broken by their damage at least make them skilled champions by removing right click targeting. Yes make their basic attack skillshots. Now show us how cool you are when you flash that Lv7 mastery when you miss everything.(of course I know it wont be implemented because the no skill adc's would bitch like always)\n\nAlso what about the 500 AP stolen from mages? Back in the day I had a chance to have around 1000 AP now it is considered good if I have 400.","replies":[{"poster":"Thilmer","date":"2017-10-28T21:14:43.206+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OP Garen Support,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=h2qFYatE,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2017-10-28T08:39:31.835+0000)\n>\n> \n> Also what about the 500 AP stolen from mages?

I recently started playing Veigar again, and I  feel great when I reach late and have 800 AP and can buy {{item:3089}}  and is not a shity overpriced Ã­tem. \n\nBut back in the day, I could do that with any mage, not only with a specific mage that gets +200 AP thanks to his passive. What the hell happens with AP?!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2017-10-28T17:18:49.715+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't recall anyone asking to nerf the mage class. People got excited about mage update - hoping for some improved items and stuff; especially more/better magic pen options. Instead, items were cheapened and lost a ton of their stats. Like why don't you see deathcap regularly in pro scene now? Maybe because ap champs are about 200ap short of what they'd get last season from the same build, so they need to go weird item combos like lich bane, protobelt, and gunblade just to have enough extra damage amplifiers to match the burst they used to have. No one in their right mind asked for a mage nerf this season. On individual overpowered mages, sure, but not on the class. That would be akin to when vayne could 3-shot everything in preseason and people asked to nerf her - then claiming people asked for every adc to be nerfed.\n\nPeople didn't ask for assassins to be nerfed because they were assassins; they asked for it because lethality was too strong and almost everyone (toplane bruisers, mid assassins, jungle assassins and carries, and adc's were all abusing it). Sure people might have said \"nerf assassins\" or \"nerf talon\", but what they were MOSTLY meaning was \"nerf lethality\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Judge Steven","date":"2017-10-28T03:26:52.131+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't forget about \"adc in 2k17 lul\" that was still spammed months after it actually made some sense.","replies":[]}]}
