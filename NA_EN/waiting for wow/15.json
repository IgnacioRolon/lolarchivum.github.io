Until you are one of those Malzahar players that are good enough to secure first blood at level 3-4 and use his early zoning properly please just don&#039;t talk down or flame anyone else it just looks silly.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-09-10T19:32:05.855+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"60% Syndra use, press R to burst anyone.

Maybe. But he was never bad, he was probably the most underrated champion in the game, his ult could easily suppress you just like it does nowadays, he could push while staying safe, etc.\n\nThe difference is that old Malzahar didn't had a spellshield to rely on to protect him. This made him a lot riskier to use, which means he required more skill to play, and meant he would fall off late game because he could easily get caught and there is nothing he could do about that other than using Zhonya because he had no self peel.\n\nThat doesn't mean he was any less powerful. There is a reason why old Malzahar was consistently one of the highest winrate champions in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Theorchero","date":"2017-09-11T04:25:54.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nGio,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=F5lLNmVM,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-09-10T22:24:17.507+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s funny how times change.
