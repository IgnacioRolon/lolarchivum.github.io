None of the people that main X or Y champion ever asked for a rework when their champion sat at a 52-54% winrate but as soon as they get 1-2 nerfs, everyone will start pretending \n that they are suddenly and completely unviable and in need of an immediate rework. Riot has better shit to do with their time than making your champion strong again but in a different way because you refuse to adapt to gameplay changes. \n\nChampions like LeBlanc and Rengar need actual reverts/reworks because they both play completely contrary to their intended gameplay design, with LeBlanc playing more like a mage and Rengar feeling like a skirmisher.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-12T15:36:01.590+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"idk bud, everytime i see a {{champion:266}}  main, im like FeelsBadMan, yall are litterally left in the gutter forever","replies":[{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2018-01-12T16:06:48.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YaRossy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TWOmzAby,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-12T15:36:01.590+0000)\n>\n> idk bud, everytime i see a {{champion:266}}  main, im like FeelsBadMan, yall are litterally left in the gutter forever\n\nI agree Aatrox is definitely one of the few champions that need some work done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoPaxt","date":"2018-01-12T15:44:59.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same could be said for {{champion:98}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-01-12T16:53:12.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is Aatrox could be decent but Riot made {{item:3076}} lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-01-12T17:27:20.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it depends on what the champion is being nerfed for. If the champion gets nerfed simply because they're too strong, then yeah, a rework wouldn't be appropriate (though from my own experience, a champion's mains tend to be the most resistant to a rework unless they've been in a really bad state for a long time). If the champion is being nerfed at a time where they're balanced or even weak, however, with the clear indication that they're being kept sub-par because of a design issue, rather than one of balance, then a rework is warranted, even if it might not be the highest on the priority list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaReK DOTA2","date":"2018-01-12T17:21:19.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i asked for Kayle's rework and she's got nerfed.
