At around 14% I get an error message \"Unspecific Error occurred please check the logs for more information,\" I try again and same thing. ~14% and I get that message.\r\n\r\nI uninstalled League, but was greeted with a new problem: Not getting passed the \"LoL Client Patcher,\" as my task manager calls it. It's just the League Logo with an empty loading bar below it. It will sit there for 5-10 minutes and then close, seemingly doing nothing. The bar moves a tiny, tiny bit but that's all that happens.\r\n\r\nDid a full system restore (I was having problems anyway) and I am still having the same issue. \r\n\r\nI have tried the known fixes (connection issues) as well as uninstalling avast! and changing the permissions in UAC.\r\n\r\nI uploaded my most recent Patcher Log file (2017-07-11T18-02-57_8120_LoLPatcher) to pastebin and added the link to this post, which seems to detail the Client Patcher issues I am having. I have more logs were created with the one I pasted:\r\n\r\n2017-07-11T18-02-56_launcher\r\n2017-07-11T18-02-57_6616_LoLPatcherUx\r\n2017-07-11T18-02-58_7004_LoLPatcherUx-renderer\r\n2017-07-11T18-02-58_7364_LoLPatcherUx-gpu-process\r\n\r\n\r\nIf needed, I can upload those too.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help me that would be amazing.

Since you've gone through with a full system restore already, you might be having an entirely different issue at this point. \n\nYou've already done the first troubleshooting steps that typically fix these weird issues where league doesn't seem like it's responding. Most of the time it's a simple [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) issue due to your OS blocking the program. If updating those settings weren't able to help at all, let's go ahead and get a little more in-depth troubleshooting from our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
