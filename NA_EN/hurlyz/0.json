If I click no instead, League just closes and I have to go through the same process again.\r\n\r\nCan somebody help me out of this? It's starting to get really annoying to have to go through this every time I login to play (or every time I switch accounts)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much :)","replies":[{"poster":"hurlyz","date":"2017-11-21T23:33:35.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Client just kicked me out of a game to activate the self-repair function then put me back into the game (as level 1 vs opponent mid laner being level 5) when it was done repairing.\n\nAfter the game, I checked to see if the shortcut shenanigans had stopped, but they didn't.\n\nIt even linked me to [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005665088-Installing-the-updated-League-client#h2) and I went through those steps, hoping it would fix it. After backing up my Config folder into a .rar (wouldn't want to lose all my settings for no reason, so I kept a backup in case deleting it didn't fix anything I could restore it) I tried their steps...... aaaaand we're still on square 1.\n\nGuess I'll have to give the Hextech Repair Tool a try, but isn't that the same Repair Tool that my client just ran automatically when it detected \"errors in my installation\" ?\n\n\nPS: Been playing since Season 3, never had a single bug with my Client, this all started a few weeks ago (pre-season patch I think or the one before) for no apparent reason. Oh, actually, now that I think of it, I think it coincides with the installation of the PBE client/shortcuts, maybe those two are conflicting for some reason? I installed them in two different folders and the shortcuts have different names though. I don't even have desktop shortcuts anymore (deleted them all hoping that would solve my issue) and I tried removing my Start menu shortcuts but that didn't fix it either.\n\n\nPls Send ~~Nudes~~ Halp :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-01T17:15:29.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some setting or antivirus is still blocking your game files from updating properly.
