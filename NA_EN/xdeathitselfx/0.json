I really think Graves need to have MR on his E back again because he was intended to play like a ranged bruiser then you removed half of his identity. Now it doesn't really work so lethality outclassed bruiser on Graves for quite a long time now. He's the shorted ranged marksman so lethality makes less sense for Graves than bruiser since he's supposed to be very close to his opponents to be doing damage, so lethality makes him squishy. Although it's almost the same if you go bruiser... you get bursted down very easily from AP champs.  \n\nWhen Graves lost his MR on E he was still meta so this had no effect on how strong he was as a jungler, when his damage got nerfed he finally fallen out of the meta. The same applies to his ult knockback cancel, those nerfs didn't even effect his win rate much, if I recall correctly it dropped by only like 0.5%. The problem was how healthy he was in the jungle, so he was able to just invade while doing a lot of damage. And he got nerfed in areas where he WASN'T problematic. I have over 800K points on Graves but I don't feel like playing him if I want to climb because he's outclassed by all other junglers. If he at least gets his MR back on his E then I will be very happy and so will all other Graves mains. It won't make him meta even, it will make him more playable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XdeathitselfX","date":"2018-03-10T06:55:02.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. yes the majority players that plays graves do build duskblade so it would be nice for graves to get some buffs because until now he isnt really viable.\n\n2. why does graves get punished for building critical strike items? lets say if i have 100% crit if i am auto attacking someone at graves max range which isnt even far at all i lose like 30% of my damage because the other pellets didnt hit but if you compare this to other crit champions such as an adc they can auto you from a mile away and do the full damage which makes it seem so unfair for graves.\n\n3. The playstyle of graves its a nice concept but at the same time his kit contradicts what his kit is meant to do. let me make it simple, because you see graves needs to go in to melee range to get the full damage for all the pellets to hit and as you know it can be blocked by minions,champions and structures. there are so many times where when i gank botlane to try to kill the adc their tank support will just stay infront of me and as you know graves has nothing in his kit to deal with tanks so its very strange to me. \n\nso i had this idea for a long time but i never thought this day would come that a rioter would respond so here is my proposal about graves. instead of giving graves random armor or magic resist stats like before making him tanky, why dont you remove that completely and add something that actually rewards a graves player for risking into the frontline like maybe bonus true damage for going melee range and remember it can be blocked by others so it would help graves alot to deal with that situation and also make it less punishing for graves to build critical strike items. besides this would make graves a high risk high reward champion that if you go into the frontline and play it properly you are rewarded but if you dont then you do instantly. what do you think?\n\ni really hope to hear from you soon RiotRepertoir ive seen the effort you are putting in the boards already, this means the world to us league of legends players :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"PowerOfDrainAge","date":"2018-03-13T21:08:21.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you can do something else for graves than just giving 0.6 AD/lvl cuz thats not what he currently needs.

A lot of people in the Graves subreddit, including myself, feel that his current damage is okay, but that what graves used to be strong at (Early counter jungling and bullying) has fallen off. He really cant fight anyone early game and cant really contest scuttle. Most of us seem to agree that we would like some of his innate tankiness back, due to him being such a short range marksman that is more like a bruiser. We think putting the mr back on his E or giving him some more base health is possibly a good direction to go in, or possibly just undoing some of his nerfs, as the current jungle doesnt work in his favor anymore. A lot of people also want his ult cancel back but im sure that wont happen. Since his buff earlier this year he still hasnt been a great pick, and Riot seems to have kinda forgotten about him. He went from 47% WR pre buffs to 48% WR post, and has recently dropped back down in the most recent patch.
