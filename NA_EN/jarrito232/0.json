Too many times have I seen people try to ult an enemy champion, but they hit minions for some reason. Why would I ever need to ult a minion when I could ult a champion instead?\n\nEDIT: Something that I am seeing is that people like to Ult monsters or pets more, and ulting minions kills them right away.

Having hard, reliable CC on a champion like Tristana could be interesting, but I just feel like the knockback is totally random and not even suppose to be apart of her kit, like it's someone else's ultimate on her. A knockup instead would be much better for an ultimate like her's, but also the damage should be lowered so it doesn't turn into a gg ez high damage aoe cc nuke.","replies":[{"poster":"BestTristMyHaus","date":"2015-06-03T20:15:49.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How godly would Tristana be if her ult stunned instead of knockback?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yosuke Apperu","date":"2015-06-04T11:15:58.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A three person knock up on and adc? nope nope nopeeeee XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-06-03T22:27:21.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO ULT THAT BUFF/SCUTTLE AWAY OR HAVE COLLATERAL CHAMPION DAMAGE OUT OF DANGEROUS RANGE\n\nedit: sry caps","replies":[]},{"poster":"DontBanMeImDrunk","date":"2015-06-03T19:17:25.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually, there are plenty of reasons to ult a minion.\n\nHow about just buffing tristana so she isnt garbage","replies":[]}]}
