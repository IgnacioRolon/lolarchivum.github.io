They could not accept the large shield + Stun it offered, regardless of how unreliable it actually was. They never accept someone hitting the Jackpot. (like when the ADC Crits 3 times in a row). Regardless though. His W does make a powerful zoning tool, so he doesn't exactly have to wait, for people to fuck up. \n\nIt seems like they are nerfing his AoE damage. First they nerfed his Q damage, then they reduced the AoE on his Ult. This is quite fair for a Utility Assassin. Assassins in general should focus on their single target damage. If the nerfs did hit him too hard, they should put that power on his passives. \n\nBecause his kit is, part unreliable, and part high skill, It's probably not fair to use Winrate as a the only metric for measuring a champions strength.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Beddlam","date":"2015-07-20T05:23:47.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is bad in mid, but better in other positions.

His ratios on his E are merely there to give bonus damage but more importantly for his engage potential/combinations with W. His theme revolves around landing 3 marking-abilities for a nuke, and starting/ending with his ultimate for a large nuke of damage. \n\nIf anything needs to be nerfed on him (Which I can't viably find yet), it would MAYBE be the shield value on his W? The stun is what allows him to be competitive in engages, but the shield shouldn't be relied on most of the time..It's the stun that's game changing in most cases. but he's got plenty of counterplay. CC him when he's low and kill him, he can't ult. Pretty much the easiest way to handle him is with CC at the right time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-20T06:01:16.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He has a 57% win rate in Master over the last 30 days and a 51% win rate in Challenger.
