I’ve been bronze 4 for the longest time and I finally got into promos. I had one free win from the last time I was in promos (a long time ago lol) and I won another game which meant I had the majority (2 wins 0 losses). When I went to see that I was in Bronze 5, my screen said “Congratualtions, you’ve been promoted to Bronze 3!” How does that even make sense when I never lost my promos?? Why am I in Bronze 3 when I should be in Bronze 5?? This is extremely annoying since now I’m even further from silver.\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-26T18:46:39.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"!><\n\nI love this post so much, thank you for reaching out to us.  The divisions rank from 5 as the lowest and 1 as the highest.  You want to climb from 5 to 1, which will then give you a chance into Silver.  Our [ranked play FAQ ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ)should have more info as well.   Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"NightTimeWolf","date":"2017-10-26T19:49:12.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my goodness.... I’ve been thinking of it the other way around this whole time! I feel so stupid lmao.
