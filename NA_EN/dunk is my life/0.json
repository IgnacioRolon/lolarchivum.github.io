Yes they need buffs but you don't have to be Diamond to know that. In reality you just have to be around gold-plat.\n\nDarius and Gangplank are relatively useless in grouped fights because no defensive steriod and fall off in split pushing because they have weird itemization. Darius technically could stay split pushing but no escape (making collapsing on him easy) + not being able to fight an ADC who knows how to kite at all keeps him from doing this. He has enough raw DPS imo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-10-02T02:45:13.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im pretty sure Darius is not getting a rework.

He is a lane bully that needs a few kills to carry him into the lategame. He does tons of damage, can peel, can initiate, can execute/burst a carry, and can even excel at clean up with his ult. I have seen many a penta with current darius. \n\nThe only problem with Darius that is crippling him is that most Darius players take ALL the kills he can with his dunk, screwing his team, as he will be focused down and no one on his team will have any gold. \n\nI've yet to see a good reason as for why Darius needs a rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AD0w","date":"2014-10-02T19:20:07.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If anything he is a little op right now. He can easily out trade almost anyone in lane, and at level 6 has the highest execute damage in game.

I know one who played a perfect game with 0 items bought. 0 deaths. His kill count was the highest of the team (and we didn't play badly). I'm just going to say that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"InvalidGuest","date":"2014-10-02T05:05:07.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they didn't cancel it, it was \"de-prioritized\" so they could work on the soraka and viktor reworks presumably\n\nHe said it was \"still a thing they'd do\" though\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotMorello/status/497554295273701376","replies":[]}]}]}
