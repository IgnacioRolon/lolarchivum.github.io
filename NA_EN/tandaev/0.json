So now as of Oct. 27, 2016, it has been a good 3+ days (including a couple of hours) and since then I have been plagued by this accursed screen and I can't successfully buy anymore RP in-game. So is this just a minor glitch for some people or does the game just not want money any more?..","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T23:10:13.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you're waiting 24 hours or longer between attempts.
