I personally, tell it straight, screwed it for some reason and ended up in b3, then fell to b4.. xd but still. There are some things that are quite obviously different from the SR games, right?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLike... the first thing that comes to mind (and logic) is, the snowball going on there - mostly, because ganking each other is much easier, and in fact the altars force you to pvp - so, the beginning of the game can and will dictate its flow. That clear. Oh, and the majority of the gold that one gets early comes from kills.\r\n\r\nAlso, the walls are more &quot;ghostly&quot; than on sr - both turrets can attack you through them, and you are not as safe near your turr.\r\n\r\nThird, there are no supports - so any mage that has a good amount of cc or protective spells is welcome.\r\n\r\nForth, don&#039;t pick adc. xd Because there _will_ be a Jax or something worse to delete you.\r\n\r\nFifth, assassins thrive as they do scale early well.\r\n\r\nSixth, it just feels like you don&#039;t have much space to avoid stuff. Like Xereath q.\r\n\r\nSeventh, Teemo and Kayn.\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAnd it feels like... if there is a priority target, it is much more proper to destroy it with 5 players... instead of three.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd so, many of the champions we like playing on SR simply have to be... left behind. And playstyles. Probably, many late game champions as, in deed.. with the snowball, you ain&#039;t reach it.\r\n\r\nIn my placement games, i played as Morgana - her root, the black shield as utility spell, and the stun.. still, with 10% altar speed, it is a bit harder to land a proper root. And her aa range is just low. Still.. i do think, on theory, that if i didn&#039;t screw up my games, she is a good champion for the map.\r\n\r\nMy question is.. is there anything i am missing? Like any advice or suggestions? About how to best set and play the fights, which will definitely happen, and a lot? And.. which champions do you think are fine.. and which are better off? Lux seems a proper choice as well, as she has cc, range and can set kills - though the altar speed is sigh and she is still a mage so.. right., Janna.. well.. proooobably. And Sona is paper. Etc..\r\n\r\nthanks :p\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_two things more:_\r\n\r\n_first, the flame is impossible, quite probably because of the clown-fest once a player gets properly fed (quite quickly). this is the mode where /mute all in the beginning of the game is too good to be ignored. sigh._\r\n\r\n_second, a bit as a suggestion... make the player with the best score a villain/bounty that is significantly easier to kill. i think this will help A LOT! :) Ooooor just hard-nerf early game gold and xp.._","replies":[{"poster":"Dotrix","date":"2018-10-19T03:59:00.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"P3 with 60%+ Winrate and 2,050+ MMR.

Let me know if it helps!\n{{sticker:galio-happy}} \n\n\n* Waveclear mages in bot lane are OP: Brand Anivia and Malzahar are strong, but Morgana can suffice if you're running a funnel comp.\n* You need a bruiser top like Irelia, Renekton, Urgot, Aatrox, Gnar, Yasuo (If you have an Orianna bot), Jax, Camille, Kled. Garen and Darius are good at low ELO but will tend to be outclassed slightly by Renekton gods as you go up the ladder.\n* Poppy is PICK OR BAN, she's an OP jungler. Kayn is annoying but if you have map awareness he's not as bad as people make him out to be.\n* Teemo isn't a good character, but he's decent in TT as long as you're REALLY good with shrooms. I still sort of recommend bruisers over him though if you're taking him top.\n* Assassins aren't good in TT as you get to higher MMR to be honest. Whenever I face a high diamond-master tier team, it's always a mage of some kind in bot.\n* If you take an inhibitor, SEND ALL THREE PEOPLE TO THE OTHER LANE IF THAT INHIBITOR IS STILL UP.\n* Understand your powerspikes and fight around them, don't force bad fights at bad times.\n* If you fall behind and get pushed to your inhibitor towers, send one person to catch waves top and one to catch waves bot. Third person (usually the worst scaler/weakest link) gets nothing but XP. MAKE SURE YOU ONLY CATCH WAVES UNDER YOUR TOWER AND DO NOT OVEREXTEND PAST THE FIRST JUNGLE ENTRANCE IF BEHIND.\n* Don't invade without lane priority.\n* Altars are nice, but they are NEVER worth dying for. If it's an even game, it's best to wait until you win a fight or force someone to recall before going for altars more often than not.\n* If you find that games snowball against you too hard, you're probably playing too aggressive. If you find that you're always falling behind early, you might be playing too passive. It's possible that both are the case, just at different times of the game. In which case, work on your decision making.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheini","date":"2018-10-19T18:10:43.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dotrix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=heovzEL8,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-19T03:59:00.153+0000)\n>\n> P3 with 60%+ Winrate and 2,050+ MMR.

Ofc, there are many players who don't know how the altars & towers opening the map work yet, but...","replies":[{"poster":"Dotrix","date":"2018-10-23T23:31:52.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, generally speaking if you que for 3s solo queue, you'll run into teammates who have no clue what they're doing and that will give off the illusion of games snowballing a lot harder than they normally should. If you queue with a premade who knows what they're doing, so long as you don't have a bad comp any game is winnable at any time (ESPECIALLY at low ELO).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
