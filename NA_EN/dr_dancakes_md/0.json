Is this happening every game, or was this something that only occurred in the game you've provided with the match history.\n\nWe are aware of an issue where if you bind to someone and then re-bind to someone else, like you've mentioned above, it doesn't bind properly, and you aren't able to proc the W passive. However, it sounds like you aren't able to bind with anyone.

I appreciate it!\n\nUnfortunately I do not have a video of the game sorry.\n\nI have played Kalista many times before and have NEVER had this issue before.\n\nI didn't try to rebind until I realized my original bind wasn't working, so yeah, I'd say it was the latter situation.  It was not a good way to start a ranked game!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-09T00:04:51.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to apologize! Definitely not a fun way to play Kalista, especially when you have such a good engage with Alistar.
