My most popular post ever by far. I was a little stressed out because of this and i decided to clear things up. \nThe Ezreal in the game that caused me to make this rant WAS good. Most likely was a smurf, but he was just so full of himself it was ridiculous. harassed every other team member, flamed us for every single TINY mistake (like ulting zed instead of the adc or something like that) and never looked at or took the blame for his own mistakes. like getting caught out in the river, it was OUR fault for not following him like little starving puppies, obviously. I've had these liars that say the are smurfs and i can assure you this guy was legit. But the toxicity and harassment is what i wanted to address. The fact that he thought he was privileged enough to talk down on us like he was a king among peasants was ridiculous.

If you're very ahead, a nice roam (while letting your adc or whatever take the kills) can do wonders.
