I get through picking and banning and then when I get into the connection screen it immediately disconnects me from the game. To fix this problem, I have tried to continuously reconnect but every time it just boots me out. Because this problem happened to me, I have lost 16 LP and have 20 minute lower priority queue for something I couldn't control. How do I fix this problem? I don't deserve this lower priority queue but I'll wait it out if I have to.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-10T17:41:17.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're unable to reconnect to the game then there may be a network problem that's blocking you from reaching the game server.
