I know it's not just hapening to me, for I've seen many other players on the boards who have the same problem as me. I'm tired of riot saying \"oh your connection is bad you have to do stuff with your firewall\". No, it's not bad on my part, because every other game I have on my computer works and skype works. If all that works, its obviously not something on my part. I have to wait 20 mins before every single game I play and then get into a game just to find out that it's not even going to work because riot screwed my game over. Get your crap together and fix this problem!","replies":[{"poster":"OneTrueGzus","date":"2016-12-12T02:18:33.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its been 6 days for me too. finally got it to where i can log in but lose contact with maestro a min after logging in. every single time","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T00:20:38.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could provide specific details regarding *exactly what you're experiencing*, I'll be able to help you figure out what's going on.","replies":[{"poster":"WingsofGulgazor","date":"2016-12-12T02:00:01.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"prob bugsplat upon hitting the loading screen.","replies":[]}]}]}
