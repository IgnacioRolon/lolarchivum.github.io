The problem is that there is no post recall animation or SFX while recalling. As this skin is 1350 RP, I&#039;d expect a bit more in terms of the recall. I don&#039;t know if this is how riot intended it to be but if so, please make a change. I really enjoy Rakan and his new support playing style and would like a well-functioning skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-04-21T16:23:32.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! \n\nThanks for the report!
