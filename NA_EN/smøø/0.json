I have a decent computer and it never freezes in other games such as Fallout 4 or Skyrim. This has led me to believe it is a problem with the client and it sucks to manually restart my computer every time this happens, since i can´t do anything while its frozen (no ctrl+alt+del or alt+f4) only mouse moves. Time doesn´t fix it either. Thanks for the help in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Vulcanator","date":"2015-12-16T16:16:21.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right click the shortcut, click properties, then set it to compatibility mode for windows 7.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Draven Main","date":"2015-12-16T08:53:56.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same problem!
