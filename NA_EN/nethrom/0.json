PLEASE address this issue...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":17,"down_votes":7,"body":"The TL;DR opening (closing at the bottom): I shouldn't have to play against Plat 5-3 players as a Gold 4 just to get promoted to Gold 3 and have to do it even more just to get to Gold 2.\n\nThe actual: I am working on climbing elo, and for a long time now, I have been playing against players who are several tiers higher than me. This has been happening ever since the horrible placement system somehow put me in Silver 4...But, of course, I am a patient guy so I just decided to start climbing. Sure enough climb I did. And the games were very easy and actually I felt a bit bad because there I was way below where I actually SHOULD have been (for real this time) and just crushing all these silver games and ruining the time of 5 other people (enemy team) game after game. It felt like i was smurfing, and it wasn't enjoyable for me or anyone else...\n\nSo by the time i reach Silver 1, my MMR was substantially higher than my actual rank was showing, and I was going against Gold 2/3 players consistently. That's fine, gold is also a bit simple. But of course, last season, if you severely outmatched the tier you were in, then you would skip a tier or two, so I patiently figured that instead of going from Silver 1 to Gold 5, I would go to at least Gold 4 or something, since I was already playing against gold 3 people.\n\nAlas, I beat my promo's and ended up in Gold 5.....alright then, that's fine. Let me just climb one more tier, I am sure it will make sense after I beat Gold 5, right?\n\nNope, get promoted to gold 4. By this time I am constantly against Gold 1 and Plat 5 players, on a team of other gold 1's. And then there I randomly am...a lowly Gold 4...who ends up carrying the game anyway.\n\nSo, by the time I am in my promo's I am going against Plat 5-3 players. At this time I figure the logic is SO absolutely broken that it would only put me in Gold 3, so I patiently get through promo's quite handily and get my promotion....to Gold 3....and now I get to climb through Gold 3 going against Plat players.\n\nAt this rate, before I even reach Platinum, I will be playing against Diamond enemies.\n\nSo can someone PLEASE explain to me why this ends up being logical? How is it that in order to get just to Platinum, I have to beat out ALL the platinum players in the world?\n\nTL;DR closing: Basing your matchmaking on MMR and not the actual tier you're in makes it a completely broken, unbalanced system, and I shouldn't have to beat people 4 tiers higher than me just to get to 3 tiers lower than them.","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2014-10-12T08:24:48.262+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey Nethrom,\n\nI think I see your point that sometimes it can be confusing to players how the process of them being matched works.

I should just jump up into their divisions, seeing as how I am already playing at their level and beating them.\n\nWhen I was climbing through gold and starting out in plat, I was against people more than 5 divisions higher than me both when Solo queueing and duo  queueing with someone slightly lower ranked than I. Yet, I was still forced to go through 4 divisions in Gold and 2 so far in Platinum to reach P2 from G5. (Skipped G4 and P4 on the way to P2.)\n\nSince our MMR is all that matters when matching us, make it be the only thing that matters when ranking us.... Right now you're basically telling people, \"Yeah, you're seen as skilled as people in higher tiers and divisions, but we won't rank you any higher because you can't win 3 games in a row consistently, with the occasional 4 in a row.\" That's a direct spit in the face to solo queue players, because despite being considered as an equal to platinum players, you're only going to get gold level rewards. Same with Silver to gold and Platinum to diamond.\n\nThe only thing I care about getting in this game right now is that Diamond Border from season rewards... But after trudging through countless P1's and D5's, I finally ran out of steam at the bottom of P2... With what I had to go through just to get **here**, I should be Diamond 5 by default.\n\nBring back the old system where you just had a number.

If you go on a win streak, your LP will be lower than your MMR.  If you go on a losing stream, the reverse happens.  It still represents skill; it just reacts more calmly to recent events.\n\nAs for why we have it, the single most important reason to me is that you can have an LP penalty for dodging.  This means that people can't tank their elo using the dodge penalty to go noob stomp and people still fear the dodge penalty enough to not dodge tactically.

You have to drop all the way down to a gold 5 MMR before it'll demote you out of plat.  Thus, you'll see a bunch of plat 5 players as you climb up towards making it there yourself; these guys were probably once playing at a plat level but they slacked off after achieving their goal for the season and now they're mid-gold tier players.  The practical result of this is that you shouldn't trust P5 players in your gold games to be any good at all.  Don't fear them, there's a good chance you're better than them if they're in your game.\n\nAs for the gold 1s with gold 3 MMR, they can exist due to grace periods and loss streak mechanics, but they won't exist for long.  \n\nOne of the things that Riot does is match you into games with different average skill levels.  You might be matched into a game where your team is on average gold 2, and you're the weakest player.  Riot will also intentionally skew the matchmaking in some games, where you might be playing with or against a MMR disadvantage this game; if you win into the disadvantage, you get tons of LP.  Both of these practices are intended to get a better reading on your skill level faster than just matching up a pure \"all gold 3s play together\" sort of thing.\n\nI took a look at op.gg to see some of your recent ranked matches.  I've bolded you in each of these:\nP5 G1 G1 G2 **G3** vs G2 G2 G2 G2 G4\nP5 P5 **G3** G4 G4 vs P5 G1 G2 G2 G3\nP5 G1 G2 **G3** G3 vs P5 G2 G3 G3 G3\nG2 G2 **G3** G3 G3 vs P5 G2 G2 G2 G3\n\nThis looks like reasonable matchmaking quality to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Nethrom","date":"2014-10-12T23:51:07.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, all those games I played were as a Gold 4.

(because at that point he will not be advancing or declining very much if he stay at the same skill level)\n\nKeep in mind that most people will not be climbing the ladder, but staying in their current position or declining. (this is obvious when you look at the player distribution for the leagues, and how the number of people in each successive league goes down immensely)\n\nSo keeping these points in mind, when you are in gold 4 and are being matched against gold 1 or platinum 5 or whatever, it isnt because your mmr is at the average of those tiers. It is because the people you are playing against likely have a below average mmr for their tier. (and likely that your mmr is above average for your tier)\n\nThe system is not broken this is how it is supposed to work. In my experience with the exact same kind of system, (getting to the master league in starcraft 2) the best thing you can do it just not think about your league or mmr so much and just focus on improving your game knowledge and mechanics, and the ranking will take care of itself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zealsz","date":"2014-10-12T05:49:37.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Following up on this thought.

That might be why you have higher MMR compared to your placing. It seems odd with your record that  you haven't skipped a single division.  I have gone Gold V > Gold III every time and I recently made a second account and went from Silver III > Silver I and Gold V > Gold III without even getting a series I just straight hit 100 LP and was promoted.\n\nAs for your gripe I agree 100%.  It is quite annoying when you are going up against X to be promoted to Y when X is many divisions above Y.","replies":[{"poster":"OhBoyItsaMegaman","date":"2014-10-12T14:39:40.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in the same situation as him on my other account, playing against Gold 3-2 in my promo games out of Silver, and then Plat 4-Gold 5 in my promo games out of Gold 5. They did skip me over Gold 4 and into 3. So division skipping does exist if you're decently high above your current tier and it's possible that Nethrom has just been a teensy bit short of qualifying for a skip each time. If it has looked like you're well above your current division, that's just the MMR/tier system being a little misleading.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nethrom","date":"2014-10-12T08:33:31.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, now that you mention it, to this day I don't recall losing a single promo game this season.
