I feel like a total idiot for having a PS3. It&#039;s pretty much a dead console. The only games i can find online matches for is COD and Borderlands 2. I would play PS3 all the time if they released fortnite or pubg or any popular PS4 game for 0S3 as well. I just hate to see mt friends playing together on their fancy PS4s and if I wanna play with them I have to hop on my shitty laptop to be able to play with them. I mean what kind of smartass do you have to be to literally make a fuck&igrave;ng *GAMING* console and not have the most popular games on it. And don&#039;t say pubg or fortnite are too big to be played on ps3, they could easily lower the graphics and it would work.","replies":[]}
