The concept is pretty straight forward and would work practically the same as swapping champions in Champ Select. This would be such a nice addition due to the fact that it&#039;d make pre-game even more streamlined than it already is. You wouldn&#039;t need to use chat and there would be a lot less confusion for not just your team but the entire game as well (proper corresponding roles in the loading screen, the scoreboard, etc.). I sent this idea as a ticket into Riot and I was told I&#039;d have better luck if I posted it on the boards so let me know what you guys think!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNairn","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2018-02-09T13:27:11.347+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":">Not sure if this is the proper section of the Boards to post this in because I've never actually done this before so bare with me.\n\nI'd post that on general discussion because there you get more attention to stuff that is not all about balance rants.\n\nI do agree that this would be a good new tool for champion select, but not everything that is intended for good is used for it. I could really imagine that many players interpretated that as a right to have their roles swapped resulting in more dodges when they are declined. On top of that I see a huge problem that players focus to much on potential swapps and waste too much time for it. \n\nI think it's a good intention but not that necessary and with potential hidden problems.","replies":[{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2018-02-10T23:27:32.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, it's a good intention that will lead to bad results. There's bound to be a ton of people spamming role swamp by picking let's say a \"support\" to swamp with the other person because ican't play said champion as an excuse.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salson","date":"2018-02-09T14:54:15.621+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, as someone who doesn't really mind playing Support occasionally, I'd like to get Autofill-protection if I decide to swap.\nBecause swapping to Support and loosing your protection is kinda garbage.\n\nStill, I rarely get autofilled these days, as Top is actually in a worse spot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2018-02-09T16:18:35.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean... the role you are given isn't concrete. Half of the time when people are switching lanes they just... switch lanes.

Obviously the suggestion isn't priority number 1 but it is a nice suggestion.

Would be great. Had a teammate flame 2 others for not going to their initial assigned lanes with an appropriate champ. for said lanes. I dont like muting people but unfortunately I had to since for the duration of the game, all there was in chat was things like, \"But 'XYZ, is supposed to top and youre assigned to ADC.

I play either jungle or support (Zyra or Shyvana) and I'm only really proficient with 1 champ for each role. When I get assigned either role and my champ gets banned I usually want to play my other 60% winrate champ on the other position. I usually have to play a champ I'm less good with instead. The option to trade with someone who queued with  your role as one of their options would be nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2018-02-10T17:57:09.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I proposed this literally more than a year ago.\nHere: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/4e0E0BOO-dynamic-queue-swap-role-and-fill-counter","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-02-10T17:16:24.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya well, i can see those guys coming, who swap roles with a supp-player on paper, but still play their respective role, to abuse getting autofill protected without actually playing support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-02-10T02:30:47.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not saying this is  a bad idea... but... you could you know like.. ask in chat? i really dont see a need to do this... the only thing it could add is auto-fill protection for those who swap.. other than that you can already do it. by just asking the players on your team...\n\ni would MUCH rather be able to swap the draft pick order.. i absolutely HATE being near the top, because i play champs that are nearly never banned and ear stupid easy to countpick.. and most people i meet don't own them so they cant swap with me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2018-02-10T01:51:38.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this... was my idea first..","replies":[]},{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2018-02-10T00:15:53.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the idea is good but there isn't enough time in champ select to make it work.
