Everything up until after the champion select screen works fine until I get a black screen with the message [\"Unable to connect to the server. Please check your internet connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.\"](http://imgur.com/zHlHy3g) and it gives me the options of Retry and Cancel. Of course, I retry and it gives the same message. (My internet was and still is working fine.) When I click cancel, on the other hand, it takes me to the [\"The Game has crashed. Please try to reconnect to the game.\"](http://imgur.com/MmNH4Ho) I click \"Reconnect\" yet it gives the same message. I would appreciate the assistance. Thanks! \r\n\r\nP.S.
