I just really wanted to put my thoughts out there.\r\n\r\n**Overall Impression**\r\n\r\n*     It&rsquo;s pretty good but I&rsquo;m not terribly excited to get it, I still like my other Sivir skins better... At this point it&rsquo;s just a status symbol that will get dusty in the corner of my skins closet.\r\n*     This skin is not nearly as bad as ppl made it out to be tbh\r\n\r\n**Bad?**\r\n \r\n*     Watching the skin spotlight video I am dissapointed to say that her new recall greatly resembles by least fav Sivir skin: Snowflake Snowdown Snowstorm (it&rsquo;s the splash art, really) I can see that the animators took effort to make the wind-up and the intermediary different, it still holds enough similarity that I make a face when I see it.\r\n*     Her weapon looks super clunky instead of [what the teaser implied](http://polscygracze.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/victorious-teaser_article-banner-1024x576.jpg); a smooth, sharp, and elegant new glaive. I appreciate what they tried to do with the laurels, but but in backfired in that it looks a little gaudy.\r\n*     Boobplate. pretty tame for ya&#039;ll and u can&#039;t see it in game (b/c of her pose) but I&rsquo;m not looking forward to the splash art regardless.\r\n*     Purple cloth brings her away from the overall &ldquo;Victorious&ldquo; theme.\r\n\r\n**Good!**\r\n\r\n*     Tying the purple color and gold laurels into the skin via victory and Sivir&rsquo;s own royalty.\r\n*     Laurel wreaths were awarded to martial victors once upon a time in Rome and the symbol has expanded from that area and is readily know, and is, quite honestly, a great theme for Sivir to have. \r\n*     Sivir might be one of the better choices to give purple instead of blue b/c of her lineage, as purple is used to represent royalty and riches.  However, since she seems to regect her royalty...\r\n\r\n**Hopes? for a skin that probs won&rsquo;t change**\r\n\r\n*     Gonna be honest, I was hoping for something more, uh, deserty. I would have liked to see it tied into _her_ a little more.\r\n*     imo, laurels should have wreathed her head and been much more subtle on her blade to give her glaive a truer bladed edge\r\n*     Keep with the blue cloth (I&rsquo;m interested to see how this would look) and give the metal a bright grey tint, rather then a blue one so it doesn&rsquo;t all blend together.\r\n*     Consider! The silver on Janna or Eliese&rsquo;s skin looks gorgeous with the gold and blue.\r\n*     Really was hoping for darker skin on this... skin. Not only would it give way to her her ethnicity it would made for lovely contrast with the bight, shiny colors of her clothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-11-03T09:20:33.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the feedback Sealust!

Right now we have a few esports lines; Championship, Victorious, Challenger, Winning Teams and we may have even more in the future. We felt like it was important that they each have their own design space moving forward because the chance of one champion getting multiple esports skins increases as time goes on. We felt it was important that people don't confuse the skin lines either because if someone thinks you just purchased the 'blue' Elise skin it detracts from your achievement.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-04T17:56:35.212+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a counterpoint, I don't care if people know I'm gold+ just from the victorious skin.

That being said I'll still miss the skin that could have existed had it followed the current Victorious theme. \n\nAs an aside, I friggin love the majority of the skins you guys put out at such a steady tempo.

The more seasons we have, the more having two visually separate skin lines makes sense.

It's just that the roman thing theme is pretty widely used across the spectrum and the Victorious line seems like something that calls for a more unique theme, something more 'League of Legends'y.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-11-03T15:36:25.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I guess Rome owned Egypt for a while...","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2015-11-03T14:55:23.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait wait wait... You WANTED to change the Victorious line??? That's like saying you want to move the Marauder skin from a dark, coal black color to straight RED, because SO MUCH MURDER AND BLOOD!\n\n... I'm sorry, the tone may be a little better, but I loved the idea that Sivir was getting a skin to join the Victorious line, since I can't have the PAX skin (although we haven't been told WHY Riot won't redistribute those, even at events, just that they won't). But this is a slap in the face, and if I can expect every future Victorious Skin to now be a wannabe Roman Skin... then count me out of ranked from now on. So not worth it.\n\nEdit: I just honestly thought that the skin set was good as is. To me, Championship was like the lesser Victorious that everyone else could buy if they wanted to. Victorious added the gold you get FROM Victory, and could only be achieved through toiling through the sludge of verbal abuse and the struggle of improving your skills that is Ranked mode. It was perfect. Like every person got a piece of the summoner's cup in skin form.\n\nJust... Please stop setting people's expectations then blowing them up for the sake of \"different\", and \" oh, you'll get used to it\". At least put some poll or something out before you change a skin line so fundamentally, see what people think. AND MAKE THOSE OPINIONS VISIBLE. Then at least we'll be able to see that, hey, a majority of players DO like the changes, even if I don't. Right now it feels like we just don't know how many people DON'T like this departure from precedence vs how many people do.\n\nHeck, I'll even be okay with the laurels and purple! Just please don't put the laurels on her weapon. Which is arguably the most prominent piece of her skins. Put the laurels somewhere, ANYWHERE else: as paldrons, as a belt, anywhere but the thing you're using to kill people with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SchaakaKon","date":"2015-11-03T02:03:25.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"To add my thoughts: After watching all of worlds and hearing the next Victorious skin was for Sivir I did a massive eye roll.
