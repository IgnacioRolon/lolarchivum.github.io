I don't have good internet but I can still play and do updates, for some reason this update keeps resetting when ever it looses internet connection. The update as of right now is 7596 MB, I got it down to 400 MB one or two nights ago but the internet company I go through had a surprise maintenance. When I got back on it was back up to the starting MBs. (around 7900+) This has happened to me two times now. Was the update that Ornn was in 7900 MB +? And doesn't the download leave off where it was? Idk I just want to get back to playing the game asap. If anyone has answers I would love to hear them. Then again it could just be me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-29T17:09:32.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the update stops then your patcher will go back to rescan all of your game files for potential corruption, and then proceed with another update.
