I just finished a rank and fiddle silenced me and i was at least 1000 range away cause malachite ulted at me. We kinda lost cause that silence. i wasn't able to ultra and i was syndra i was out the entire fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Star Warden","date":"2014-10-07T00:59:25.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to give you a tip on how to play, but I think you could use some tips on how to talk/type first. Ult not ultra, there is no \"ultra\" anywhere in ultimate. Malphite? Malachite is copper mineral and not a league champion. If you have to say and more than once, rephrase your sentence since it will become a run-on very quickly and easily making you sound like a blithering idiot.\n\nYou positioned badly and got caught, they then used that to 100-0 you. Fiddle is a mage assassin meant to hard cc someone from 100-0, but he can deal his ultimate in a huge aoe making him perfect for wombo combos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wolfax","date":"2014-10-07T00:34:28.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiddle can't take you out within that silence.

Talon still can do crazy damage without his silence. They already nerfed fear so it does this stupid thing where you run away from him. Nerfing him more would just mean they need to rework all together.","replies":[]}]}
