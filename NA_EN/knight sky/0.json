Which puts him at the 26th best midlaner out of 47 and the 28th best top laner out of 55. So obviously he is NOT op in anyway. His winrate is exactly where it needs to be and he is a balanced champ. Too many people are hoping on the &quot;yasuo needs a nerf&quot; bandwagon. In my oppinion he is not that hard to play against and overall is a fun champ to play as or against. You cant argue the facts/statistics they are what the are. so if he needs nerfed so does 20 other midlaners and toplaners. \r\n\r\nIf you dont believe me here is where the data comes from:   https://champion.gg/statistics/#?search=yas","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2016-12-15T02:13:51.769+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If people stopped looking at the winrates for their only statistic, maybe riot WOULD do something about champs","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Sky","date":"2016-12-15T14:00:14.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This statement literally makes no sense lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hrd2H1t","date":"2016-12-15T02:13:13.934+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No shit he has a low winrate, he has one of the highest play rates in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Sky","date":"2016-12-15T02:15:32.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"this makes no sense lol playrate has nothing to do with winrate, look at hecarim or vi for example","replies":[{"poster":"Hrd2H1t","date":"2016-12-15T02:19:27.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Low play rate champions always have higher win rates than high play rate champions, regardless of their actual balance.

Putting the minimum cooldown on his Q to 2 seconds instead of 1.33 seconds would fix this without ruining him too much and at the same time, some better scaling could be added to his E, making it more than just a tool to get close or away past the early game. I am in favor of nerfing his Q slightly, but buffing the rest of his kit and have been so from the beginning. This might be a personal opinion and I realise his winrate shows him off as really balanced, but I still find this aspect of him too strong and would prefer to see him actually be a bit stronger in other aspects of his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Sky","date":"2016-12-15T02:12:01.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for being a decent person with a very valid oppinion, i agree a slight change like that would be nice.
