And when I checked the &quot;killer&quot; damage tab I saw 1900 damage coming from MF ult... AND I HAD ARMOR, 260 points of armor to be certain.\r\n\r\nThe thing is... comparing MF ult to other similar ults one can get to the conclusion that MF ult is superior in terms of damage and safety... but I will make the comparison anyways:\r\n\r\nKatarina: literally leaps into your face and is limited to hit only 3 champs at the same time, it can be easily interrupted due to the distance.\r\nNunu: He has to be super close for it to work, also it doesnt deal damage until it is stoped or it finishes.\r\nGalio: High cc, not so much damage, the user can be interrupted, he takes damage, low distance.\r\nKarthus: can be prevented, it has a great indicator to tell you when it is going to be casted and the damage is not so high.\r\nCaitlyn: in terms of ADC ults caitlyn ult is similar to mf, but... it can be interrupted, it has a LONG indicator, it can be stopped, and the damage is not so high.\r\nVelKoz: he can move his ult, but it can be sometimes hard to control and the total damage amount is in comparison not as high as MF ult...\r\n\r\nWhat happens with MF?\r\n1) She is a lane bully, with the capacity to poke without using high amounts of mana, therefore eliminating her old need to buy a mana item.\r\n2) She has a powerful slow with her E and is able to proc Thunderlord whenever she wants from it... actually she does.\r\n3) She is now harder to reach because her moblity was moved towards her w, a mobility which can be compared to Sivir&#039;s R.\r\n4) DAMN! you added critical to her ult.... YES RIOT YOU DID! this means that her ult can get to deal 200% damage if it crits... NO! It can get to deal 250% (and even more with crit damage runes!) damage, because every ADC builds an Infinity Edge... and yes! This MF didn&#039;t even build life steal, actually she didnt have so much AD, she had an Infinity, Stattik and Rapidfire Cannon (80% CRIT CHANCE).... I bet her ult could deal up to 3500 damage if she just builds Essence Reaver, 3 Infinity Edge, Dominik Regards and the boots.... because... why not? \r\n\r\nActually Riot do not nerf her, don&#039;t you dare! Because I am going to start abusing her! Because now you added all the advantages of Mage Fortune into ADC Fortune! now it is pointless for her to build ap because her ult alone can be a pentakill! And even more than before folks!\r\nTry it! dont build attack speed! just damage and crit!\r\n\r\nAnd please Riot give me some of that pot you smoked when you thought that adding such a crit ratio to MF ult without controlling it like you did with Yasuo or Katarina (limiting her ult to 3 targets) was a good idea!","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-02-11T15:48:09.938+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's squishy, immobile and relies heavily on a front line.\n\nWhat I'm curious to know is, how the heck do you let her ult for that long to rack up 2k damage? It's not instant and while it does do a chunk of damage, its done over a fair amount of time. \n\nLeona's ult distance is around the same as MF's ult range, the moment you see her use it, she becomes sitting duck for yours.\n\nKatarina's ult also does damage significantly faster than MF's ultimate. \n\nVel'Koz's ult is different from MF ult as well. MF can pretty much launch it whenever she wants to. Ideally, you want to use E before so you can keep them slowed in bullet storm, but its not imperative to do so.\n\nVel'Koz's ult is meant to be a finishing ability on top of a chain of all his other abilities, additionally his is controllable. Land all of them in succession, you have a guaranteed dead squishy. MF, not so much, only time you have a dead squishy is if its in conjunction with other CC.

He can travel from one turret to another up to you and kill you under your own turret while missing half of his abilities and teleport back to his own turret safe and sound. Yet, here you are complaining about MF and her toolkit that is purely focused on damage even tho she does less than the flavor of the month.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"spirit cooking","date":"2016-02-11T21:09:18.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buff Lucian's ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ruin Lance","date":"2016-02-11T18:58:35.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with the proper team comp, MF is pretty busted. just get a frontline and just watch as the enemy team can do nothing to stop you from blowing your ~4k+ damage load all over them. and at high elo, that's how people build miss fortune (how you described it)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2016-02-11T18:54:36.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were a leo.\n\nHow did she channel the whole thing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2016-02-11T18:35:30.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cherysse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XvHiJsks,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-11T15:27:07.810+0000)\n>\n> 4) DAMN! you added critical to her ult....
