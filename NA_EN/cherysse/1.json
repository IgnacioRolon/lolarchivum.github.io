The item was \"working\". It was just very niche and only built in dragged out games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2015-12-13T05:56:57.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do just want to point out that losing zephyr left a hole in itemization for AD champs that are looking for attack speed without crit.

It just seems like your lacking a coherent philosophy when it comes down to itmization.\n\nalso some copy&paste as it didn´t get answered in the devcorner: \n>are you happy with everything going crit? before this preseason i could play most of the marksmen as AD-Casters sucessfully, some of them even as AD-Bruisers. Now there´s no variety anymore for me, the Champ always plays the same way. Which is rather boring/frustrating...as i really like having more options available (i´m mostly an RPG/turn-based-strategy guy) to react to the game unfolding.\n\nand maybe take a look at http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/kIqG66Ao-detailed-preseason-feedback-part-1-items, as there really are issues pointed out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cherysse","date":"2015-12-13T05:13:19.096+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) Are you planning to make {{item:3060}} viable again on midlaners? (by re-adding the 15% minion/summoned units damage aura to it -which you removed from the game when Elixir of Ruin was finally thrown into the void).\n\n2)  I would also like to see a buff to {{item:3056}}  (maybe adding extra %MS -always-) so that it becomes more popular -and focused on mobility-.\n\n3) I love niche items, even if I don't like when you remove them (I missed {{item:3123}}  A LOT). I am kinda ok with the removal of SotD (useless and somehow toxic), but I like the concept of it and that magic mechanic of the 3 AA, which is something that can be reworked into a viable item. Same goes with Zephyr which is in terms of concept heavily outshadowed by {{item:3078}} in terms of stats/role, but we are now lacking tenacity items.\n\n4) Any ideas for future AP items?\n\n5) Well this is more personal, hahahaha. I am a map designer in WC3 (and a graphic designer as well), I have invested years researching the internal mechanics of WC3, and well, the gameplay and the Design; is there anyway I could have contact (not work I know my place) with the creative team, I am a pretty creative person and I have personally created tons of items (more than 350 viable items), abilities (over 2k), gameplay mechanics (shopping stuff, gameplay stuff), characters, lore and well... terrain. Actually I have noticed some of the things I did in my map ended up being applied in this pre-season (Refillable Jungler potions, Universal Spell-Vamp-Life Steal, some abilities and other concepts). My map is called Duel of Gods, it is both a Moba and a Hero Siege (the 10 players vs the Monster Siege, something which could be also applied to League, mainly because the Hero Siege concept has always been very popular and played by the same group of persons who played Dota1 in wc3). Well before going non-sense here is my main map, I don't know if your team still likes WC3 but well here is my humble request for you to try my not-so-humble map (btw the description is outdated and it has more to it than what it seems):\nhttp://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/maps-564/duel-gods-prev-244566\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-12-13T10:05:03.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you remove zephyr & atma's impeller despite them being built occasionally; but leaving in ohmwrecker & odyn's veil even though they haven't been seen outside of custom games?\nI'd rather have more options for versatility, than being forced into the same things by design.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-12-13T13:50:54.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It is more that they decided that Zephyr and Atma's didn't serve the purpose Riot wanted them too. \nIf you notice, Atma's was brought back into the game in the form of Titanic Hydra - extra damage for tankiness - but overall it is much more satisfying. \nOhmwrecker has the potential to serve a purpose - it gives teams that are having difficulty against a stall comp a way of diving. It will need more work, but the basic idea of \"disable turrets for a little while\" is workable, whereas flat attack damage for building health (Atma's) is not.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-12-13T14:37:39.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ohmwrecker hasn't been buffed, nerfed, removed, nor reworked for years; atma's was at least altered a couple times before being removed. Zephyr was one of the newest items to be deleted (except for feral flare), but likewise was never shown any attention despite their claim it wasn't doing anything. I built it on roughly 1/3 of the games I ran a melee champ, just from the mobility & attack damage bonus being a necessity against the more mobile champions that need to be killed first (such as gnar, yasou, fizz, ext). \nMy annoyance is from the hypocrisy meddler has proposed; they remove items because they aren't working right or meeting expectations. Zypher was fairly balanced and reliable while being occasionally used; but ohmwhecker is rarely seen (if ever) and it's stats are so low, that most players expect it to be wasting an item slot more than being useful (also probably because towers are so weak that it has no purpose). \nThe choice between the two should've been rather clear; but it's like the 'sword of occult' & 'soulstealer' inconsistency again. Either one hand doesn't know what the other is doing; or they are deliberately trying to provoke the community; or they are seeing just how far they can force us into particular play-styles before we notice.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-12-13T04:00:46.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ammbE4IN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-13T03:58:28.312+0000)\n>\n> Over time we'll want to add new items to support champions that don't have good choices, to create new playstyles/moments of gameplay, to help balance the game etc. At the same time though we don't want the item pool to get so large it's impossible to keep track of it and make informed choices.
