Why cant I buy just one instead of bundle. I do not wish to purchase bundle as I main support and I do not play rest of the champions you are offering in that bundle. If you could make this individual I would be able to buy one. I been waiting for this particular skin for a very long time as currently I do not own any other blitz skin and I main blitz and thresh support. If you could do this I would really appreciate. \n\nBest Regards,\nSSW Thresh","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-04T01:32:15.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SSW Thresh,\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to obtain this skin, at least for now, is through the bundle.

I joined a tournament that happened in February. A team clearly full of plat's rofl stomped everyone, tourny host didn't want to give them prizes. Up to now i'm still trying to get my team's second place prize.\n\nRiot doesn't see us above money, I know it sucks but I think that if riot has a chance to make you spend more money they will do so.\n\nAnd the thing about your mom not letting you spend that much money, I get it 100%. I'm in Asia right now so I end up having to spend 3 times as much for the same amount. T_T\n\n30 dollars for 1350 is alot T_T. \n\nAnd I feel like i've played with you before.
