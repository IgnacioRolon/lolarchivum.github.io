Able to towerdive 1v3 and win?\n\nThat botlane being twice as powerful as it currently is? Or that enemy assassin literally appearing in 1 second  doing an attack to delete 3 people instantly?\n\nThis is the epitome of snowballing, and i have seen it.\n\nNever again, no matter how amusing it was being the one doing it.......it just felt so damn fking terrible having to endure it, no matter what you did it was just purely hopeless.\n\nCurrent game is team reliant but it is actually possible to pull back up even if a enemy gets fed as hell, i even did so fairly recently. \n\n\n> Seeing how I was plat 3 this season and I got series of monkey teammates and how I don't still know what my skill ceiling is, I couldn't carry and win some games, eventually dropping back to plat 5.

On top of that, when you really think about it, preserving stats doesn't mean just protecting your KDA or whatever. I for one wouldn't want to go into a ranked game on a champion I don't know, but also bot games don't do the job right, of teaching what a character is like against various champions using various techniques on the actual rift.

Silver is hands down the most toxic division on NA. The players are more concerned about what they type to teammates than improving at all.\n\nNormals have too much variance. Players play off roles too much, give up quickly, and there is a wide array of player skill. I am in high platinum and I get silver and gold players in my normal games. \n\nIf I try to learn a champion or role in normals I don't walk away learning too much because I can simply punish the lowest ranked player over and over again.

It's an opportunity to figure out how to improve and get better. Platinum is littered with high diamond smurfs.  Most high elo Diamond players place in high gold or low platinum on their smurfs.

Most smurfs can do it in less. \n\nEither way, smurfing has helped me improved a lot, especially working on teleports and splitting. \n\nDoesn't matter too much if I can't convince you, but playing on a smurf helps a lot players learn roles and champions in a lower pressure environment that isn't as low as a normal game or flex q. \n\nSoloq is a better learning environment because it eliminates most variance. If I tried to learn a new role or champion at my current elo I would simply get stomped in ranked. The skills in normals don't often translate to ranked. Ask high elo player they will say learning champions in normals is not very effective and you are better off having a smurf. \n\nIf I play on a smurf I can incrementally learn the role and the champion.

Also season change, in this current season, teamplay has a massive influence saying that having good teams isnt necessary is like saying supports have no impact in the game. \n\nI dont believe that smurfing can ever help a higher elo player in any aspect. How does playing with lower level players then you help you in anyway? They dont even measure up to you in any aspect? Split pushing, you can split push in plat, in fact learning how to split push in plat would be even better because the map awarness and level of play would actually help you unlike in Gold and below, many people dont even look at their mini maps let alone ward.

I went from low to high platinum on my main just from getting better at something I thought I was already good at.\n\nSo yes, split-pushing purposefully in gold (even though I could group and still win the game) provided more exposure to scenarios of when to split and when to not.

You are playing and spliting in a higher level, more map awareness, better reaction time, more wards being placed.

I probably honor players once every 4 or 5 games, so me honoring others didn't expedite the process.\n\nA lot of low elo players are just trying to win, they aren't trying to improve. I have smurfed in low elo and silver is pretty toxic and a vast majority of the players in silver just want to blame teammates instead of accounting for the mistakes they make in game. They simply deflect. Some also don't know how to improve. They just play a large volume of games making a lot of the same mistakes because they don't identify what they are doing wrong themselves.\n\nSome are trying to improve, but most are fixated on winning and not improving. \n\nMost of getting better at this game is attitude.

Also it seem like you just to scared to lose elo in your main account to learn.

Also you still havent disproved my point that playing at a lower level is some how going to improve you more then playing in your own elo.

Taking a new champion into a ranked game that you have never played is a good way to lose your rank, that much is true. \n\nBut if my skill is the same or close to the same level on that champion in silver or gold the game is relatively fair going on a smurf. \n\nPlaying at a lower rank lead to me practicing specific skills that then lead to improvement on my main. Simple as that. I was not a good split-pusher, went on a smurf, practiced it, and now I am a good split-pusher because I dedicated a lot of time towards it. \n\nThat's how most players improve at this game. Sure I could have just dedicated time on my main account towards splitting, but I probably wouldn't have incrementally learned anything. It would be like taking a Calculus 3 course and not knowing pre-calculus. \n\nAlso winning doesn't always equate to improving. A lot of players in league play to win, but not to improve. If you are only playing to win you will just be streaky and once you hit your peak elo you will sit at 50% win rate if you put no time into  figuring out why you aren't winning.\n\nMost of the players in silver are playing to win. They aren't critically thinking about their games, their mistakes, their positioning, etc. They are in silver because they aren't taking the next steps to improve, which is why 70% of the player base is Bronze or Silver. They mindlessly grind games thinking that winning and improving is the same thing. \n\nIf you improve you simply will begin to win.

Play them in normals, you dont ruin anyones game that way.Also are we talking about first timing a champion or spilt pushing? Or is the first timing a split-pushing champion? If so again you can go to normals, In fact it would be better to split in normals because it literally doesnt matter if you lose.  Another thing is if you are plat( not boosted) regardless of if you paly a champion for the first time there is literally no way, because your marco and mechanics will be at the level of a plat player, so even your first time is at a higher level.\n\nAgain how is it that you improve more at a lower level rather then a level that is the same? What specific skills do you gain that you wouldnt gain at a higher level compared to at a lower level then your own. That is like saying that as a 9th grader by reading childrens books I gain more knowledge then reading actual 9th grade books. It doesnt make any sense.  And I already know your going to replay to this argument saying you can if you are learning the basics but then that would mean you didnt even deserve to be in that elo and it was luck, you need to at least have the basics to reach that level. Also for your Calculus example that would  be like actually not even having the basics of math down yet somehow passing all the way to reach the level to actually take Calculus meaning you didnt even have basic math figured out.\n\n I may not for something else, but it does in league or else you wouldnt actually have anything to show your progress. If you are improving you are essentially winning more by working to improve the thing you want. That is how you track progress in league, for example if you are improving on a specific champion you win more on it. If you are improving with split pushing then you start winning more because you are split pushing effectively. Again there is nothing stopping you from doing this on your main account in fact it would be better to, because there is actually pressure involved that you would not find in gold/silver. Marco is better mechanics too, so you would have actual challenges when someone is coming to 1v1 you. If you are 1v1 against a player that isnt even as good as you how do you improve in that area? If you split push yet the players barely look at their own minimap, because they dont have enough awareness how can you actually be improving? You yourself should know the difference in level of play, so again how can you actually gain anything from playing against lower level players then you?","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2018-05-14T02:37:35.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I realize you give up when you realize your wrong, its ok you know you wrong but you arent able to admit it.

You still have a much better level of knowledge and skill then most players that are mid, espeically someone who is gold/silver/ or plat. However you seem to think for some reason you drop a elo if you try a new lane.  \n\nAlso if you are smurfing and you are going up the ranks playing against silver and gold players trying to learn something new, the only discrepancy you will face is one bronze player or some unranked players but that doesnt mean every single normal player is bad. Gold silver or plat players dont play normals? player who are unranked might even have more games then most ranked players to so they might even be at gold or plat level.

Then they get toxic toward the players and degrade them all while being watched on stream. This type of behavior if sent in by someone should have at the very least their low elo account banned and their main suspended. It's kinda how I feel about flex as of late. Me and my two buddies played alot of flex que in the beginning of the season. The matchmaking system doesnt take into account soloque( for some reason) so half the time your are playing with people way out of your elo (up or down). Most of the time it turns into someone feeding and stating \"well its flex I dont care about it\" or something of that nature.
