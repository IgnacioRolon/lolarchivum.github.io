If you were wanting to get more mastery chests and that was why you wanted those scores reset, you'll be able to get more once the new season starts. If you were just wanting the fun of leveling up that mastery again, you're always able to start new accounts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-11-27T02:02:50.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my personal opinion, if you were able to reset mastery levels, that would only lead to further potential harm that could be done against someone who has had their account information compromised. Imagine if you just got every champion to Mastery 7, and somehow someone else gained access to your account. Meanwhile, they're resetting every mastery for every champion, and when you regain access to your account, you're back at square one. How would that make you feel?","replies":[]}]}
