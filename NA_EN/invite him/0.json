I wanted to share this champion idea with the people who read this! I though of a new mechanic that i think a new champion Attack Damage Carry, will be great to have. I'll explain the new mechanic below, ill say about his passive and about his range/ attack speed/ attack damage/ movement! \n---\n>***Lunk***, the Space yordle!\n\n---\n\n>**Lore**: *(Short for now, longer will be added later)*\n\n- Hello? Is anyone out there? I'm scared - she shouted.\n- Don't be! I'm here! My name is Lunk, i'll help you! - he said.\n- Are you the yordle, that saved the woman from death? - she asked.\n- Ye..Yes that's me! - he returned.\n\nA little yordle, with a big heart, but before, on the last birthday he had, he found out that his parents weren't his own parents and he escaped from home! Through all the Galaxy way, he managed to find a little pet. He named it Rox. He and Rox traveled a lot, but their journey has just began, when Lunk found a secret weapon in a cave, far across the Kripton-H65 Galaxy, which was invented by a recently killed yordle, that made some of the weapons that Battlecast's have and that's why this weapon will change this yordle's life, a lot!\n\n---\n\n>**Stats**:\n\n**Health**: 480 (plus 54 per level) (plus 918 at maximum)\n\n**Attack Damage**: 49 (plus 4.1 per level) (plus 69.7 at maximum)\n\n**Attack Speed**: 0.000 (plus 2% per level)\n\n**Movement Speed**: 340\n\n**Health Regen**: 4.0 (plus 0.3 per level) (plus 5.1 at maximum)\n\n**Armor**: 17 (plus 3.1 per level) (plus 52.7 at maximum)\n\n**Magic Resistance**: 28\n\n**Auto Attack Range**: 800 (optional, might change) (because some say he doesnt have kitting, let me say, that this range is really good for non-kitting champions, again its ***optional***!) \n\n*Primary Role* - ***ATTACK DAMAGE CARRY***\n*Secondary Role* - ***TOP LANER***\n ---\n>***Mechanic**** - ***Do not watch the numbers while reading Lunk's mechanic, see below at the bottom of the post, where ive *FIXED* every ability/mechanic that has came in problem, after you read the abilities/mechanic, go and check what changes ive made at the bottom, that are given suggestions from other players!***\n\n----\n >**Lunk's unique Mechanic** : \n\n*1 - Every time you auto attack a target, your attacks will continuously dealing damage, if you don't move or if the target doesn't get out of your range. \n2 - Your attacks don't need any attack speed to be faster, because you'll auto attack continuously on the target you've selected. \n3 - If you cancel your basic auto attack, but you've already made a 0.1 - 0.5 second animation, your auto attack will deal your basic attack damage.\n4 - Building attack speed, will make it into **Armor's Flexibility**. (This champion's *Passive*)\n5 - Attack speed slow items/ spells will not work on this champion because he doesn't need any attack speed to use his auto attacks, but reducing his attack speed will make him lose his **Armor's Flexibility** % gained from bonus attack speed.\n6 - Critical striking is the same, when he's about to critical strike, he deals damage based on his critical damage.\n7 - Movement slowing items on Lunk will be really powerful, because you'll slow your target like normal ADC, but you will attack continuously, not auto attack by auto attack!\n8 - Life steal works like movement speed slowing effects, you'll heal every time you auto attack continuously, even if you cancel your attack and you deal only base damage instead of a continuous damage, you'll heal for the % life steal you have. \n9 - For people who say that this mechanic is way too **over powered**, let me say a few words for the **counter-back**. First if the enemies buy **Thornmail** and you auto attack them continuously, you'll receive damage continuously, if they get attack speed slowing items on them, your **Armor Flexibility** % chance will be lowered!\n10 - For people who cant imagine what i tried to explain with this mechanic, check **Overall Look**, which is after the abilities. There you'll see what is the mechanic and how i imagine it to be. **(you basically auto attack like the inhibitor turrets do and like the nexus turrets do!)***\n\n---\n>***Abilities**** - ***Do not watch the numbers while reading Lunk's abilities, see below at the bottom of the post, where ive *FIXED* every ability that has came in problem, after you read the abilities, go and check what changes ive made, that are given suggestions from other players!***\n\n---\n\n**Passive**: *Armor's Flexibility: U34* \n\n>Every 1.0 seconds Lunk auto attacks continuously the same target, he gets a X% chance, based on bonus attack speed, of getting his attacks go through his targets armor, dealing bonus true damage!\n\n*Every 5% bonus attack speed transforms into 1% **Armor's Flexibility** chance!*\n\n**Charity**:* I've explained every thing about this passive, about how it works, so if you have some **deep** questions, feel free to ask in the comments!*\n---\n\n**Ability Q**: *Auto-Motivation: K98*\n\n>When this ability is active, Rox passively attacks along with Lunk, draining 2/4/6/8/10 mana per second and dealing 10/15/20/30/50 bonus magic damage!\nWhen this ability is off, its passive gives Lunk and every friendly champion near him, bonus 5/10/15/20/25 armor.\n\n***This ability doesnt have any bonus rations, meaning that it will keep its stats, even if you build more AP/AD***\n\n**Charity**:* So this ability is for safe lane and for good poke, if you have more **deep** question, feel free to ask, below, also it may be activated, while you auto attack someone, meaning your auto attack will continue dealing damage, even if you activate it!*\n---\n\n**Ability W**: *Force-Field 003*\n\n>Upon activation, Lunk gets his weapon a setting, which gets Lunk shielded from 40/65/100/150/210 *physical* damage for the next 6 seconds. During this time, Lunk enjoys bonus 5/6/8/11/15 % lifesteal!\nAfter this shield ends or after it's destroyed, Lunk enjoys bonus 5/8/10/15/25 %  movement speed!\n\n***This ability doesnt have any bonus rations, meaning that it will keep its stats, even if you build more AP/AD***\n\n**Charity**:* This ability is here to 1 v 1 players, also it may be activated, while you auto attack someone, meaning your auto attack will continue dealing damage, even if you activate it, so its welcome to join Lunk's abilities* (future questions below)\n---\n\n**Ability E**: *Solar-Command: H951*\n\n>Lunk channels for 0.5 second, to fire out a blue laser, dealing 10/20/35/50/80 magic damage, applying on hit effects, but this ability does not appy Lunk's passive **Armor's Flexibility**\nWhen this ability hits a target, Lunk can auto attack this target and his attacks will slow its target with 20% of their movement speed for the next 1/1.50/2/3/4.50 seconds, based on how much this ability has been leveled up and how much Lunk has been attacking the enemy!\n\n***Damage Ratio on the skill shot - 0.5 of bonus magic damage, 0.2 of bonus attack damage***\n\n**Charity**:*The ability gives a chance for Trinity force to come along, so as Statikk Shiv, Iceborn Gauntlet and many more, also based on how much you've attacked the enemy, that got hit by this ability, they will be slowed, so if you auto attack them continuously, they will be slowed for X% seconds, based on what leve is this ability!*\n---\n\n**Ultimate Ability R**: *Galaxy Ka-Boom: Weapon-Stance R65*\n\n>Lunk charges back for 1 second to fire out a plasma comet in the space. After 1 second, this comet will fall to the target location, dealing 80/125/205 magic damage. Targets that get hit by the comet will get poisoned by a radio active energy and are dealt a 9/16/25 % of their max health as magic damage every second for 2 seconds.\n\n***Damage Ratio on the explosion comet - 1.8 of bonus magic damage, 0.9 of bonus attack damage, the poison doesn't have any ratio in bonus***\n\n**Charity**:* Lunk's ultimate, Galaxy Ka-Boom! is made for killing down fleeing enemies or initiating a team fight for the Baron or for the Dragon. The poison damage is significant but it's really hard to hit this ability, also the base damage of it is really low and because the enemies know when the comet will fall, although they have 1 second to react, some of them might not be in time to escape! It provides vision too, meaning other players with **global** ultimate's can snipe too! If you have more questions ask below. Also this ability cancels Lunk's basic auto attack mechanic! * \n---\n*His second skin will be: Infernal Lunk, with all fire-y kind of animations!*\n---\n***Overall Look***:\n*I'm not going to explain everything about his animations, make some imaginary animations but ill say a few things about his mechanical auto attacks!*\n\n>Lunk's auto attack animation will be like the current auto attack animation bot the inhibitor turrets and nexus turrets have, but in a different color. For the base skin in blue-ish and after you start to peel through the targets armor - in purple-ish and for the skin - fire-ish animations, something like a Malzahar's ultimate, but in red color and after you start to peel through your targets armor, it'll turn into yellow-orange color!\n\n---\n\n**Taunts**: *(I'm going to go through few of them, if you have some ideas, post them in the comments!)*\nFeaturing - ***Ctrl + 1/2/3/4***\n\n*1. Joke -  Rox go get 'em, Rox! ROX!.. uhh.. \n2. Joke - My pet is stronger th.. ROX! Come here..!\n3. Taunt - See, i have a weapon, you - money! Make a deal!\n4. Taunt - Ill give you a head-shot, stronger than Caitlyn's!\n5. Taunt - Come and see, right in this hole.. BOOM!\n6. Taunt - Ill save you, just like Tristana did it to me! **(featuring Tristana's rework :D)**\n7. Dance - Think of your own, post suggestions in the comments!\n8. Laugh - Laughs like a little kid, along with his pet!*\n\n---\nHis Champion Select Quote: *Here goes Lunk, on your commands!*\n\n*Okey so, **Thanks** for comming 'round here to see my Champion Suggestion and my New mechanic, i obviously got inspired by our latest Inhibitor turrets and Nexus turrets, but that's fine :D. Also if you want to change something, make a new ability, a new dance or even new stats that you think can fit this champion, post suggestions, I may add them SoonTM!*\n---\n***Also i wanted to add my previous two Champion Concepts that i made:*** \n[Qrow, Holder of the Lighting Hammer](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/7UtrcEvT-champion-concept-qrow-holder-of-the-lighting-hammer)\n-----\nJust to remind, my next champions will be Hex, the Architect of Destruction; Zon, the Noxian's Armor; Sue, the blade of Piltover; A.Z.R, the Machine of Tomorrow; Razz, the Prehistoric Jaw; Edward, the grandfather of Noxus; Goblyn, the Doom Itself;\n-----\n***Fixed abilities and stats:***\n>1 - Every time you auto attack a target, your attacks will continuously dealing damage, if you don't move or if the target doesn't get out of your range.\n\n*Fix* - If you have 100 attack damage, you will deal 1/2 of it every 0.25 seconds, this is what makes this ADC unique, its damage is high, because his kite is equal to 0. And so now, you might say - he will recieve damage from Thornmail every 0.25 seconds, this isnt a good mechanic, it wont help anything, let me say - if you get lifesteal, you get healed every 0.25 seconds, think of it, If they get attack speed slowing items, well, youll still deal damage to them, just wont apply true damage that much! \n\n>2 - Your attacks don't need any attack speed to be faster, because you'll auto attack continuously on the target you've selected.\n\n*Fix* - See above! I have given a X amount of attack damage, every 1/2 of it will be dealt every 0.25 seconds! \n\n>7 - Movement slowing items on Lunk will be really powerful, because you'll slow your target like normal ADC, but you will attack continuously, not auto attack by auto attack!\n\n*Fix* - Yes this statement might not be true, but since your auto attack range is very high, well, pretty much, if your enemies go out of your sigh, your auto attacks as a normal ADC will slow for X seconds as *Frozen's Mallet* slow is. As Lunk, you will slow your enemies every second they get attacked by you and X seconds after they leave your auto attack range!\n\n>Passive: Armor's Flexibility: U34\nEvery 1.0 seconds Lunk auto attacks continuously the same target, he gets a X% chance, based on bonus attack speed, of getting his attacks go through his >targets armor, dealing bonus true damage!\n\n>Every 5% bonus attack speed transforms into 1% Armor's Flexibility chance!\n\n*Fix* - True damage - 10/20/30, i think its a fail number given that he has 0 kitting, he will need to kill its enemies faster before they get to him!\n\n>Ability Q: Auto-Motivation: K98\nWhen this ability is active, Rox passively attacks along with Lunk, draining 2/4/6/8/10 mana per second and dealing 10/15/20/30/50 bonus magic damage!\nWhen this ability is off, its passive gives Lunk and every friendly champion near him, bonus 5/10/15/20/25 armor.\n\n*Fix* - Rox attacks every 0.5 seconds, given that Lunk deals his X amount of attack damage for 0.5 seconds. With the scale every rank this ability has, let it be, i though that this ability should be weak earlier, but.. - 10/20/30/40/50 magic damage!\nAway from that, given that someone doesnt like this ability, its not my fault, this ability gives a really good bonus magic damage, that many ADC would like to have, at least i bet! \n\n>Ability W: Force-Field 003\nUpon activation, Lunk gets his weapon a setting, which gets Lunk shielded from 40/65/100/150/210 physical damage for the next 6 seconds. During this time, >Lunk enjoys bonus 5/6/8/11/15 % lifesteal!\nAfter this shield ends or after it's destroyed, Lunk enjoys bonus 5/8/10/15/25 % movement speed!\n\n*Fix* - Okey, more number fixes, i do agree.. - Shield damage 40 / 90 / 140 / 190 / 240, Lifesteal 7 / 9 / 11 / 13 / 15%, Movement speed 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25%, as for these who do not think this ability fits the ADC role, okey, which other ADC has a shield that gives movement speed enough to escape after someone destroyed it, because *this* given ADC doesnt have any kite? There isnt such an ADC!\n\n>Ability E: Solar-Command: H951\nLunk channels for 0.5 second, to fire out a blue laser, dealing 10/20/35/50/80 magic damage, applying on hit effects, but this ability does not appy Lunk's >passive Armor's Flexibility\nWhen this ability hits a target, Lunk can auto attack this target and his attacks will slow its target with 20% of their movement speed for the next >1/1.50/2/3/4.50 seconds, based on how much this ability has been leveled up and how much Lunk has been attacking the enemy!\n\n*Fix* - Okey, numbers are again a bit off, thanks for the help - 60/70/80/90/100 magic damage, Based on how much seconds *Removed*, Debuff over enemies *Added*  4 seconds, Slow 10/20/30/40/50 %, if 20 isnt enough, Ratio AD 1.0; Ratio AP 1.5\n>Charity:The ability gives a chance for Trinity force to come along, so as Statikk Shiv, Iceborn Gauntlet and many more, also based on how much you've attacked the enemy, that got hit by this ability, they will be slowed, so if you auto attack them continuously, they will be slowed for X% seconds, based on what leve is this ability!\n\n*Fix* - Well, these items are welcomed, so far to Ezrael because his Q applies, so why not on Lunk? Every 0.25 seconds he applies damage, he will apply these bonus stats/damage debuffs! As for those who dont like it, i cant help, keep hating!\n\n>Ultimate Ability R: Galaxy Ka-Boom: Weapon-Stance R65\nLunk charges back for 1 second to fire out a plasma comet in the space. After 1 second, this comet will fall to the target location, dealing 80/125/205 magic >damage. Targets that get hit by the comet will get poisoned by a radio active energy and are dealt a 9/16/25 % of their max health as magic damage every >second for 2 seconds.\n\n*Fix* Again, again and again, numbers, thanks for helping - Damage 150/250/350, Max Health 10 at all ranks, to be fair, Ratio AD 1.0; Ratio AP 1.5! \n\n***Thoughts and Suggestions/Help:***\n\nThis is an ADC, thats feels unique over other ADC, having the power to deal true damage probably every 0.5 seconds with max attack speed, given that he has 0 kiting, is great. For those who feel he is Fighter/Assasin, he might work yes, in fact he might be really good, but to be honest, many ADC can fit for other roles, as mage/assasin, not giving names, because different players play in a different way. His abilities arent there to be connected, something like Twitch, his Q and E can be cast while he auto attacks, so they fit well, his shield may be activated while he attacks too, so i dont see anything that doesnt connect in some/another way, for those who dont see any connection, well ok, yes he might not connect like Caitlyn/Lucian/Jinx/Quinn, but thats why he feels*unique*, for the one helped me fix all of the numbers above, i do know what his role is, ive written that he is good ***Bot lane/ADC and Top lane*** in the primary, secondary role section, so he can fill in what ever you like to play. Hopefully this points everything that ive been asked to point out, have a nice day and also if you have questions/future things to point out, lets complain/suggest/have fun in the comments! \n","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2014-12-31T17:54:11.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1 - Every time you auto attack a target, your attacks will continuously dealing damage, if you don't move or if the target doesn't get out of your range.\n\nAt what speed? If my attack damage is 100, does my target take 100 damage per second? 150? 200? This is important: we have to know how often the attack damage occurs.\n\nAlso note that, since you can't move while attacking, this guy's kiting is effectively reduced to nothing, which will make him a pretty bad Marksman.\n\n> 2 - Your attacks don't need any attack speed to be faster, because you'll auto attack continuously on the target you've selected.\n\nSee above. Consider attack speed to be a stat that says \"this is how often you deal damage.\" It's an important part of carry scaling. So...how often do I deal damage, in terms of total AD/second?\n\n> 7 - Movement slowing items on Lunk will be really powerful, because you'll slow your target like normal ADC, but you will attack continuously, not auto attack by auto attack!\n\nGiven that the only movement-slow on-hit item is Frozen Mallet, which has a duration long enough that you can just hit them again to refresh it as *anyone*, I don't think this statement is actually true.\n\n> **Passive**: *Armor's Flexibility: U34*\n>Every 1.0 seconds Lunk auto attacks continuously the same target, he gets a X% chance, based on bonus attack speed, of getting his attacks go through his >targets armor, dealing bonus true damage! \n> \n> *Every 5% bonus attack speed transforms into 1% **Armor's Flexibility** chance!*\n\nHow much bonus true damage are we talking about here?

Or is it damage per hit of his auto-attack (at whatever speed that hits)? An important distinction. Also, abilities scale consistently: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 damage should be the numbers on this--every level of every ability in League gives you the same progression (aside from first, which sets the base value), so don't break that pattern.\n\nAll in all though, this is a pretty boring ability, and it's a team-wide defense aura, which seems *really* out of place on a guy intended to be a carry. The lack of scaling is also odd: most carries need abilities that help them scale into late-game.\n\n\n> **Ability W**: *Force-Field 003*\n>Upon activation, Lunk gets his weapon a setting, which gets Lunk shielded from 40/65/100/150/210 physical damage for the next 6 seconds.

Then probably 7 / 9 / 11 / 13 / 15% for the Lifesteal and 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25% for the movement speed.\n\nThis ability also doesn't really fit a Marksman though: a shield + speed boost + bonus lifesteal says \"Fighter\" to me.\n\n> **Clarity**:* This ability is here to 1 v 1 players, also it may be activated, while you auto attack someone, meaning your auto attack will continue dealing damage, even if you activate it, so its welcome to join Lunk's abilities* (future questions below)\n\nCarries aren't the kings of 1v1 though: they're supposed to be somewhat vulnerable to those situations, save for intentional duelists like Vayne and Quinn. *Fighters* are typically designed with excellent 1v1ing kits, as are Assassins.\n\n \n> **Ability E**: *Solar-Command: H951*\n>Lunk channels for 0.5 second, to fire out a blue laser, dealing 10/20/35/50/80 magic damage, applying on hit effects, but this ability does not appy Lunk's >passive Armor's Flexibility\n>When this ability hits a target, Lunk can auto attack this target and his attacks will slow its target with 20% of their movement speed for the next >1/1.50/2/3/4.50 seconds, based on how much this ability has been leveled up and how much Lunk has been attacking the enemy!\n\nI'm not sure this is worth the casting time, honestly. The damage (again, watch your scaling: both damage and duration scale improperly) isn't good, doesn't scale, and 20% movement speed isn't a lot of a reduction.\n\nSo far this guy is a *terrible* carry, incidentally. He doesn't scale with Attack Speed, his abilities don't give him any steroids or any real mobility, he can't kite well because of his attack mechanic, his ratios are either non-existent or abysmal (0.2 bonus AD on an AD carry's ranged damage spell?) and he just generally doesn't really have much of a role in the game.\n\n> **Charity**:*The ability gives a chance for Trinity force to come along, so as Statikk Shiv, Iceborn Gauntlet and many more, also based on how much you've attacked the enemy, that got hit by this ability, they will be slowed, so if you auto attack them continuously, they will be slowed for X% seconds, based on what leve is this ability!*\n\nBut he doesn't work particularly well with any of those items...\n\n \n> **Ultimate Ability R**: *Galaxy Ka-Boom: Weapon-Stance R65*\n>Lunk charges back for 1 second to fire out a plasma comet in the space.

Secondly, this ability is *way* to powerful. A nuke + a potential **50% max health drain** is *hugely* overpowered, especially in an AoE. Even if it's extremely hard to hit that sort of power is obscene: there's enough AoE CC in this game that abilities that strong can't be allowed. Nunu is about the only exception...and he's got a 3 second channel time that's easy to interrupt with any form of CC or displacement.\n\n----\n\n**CLOSING THOUGHTS**\n\nThis isn't a Marksman or a Carry. I'm not sure what it is: until I see exactly how often this unique attack mechanic of his deals damage (again...show me how the numbers work if my total AD is 100 damage: is it 100 damage once per second? Twice? Four times?) it's hard to judge him.\n\nEither way, his abilities follow no real theme and don't work together well...the kit feels like about three champions glued together into a non-coherent whole.\n\nI think the champion can use a lot of cleaning up and some revising: I'm not sure you really know what his unique role in the game will be. What's his specialty? Why should I pick him over any other ADC? Tell me what mechanics and roles he fills uniquely, and then design a kit to emphasize those unique elements: this one just feels all over the place.","replies":[{"poster":"Invite him","date":"2015-01-01T20:44:17.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=9K0jp7Fr,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2014-12-31T17:54:11.477+0000)\n>\n> At what speed?

Four times?) it's hard to judge him.\n> \n> Either way, his abilities follow no real theme and don't work together well...the kit feels like about three champions glued together into a non-coherent whole.\n> \n> I think the champion can use a lot of cleaning up and some revising: I'm not sure you really know what his unique role in the game will be. What's his specialty? Why should I pick him over any other ADC? Tell me what mechanics and roles he fills uniquely, and then design a kit to emphasize those unique elements: this one just feels all over the place.\n\nWow, im so impressed, that someone reviewed my champion in this kind of deep level, thanks for the hate in one way, thanks for the help in other! Since the numbers are just to show off, i dont think that some of these comments below the quoted abilities arent kinda true, with the 50% max hp 'n stuff! Im going to fix this, also, what is Urgot? He also has a shield, given only that, that he doesnt get bonus movement speed. Get another look over this champion, ive fixed a lot, hopefully youre *happy* now, because you seemed like i *killed* someone with this CC, given its my 3rd champion concept so far, but obviously you havent seen my first one, where i say that all the numbers are optional - ***do not mind them THAT much***! Thanks for the help thought, i can use this help for future projects, so its in handy! So let me give you a hint in your comment feeling, that flew in my mind while i was reading it, bro/man/player/teen, etc., please do not be so mean with people, try to help them with a good feel and not with a bad one, because i didnt get absolutely any help in mind-kind of way, because of the *bad* feel youve put in your comment! Thanks anyways :).","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2015-01-04T22:41:16.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=thattipman,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=9K0jp7Fr,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-01-01T20:44:17.014+0000)\n> Wow, im so impressed, that someone reviewed my champion in this kind of deep level, thanks for the hate in one way, thanks for the help in other! \n\nAny time! No hate, by the way: this wasn't actually a mean review, just an honest one. I may attack a kit because it isn't well put together, but I will *never* attack the person *creating* the kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Invite him","date":"2015-01-05T08:27:45.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, i was kinda mad at smb the day i wrote my reply, so dont worry, i kinda felt that its not mean, but any ways thanks :)!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"StealthyWolf52","date":"2015-01-03T03:52:37.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Epic review man, might you be able to review my own champion too?
