Sometimes it takes for 10-15 minutes to find a game., because it keeps disconnecting me while Im in queue. It is only for League of Legends.  When im in game , everything is normal. After game ends, sometimes I cant see game stats and it says that im disconnected, I don't know if it is because of my internet or what ?\r\nDoes anyone knows something about it ? Have someone experienced this ?","replies":[{"poster":"Squibblesz","date":"2017-08-17T23:17:57.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have been having this problem for a long while now and no fix has ever popped up.

At some point of time u getting dc but probably in queue you are still looking for it no 'Accept' pop up show up when game is ready. Happens only in league tho, steam and origin works like charm (dota 2, battlefield 1).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StrikeKillz","date":"2018-03-12T23:21:03.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump\n\nI had that problem for more then a year and it looks like i finally solved it.\nI have set up a QOS and port forwarding on the tcp/ip ports:\n2099 TCP - PVP.Net\n5223 TCP - PVP.Net\n5222 TCP - PVP.Net\nIn addition to that I opened up an exception for league on windows firewall.\n\nhope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cornosdojorge","date":"2017-11-18T19:49:56.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fuk riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Assaf Szir","date":"2017-11-15T17:58:43.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you find the fix? i experience this for 2 years now and the preseason 8 made it so when i get trying to reconnect while in a queue with a friend and it stops the queue also stops even if there was no accept popup for the friend(that doesnt have the problem)","replies":[]},{"poster":"PAPAPLANK","date":"2017-10-13T14:33:55.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:41}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T18:50:37.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When you're in queue and accept, your connection needs to transfer you over to the same group as everyone else.
