[The result, well, I still see my old name and icon when I go on my boards profile.](http://i.imgur.com/5OKB1aO.png) Additionally, when I log on to my smurf that owns the name Solstice, it shows the boards profile from this account. Basically I have two accounts showing the same thing on the boards.\n\nIs there any chance you guys would be willing to correct these accounts for me?\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nEdit: Included an image.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-25T16:57:16.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked your boards profile, and it looks like it's showing your normal profile: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Zyreck\n\nI attempted to refresh your boards account just in case, so hopefully things will fall into order in no time!","replies":[]}]}
