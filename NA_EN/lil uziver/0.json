Do you see a dip in your FPS or latency (ping) or is it entirely visual with no identifiers? \n\nSometimes, performance can be pretty janky if there are missing assets for a specific champion. I'd recommend [running a repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq5) just to ensure this isn't the case. \n\nLet me know if you continue to see this after the repair.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Uziver","date":"2016-09-10T18:47:48.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry havn't been on recently, but yes my ping goes up from 50 to mid 60's/70's, but i have repairing and the problem is still their some of my friends just think its more on my end with my shitty computer","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T16:28:46.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha.

Let me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
