And here we are, giving him the very gutting that happened with the two previous renditions of Aatrox because he became too good at his job, leading to being slowly but surely forgotten in the realm of soloqueue.\n\nIf you want one crucial thing to be pinpointed on why this rework has become a nightmare, here it is: You put too much emphasis on his Q to the point his Q is all he is, nothing more and nothing less. Its clear the rework has failed to do what it was set out to do.\nAt this point, you might as well throw out a semi revert and experiment with the old kit on the PBE for a better fix. I want to make sure Aatrox avoids a Kalista/Azir/Ryze situation where he basically gets left in the dirt because of pro play. I loved this champ in his previous form and stuck it up with this version, and the last thing I need is losing another champ I love playing in norms and ranked (Already lost Maokai).\n\nI just want to hear from a rioter on the balance team if they might consider a semi revert as an option, and make sure they will avoid putting him, Akali, and Irelia on the track of being the next Kalista/Azir/Ryze. No person should have their main ruined and torn like those 3 have.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2019-02-06T22:51:19.299+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":18,"body":"Imagine reworking a champion, who's been historically balanced and in fact underpowered, for \"being unbalanceable\" and making him an actual champion who is unbalanceable.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowbrand","date":"2019-02-06T23:04:51.590+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AirKingNeo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bLag77dR,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-02-06T22:51:19.299+0000)\n>\n> \"been historically balanced\"\n\nLmao!

And yes, mage items are broken which is why they had to nerf them over the years but that's not the topic.\n\nThe problem with statistics are that they exactly work like that: A small amount of player base means usually that only their mains play that champ. Aurelion Sol mains had almost a 60% (consistent) winrate and he was considered garbage by the majority of players (bronze, silver, gold makes up the majority). Yet his mains still played him pretty well, too well and Riot decided to nerf him (ofc they gutted this champ but he still had a dedicated playerbase, even if pretty small, that was pretty successful with him).\n\nTo come back to Aatrox in terms of statistics: You said in an earlier post that he was unpopular not bad or kept bad (or someone else said that idk anymore its somewhere above). This should automatically mean that only his mains play him or people who are willing to play him consistently since nobody else would like to play him and that would/should mean that he should have a high winrate if played by mains. Yet his winrate was just ok (let's just say it wasn't bad compared to other champs with small playerbase***), except for the time he got his mini rework and buffs and several other changes that impacted his build (it also fits your source you just posted). That time his winrate spiked to over 65%. This is too much. He was completely broken and got prob nerfed back until he once again below 5% pickrate and a winrate of below 55%.\n\nNow, statistics with small playerbases aren't always reliable. It could just mean that the Aatrox player base doesn't know how to play him to significantly climb with him or it could just be that the champ is too weak to climb with or the champ is out of meta (which he kind of was for a long long while). That's why nobody picks statistics from diamond and above but platinum and above. Diamond and above is way too small of a sample size to analyse and since platin is considered the top 10% (or it was like that back then idk how it is now) it gives a \"good\" enough sample size to make decisions.\n\nI hope you understand that perspective of mine a bit better now.  \n\n***(actually it was bad because low pickrate --> more mains simply because everyone else refuses to play that champ--> less noobs playing him-->automatically boosting the winrate high but yet his winrate was always barely beneath 55%)\n\nEDIT: And the thing you wrote about the consitution is most likely right, but I can't confirm any of it because it's not much of a big deal here in europe. So I will just ignore it since I don't anything from it.

It's like saying \"only people who've played Pokemon games agree that Pokemon games are good\". Like, no shit people who have experience, typically positive, with something will like it.\n\n> The problem with statistics are that they exactly work like that: A small amount of player base means usually that only their mains play that champ. \n\nThe fact he had a small pickrate with a decently good winrate is proof that he was balanced.\n\n> To come back to Aatrox in terms of statistics: You said in an earlier post that he was unpopular not bad or kept bad (or someone else said that idk anymore its somewhere above).

You can see the spikes on the graphs.\n\n> Now, statistics with small playerbases aren't always reliable. \n\nThat's a decent argument, but his pickrate was much larger than Mordekaiser who seems that problem very often. Aatrox's winrate was mostly stable, unlike Mordekaiser who saw fluctuation.\n\n> EDIT: And the thing you wrote about the consitution is most likely right, but I can't confirm any of it because it's not much of a big deal here in europe.

All statistical data shows Aatrox was very much balanced for almost a year and otherwised forced as underpowered. At no point, besides release, was Aatrox ever an issue statistically. Thus, the \"too strong or too weak\" argument fails, because there is **zero evidence** to support it, as Aatrox was in fact balanced during seasons 7 and 8.\n\n> I'm suprised you haven't heard about it, but I think that was one of the main reasons why riot reworked him\n\nI heard.

Warwick is more melee than Aatrox has ever been, but they still changed his passive to heal alot less if he is high on health and more if he is low. Because now he actually has a window in which you can say \"I should use ignite **now** to reduce his healing\".\n\nSame with Swain. His old ultimate made him a drain tank, being able to heal constantly. This got changed, his ultimate now has a meaningful cooldown and he can heal from his passive and W, which requires him to land skillshots.\n\nAccept it, Riot is removing the drain tanks from the game and this is a good thing in my book.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2019-02-07T14:44:24.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I hope adcs get removed from the game soon then. \n\nRightclicking from range to draintank with Bork and BT has no counterplay and should be removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-02-07T20:57:19.085+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something that dies instantly from any kind of burst whatsoever can hardly be described as a drain tank, imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2019-02-08T01:45:18.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Reminds me of the meme that ADCs \"draintanked\" tanks, and that justified Thornmail fucking bruisers.\n\nFuck this balance team and their shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-02-08T15:39:29.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All they literally had to do, was make thornmail work only against ranged users, therefore bruisers would not be fucked.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iv iron iv","date":"2019-02-08T07:49:54.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"aatrox has been overpowered ever since his rework, they nerf him once, still hella strong, nerf him twice, still hella strong, nerf him 3 times, still hella strong, get rid of his jgling potential, still hella strong, gets rid of his 2nd e, OMG HES SO FUCKING BAD EVERYONE OMGOMGOMGOM HES SO BADD NOWW OMGGG, how about you just, not use your e until they flash or something because his kit basically cc locks you in one place so you can hit all 3 qs unless your literally bronze pretty easily..","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2019-02-09T00:53:45.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"talking about pre-rework.
