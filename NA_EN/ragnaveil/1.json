No one likes dealing with Cait and her critting headshots, Jinx and her passive + Rocket Crits, Trynd and his RNG crit chance, and Yas' crit chance doubler. Its just not fun and not fair to really fight against unless you can have the same feats, which if we are keeping to originality, no one else really has anything that matches them. The only champ that doesn't have stuff like this that tries to use crit to their advantage if regular standard builds fail is Riven, due to her passive gaining tons of power from this stat increasing rune system (aka Conq giving AD per stack, Trans giving AD per 1% extra CDR, Gathering giving AD per 10 minutes, etc) paired with her R1. Crit got nerfed into the dumpster (then resurrected) because it made ADCs the best at damage period, making everyone second dog to them.\n\nMy idea is that instead of doubling your auto's damage, it increases your auto's damage based on how much crit you have. The calculation of the auto damage is where it gets tricky. I don't want ADCs doing 0 damage to tanks, but at the same time I don't want them to punch through tanks with ease. The middle ground is what im trying to figure out.\n\nNumbers and items would have to be tuned, but a rough estimate on how that would work could be something like this:\nStandard Build is IE + 2 crit items. What those two crit items are is up to the user to build per the situation.\n10% crit = 10% increased auto damage\nIE's passive would give up to 40% extra crit (gained by having two other complete crit items)\nCrit items give 20% crit max. glove still give 10%.\nAS crit items will gain 20 AD on completion (Zeal is 10) (just like how Tri gives 5% ms on completion).\n(These are not exact, they do require tuning so ADCs avoid getting shafted too hard like what Riot did previously)\n\nThis way, it makes it fair to ADCs and other crit users to not pray to RNJesus for a crit till they max out crit, but at the same time doesn't make crit super strong. Making it a 3 item core allows the users to be able to grab two non crit items for the situation instead of being shelved to one. AD stat growths on ADCs may or may not have to get upped.\n\nAt the same time, it alleviates the headache of being unable to really mitigate crit damage (omen does a bit of work, but is easily nullified by a LW or BC), as the users who make the most out of it (Cait, Trynd, Yas, Jinx) will be given adjustments and changes around it. This does mean ADCs might have to build a LW to deal with tanks, but at least they can build another damage item with it instead of that filling the last build slot (which made crit have to be strong). The possibly of more unique and different builds would exist, but i'd leave that to the community to explore. This change does open up crit to more users than just ADCs at the same time, making it a general stat instead of a mainly ADC centered stat.\n\nEDIT: Its to also prevent ADCs from becoming Judge, Jury, and Executioner like they were during the \"Tank\" meta. They are slowly creeping on it, and all it takes is one or two changes. So what if the first \"20-25 minutes\" is decided by mid top and jg? Its not just because your lane is the weakest, therefore they camp it, its because you are also the strongest lane at the same time, dictating the result of the game. This is the very meta that existed with tank meta, yet who was it that got blamed for it? Oh thats right, tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-09-23T18:32:05.945+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Like, hear me out.

To kill another ADC they need something like 5-10 AAs, and RNG somewhat evens itself out during this fight.\n\n> Current crit paired with armor shredding/ignoring effects just makes for not very resistible damage. Doing this change also reduces the \"Botlane diff\" problem by making snowballing ADCs a bit more tolerable to deal with.\n\nSo you suggest replacing, say, 75% crit with +75% aa damage? That results in literally the same overall damage, how is this suddenly \"more resistible\" or \"less snowballing\"?\n\n\"Botlane diff problem\" happens because \n1) losing bot means getting 2 enemies fed and getting 2 teammates underleveled/underfarming \n2) kill possibilities are much more frequent there, getting out of position will much more certainly get you killed if there are 2 enemies rather then 1 \n3) fed botlane is much harder to shutdown with ganks because its 3v2 instead of 2v1 on a regular lane, if those 2 are fed they can kill all 3 enemies, and even if they can't, botlane is shorter and easier for people to avoid incoming ganks\n4) roaming (either normal or TP) was nerfed in a lot of different ways(TP nerfed, midlane roaming mages had their waveclear nerfed, plating gives enemy free gold if you roam), so losing botlane is less likely to get help from other lanes\n\n\"Not very resistible damage\" is there so that ADC can kill tanks effectively without murdering everyone else.\nIt works like this:\n1) We have 5k hp 300 armor tank. To kill him enemies need to deal 15k physical damage. Lets decide on the fact that ADC deals 10k of that damage(everything else is from the teammates) and that such tank should die under the focus of the team in 5 seconds. This means that ADC has to deal 10k damage in 5 seconds or 2k damage/sec\n2) We have 1.6k hp 50 armor non-tank. He will die after taking 2.4k damage. If he has such \"luck\" to be near the ADC we just looked at, he will die in 1.2 seconds. Just from ADC damage alone. This effectively makes ADCs not \"anti-tank\", but \"anti-everything\" like before first ADC item rework\nTo make sure this don't happen, Riot made some items, runes and spells that work better against tanks.
