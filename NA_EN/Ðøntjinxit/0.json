But I was just disconnected from game and my client crashed and I was forced to re-install due to client issues, anyways point being i got leaver-buster for 5 games when it's 100% RIOTS FAULT!!! Is there any way to speak directly to someone? Or is there anyways to show proof that it's their fault? Honestly love this game, but this is unacceptable to punish players for riot garbage client update. {{champion:76}}","replies":[{"poster":"Alendj13","date":"2017-05-22T03:56:35.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah it happens but riot wont do anything about it. Same thing happened to me but i also lost LP and got a leaver buster, but they told me it was my computer or networks fault. Get used to it, honestly I love the game and have played for years but the service to players that are unrightfully wronged is just horrible, they wont do anything they will blame it on your equipment and never on their game that needs to be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"SadKill","date":"2017-05-22T15:27:15.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that they won't, it's that they can't. A lot of network issues (and I mean A LOT) are out of Riot's control. They can try to get good connections everywhere but there's always places, ISPs or other random factors that make connection issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-05-22T14:31:04.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection issues aren't caused by the client.  The client can close completely once you're in game, and have no effect on your game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T04:22:46.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned that you were disconnected from the game you were playing, which is a pretty big signal that your network lost it's connection to the servers. Regardless of what the main reason was, be it ISP issues or otherwise, that connection was lost. It's pretty shitty that your client also had some corrupted files in it, which is what caused it to re-install. The client noticed that it wouldn't be able to run correctly because of those damaged files, and if it let you back in you would have crashed out of the game. Typically those corrupted or damaged files are also caused by an interrupted connection during patching. \n\nAll in all, these symptoms are all pretty indicative of network issues. It doesn't mean that your internet sucks, but the internet is a fickle mistress. Sometimes she can't get that connection through to specific servers, it's just a fact of the internet. Nothing is perfect. With that being said, you're going to need to run through some steps to troubleshoot those [**connection issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) first.","replies":[]}]}
