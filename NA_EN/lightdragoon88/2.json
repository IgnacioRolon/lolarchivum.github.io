These champions were taken out of rotation and stayed out for a very long time, especially Evelynn. Riot didn't \"forget\" about doing this, they do it for a certain reason. This reason? It's going to sound conspiratorial, but the evidence supports that they're removed so Riot can justify completely ruining some core identity to their design/character with data showing how infrequently they're played and how so many people don't even know what said champion can do. At least, this was their justification for Karma's changes.\n\nYorick is in a unique position with this dilemma though. Unlike Karma who was built around the concept of duality and calculated aggression (something she no longer has any relation to), Yorick's main identity was the concept of a minion summoner that didn't work because Riot doesn't have a proper interface/programming to allow true control of minions. So Yorick's \"minions\" ended up just being vessels for spell effects, and not much else.\n\nWhat does this mean for Yorick? Well, it means that if they actually try to stick to their constant promises of \"keeping the same concept\" for these reworks (which usually doesn't work, or they focus on the wrong concept idea that they made up one morning), there's not really any mechanics that need to be kept. About the only thing people would really be upset about with a Yorick rework is if he completely abandons the notion of being a minion summoner, if Riot decides to turn him into a mage instead of a bruiser, or they replace his Ult with something else entirely.\n\nNow, that doesn't change *why* Riot removed him from rotation (to skew data in their favor for drastic change), but at least in Yorick's case, it shouldn't actually hurt his identity too much. Well, at least not as badly as Karma was, at any rate.","replies":[{"poster":"kaltenashes","date":"2016-01-29T00:23:08.643+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"~~if you wanna have fun playing a 2 champs in 1~~, cough, i mean MOV SPEED {{champion:133}} \n\nchamps update team \"**we'll preserve what you love, promise**\"... unless what you love is what we want to remove","replies":[{"poster":"ForeverLaxx","date":"2016-01-29T03:49:47.332+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much.

Won some games, lost some. \n\nWhat really drew me into him was his ultimate. Honestly, when you look at just his ultimate, not his basics, I think its one of the best ultimates in the game.  Because its on Yorick and 70% of the player base doesn't even know he exists, nobody knows what it even does. I literally have to tell my ADC \"No, don't run away if you die with my ult, go fight, its not a Zilean ultimate!\" Its great for splitpushing and taking towers too.\n\nI think thematically he's great. The Gravedigger, Yorick Mori. Busts his ass on the Shadow Isles doing the dirty work. An every man. He definitely needs his background _fleshed_ out a little more, but I hope he doesn't change much. His voice acting is also some of the best in the game, in my opinion. Its a shame he doesn't have more lines. Go listen to it (because you've probably never heard it before), tell me it doesn't sound awesome. It fits him perfectly.\n\nHis problem really lies in his basic abilities. They lack oomph. There's no real skill or thought involved in using them other than blocking skillshots with his W, that's the best. Blocking a blitzgrab or Ahri charm with his ghoul is badass. His passive makes him more of a juggernaut in my opinion, and I hope that's where Riot takes his rework. \n\nI have faith though, I know Riot will treat Mr. Mori right.  {{champion:83}}","replies":[]}]}
