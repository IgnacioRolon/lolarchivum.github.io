After this, Yi will get his passive hit every other attack for a total of 2.5 AD and 4 on-hit applications every two hits. The first 3 AAs will have a total 3.5 AD(remember divided by 3 AAs) ratio and apply 6 on-hit applications(3 AAs, one passive hit, 2 sated procs). I'm not really sure how this will interact with his passive counter after the first three hits because it might not count up until after his passive strike.\n\nRegardless of how it will work after stacking(maybe every hit, maybe not) this means that a Yi that attacks someone 5 times(2 seconds at AS cap) would apply 600%AD worth of AA damage and 10 on-hit applications. This might open up on-hit bruiser builds to him again, but it will definitely make the best scaling assassin who can also bust tanks if not locked down or burst down. 10 on-hits in 2.5 seconds will reset Qs cd if you have somewhere shy of 20% cdr.

What about {{champion:11}} and his true damage E?\n\nedit: The terminology and stack gains have been altered. A Takedown is a kill or assist. Currently Devourer grants 2 stacks for a takedown on a champ, and 1 stack for a large monster kill (not assists).\n\nThe new language reduces the champion takedown bonus to 1, increases epic monster takedowns (kills+assists) to 5, and 1 stack for takedowns (includes assists again) for large monsters.\n\nIt seems to me the new item will benefit greatly from killing Dragon because assists count.\n\nAs you know, WW is more than capable of taking Dragon solo at very early points in the game. Doing so with Devourer would benefit him greatly because +5 magic damage. Also, this mechanic would greatly benefit having multiple devourers on a team because everyone wielding a Devourer enchantment would get +5 stacks assuming they participated in the takedown.\n\nThe bonus damage on every other AA is kinda wonky. I really don't see why its like that.\n\nIn any event, I agree this is a huge buff to {{champion:19}} \n\n\"Unique Passive - Phantom Hit: Every other basic attack will trigger a phantom attack that triggers all on hit effects a second time.\"\n\nThis is broken beyond all compare.
