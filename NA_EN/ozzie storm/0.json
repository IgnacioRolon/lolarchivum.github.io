For players that would experience Bugsplats upon opening the app, we believe we have found the root issue. We had not accounted for players who may have special characters in their computer username (e.g. D@NK M3M3S). We've fixed this particular issue so that it works with all usernames. While we understand this may be a hassle, it'd be great if you could redownload (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/league-displays) the app and let us know if you're still experiencing this issue or not. To clarify, you will need to redownload and reinstall for this to work.\n\nIf you're experiencing issues not related to special characters, please let us know! We're monitoring threads and trying to provide updates as quickly as possible. Additionally, you can check out our FAQ (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207525756) where we'll be posting updates to major bugs as they come in. Lastly, definitely continue to send us your feedback! We're listening and trying to find solutions for everything!\n\n P.S. you don't have to download from the NA website but I can only link to one place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peterko","date":"2017-12-09T14:59:13.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here","replies":[]},{"poster":"Izendel","date":"2017-12-08T17:16:30.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreamR","date":"2017-12-07T21:56:33.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem as well.
