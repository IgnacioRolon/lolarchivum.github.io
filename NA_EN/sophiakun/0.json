Don't want to wait that long to earn the IP for all the champs you want? Buy RP. Bundles and sales are the best way to obtain things in the long run, so if you can wait for the sales, do it! If you really want the champion/skin now, it's your choice to get it for the full price. There is a starter bundle that consists of some of the cheaper champions along with XP and IP boosts to help you. Just because champions have different prices doesn't mean any cheaper champion is any less effective than the more expensive champions. You can also earn key fragments (which combine into keys) and chests to open (by obtaining S rank) to get champion and skin shards, which you can use several of to unlock champions/skins.\n\nLucky for you, Annie is a 450 IP champion, relatively easy to play, and fairly strong (in my opinion). She can be quickly obtained for free, and is completely worth the purchase!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T02:00:22.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have been looking at the [**weekly free rotation**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation/new-free-champion-rotation-caitlyn-kled-lissandra-and-more) that changes each week.
