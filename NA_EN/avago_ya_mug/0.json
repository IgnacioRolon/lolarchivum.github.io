This causes the selection part to freeze for me which makes me unable to choose a champion. If i already locked in before the message and the game would have went to the load screen, i can close out of the window and restart league and join in on the game... no idea why it is doing that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T19:41:44.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reinstalling may not necessarily solve this if the issue is network related.  I suggest starting with the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot anything blocking your connection from holding tight to the game servers.  Test it out in custom games, and let me know how it goes!","replies":[]}]}
