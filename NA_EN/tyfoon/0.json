All that matters is whether or not what you said was - in and of itself - considered unacceptable.\n\nIt's not a contest to see who was \"less bad.\" When it comes to toxicity, the only person you're competing against is yourself, and the only measure that matters is Riot's standards.\n\n> I don't sit idly by while someone spews hatred at me for literally no reason.

But active avoidance isn't the same as counter-attacking.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Allow me to be extremely clear, here:\n\n**By itself**, this log doesn't quite seem to be worth a 2-week ban. It's extremely doubtful, however, that this was the only game where you exhibited toxicity (in large part because the system tends to require a fair number of reported games before it bothers with mild-moderate toxicity).\n\nI think it's reasonable to assume that if further logs were available, we'd see more of the same - enough more to warrant a ban.","replies":[{"poster":"tyfoon","date":"2015-08-06T20:47:56.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be honest, i really am not toxic.

Jubbinaut likes to come on the forum suck riot's dick like he's going to get free RP for it or something. \n\nThis is exactly what i feel like is wrong with the system, it takes being toxic and punishing for it way out of context. It's literally boiled down to bantering and defending yourself as being punishable now. To me, you weren't being toxic. You were sarcastically responding to their true toxicity and trolling without cussing or calling them names. This is why i miss the tribunal, it was actually very, very reliable. May have taken a while to get things done, but it was extremely fair. \n\nThe automated system is a joke. Did you deserve to be banned for this? no. not in my opinion what so ever. I'm in your exact same boat, kid. But just so you know, everything is completely automated. Like not reviewed. I was banned before by the automated system instantly- no review of my account- falsely reported, because it's been proven it doesn't actually scan for words like riot claimed, it's literally adding up numbers of reports and punishing people for them, and rioters don't even review the bans. \n\nSo as everyone seems to say, it'd be best to not speak at all to avoid false reports. or as sky williams says, DST: dick-sucking-theory. suck their dicks and pretend everything is peachy.
