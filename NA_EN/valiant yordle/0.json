Is this a legitimate strategy? If it won&#039;t get me banned, dodging que could absolutely help in ranked. Hell, even if it made you lose a little lp, it&#039;d still be a useful tool if it didn&#039;t do anything else, but Sa&igrave;nt makes it sound like it doesn&#039;t even do that. Riot, is dodging que supposed to be there as an option for avoiding trolls and people who make terrible pick choices for the team comp? Because sometimes there are games that you know for a fact are going to be un-winnable or not fun at all, just in champion select.","replies":[{"poster":"Curling Veigar","date":"2015-04-30T15:41:50.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":11,"body":"plat V isnt something you should be taking advice from; they suck at this game","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2015-04-30T15:43:04.038+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is that even a thing to be said?","replies":[{"poster":"Curling Veigar","date":"2015-04-30T15:50:15.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Strawberrycocoa,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hEFV4E0T,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-04-30T15:43:04.038+0000)\n>\n> How is that even a thing to be said?\n\nDodging can be beneficial. Only sometimes. Usually if you have a troll champ select wait till the last second to dodge cuz chances are someone else will do it before then. Try to limit one dodge per day so you only lose 3 points. I only dodge if we lost in champ select or if there are trolls/ I didn't get my Veigar","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2015-04-30T16:07:54.354+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant how is, \"Plat V sucks at the game\" a thing to be said?\n\nBronzelord here, y'all are basically demigods to me.
