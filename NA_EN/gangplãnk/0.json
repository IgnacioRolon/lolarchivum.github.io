Now I&#039;m going to rant here. I AM a toxic player, but only when I have a Teemo support with no support Items in my Ranked Promos. Especially when this Teemo support refused to build support item and refused to help the team (not grouping or warding objectives). AND ACCORDING TO RIOT GAMES THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND BAN WORTHY. But in recent years, Riot&#039;s reporting system seems to care less about griefing and intentionally feeding summoners than they care about toxicity. According to Riot games this is totally unacceptable. It seems like this billion dollar company promotes intentional feeders in the community (which is as pathetic as their matchmaking). \r\nThis is not what the rant is only about.\r\nBanning summoners is NOT the way to cure toxicity in case this shit company noticed. 1st of all the system of searching for intentional feeders should not be implemented. I&#039;d rather have AN ACTUAL EMPLOYEE AT A RIOT GAMES SERVER WATCH THE REPLAY OF THAT GAME AND DO THEIR JOB! (only if 3 people reported that specific player), this would be a lot more beneficial for the community and employees at riot can actually do something to fix their broken community. I strongly believe that there should be NO bans for toxic Summoners, only chat restrictions. I know that there are chat restrictions, but how come I have never gotten it. Just permanently chat ban me from all games. But NO your unfair system decides to ban me for 2 weeks over and over.\r\nI have 2 acquaintances and 3 friends that are as toxic as I am but have never gotten banned for 2 weeks, instead they have received that chat restriction, SO WHY CAN&#039;T I?? What kind of cheap system is being run by 1.6 Billion dollar company? Can you not afford better coders or people to do their job? This is pathetic. For anyone else that has something to say that i might be toxic and that I suck at the game. I am toxic towards troll picks, but I cover it with a 80% winrate in my ranked game.","replies":[{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2017-12-17T10:10:32.330+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a 52% winrate and the teemo placed the most wards in your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Gangpl達nk","date":"2017-12-17T11:33:51.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The 52% was from  my total ranked games, I went from a 30 something %  to 52% in the matter of the end of s7","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-12-17T17:23:14.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So how is Teemo not grouping or building how you want against Riot's rules?\n\nNo, Riot still punishes griefers and trolls after determining the intent. They don't want to punish for a bad game. Chat is easier to monitor and punish.\n\nSo you want to waste a lot of peoples time with 3 reports for a manual int review? You may wonder \"why would that waste time?\" simple, what happens when people beg for reports and it happens? It goes to get reviewed, and turns out it was just a bad game.\n\nIf you skip chat restrictions you probably use hate speech or other 0 tolerance phrases. It also shows you were reported. Your friends might be as toxic but not say those same things and therefore progress normally.\n\nHow does one determine a troll pick? Outside of disco Nunu. Had a Zed jungle yesterday. It actually went pretty well. But he normally isn't there so was it a troll pick?\n\nEveryone is subject to punishment for toxicity if reported, no matter how good at the game they are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-17T11:25:33.533+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They currently do manual reviews when someone is reported a lot.\n\nThey do not punish flaming harder than trolling, flaming gets you 2 tiers of chat restrictions before the 14 day ban and trolling gets you a 14 day ban or perma ban first time.\n\nThey have tried something similar to permanent chat restrictions in the past. It failed because most of the people affected turned to gameplay toxicity.\n\nIf you skipped the chat restriction tiers then you probably used racist terms, hate speech, or encouragemwnt of self harm, which are zero tolerance.\n\nI did this hastily, did I miss any major points?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CamilleRule34","date":"2017-12-17T09:37:55.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">80% win rate in my ranked game\n\nsure ok buddy","replies":[{"poster":"Gangpl達nk","date":"2017-12-17T10:02:15.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well due to that last game I am actually sitting on a 70% winrate.\nAnd don't hit me with a tobias fate reference.","replies":[{"poster":"CamilleRule34","date":"2017-12-17T10:13:58.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShotgunBoi,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sE1PHoRI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-17T10:02:15.063+0000)\n>\n> Well due to that last game I am actually sitting on a 70% winrate.\n> And don&#x27;t hit me with a tobias fate reference.\n\nWhat the fuck no one said anything about tobias fate.\n\nYou must be either shit at math or basing your data on 10 games?\n\nBecause losing one game making you drop 10% means there was only 10 games total.\n\nYou're saying your games basically went from\n\nWWWWLWWWWL\n\nto WWWLLWWWL.\n\nlike wut","replies":[{"poster":"Gangpl達nk","date":"2017-12-17T10:15:32.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"First of all, stop talking like a child, second of all, I'm talking about my recent 20 games of ranked according to op.gg.\nI had not given you the total amount of games played so maybe you can chill out and act like an adult or go back focusing in your studies at school.
