A very important part of playing zed is using his ult to dodge abilities, but as of right now there are some abilities that still connect while he is \"invulnerable.\" 2 of the most noteworthy are fizz's ult, and morgana's ult. Fizz's ult still does damage, while morg's ult does damage AND SNARES while you're untargetable.... This is huge problem for the aspiring zed mains and players out on the rift. Thanks  {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-07-16T08:07:05.524+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the other awesome posters here have mentioned, becoming un-targetable is not the same as invincible. Things like Fiddlesticks Drain and Morgana ultimate work properly with abilities like this. They've already latched onto you and you didn't really go anywhere. You're just immune to new effects.","replies":[]},{"poster":"High Lord Blaze","date":"2014-07-16T01:03:41.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure the Morg ult thing isn't a bug (Vlad can't dodge it either, even if he pools, but it won't work if Morg ults AFTER Vlad is in his pool), but I dunno about Fizz. I know that if Lux tries to bind you and you ult her, you go through the binding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nebuul","date":"2014-07-15T21:55:37.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK, untargetable will not help you if an ability has already been launched, nor will it save you from AOE.  All it means is that, while untargetable, you cannot be targeted with single-target abilities or attacks.\n\nSo, be sure you ult before fizz launches a fish or morgana shoots her root.  Otherwise, nothing you can do.  That is why some abilities specify untargetable *and* invulnerable.","replies":[]}]}
