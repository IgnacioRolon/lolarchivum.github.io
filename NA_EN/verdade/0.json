There would be counterplay to this in the sense that you could position so that Lulu can't hit you and the wave at the same time, giving you a chance to push her in and force her to use mana on waveclear/shields while you harass her under tower. Lulu is very weak to poke, so a good Ziggs or Xerath could still destroy her in lane. This would also give her more identity as a poke based support, instead of the confused W/R bot she often ends up playing as. This would also let her stand a chance against other popular poke supports, since to hit them or the ADC, Lulu would likely have to Q from an E-ed minion, giving a chance to trade back because she blew two spells for the damage of one.\n\n(deleted previous comment because mobile is being funky and I replied to wrong comment!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-01-12T17:33:25.947+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Edit: I might as well ask, why are support items cluttered with gold-sink stats?

If you keep them low health it makes it risky for them to go all in, especially if you deny them vision.

XD When he dies because of it you'll have more push/poke to be able to protect the turret under siege better and buy your own jungler time to make it to bot and save the turret.
