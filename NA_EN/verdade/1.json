His kit missed the mark both thematically and mechanically. Aatrox was supposed to be demon who mind controls warriors on battlefield to sink into bloodlust and leads them to victory. Bloody victory, that is. Lore just screams OFFENSIVE SUPPORT, but for whatever reason, he was made as solo laner. \r\nMechanically, he is either too tanky and dealing 0 damage or he&#039;s full glass cannon who dies to first CC. There&#039;s no middle ground where he can use his lifesteal efficiently. This has something to do with his healing being too reliable, so adding more power makes him just too oppressive.\r\n\r\n{{champion:50}} - According to lore he&#039;s extremely determined and efficient general, master tactican and stuff. There are like 2 sentences about his bird, but nothing that seems imporant. In-game we got demon-possesed bitter man with all of his abilities centered around his birdo/demon. What. Also, what is even more weird, lore portraits him as front-line fighter (his duel with Jarvan back on crystal scar?!). So is he brilliant general or man/demon frontline fighter?\r\n\r\n{{champion:7}} - supposed to be using deception and trickery to win. Her passive and W already do this but its too defensive. She&#039;s extremely straight-forward offensive wise. She literally throws herself at her enemies... is this something she should do?\r\nAlso, her passive has much more potential. What if LB gained health equal to damage taken by her clone (only when clone dies by damage), or if her clone accumulated damage taken, reflecting it back to attackers when it dies? Of course they would need direct impact of her abilities to allow this, but it would be VERY cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-26T11:42:02.866+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":37,"body":"Riven was suppose to have a combo-oriented, fluid kit inspired by fighting games.

Its the go to mechanic for comboing in general in fact. If anything, I wish they made her combos slightly harder, in which that you can still animation cancel, but your timing has to be perfect like in a actual fighting game. And I'm talking near frame perfection here. And if you miss, you are forced to complete her entire recovery frames before you can make another action.

As someone else said on the boards last night (that I can't remember the name of, sorry): Her entire kit is just lumps of jade frankly. Her W has the potential to be fascinating, but gameplay-wise it feels pretty janky. Her Q is such a bland mechanic - skillshot that does AOE damage when it lands, and, when Mantra'd, the exact same thing, but more damage. Her Mantra'd E in fact was my favorite part of her kit until the shield-bomb was removed, despite it doing virtually no damage (and even less when you played her in the support role).

It will also pop when it reaches max rank, making it possible to manipulate where it lanks (this can be useful for stealing, zoning, harassing, and clearing waves).\n\nI admit her W on its own is rather bland, but the way it combos with her passive makes it even more vital to keep it on an enemy during fights.\n\nHer E still has interesting uses for team shields/movespeed buffs, though I miss being able to use it on minions (made each minion tank 1-2 extra turret shots, which was great for pushing.  Ofc could also be used to deny cs which was fairly unique to her).\n\nHer ult has a little trick of its own that not many people seem to realize.  The buff from it lasts 10 seconds, but the cooldown starts as soon as you activate the ability, not when another ability is amplified.  Thus, if you know you're going to want to Mantra an ability in the next few seconds, you can activate it early to have it up a bit sooner later on.  This is fairly situational though, as the opponents can see you activate Mantra if you're visible, and then back off.\n\nWhile her abilities individually can be rather plain, she does have interesting interaction with her abilities to her passive/ult and back again.  There are some other little aspects of her, but as their uses become increasingly situational, I'll end this here (unless someone asks for some more).","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-08-26T23:14:13.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, I main Karma, I personally find her fun to use, just in need of some modification if we want her to actually feel better to use.
