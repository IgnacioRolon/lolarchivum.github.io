Please, tell me how we are supposed to play with this now, and why we should have to pay money to transfer out of the NA servers, as well as not be able to play with our NA friends anymore.. it&#039;s ridiculous.. \r\n\r\nwe spent so much time and effort on our NA accounts because we were willing to sacrifice having good ping to being able to play with good friends, but there&#039;s no longer a reason to sacrifice, because our ping is basically preventing us from playing with those friends.. \r\n\r\nPlease riot, offer us a transfer, or some other way for us to be able to play again..","replies":[]}
