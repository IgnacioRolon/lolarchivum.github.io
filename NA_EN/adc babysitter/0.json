Seeing that the person who has all my personal information, passwords, blah blah blah, I create a new gmail and start deleting all the keys of the previous gmail so that the person who hacked me there or what he has done to enter me email and in my LoL account I did not know more information and all the important information was moved to a new gmail account (which I will not say for fear of the same thing happening) and that is why I need someone to give me instructions to change the gmail and the password without the other person seeing it since i tried to change the password but it does not leave me since the other character says no to the password confirmation. I need help because I am very scared because I have valuable things and I put money in this account.\n\nRito Pls i need answers.","replies":[{"poster":"ADC Babysitter","date":"2017-12-14T22:34:00.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not know if I explain myself well but since I saw someone enter my gmail and enter my LoL account I'm very nervous","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T02:32:41.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries friend!
