It sounds like the issue is with your ISP (or multiple ISPs) with peak traffic and their ability to manage those loads. It's best to contact your ISP if you encounter further issues with a Tracert to Riot's servers.\n\ntl;dr: think roads and destination. If there's traffic, you'll move more slowly to the destination. With the way that the servers are set up, it's unlikely that the bottleneck will occur at the server and more likely along the route.

The path latency is in the Latency column and is seen on the last hop. For yours it is hop 12 and shows 15 ms. This particular trace-route program does a lot more than just trace-route such as pull rDNS and GeoLocation Data. The \"Trace Route Completed\" at the bottom is a combined time of all of those services together. This does not mean your connection is bad. rDNS can take time to load. GeoLocation data is horribly inaccurate (which is why it shows Europe) and often shows wrong data, not to mention it takes time to get that bad data. If you run a ping at the same time your ping will match the last hop in the OVTR trace, latency column, as seen here: http://i.imgur.com/fQBlFT6.png\n\nTelia does not just operate in Europe.
