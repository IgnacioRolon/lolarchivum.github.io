I have tried to piece together as many maps and bits of information together as I could possibly find so that I can attempt to host a game of Dungeons and Dragons within this world. \r\n\r\nI know the fan powered wiki has many tidbits of helpful information like the lore of the lands and it is pretty up-to-date. I get the general idea of what the world looks like with the map of Piltover trade routes combined with the territory map of the Freljord. I also kind of see outdated references to the older map where all of Runeterra was just a circle and with some islands that can still be incorporated. These combined with all the wonderful backstories and art make the Runeterra seem just developed enough to play in. Being a DM for a campaign within Ionia, exploring the magic lei lines, or being the forward party of a Noxious war band annexing a city, the possibilities are nigh endless.\r\n\r\nI know having a map is not the most important part of a D&amp;D campaign, but if nothing else it makes it more fun as the DM to be inspired to make a crazy awesome quest.\r\n\r\nSo TL;DR I want the world map so I can make a D&amp;D campaign.

Several continents on Earth have connected points, just as Shurima and Valoran are connected at Zaun/Piltover.\n\nMore maps will come, though a world map or globe is probably a loooong ways off - it'd be more honest to say we have no plans to release one at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-05-04T19:50:47.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get even the vaguest of hints as to what the Shuriman continent is like?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-05-04T22:37:48.900+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chromatic Eagle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=iuRsF9RU,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-04T19:50:47.488+0000)\n>\n> Can we get even the vaguest of hints as to what the Shuriman continent is like?\n\nCan you elaborate what you mean by when you ask what it's like?  \n\nThe Medarda Heirloom map (the Piltover one) shows the entire Northern coast of the continent - from Kalamanda to Mudtown.  (One could argue that Aurma is part of the continent,and you'd be right, but it's not part of the coast :) )","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-05-04T22:44:49.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, it's climate?

Awe inspiring in the sort of way that means you might be about to die and no-one will ever find a corpse.  Also, 'epic' is another keyword, in the sense of scale.\n\nClimate wise, it obvs. has the largest desert currently known, but outside of that it varies dramatically.  Some parts, you'd be lucky to find 3 days in a row without precipitation.\n\nSeems almost cheating to consider Piltover and Zaun so representative of Valoran - as it's the junction between the two.  I bet stuffy Piltover scholars argue over which continent they're part of all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Majestic Emu","date":"2017-05-05T01:02:26.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just all that right there is super duper helpful.
