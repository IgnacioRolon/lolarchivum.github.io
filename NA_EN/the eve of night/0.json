I won&#039;t be playing League of Legends this patch or any future patch until jungle diversity is restored. I just can&#039;t be bothered. I don&#039;t find any of the early dueling champions fun and I will not gimp my teammates because I want to make Evelynn work.

I&#039;ve had a lot of fun over the years but...I can&#039;t bring myself to thank them for anything at the moment. I&#039;ll get over it eventually but I still won&#039;t be playing.

Unless you really didn't give a damn about that game and was just wasting your time pretending like League doesn't matter to you anymore.

Do not treat it as such.\n\nYou didn't manage your expectations and think that you, as a player, has the ability to make changes to League on a level of developers by simply asking for them on their forums. Riot doesn't work for you, it's their game. And i also urge you to recheck your statement about \"Riot not caring about the community\" when you have replays, runes, new client, practice mode, etc. in the game - which are the direct results of us asking for it and them delivering (albeit a bit later). Then Marksmen adjustments in 8.10. 11 and 12, Fighter adjustments and new items, gold spread out from team gold to solo gold (solo cary potential) - everything that people yet again asked for.\n\nIt's funny how confirmation bias works.\nYou only remember when it's convenient for you to remember or if specifically your needs are being met. You're not the only player in this community, Riot has to work for the benefit of many, not few. The one who needs to pull their head out of their ass is frankly, you.\n\nAnd one more thing, the issues you speak of are a still under a big question mark because you still didn't elaborate what you think are the problems League faces/has.

At least have the common decency to know what you should and shouldn't be encouraging on the boards. If you want to express your displeasure in the direction League has gone in, be my guest but when you're writing such posts, you still need to understand that it shouldn't be written as an empty threat to Riot or talking shitabout them either.\n\nIf you want a discussion, it can't be about your feelings.\nIt has to be about the changes that you don't like so that people can tackle it from a few more different points of view.

No one asked you, no one cares, no one knows who you are. You could've as easily \"not cared\" in silence and it wouldn't have made a difference, except sparing the rest of us a headache.

Riot does this with every big rework or change they have planned. They did it with the assassin update, they are doing it with the ADC update and they did it with the jungle update.\n\nAnytime Riot says its going to do one thing you can expect them to pull a complete 180 and do the opposite,  their sense of balance is so twisted at this point they can't even tell what's a buff and what's a nerf anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-05-19T00:57:26.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot can nerf buff junfle items and monsters and ivern laughs because he will forever be uneffected by anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moon Mom","date":"2018-05-19T05:38:45.995+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tons of high elo players like sunset are doing just fine with eve though.
