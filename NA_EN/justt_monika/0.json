This is getting really annoying as I assume like everyone else, I set myself to away when I'm busy and don't want to be spammed with invites or messages. \n\nHas Riot even acknowledged this bug yet? There was a patch last night which I'm assuming fixed the collection bug, but this isn't been fixed yet? Why.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-10T21:20:13.764+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"We've were made aware of that Status button not working correctly shortly after the patch dropped, partly due to players reaching out to us and mostly because we couldn't change the status either xD!\n\nWe're still working on a fix, and I'll do my best to update all of you once I have more info!","replies":[{"poster":"Justt Monika","date":"2017-08-10T23:06:27.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding! I had to know, it was really bugging me, (no pun) because like I said, I along with so many others manually set yourself to \"Away\" on a day-to-day basis, and it's really tedious that we can't :<","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T03:48:17.900+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"No worries bud, I do the same myself which clued me in this morning! \n\nAlso, nice pun.

I know that in the past when you were away long enough the status would go to away and would revert back to online once you did anything in the client, so maybe there is a line of code messed up that keeps resetting the status to default of online?","replies":[]}]}
