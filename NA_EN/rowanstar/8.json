Also warwick uses his bare claws and straight up tears through everyone. he has pretty much no weakness because of his unbreakable wrath. I can see the case for Ornn being higher but altho he is strong, he uses his physical to amplify his magical power. I can understand your point about Galio. However the ones above him are amplified by rage and anger. For Braum, his shield raises his strength level and Galio is made of stone and can be broken. Id like to hear other ppls ideas and maybe I missed some champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-11-09T17:24:33.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean with how huge he is? In cinematic, he is not that huge compare to human. \n\nRenekton is bigger, by a lot, IMO.\n\nNasus could carry the sun priest with his fingers in his ultimate from in Bloodline story.

He has enough power to destroy continents if he is ever unbound. As is Sol, at the end of his lore the chains were weakening.  Bard is so powerful the universe wont even allow him to speak. Nasus and Renekton are up there, they are ascended demigods.
