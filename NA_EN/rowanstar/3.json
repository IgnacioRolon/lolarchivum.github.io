I think she would fit the theme well because I could just see a sleepy kitty in front of fire place when it is cold, or seeing Yuumi shoot Snowballs as her Q and R.\n\nI would also love to see the two sisters Morgana and Kayle back together as sisters. As much as they are sorta enemies it would be cool to see the sisters sharing a splash art together. Also seeing them interact with each other more friendly (instead of them being at each others throats all the time) for the holiday. They need to have some quality time together, they need to have some fun in the snow. Do they wanna build a snow man?\n\nThe last two I would love to see would be Gangplank and Twisted Fate. Both of them haven't had a new skin in a while and I think it would be cool to put them in the mix. Gangplank seems to be the type of guy who would enjoy a hot cup of coco by the fire (with Yuumi), and he could call a rain of snowballs as his R. Twisted Fate could change what he throws; a red tree ornament (red card), a blue snowball (blue card), and a um... yellow... snow cone (yellow card). If there are better ideas for his cards I'll take them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-11-07T19:54:07.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx already has a winter skin, Ambitious Elf, so she'd not get one anyway.\n\nAshe recently got High Noon.\n\nLucian recently got Demacia Vice.\n\nMorgana just got Majestic Empress\n\n\n--\n\nOrnn I definitely want for a Santa skin.\n\nJanna and Kayle are possibilities as Janna has yet to see one this year and Kayle hasn't gotten one after her update.","replies":[{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2019-11-08T14:39:56.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sukishoo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qtTt8Xna,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-11-07T19:54:07.581+0000)\n>\n> Jinx already has a winter skin, Ambitious Elf, so she'd not get one anyway.\n> \n> Ashe recently got High Noon.\n> \n> Lucian recently got Demacia Vice.\n> \n> Morgana just got Majestic Empress\n> \n> \n> --\n> \n> Ornn I definitely want for a Santa skin.\n> \n> Janna and Kayle are possibilities as Janna has yet to see one this year and Kayle hasn't gotten one after her update.\n\nOrnn as a reindeer with his jolly white beard.

Since we got Sugar Rush this year and Winter Wonder last year, we could do traditional Showdown next year and have it only be champs who fight eachother (Snowdown Showdown is the Santa/Elves/normal Xmas theme so they would all be dressed in red, green and fluffy white, or be xmas animals).\n\nHere is what they could do: have Morgana be dressed in a red dress with white frills, her energy is sparkly xmas green. Kayle can be wearing her usual tights and armor in red and snow white, with her sword being a candy cane (with a sharpened tip).\n\nNasus can be santa, white Renekton is basically Krampus.\n\nThen to Rengar vs Khazix: Rengar is white with either an ugly sweater or he could be a reindeer and Khazir can be gold and red with candy cane wings.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PurplePegasus","date":"2019-12-02T02:48:50.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rowanstar,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qtTt8Xna,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-07T15:48:14.204+0000)\n>\n> Of course I am stoked for the holiday season and part of that is the league skins and events for the Christmas Season.
