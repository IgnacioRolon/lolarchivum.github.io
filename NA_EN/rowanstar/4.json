Being one shot the whole games isnt fun. IDK how to deal with URF. The concept is fun but i dont get how ppl get so OP so fast.\n\nA lot of the problem is the objectives...i keep trying to tell people urf was not like the first time urf came out. if used to range from short to 40+ min back and fourth games...now 100% are 10-20 min stomps due to the op objectives.\n\nmost people seem to underestimate/forget them but gold,exp,stats from elder buff/baron.are huge.\n\nturret plating\nelder dragon\nbaron\nand even the cannon \n\nare speeding up the mode way more and causing snowballing. this effect from them is massive.\nand also is anti-fun.\n\nthe dragon being the biggest problem..\n\neach dragon gives a 20% damage swing, plus true burn damage, plus all the other stats. PER dragon is a lot of power to be given free at the 10 min mark of the game. add baron on top of that then its pretty ridiculous.\n\nthe objectives are turning 100% the games in to 10 min laning phase followed by a stomp and forced end at 20 or ff after dragon goes down. this is anti fun when the game is so heavily dictated from one objective at the 10 min mark. and this makes the mode a far cry of what urf used to be when they first released it.\n\nwhen you consider before elder was added to urf there was at least a chance for some of the games to make it past 30 min and to have to have some back and fourth fights on longer games. those were always the more fun games at least for me even if i lost..\n\nthe dragon and turrent plate is also warping the picks massively and limiting them a lot. as you need to pick strong laners so you can contest dragon get plates..people would be more willing to pick more weak lane champs/for fun picks. if the mode was a little longer or if they dident have to worry about contesting objectives or getting stomped so hard immediately once the other team gets an elder.\n\nthe pick warping from the short forced snowball games due to objectives is causing a lot people to complain...but most people ever acknowledge/realize that the objectives are making the mode way worse. \n\nthe sad thing is riot may even use these complaints as a reason to only do arurf from now on or worse not bring it back at all..rather then just remove the\nthe snowballing from the objectives.\n\nin the PBE people were telling riot that elder dragon was a problem and was anti fun and  the games were snowballing to hard..so i am not even sure why that was never addressed.\n\nthe forced objective interactions over op objective is also encouraging people to more competitive rather then to just have fun.that is not something you want for game mode that are just meant to be fun..\n\nthere is also the problem that since the mode is call ultra rapid fire people are under the impression all the game should be super short and decisive. however i believe that the mode would benefit a lot more fun wise if the games were less decisive/snowball and aimed for the 30-40 min range and to be a bit harder to close rather then 10-20min.\n\nthis could be done pretty simply by slowing gold maybe exp, removing or just delaying the snow ball objetives, and urfing up the towers(attack hp ect..) till it hits a later point in the game.THEN make the objective matter a bit more. so the game dont stall out after the 30-40 min mark.\n\nbut most would probably disagree since people think it need to be fast... even though earlier versions were a lot slower then it is now..","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2019-10-31T08:37:32.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yo honestly. baron is a meme.
