For one, they definitely don't give us a direct answer in the lore, and he has aspects of many different things. He's got to be a zombie, because he's physically real and litterally fucking slashes throats in bilgewater, right? Well yes, but actually no. He is physical but also..not physical..he can turn into a weird phasing thing that thinks it's a shark and honestly it's just weird and I don't like to think about it. Okay so if he's not a zombie then what, is he like a returned ghost like Mordekaiser? Welllll that doesn't really make sense either because for one how in the fuck would he escape daddy morde's land and for two he again has a somewhat physical body sooo..? So he's not dead, he just got his body and mind fucked with by fish magic? Well I don't know about you but he can do some REALLY WEIRD SHIT TO JUSTIFY VIA FISH MAGIC! \n\nI don't know what Pyke is, Riot doesn't know what Pyke is, and Pyke damn sure don't know what Pyke is\n\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"saphireflame123","date":"2019-08-10T06:36:43.125+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is a \"drowned\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-10T06:02:32.629+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"He's an undead.
