He is very sweet and loves belly rubs and being held. He has gotten real clingy, but the main thing is him playing really rough.\r\n\r\nWhenever i fill a cup with water he swats at my hand when i go to turn off the water. Then today as he was giving me face rubs, i kissed him and he bit me on the cheek and its a bit sore. This cat is nuts!\r\n\r\nHe is very rough when playing and bites down hard as if he is hunting food. I need to train him to be more gentle. But I love my kitty. He is so friendly and adorable and he acts like a kitten and im his parent, begging at me and following me everywhere. He wont even eat unless i pet and love on him first. Silly cat.","replies":[]}
