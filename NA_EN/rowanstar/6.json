I love how strong, angry and muscular he is. I like his VO as its simple as it should be. He is the champion I play when Im ticked at something or someone because it makes me feel like my rage has powerful effects (without irl consequences). Because of that, I have some suggestions for him moving forward.\r\n\r\nSkins: I suggest avoiding skins where he is heavily armored. A mighty minotaur needs no such things. Also it makes him look congested and overly bulky (looking at you Infernal and Conqueror). His best skins are his classic, Golden, Black, Unchained and Moo Cow. I say this because I love his theme of having no armor or clothing, just his chains, and his waist clamp thingy with some cloth. Moo Cow is great because he is hilarious and has kittens in the back animation. So for new skins, maybe tone down the heavy armor. Even if there are no more re-colors (which are some of my favorites: see Dark Crystal Ryze, Dreadknight Garen and several more) there are skin ideas which keep Alistar's mighty figure at the forefront of his theme and visuals and eschew any unneeeded armor (also avoid robot skins as they would downgrade him like Hextech did where instead of a muscular figure he is a big robot, although tech upgrade skins like SG would be fine as long as he isnt clothed to excess).  Maybe make chromas for his classic skin?\r\n\r\nFX: compare conqueror Ali's fx to the other skins and you see that he needs vfx and sfx updates to his Q and W and AA effects. They are outdated and still look like pre-VU Alistar fx. I would love for him to be in the next set of FX updates.\r\n\r\nThose are my thought on one of my favorite champions.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-28T05:24:08.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This best skin is his Longhorn skin, good sir, as he is a literal cowboy.","replies":[]}]}
