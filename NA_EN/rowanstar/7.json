At this moment I am using the basic runes that are pre-set and given for free. I know I will need to make customized runes eventually, but considering Ill need several of each rune type because of champ variety, ill focus on improving at stuff like farming and builds before i make my own runes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2019-09-06T04:32:57.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for yalls help.
