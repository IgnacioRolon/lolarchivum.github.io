A bit about us first, then you can read about what we want from you if you like what you see.\r\n\r\n1. This ranked team was made about 2 months ago\r\n2. Our previous mid had to demote himself to substitute due to work obligations as well as a busy personal life situation.\r\n3. We use skype to communicate in game. All team members are required to have working mics and be able to communicate in game \r\n4. We are looking to take the team in a more serious direction and because of that have implimented some rules that we all follow. Since implimenting these rules we have become much more successful as a team. The rules are:\r\n A. When in champ select only the people currently picking their champion are allowed to speak. If you need to communicate and it is not your turn to pick you must type your message out. This prevents people from talking over each other and causing some bad champion picks.\r\n\r\nB. When the shot caller says to do something, do it as soon as you are able. The whole point of communication is lost if someone doesnt play on the same pafe as the rest of the team. If yoy disagree with the shotcallers decision we can talk about it after the game. \r\n\r\nC. No side conversations during game play. All communication that takes place from the moment you load into the game must relate to the game at hand. No talking about your last game, how your girl left you, dog shat on the floor etc. \r\n\r\n5. We use personal Cell phones to communicate outside the game. If you do not want to give out your phone number do not join this team.\r\n\r\n6. We meet every other day at 11pm est. If you can not make it you muat text someone on the team to let them know so we can get one of our subs contacted.\r\n\r\nWhat we want from you!\r\n\r\nI see you are still reading, awesome. Here is what we want from you specifically in your role.\r\n\r\n1. Have a decent champ pool of people you can use well. (minimum 5 champions)\r\n2. Be on time. If you are consistently late or absent then you will be removed from \r\nthe team.\r\n3. Bonus points if you are good with or happen to main Oriana or Zed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not add me in game without first leaving a reply here, you will be declined. I am not online at this moment anyway but will be tonight around 930pm est. Any questions comments etc please post here.","replies":[{"poster":"GoogleAndrewYang","date":"2015-06-10T02:34:41.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooh pick me lol! :) I get off work at 11 MST so that is perfect.
