So regarding his shield... Does it block or reduce damage of attacks that go THROUGH it without being stopped? im thinking of things like lux ult, Draven ult, Ez ult, etc","replies":[{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-07-05T22:19:30.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything that would go through the shield will be stopped in its entirety. Braum tanks the damage/CC it gives, and the projectile goes away. However, as much as it is a skillshot, I don't think it blocks Lux Ults because it's not a projectile, per say. It's more like a long and narrow AOE spell that deals damage to anyone inside the laser. I don't speak from experience, but that's what I think when I envision it.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hizsoo","date":"2015-07-05T19:04:31.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just leave this here:\nhttps://youtu.be/ajUghBnxZQA?t=3m10s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reluctor","date":"2015-07-04T21:20:11.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Braum\n\nYou intercept projectiles. Similar to wind  wall from yasuo. I believe the damage reduction is 100% from first champion damage, be it auto attack or syndra ult or lux ult or anything, then 30-40% dmg reduction after.","replies":[]}]}
