Many people are attached to it, it's not completely out-of-date or out-of-place like the old Sion default skin, yet it's being cast aside for a new default skin that's entirely in a different direction. Perhaps give it the  \"Captain Gangplank\" treatment and make it free as part of an event? Or just reverse your stance on the \"no more traditional skin\" policy and start handling it as a case-by-case situation since one-bill does not fit all?\n\n-PROJECT: Fiora","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"searchman15","date":"2015-08-03T04:16:19.821+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes plz, especially after RUINING my favorite one.
