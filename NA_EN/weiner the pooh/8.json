It's why the skin was released on May the 4th. (May the 4th be with you).. The same as Chosen Master Yi.

They'll update the skins to meet modern criteria (see Alien Invasion Heimerdinger or Magnificent Twisted Fate for examples), but they will not update the old skins to their levels.  \n\nForsaken Olaf is a recolor of the classic normal skin, created at a time when that was expected and accepted.  That's what you're likely going to get, something that would sell for 750 RP with a few tweaks here and there.\n\nThat's only if Riot feels that Olaf needs a visual rework.  (Meddler has said that his gameplay is in a \"good spot\" right now.  That probably says more about the wacky state of the company more than anything else to be honest...)\n\nGiven what that team did with Mordekaiser (nerfing all the effects of his various skins with no plans on fixing them anytime soon), what you should fear with an Olaf rework is how they'll treat Brolaf or Pentakill Olaf (make all the axes look and sound the same, remove any special effects, not update the voice work on the legendary, etc.)","replies":[]}]}
