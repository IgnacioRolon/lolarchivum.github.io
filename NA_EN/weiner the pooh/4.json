I know the hair on the Project skins is roughly supposed to resemble the characters' default looks, and I think short hair would look great on PROJECT: Fiora, but the mini-Super Saiyan hair just doesn't look that great to me. You might try keeping some variation of her current hair-over-her-face look, but something approximately shoulder-length and slicked back might look good as well.
