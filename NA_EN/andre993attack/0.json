I would not recommend going any farther than this though, mine gives no competitive advantage and you can customize all of this without a 3rd part program. Changing art to me seems fine and I do it at my own risk, change particles in game though can be bad for your visuals and how they implemented :P.\n\nChanging the art is fine, changing how particles are used and treated not so much?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-10T22:26:17.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Custom skins fall into a *use at your own risk* category. Because a lot of these custom skins are deployed via a third-party program not created or maintained by Riot, they can potentially contain features that could provide you with a competitive advantage. Because there are an endless number of these programs, we cannot maintain a list of what is and isn't okay. Choosing to use these could be a risk to your account and it's definitely not recommended.\n\nYou can find our official post on third-party apps [here.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848-Third-Party-Applications) Although I can't tell you if a specific method or program is okay to use, let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
