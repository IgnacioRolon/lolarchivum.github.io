Now fastforward to today when, as a surprise to me, the event is over and i can no longer get the tokens for the skin i want and im a little under 150 short, I couldve maybe played more games or something but because i thought that i could get more tokens until january 21st i didnt feel a need to, basically it would be really nice if in the shop in addition to their them telling us when the tokens expire if they also told us when we can expect to not be receiving any more.","replies":[]}
