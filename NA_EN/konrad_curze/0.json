As such, I really think that new Morde needs to keep some of his Hybrid scaling especially with his new Ultimate. When you rip stats off of another player (Let’s say a Darius/Fiora in lane or pretty much any AD Botlaner during mid/late) you’re wasting the AD you would get from them. Additionally, old Morde’s hybrid scalings are pretty core atm, and really allow a number of diverse play styles. Akali (though not the best example for an effective rework) and Katarina kept their identities as Hybrid champions, why not the same for new Morde?\n\nI suggest any of the following:\nPassive: Give the AOE a % bonus equal to the AP ratio for bonus AD. \nThis wont increase it’s damage too too much, seeing as getting AP is much easier that AD.\n\nQ: Give it around a 65% multi-target bonus AD scaling and a 165% single-target bonus AD scaling. \nThe latter of the two matching Morde current AD scaling.\n\nW: Give a 100-200% total AD scaling to increase the maximum amount the shield can store.\nThis doesn’t directly give him a bigger heal, just allows him to soak/deal more damage before activating. I can only really see 2-3 AD items being built on Morde, being Gunblade, Death’s Dance, and Steraks. Assuming all of these items are built, that’s no more than an extra 340 for the shield after taking/dealing damage.","replies":[]}
