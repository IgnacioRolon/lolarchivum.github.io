Hm, a scaling champion such as Wukong which needs gold for items can't farm because \"champion difference\". And then when my team isn't doing well, and I can't carry them it is my fault? Although I dealt with a very suppressive lane for 20 minutes, did not feed and tried to play it the best I could... I can't take his tower, I can't push, if I roam they get plate gold now and I miss out on not only gold, but also exp.\n\nNot to mention, the fact that they get so much control over the lane, means that they easily get a gold and exp lead. So these champions that are supposed to fall, are still very strong leading into mid and late game. When I have to lane against these champions I am at the mercy of my team. LITERALLY. If my jungler doesn't gank, I am bound to lose my lane. If my team doesn't snowball, I sure as hell won't be able to.","replies":[{"poster":"5or6stores","date":"2019-02-11T04:36:39.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play {{champion:17}}. Top is very matchup/counterpick dependent, and sometimes you're just screwed. Your objective in most of these matchups above is to outlast, not necessarily to win the lane. Teemo is very good at this, because he's ranged (to CS safely), and is very hard to jump on thanks to his Q and W. Rarely is Teemo a horrible pick.\n\nBut some more specific details for these champs:\n\n{{champion:58}} {{champion:80}} and {{champion:240}} to a lesser degree all fall off very hard, and are GEARED around getting fed... if you don't feed them they won't be relevant. It's expected the opponent knows this, and so they have gapclosers/CC to catch them. Farm as best as you can around their CD's & try to freeze the wave as much as possible. You won't be as powerful in teamfights as normal, but it's better to do a 4 vs 4.5 than unleash a fed snowballer on the rest of your team. You didn't mention {{champion:126}}, who's an early game bully that works the same way as those above.\n\nDo short trades with {{champion:122}} (Wukong is very good at this thanks to W). Don't initially engage on {{champion:86}}... wait for him to Q, kite him (an escape/mobility ability helps), then be sticky and punish him. Then you can abuse him a bit, and he'll have to miss farm if he wants to use his passive. Ranged tops destroy them both and can win lane if you get the chance to counterpick.\n\n{{champion:420}} {{champion:266}} you just have to dodge their skillshots. It's a skill matchup, nobody can really tell you how to do it. \n\n{{champion:92}} isn't really an early game bully. Punish and be aggressive pre-6, because she needs farm and items. Flat-out get the fuck away when she ults and just wait.\n\n{{champion:24}} and {{champion:6}} are kinda just broken lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2019-02-18T12:08:01.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=5or6stores,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HwwZ6Hxf,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-02-11T04:36:39.153+0000)\n>\n> Play {{champion:17}}.
