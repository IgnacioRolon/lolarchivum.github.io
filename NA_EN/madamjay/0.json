I get a message saying that I disconnected and it might be the network. I know my internet is fine. It takes about 3x times clicking on reconnect in order for me to get back into the game. I have tried everything you guys recommended and I'm still having this problem. I tried the Hextech repair tool, changing my DNS to the 0s, I made sure it's not blocked by my firewall. At this point, I don't know what else to do. Can I get some help by anyone??","replies":[{"poster":"IlikeSupportCP","date":"2017-09-15T18:04:43.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this thread is 3 months old, but I am having the same problem.  Champ select is fine then during the loading screen I DC.  Once the game starts (I duo with a friend), it allows me to connect to the game and I do not have a problem at all during the game.  It is only during the loading screen.  I guess I will try to delete the game and reinstall, but I really don't want to do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"10Miljoen","date":"2017-12-12T23:37:34.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you choose a character to play with and the loading screens is about to appear and all out of nowhere things happen to you, you're slowly lurking in the bush of this addictive game , picking a character to play with , the sound of the selected champs echo's though your area... tensions rises, the dark black screens of death slowly creeps up whilst you/your team are deciding who to take and all of a sudden...YOU PRESS ENTER , YOU HAVE SELECTED YOUR CHAMP!!!
