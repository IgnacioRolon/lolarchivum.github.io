Current Shen is pretty much forced into full tank. The only damage items you're building are titanic hydra for the wave clear and perhaps wit's end just because it's a ridiculously efficient item.\n\n**Better Aesthetics-** At least in my opinion anyways. I liked it when Shen was a pure ninja, but for some reason Riot thought Shen should have gimmicks with this spirit nonsense. Shen still has 2 swords, but never uses more than 1 at a time like he used to. Vorpal blade into Ki strike always felt satisfying to me. I want my dual wielding shinobi back, not this monk that's off to go fight some spirits. \n\n**Energy Management-** Seriously, current Shen just DOESN'T run out of energy, you might as well remove it as a resource for him. Part of the reason they reworked Shen was because his feint was so worthless it felt like a waste of energy. They could've just given it a health ratio or something else to make it worthwhile instead of completely reworking Shen. Anyways, I actually preferred it when energy was a resource you had to manage. Isn't it more engaging to decide what to spend your energy on instead of just pressing everything on cooldown? Scarcer energy also means that taunting multiple enemies was more meaningful.\n\n**No Nonsense Kit-** The only other reason they reworked Shen was because his Q and W were apparently too generic and outdated. If that's the case, I'm wondering why they haven't reworked Pantheon yet because he is just the offensive version of old Shen as far as I'm concerned. Anyways, I fail to see how his new abilities are more interesting. His Q is just gives him a glorified bloodrazor passive for his next 3 auto attacks, and if you're lucky you get the attack speed of bloodrazor too. I prefer old Q not having a lame minigame attached to it, and it was actually a versatile laning tool that Shen could decide to poke, sustain or cs with. I can understand how old Q was more frustrating to play against, but old Shen seems like a pretty mild offender of annoying lane opponents. If they really had to, they could've just made it a skill shot with longer range. Shen's new W is just a worse Jax E in every way except that it's aoe. This ability is too specialized, if you're fighting somebody that doesn't rely on autoattacks then Shen is basically fighting with 2 abilities, his Q and E. Although Ki barrier has the health ratio that feint should've had in the first place, you can't use it to reactively negate poke like feint because it's either delayed or not worth using shadow dash just for the shield. A simple champion like old Shen still has the potential to appeal to players like me.\n\nTo conclude, old Shen might not be perfect for modern league, but his rework could've been handled better.\n\nEdit: All the posts so far said they have something to miss about old Shen, so I'm wondering about the reasoning behind the downvotesis\n","replies":[]}
