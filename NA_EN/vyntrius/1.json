My mouse otherwise appears to be fully functioning and this problem occurred rather suddenly. I tried replugging in my mouse, that doesn't work. When I bound movement to a certain key it worked fine, but I obviously can't play league like that. Do any of you know about this problem and how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Vyntrius","date":"2016-12-29T16:30:45.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue has resolved, I just changed mouses and it works.
