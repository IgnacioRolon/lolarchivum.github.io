However, I've noticed that when others play Draven, they get a distinct pattern for the landing zone of their spinning axe. For me, it's just a faint glowing outline of a circle. My version is a lot less clear, so is there a way I can change this? This question may sound really dumb to some people, but again, I am new to Draven.\n\nEDIT: I put a picture of the problem in the comments, but to be sure nobody misses it -\nhttps://imgur.com/rss979i","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T17:48:57.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this may be a practice tool issue as well.

I assume this problem will persist for the other game modes. I guess I will post this to bug reports. The reason I didn't do that in the first place is because others don't seem to have this problem, so I thought it was something I could fix on my own.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-30T21:30:40.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to be safe, download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and see if a force repatch can fix any potentially bad files.
