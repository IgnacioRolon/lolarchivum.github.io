There is nothing I can do except do a hard reset, and it won't stop happening. This problem was spontaneous and out of nowhere. I have no viruses and nothing changed that would've affected League, so I do not understand why it's happening. Any Advice, support, troubleshooting, etc is greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"diddakoi","date":"2016-09-17T02:31:06.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem - once the champs loading screen finishes and I'm \"deployed\" into the game, it just freezes and the last second of sound/music plays in a fast loop.
