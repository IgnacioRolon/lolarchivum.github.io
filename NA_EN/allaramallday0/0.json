I have all my UI and cursor size settings maxxed and wish they could go higher. The tiny-ass text in chat I&#039;ve more or less gotten used to, and this cursor thing is definitely helping *a bit*, but I still lose cursor in teamfights all the time. This is probably because I&#039;m on a 4k monitory and colorblind (and find colorblind mode to not help at all...).\r\n\r\nIs there a reason it&#039;s capped at the size of my pinky nail on a 27&quot; monitor? Why not let it take up whole inches of screen real estate if I wanted it to? While we&#039;re at it, why not let me set my cursor to &quot;painfully fuchsia&quot; for greater visibility?{{summoner:13}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-18T21:24:01.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first mistake was a 27' 4K monitor.
