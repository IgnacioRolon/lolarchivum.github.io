Than their support &quot;brand&quot; started saying &quot;ff early&quot; and says a lot of random shit to tilt us! At first I muted him, but I reliced how much my team was typing in the chat that I unmuted him. My team got really tilted and flamed each other.  I told that person I was going to report him for all the negative, cocky and tilting comments he used against my team. He and his friend started saying even more shit, more to me because they didnt understand how that was a reason to report. I said that his attitude could be enough for some people to wanna track him in real life and beat him up. That it was really that bad and made people so sad and depressed. I told him to stop, but he didnt. So I reported him after having a long conversation in the lobby after the game. Than he started telling me how &quot;lonely&quot; I was and that I didnt have any friends. Tried to make him sound so much better and making me depressed. My report didnt do a shit to this player, and for that im pissed, and feel sorry for the other players he will play against. You really should take this report thing more seriously! Several times ive come up against someone who is tiling my team at the worst but havnt seen any of them getting a ban. It seems like the report button is useless! If they get ban a small window till pop up on the screen and say that a player I recently reported have been punished or so.\n\n<removed by moderation>","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-11T00:07:17.823+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No name and shame.\n\nYes, reports work, you just dont get confirmation of a punishment in most cases. Chat abuse has a 100% punishment rate if the player keeps it up, because it is very easy for the system to verify just by looking at logs.","replies":[{"poster":"LordPyro","date":"2017-06-11T00:10:53.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okey?

If their behavior is bad enough to warrant punishment for a single game then it can happen. However, usually when a player is acting out it's not their usual behavior and it's not necessary to immediately punish them; it's typically when they are *normally* acting that way when they receive a penalty. As long as your report is accurate it will contribute to them being punished if they keep it up.","replies":[{"poster":"LordPyro","date":"2017-06-11T00:26:56.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okey..

Yes, Riot is aware of it. Now that new honor system is out, hopefully they develop something for visibility soon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hocker","date":"2017-06-11T01:18:54.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"tough-guy troll talk\" really got to you that much, eh?\n\nDid you ever see the south park episode where they made fun of WoW?
