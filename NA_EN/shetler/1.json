Or overall? The question shifts based on time focus.\n\nI'd say that C9 remains at the very top as of this moment, the recent loss to Dignitas besides. Your informal poll'll say otherwise, of course - witness the raw power of the TSM hype machine - but they were effectively untouchable all last year, and still remain the most North American team at their level of play. \n\nBut overall? That's a lot murkier. TSM's improved massively with the Bjergsen pickup. Dignitas finally looks serious again (though I'm not holding my breath - they had a sustained spike last year too yet couldn't hold it together). Even CLG showed that their strategic planning's been refined, if not necessarily their capability to execute. And down in the Challenger Series, LMQ's stomping boots are downright muddy with the viscera of their victims. \n\nWho is the best team across NA? Ask me again at the end of summer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"light trick","date":"2014-02-01T04:36:41.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a huge Coast fan, but by far the best right now are C9 and TSM.  Dig comes in at third, and this isnt just from their records but performance wise.  So far Dignitas is the only team this split to beat C9.  TSM is stronger than ever with Bjergsen in the mid lane and C9 is just as consistent as they were last year.  If they continue this level of play then they are most likely the three going to worlds this year.  However, its only the 3rd week of the Spring Split, anything could happen.  Last spring everyone counted out Coast and they came back to take second place.  XDG has the same lineup, Zuna just needs to get his act together in the jungle.  EG needs time to acclimate to the NA meta, Curse has a new lineup, and as far as CLG is concerned....well, at least they make the game interesting to watch. \n\nTL;DR- C9 and TSM are the powerhouses but anything could happen.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Rabbit","date":"2014-02-02T08:02:58.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but I believe XDG comes in third, their potential amazes me...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oEX5o Phoenix","date":"2014-02-04T21:42:03.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its going to be between C9, TSM, or DIG. they are all strong teams and are making very good plays.
