I understand that worlds happened to fall very close to Halloween so you would want to put off the harrowing so as to give it its due without being distracted by worlds but, you chose to release the harrowing story without any harrowing content. this i feel was a bad choice. I liked the bilgewater content you guys released this year, it was thought out and kept us coming back for more and i had hope that the harrowing would tie into that with the same kind of events but instead you released the harrowing story with nothing to back it up and it feels like the harrowing got done as a after thought to worlds.","replies":[{"poster":"MeDicenWera","date":"2015-11-02T18:50:14.850+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's also the problem, October is done and we didn't even got the past Harrowing skins.
