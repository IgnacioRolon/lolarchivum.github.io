LMFAO. Your champ has been taken extra special care of because of your dumbass playerbase that circlejerks her when she starts garnering anything less than positive attention.

My source for this is League of Graphs where she is also currently sitting at a 53.5% winrate and a playrate of 12.3%. Yet people like you want to say she is \"balanced\" or, \"she's just really safe, she doesn't do that great of damage\". jesus fucking christ you guys are the most toxic fanbase. If your champ doesn't have a winrate over 50% then she's \"unplayable\" and \"weak\".

Nami has both higher , slightly a higher  winrate and has much way more pickrate than Ahri , but no one complains about her because she has just been like that because of the Starting support items nerf \n> and in Korea Kassadin has much higher both pick and winrate \n> So why did you choose to complain about Ahri?\n> \n> For your infomation , Ahri has one of the weakest wave clear pre 9 , especially at 7 and 8 , Her Q makes the backside Caster minions survive on low hp , W and E won't kill them so you have to use auto attacks and until then 1 or 2 casters will die , at lvl 9 , wow Ahri can 1 shoot caster minions with Q , WOW WHAT A BROKEN WAVE CLEAR ??? her wave clear is sure nice later , but don't call it broken\n> \n> \n> Ahri is ungankable after 6 ? well mid lane is full of champions that are ungankable even pre 6 , not to forget that she is only ungankable because of her ULTIMATE , so you got angry that you couldn't kill her ? well you just forced her to use the key to her kit that actually makes her a champion , the key for her to roam or to kill the enemy laner \" tho she fails at both if she misses her Charm \" \n> \n> After buying 3 items Ahri killed you even when missing her Charm ?  Well yes , she hit r w q ignite and applied electro , sure her q isn't hard to land when you Ult  and W won't miss , but she just used her Ultimate , for the love of god you people .. she used 3/4 if her kit , even if they are easy to land , some champions are using half of their kits \" non-ultimates ones btw \" and still killing people while they are easy to land and with 1 item spike only !\n> Ahri can't do that when she has 3 items while more than 1 enemies are near , like any champion in the game she gets bursted , and she can't do that against champions that got shield in their kit or took barrier \n> \n> Like any mage , Ahri gets hard countered by MR , \" BUT HER Q DOES TRUE DAMAGE \" O....ok.. lol , so the q on it's way back killed you ? \n> \n> Most of meta champions and champions that are being played lately are ad ,  they still buy QSS to dodge her only CC ability that is a skillshot \n> \n> But actually , do you think it's more fun to play against champion  Irelia ?  the champion that has 50% which is 4% less than Ahri's but actually dominates and gets a triple or quadra kill everytime I watch a stream ? \n> \n> Btw for your information , it's not really about winrates , Before her latest rework , Ahri had 52% winrate  while at the same time everyone complained about how useless she was \n> \n> So you want her to be nerfed ? what nerfs comes to your mind ? I honestly can't think of anything except reverting her latest buff , any other nerfs will make her useless again\n> \n> besides , why are you complaining about Ahri to be exact when she finally became in a good spot ? wait nvm you are a jungler main who gets angry everytime he fails to kill Ahri , even though when we finally had  a mage being a good pick \" half mage tho , but her only ability that makes her half assassin is her ult \"\n> \n> \n> besides , why do you hate it when Ahri misses charm and runs with her ult in fights?  I mean , forcing Ahri to run with ult makes it as if the match is 4v5 lol\n> \n> Ahri is a mana Hunger champion , she runs out of mana easily more than any other mid laner in the game while laning\n> \n> Btw , Ahri isn't a champion that can 1v1 you from behind , she is a champion that MUST stay ahead to be viable. \n> She isn't LB who dies 10 times and still kills you without even using half of her kit.\n> in other words , deaths for Ahri pre 6 are enough to keep her out of the match\n> \n> Idk what to say anymore , Keep complaining when {{champion:104}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:91}} and many others dominating as they wish.\n\nfound the Ahri waifu main LOL.

I do see Ahri's stats and how good they are, yet i've seen these other dominant mid laners be priority still who get banned out more often. You can check on U.GG for example, all of these champions i've listed actually have way higher ban rates than her which would ALSO be the reason they don't get picked as much. Don't forget the tons of other unbalance in the game. For god sakes, look at Zed's for example, in all 40% of matches he is banned.
