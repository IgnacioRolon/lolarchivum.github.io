He was below average and then some soul in the wild finds out about AFTERSHOCK on pyke and all of a sudden next patch he jumps to 54% winrate and everyone spam picks him causing Riot to quickly nerf Pyke. \n\nIt's almost like there is something wrong and overtuned about that rune causing unhealthy gameplay and balance. \nBut what do I know, I'm just a low diamond Rengar one trick wondering every patch why my main has a 47-49% winrate and under 7% play rate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sliceruser","date":"2019-03-21T16:40:56.412+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"ludicrous  if it doesnt give damage or move speed its completely inconceivable -rito balance team","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vectros","date":"2019-03-22T06:39:26.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think Aftershock should be changed to something like:\n\nSmall base armor/MR (like 1/5 what it is now)+large % of bonus armor mr (maybe even 100%).

I miss that big, beautiful shield that got strong with more enemies around.\n\nWall of text following though.\n\nThere’s two big issues I see though that makes Aftershock an issue. The first is the damage. The second is the sheer amount of flat resists it gives. This is what makes it even better on non-tanks. Patch 8.2 is where it broke.\n\n> Removed: Armor ratio of 30% armor.\n> Bonus armor increased to 70 − 120 (based on level) from 20 at all levels.\n> Removed: Magic resistance ratio of 30% magic resistance.\n> Bonus magic resistance increased to 70 − 120 (based on level) from 20 at all levels.\n> Shockwave base damage reduced to 10 − 120 (based on level) from 40 − 140 (based on level).\n> Shockwave health ratio reduced to 3% of maximum health from 3.5%.\n> New Effect: Shockwave damage now scales with 15% bonus AD.\n> New Effect: Shockwave damage now scales with 10% AP.\n\nThat was all one patch. They made the damage scale with more stats, removed the scaling resists and gave it much higher flat stats. If they revert it to the less damage, lower base stat grant and give it the bonus armor/mr ratios, it’d be much better for tanks. **Currently, at level 1 it gives more resists than almost every tank item.** For armor, the only items that give more armor than *it’s level 1 value* are {{item:3373}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3387}} {{item:3075}}, two of which are only available of Ornn is in the match. For MR, the only two items available on Summoner’s Rift that surpass Aftershock’s level 1 value are {{item:3379}} {{item:3383}}, again, only available with Ornn. That’s insane flat value just for one CC.\n\nThe problem is, they *wanted* non tanks to start using it and having fun with it. Honestly, their reasoning on this one..just doesn’t make sense: \n\n> Aftershock's base damage is a bit too high, and it's letting champions like Alistar or Leona run wild in early duels against marksmen. Having one mastery be so good for both durability and damage is warping interactions between tanks and squishier champions, so we're shifting the item profile to be less about damage and more about durability. While we're at it, we're shifting the resistances gain from percent to flat so that divers can get in on the fun, too.\n\nI honestly don’t understand. You took a rune that tanks would prefer, and made it a Diver preferred rune. If it’s to stay instead of Courage of the Colossus, Give it back the bonus resist ratios, reduce the flat amount. They honestly broke it when they made that change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2019-03-22T01:14:40.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think keystones as a whole need to go bye bye","replies":[{"poster":"I memba balance ","date":"2019-03-22T04:21:42.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would be totally fine with this as well.
