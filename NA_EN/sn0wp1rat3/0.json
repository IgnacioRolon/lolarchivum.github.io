Why do people HATE playing against her?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":41,"down_votes":8,"body":"~~Answer: because she gets ten million shields per second... stun... 4 dashes... etc. (jokes)~~\r\n\r\nReal Answer: because she can do extra 150% AD damage from passive ALONE starting at level 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_What's her passive?_\r\n\r\nRunic Blade\r\nRiven's blade gains a Charge for 6 seconds every time she uses an ability (stacks up to 3 times). Riven's basic attacks consume a Charge when available to deal 25% âˆ’ 50% (based on level) AD bonus physical damage. (Source: LoL Wiki)\r\n\r\nNow, it says it stacks up to 3 times, but there is a trick to stack it 6 times at all levels, including level 1.\r\nThis means that at level 1, she does 150% AD bonus physical damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Let's do the math:_\r\n\r\nRiven's Base Attack Damage: 64 - 115 (based on level)\r\nLet's say you start Doran's Blade (common starting item against melee champions): + 8 AD\r\n(64 + 8) x 1.5 = 108 bonus physical damage at level 1???!\r\n\r\nYou might think this is low, but dude. Tryndamere, who has the highest base health stat at level 1, has 625.64 HP.\r\n\r\n108 is 17% of Trynd's health (of course, not taking armor and starting item into consideration)\r\n\r\n\r\n_\r\nHow do you do it?_\r\n\r\nCast the second and the third Q as late as possible in order to infinitely keep your passive stacks.\r\n\r\nIn-depth video guide: https://youtu.be/dz0yx4DeO04\r\n(Although the video includes everything from laning phase, trade timing, mid-late game macro and much more,\r\naccurate description of Runic Blade and explanation of the mentioned trick start playing at 0:27 and last only a bit!)\r\n\r\n~~Rito don't nerf her~~","replies":[]}
