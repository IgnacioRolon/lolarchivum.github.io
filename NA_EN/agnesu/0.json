Someone (probably the tilted midlaner) was so frustrated with being 0/8 that they decided to report me even though it was obvious I was talking to someone I know. Now I know that telling someone to kill themselves is considered bad and all, but when someone who isn&#039;t being attacked decides to try to get someone else in trouble when they&#039;re talking with a friend is just spite, Also I told the enemy team to report Ori just like everyone else (might be she reported all of us). Point is my friend wasn&#039;t the one that reported me and therefore I shouldn&#039;t have been banned.

Also, calling for reports is a form of harassment and can be reported in and of it self.
