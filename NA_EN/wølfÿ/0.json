Typically, it's in the case of a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf you believe that content you have received on your account has gone missing and is not because of this (you could check with your friend!) make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!
