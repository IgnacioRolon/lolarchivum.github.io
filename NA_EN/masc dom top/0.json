Most people don't build tank items on him they build items melee carries build. Which when you add on to the fact that he can get a free 120 armor and magic resist. It makes him hard to kill while still doing a ton of damage. Any champion that gets focused by a full team will \"get insta gibbed\" even a full tank build.\n\nThe problem is he's too burst heavy while still being safe by being so tanky. that's due in part by his true grit and the strength of those items. while him still having so much damage in his kit alone.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Left Hook Larry","date":"2016-03-10T22:47:54.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You entire match history is graves, no wonder you think hes balanced","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ant Reformed","date":"2016-03-10T17:12:23.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Señor Funky,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fa9InfH8,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-03-09T18:15:02.538+0000)\n>\n> as I said, assasins and bruiser need to get into melee range (125-175) to kill me.

Good for you if you have smart teammates but in lower elos teammates aren't as smart as in diamond.\n\nHe can't do a lot of damage at his max range though, since his auto attack spreads out he needs to get really close (melee range) to start dealing damage. So as compensation for this Riot gave him defensive stats on the same ability that allows him to get close and made it so the same ability had a reduced cool down from auto attacks. The point is to make it so he can consistently be putting out damage, and since he needs to get close he has a low cool down dash to help. Another thing is his damage is mostly avoidable, sure when in the jungle or maybe in top lane his Q is a lot easier to hit, and in the chaos of a team fight you may forget about it, but its an avoidable ability that has a long delay. Another thing I would like to point out is that since Graves is an up-in-the-face ADC he builds items to enhance his abilities and not his auto attacks, making the pattern of his damage predictable and pretty comparable to any other ADC who would build Crit and AS as core items.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-03-09T21:17:06.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanky adc assassin jungler.

Meaning that A) before youre first quickdraw, youre just as squshy as any other ADC with a similar build, B) you need to use quickdraw 4 times to get max stacks, and C) his E has a 14 second cooldown reduced by .5 for each pellet.\n\nWhat does this mean? First, your build has no crit, so Graves will only be firing 4 pellets each auto. Second, it has 20% CDR, so his 14 second E is lowered to a little over 11 seconds. If he is within melee range of you, his E cooldown gets lowered by 2 seconds per auto. So in the FASTEST of scenarios where he uses quickdraw at the start of the fight (not for the quick reload), he would need to: E - auto x2  (at this time, around 5 seconds left on the cooldown for E) - reload - auto - E - auto x2 - reload - auto - E - auto x2 - reload - auto - E. Youre talking minimum 9 autos and 3 reloads, which is easily around 10 seconds in combat. \n\nBut realistically, as you said, he is ranged. He isnt going to hit you with all 4 pellets - he will most likely only get 2 with a non-crit, non IE build. Meaning that youd have to have twice as many atuos and twice as many reloads between uses of his E. From my experience, the only time ive been able to consistently and quickly get max stacks with him is with a traditional ADC build that has 40% CDR and 70% crit, but even then the fight is usually over before the 4th quickdraw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Feathermane","date":"2016-03-10T20:41:10.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is Jax, what else is new?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Turdong lite","date":"2016-03-10T08:15:11.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves isn't too tanky for the damage he deals, the items are ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"kebslol","date":"2016-03-10T07:27:21.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Concur.
