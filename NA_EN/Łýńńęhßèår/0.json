No Brainer right?\n\nWith that said here are my issues \n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9pqDAVoKQ4I/WIfP0Kr-cHI/AAAAAAAAcrE/_la_7YhsALsrC2ZFJ_GxEyVer4koQeLdQCLcB/s1600/dianaturn.jpg\n\nMy 1st issue is the mask:\n\nWhy can&#039;t her mask be off the side of her face like Blood Moon Akali?\nWhy do this? Because this would allow you to re-do her crescent tattoo on her forehead to the blood moon symbol.\nThis also allows another champ to have a offset mask VS a perma faced one.\n\n2nd Issue- Shoulder fur:\n\nIts bulky, also the colour allows little to no definition to what it really is.\nHonestly, it&#039;s almost if not the same texture of the hair used. \n\n3rd Issue- The hair:\n\nIt looks and feels as if it&#039;s the same as Blood Moon Yasuo, just dragged and extended. \n\nDiana is of the moon and this feels rushed and clunky. \n\nThe splash looks amazing I will give it that but for a skin to be 1350 and feel so..lackluster is a disappointment. \n\nWhy not seeing how she IS of the moon, make her more..regalia? Almost as if she&#039;s royalty the blessed of the moon? \n\nYes, we have Lunar goddess, but with that you should be able to grow from that and not almost downgrade her to this rushed work.\n\nThis is just my opinion, I just feel she deserved more than a half ass&#039;d almost Naruto rip off.","replies":[{"poster":"Targon","date":"2017-01-25T20:10:16.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wish the red in Diana's skin was as vibrant as the red in Star Guardian Jinx's skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2017-01-25T15:13:16.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it seems riot rushed the last skins (except the lunar-skins) thats pretty sad, cuz there should be (and is) soooo much inspiration they could get from.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-25T10:27:26.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

I despise the mask\n2. the fur looks solid\n3. I literally thought she was yasuo when i first saw it cuz of the hair.\n\nAlthough they nailed the splash! Loved it.

The main thing we would ask is just more detail for the mask.  You know what I mean?\n\nOtherwise, we'd ask for a face purely because it's a pretty girl behind it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łýńńęhßèår","date":"2017-01-25T20:50:52.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found this a few days ago before they leaked the new blood moons.
