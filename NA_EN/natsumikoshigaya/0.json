I also played Galio and I am extremely upset with these changes but one thing we should keep in mind is that when riot claims they are going to rework a champion they are literally stating that they will add a new champion with little to no resemblance to the original champion with the same name. We saw these changes with eve, karma, sion, poppy and yorick, truth is many of our beloved champions will end up wiped eventually, we just have to deal with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-03-17T06:55:16.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Rework say it with me now rework.

The custom VO was done two days after PBE was updated. \nTraditional skins arent hard. Theyre just the old voice lines and recoloring with slightly different textures. \n\nRiot classifies a RELAUNCH as a re-release of a champion with an entirely new kit, background, personality, and model that is unrecognizable from the previous. \nPoppy, sion, karma, and yorick are COMPLETELY unrecognizable from what they were before, with minimal similarities. They are, in essence, an entirely NEW champion. \n\nShen, warwick, and malzahar are reworks because even though their kits were changed, they were STILL recognizable as what they were before and retained their personality.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrEctomy","date":"2017-03-21T03:32:39.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio main here.

Yeah, poppy's old kit was toxic(well really it was just her passive and ult), but there was NOTHING wrong with her as a character. I think they actually did a decent job visually by keeping her similar to her old design with some really good updates to visuals like her armor. However, she isn't poppy. she is a new champion that was \"influenced\" by the \"real poppy\". It really just grinds my gears cause it completely unnecessary. These champs are getting reworks because their gameplay is bad, not their character. Also, we know now that riot is certainly capable of doing a proper rework as evidence by the new {{champion:99}} VO. This is what should be done with all reworks that involve new VO's. Lux is still the same character she was just updated and refined to draw out her character more than her old VO. As an {{champion:28}} main i feel you man, cause she is right behind galio to getting her chacter axed by a \"rework\"(aka champion replacement).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-03-21T03:48:50.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i really hated his overbearing immunity to my spells and his ultimate was cancer. good riddance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-03-17T07:16:07.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"new galio is fuckin awesome","replies":[]}]}
