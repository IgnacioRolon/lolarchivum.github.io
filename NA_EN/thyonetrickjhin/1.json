So please please please please help me I love this game and any help would be good\r\n\r\n(Yes i deleted this game and reinstalled waste of 3 hours)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-18T04:23:44.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's most likely happening is that League is trying to load your old display resolution from when you played on the TV, which causes issues when your current monitor likely can't display the same resolution.

When i click on league the only files it has in it are my replays, because i deleted and reinstalled","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-19T22:56:15.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, no worries! So you can get to the folder by hitting the start button (bottom left corner, looks like the windows logo), then hit either **My Computer/Computer** if you're on windows XP-7, or **File Explorer** (folder icon) if you're on Windows 8-10. Make sure you're in the **Computer** directory that shows your (C:) drive and DVD drive. If you aren't, find it on the toolbar on the left side and click on it. Double-click on the Windows (C:) drive, next double-click on the **Riot Games** folder and then double-click the **League of Legends** folder. You'll finally be able to double-click on the **Config** folder so you can take care of those two files for the reset.\n\nI hope this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"ThyOneTrickJhin","date":"2017-01-20T02:07:24.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=8xUEcpwh,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2017-01-19T22:56:15.062+0000)\n>\n> Ah, no worries!
