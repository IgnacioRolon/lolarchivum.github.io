I often get que bans because i couldnt pick my champion, its annoying as all hell waiting for an hour for something you had no control over, any way of fixing this?\r\n\r\n                           -S","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T22:53:36.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time those freezes in champion select will happen if your connection to the servers gets interrupted. The client needs to keep a steady connection in those lobbies otherwise it's unable to communicate with the other players. Hit up our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and go through each step testing it in a custom game.
