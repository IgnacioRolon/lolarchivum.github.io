When his knees go on cooldown in the laning phase, you have a long window to attack him from that angle. \n\nHis range is very short. His dash is tiny, and also on a long cooldown. Every champion has flash, you can't count that as his mobility alone. \n\nHis big damage comes from his combo of flip into W, then shotgun you as you try to get back to your side of the lane. If you dodge the flip, his damage is much lower. \n\nUrgot is a snowballing juggernaut, who needs to get kills in order to thrive. Deny him those kills and kite him in teamfights, and he's virtually useless. \n\nBuy armor.","replies":[{"poster":"Luxanna Ahegao","date":"2019-07-02T22:00:51.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"he literally has 0 seconds cooldown on machine gun at max rank......","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-07-02T22:07:59.459+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rito are scambgs,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YpRY2XQ7,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-07-02T22:00:51.635+0000)\n>\n> he literally has 0 seconds cooldown on machine gun at max rank......\n\nAt max rank.
