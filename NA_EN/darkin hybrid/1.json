Good l ccing her if she knows how to use it.

Also she has 2 cc in her kit too. Her drowsy slows and then they fall asleep. \n\n> I fail to see how she's more slippery than other champions without you handing her her W.\n\nOke here is an example to see it. Imagine you are a xerath, and you can finish zoe that is literally 10 hp. But you have only the last shot in your ulti. Killing her is well kinda impossible. If the target was, lets say velkoz, the chances would be better. \n\n>  Also while her cooldowns are generally lower, she deals less aoe damage,\n\nWell duh. She is an burst mage. Burst mages excel at single target damage. \n\n>   and her cc is interrupted by damage.\n\nAnd that said cc can interrupt more or less everything, for channeling to dashes. Also the instance of damage that awakes the target takes bonus damage. And lastly, if those werent enough, the target will take bonus damage even he got awake. (go test it the target will take bonus damage, but you have to be very fast bugsftw)\n\n>  he at least needs to land E and have her Q land directly on that champion from good distance.\n\nWhich in theory sounds difficult. But not in practice.  Even heavily armoured tanks will take a decent amount of damage from a single q if it travels a certain distance. \n\n>  She also doesn't have great waveclear\n\nAnd again some burst mages have weaker waveclear than other mages.

In the ones that you listed, the only ones that can actually cc as much time as zoe or/and stop dashes, is orianna, syndra, velkoz, veigar and theoretically viktor.
