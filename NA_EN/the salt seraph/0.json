I am Hosekinofunsaiki, or as some call me, Silver. Well. I got a message on my league account and they said they were boosted earlier today. Is there a way I can report them here? Or is there a way to report them on the league client itself? I have the message copied and saved if you wanna see it. This is mostly for the Rioters and all, but any info would be Fabulous.  {{champion:44}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T20:27:46.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Definitely be wary of who you add to your friend's list, and put them on block.
