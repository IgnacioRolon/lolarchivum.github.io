The apps on Overwolf, or in this case to be more specific, the Trophy Hunter app on Overwolf. Is this app alright with you guys? I want to make sure I don&#039;t get banned for using it since it does reveal things about my allies and opponents in game. If I could get some feedback on this, I would be very much relieved.~{{champion:44}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2017-10-10T19:34:05.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We never formally approve any applications and blanket green light them to be guaranteed safe, because there is always a chance the apps can change down the road or the situation pivot. That said, we *do* flag applications as being compliant within our guidelines and permissible to be published. \n\nOverwolf plugins go through an approval process with our Developer Relations team that ensures that they are compliant with our current policies and guidelines before they are approved for API access and to be released to players by Overwolf. In the case of this particular application, while it's on the line, we did clear it for being compliant with our current policies. Using it will not get you into any kind of trouble, and worst case scenario we would take our concerns up with Overwolf and the app publisher, *not* the players in question.\n\nApologies for the confusion in the contradiction with the post from another Red below, but this is just a simple case of an honest misunderstanding internally that my team will work to address.","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-11-02T03:19:39.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same conversation with Broporo right now on my own thread. https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/yEbeFwOj-is-overwolf-allowed?comment=00000000\n\nPerhaps you can clear it up a bit more. \n\nUsing OverWolf in its current condition will not get my account banned. However, if the developers change the app, theres a chance I can be banned for using it? Will there be a notification from riot saying \"Overwolf is no longer acceptable\" or will you guys just start banning the players that use it? I don't want to lose my account over something stupid, but I also really enjoy the post-game summary that OverWolf  gives","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T01:33:17.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm gonna have to fall on the side of [**\"be cautious, best not to use it\"**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848) on this one.

I've removed it from overwolf. All that I have on it now is an app for builds, the death replay and one that changes my keyboards color with the champion.. I believe. I know the pro's use the Death replay one, the keyboard one is just for RGB keyboards and the builds as far as I know are just suggestions. \nIf any of these sound like they shouldn't be used, I would be glad to hear about it so that I don't get in trouble.~{{champion:44}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sargonas","date":"2017-10-10T19:34:58.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel really terrible popping in here to follow up contradicting another Red on the forums, but just wanted to clarify that it is safe to use this app (at this time).

Misunderstanding happen all the time, but it's good to hear that Overwolf goes through you guys so well with their applications before releasing them. The only reason I asked is because someone I knew got banned over an overwolf application before. So I thought it was better to ask than to be sorry and lose out on my account that I've worked hard to build up over four seasons. \n\nWith the information posted, I'll look back into redownloading the plug in. I just wanted to be sure that I wasn't breaking any rules with how it worked. It gave quite a bit of information, thus I was concerned.","replies":[]}]}
