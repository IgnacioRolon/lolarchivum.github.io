Camille has her Passive which shield her (I use it like {{champion:201}} Barum's Sheild to make enemy team focus on me and save ADC or to poke and run to allow my ADC to farm), Q to make her escape or catch enemies (Similar to {{champion:43}} Karma's shield passive) but what makes Camille a good support is her E which stun multiple enemy champions (It's like {{champion:45}}  Veigar Stun, It's not right away and take around 1.5 sec to Stun enemies with), R which lock-in champions (More like {{champion:59}} Jarvan IV's wall to trap enemies within) and her W which slow multiple champions and preventing them from escaping (Which is more like {{champion:16}} Soraka's Q).\n\nThen I do my best wither I win or lose and I hope that explain to you how Camille's Ult isn't what define her as a possible support.","replies":[]}]}]}
