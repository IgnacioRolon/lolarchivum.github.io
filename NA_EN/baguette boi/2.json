I have uninstalled the program and reinstalled it but the same problem keeps happening, i'm not sure if it's the windows update or the game itself but i'd really like to know what I should do about this situation. I'm not sure if i'm the only person experiencing this however if i'm not the only person please comment below and if you have any suggestions to what i should do. Please let me know","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T20:43:48.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Windows 10 Anniversary update enabled the Game DVR feature in the Xbox Game Bar, which is causing system freezes in-game for some players.
