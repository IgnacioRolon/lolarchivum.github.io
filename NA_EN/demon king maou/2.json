I may not have climbed with him, However i will never forget the times we spent together. Together we memed about you becoming a baker and together we saw that dream come to fruition. However you never were the same after S7 and we spent less and less time together, Eventually i moved on to other's who could satiate my needs &amp; would go to fill my life for the next couple of years,{{champion:17}} .\r\n\r\nIt's sad to see you go but with no changes year after year after year something had to be done &amp; while it pains me to see you go entirely i know you'd sleep well knowing the legacy you leave behind will spawn a new era for pantheon players everywhere.\r\nSleep well old friend.\r\n\r\nI'll never forget the time we spent together in silver {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
