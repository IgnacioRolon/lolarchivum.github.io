She's not a real person, she's not even meant to exist in the real world. Her job is to be engaging on some level, and while I'm not saying a calmer character can't be engaging, she needs more than that. Ivern, Taliyah, Jhin, Camille and the Lamb half of Kindred are all calmer characters in some aspect, yet obviously they have a lot more than just calm and/or focused going for them. \n\nMy point is also that there is a middle ground where she's not completely dull and uninteresting, but she's not a caricature either. \n\nHeck, I think making her a full-on deadpan character a la something from an anime would have worked better.

Galio's new lore and look I hate--for reasons that I won't get into detail--but I can see the appeal and understand when other people like it. Its very high quality and delivers effectively on the fantasy they chose for him. \n\nWith Kai'Sa, this is more a combination of \"I think the direction was weak\" and \"I see what they were going for, can see the appeal, but think they failed at delivering on that concept\". \n\nIt's less like asking a Trekkie how they liked the new Star Wars and more like asking a Sonic the Hedgehog fan how they liked Sonic Boom (it was terrible).","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2018-02-23T17:17:04.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nah she's more like Sonic Adventure 2, some people say it's terrible because it's a 3D Sonic game and those should never exist in their opinion, While others think it's amazing and wish they would make a third one.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-02-24T21:54:51.448+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not like either of those things... because it is not a game, it is a character who is good or bad based on how well she is written and executed.  Sonic games can fail for multitudes of reasons beyond writing and characterization (though they can certainly fail for those reasons too).\n\nAlso, no one is saying Kai'sa is a failure because \"calm or collected characters should never exists\".  They are mostly saying that her characterization is weak, doesn't come across well or really fails to live up to her intense backstory.  You clearly like her, and that's fine... but you also clearly don't seem to understand characterization and how to discuss it or what the properties of a character even ARE.  \n\nAnd that's ALSO fine.  You can enjoy the character just fine without analyzing her like a writer or a critc might.  But if that is the case, stop acting like a writer or a critic and trying to defend her on grounds that you do not freaking understand.  Just... agree to disagree man.  It's not like Riot is gonna change her, so you're going to get exactly the character you seem to like.  So just let the people who enjoy rambling about lore and writing and shit do it and go play her.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-02-27T23:02:54.556+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree to disagree on this then... because I think you're projecting these ideas onto an otherwise milquetoast, blank-slate of a character.\n\nThe fact that you have a lot of \"If\" and \"we have to assume\" in there is kind of what I'm saying.  They could have defined her AND the void a lot better with just her VO.  The mere fact that you flat out said \"if we delve deeper\" is the issue.  It's a VO in a game where story is light... is there a reason why they couldn't have cranked her VO up a little and added some more lines to let us know what she was like, what the void was like and how she dealt with it and came out the way she did?  They put in about ten different ways she can say \"I shot you.  Ha.\" on her W and about ten more ways she can say \"go away bug\" when she attacks a void monster... could we not have ditched one of those generic \"I'll get you\" lines and gotten a soft \"It's funny how unsettling normal can be when you're used to weird\".  Not that exact line obviously, but something that brought that across.\n\nAnd no, I will NOT excuse the catsuit and make up.  If her VO didn't leave me grasping at straws to figure out what kind of character she even IS, I might... but since it left me with nothing her visuals matter to me a lot.  Hell, I'd say they should tell a story in and of themselves.  Looking at SO many other champs tells a story.  Darius is a big, brutal man.   He's got the grim-looking armor, the chopped short hair and the intimidating weapon.  Zoe is a childish goofball.  Swain is a powerful, sinister aristocrat with an obviously inhuman arm.  They all come across pretty well just from looking at them... how they look and how they move.  \n\nLook at Kai's splash art and you'd think... she's a hot chick in a bio-tech lookin' suit.  If you told me she was a space pirate come here to steal magic and sell on the intergalactic market, it would fit.  If you told me she was Samas Aran's cousin, here to hunt down alien criminals, it would fit.  If you told me she was a fashion model that got tricked into putting on a high-tech suit that would \"keep her thin and pretty forever\" and she can't take it off now... it would fit.  If you told me... well, you get the point.  Her visuals do not convey much about her, and in a lot of cases only raise questions when you bring up her actual backstory.  Why is she so pretty and normal looking?  Why is she so put together?  Why is she flashing cleavage and wearing make up?\n\nThe real answer to those questions is \"so teenage boys will buy her\"... and that's a good enough reason for the marketing department, but the writing department should be PISSED.  That is NOT how you write a good character... and it is EXACTLY what went wrong with her IMO.  It's pretty obvious that their goal with her was NOT to make an interesting character that felt real... but to make a broadly APPEALING character without much people could dislike about her.  No intense traits or actions.  No moody edgelord wangst, no bitchy demeanor, no \"helpless woman syndrome\" or PTSD style broken/shaken will, no alien mindset or physical features.  Everything that might make her in ANY way unappealing to someone or offend someone was filed off, save the generic sex appeal that EVERY character in media has be default unless some company wants to make a point about being \"progressive\" by tossin' out an Illaoi or a Zarya.  She was filed down to a shape they figured no one could hate, and because of it she has nothin about her that makes her interesting or exciting.  Her backstory is the only part of her that's got teeth to it... and it's the part that current in-game Kai may as well not have had, for how little it's changed her.  Christ, Akali did the \"calm but deadly I might have some emotional issues but they're ones I'm in control of\" thing a looong time ago.  Did ya know that?  I'll bet you didn't... because Akali is an old champ with very few lines that explain that.\n\nAnd that is how Kai is going to.  A functional kit with a pretty suit, a pretty face and no god-damned character.  Oh, there's a story about how much character she's got coming soon, I'm sure.  But if you need to do research to find out what she's like... I'm calling that a failure to portray your character as much as if you needed to read a book to understand enough about a character in a movie to enjoy that character.  There should be SOMETHING in the movie... or in this case, the game... that gives the audience a grounding on who she is, what she feels and what she's like.\n\nShe's so much a blank slate tho that... it worked.  People see her, like the design or the background or the kit or just her tits... and say \"well, I think she's like _________\" and just go with that.  She was made to headcanon her.  Like a cardboard cut out or a body pillow you can ascribe your own feelings to.  Of course she's a fragile soul that barely managed to endure.  Don't like that?  Of course she's a hardened badass that burst out of hell without looking back.  No?  Like 'em frosty?  Of course she's an emotionally deadened woman with alien impulses who no longer understands this thing called love.  \n\nYou can slip her around all manners of interpretations of what you feel her character is like a pretty suit and then hug the shit out of it.  Or admire it.  Or fap.  Whatever you're into.  Because they wanted her to have broad appeal at the expense of characterization.. so she can be exactly what you want her to be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2018-02-25T03:16:45.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Whamboozler,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xVwz4Uza,comment-id=0001000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-24T21:54:51.448+0000)\n> So just let the people who enjoy rambling about lore and writing and shit do it and go play her.\n\nI wish more people would understand this.
