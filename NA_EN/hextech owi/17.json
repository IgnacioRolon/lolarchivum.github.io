The jungle are the dark back-streets with only few lanterns to light them.\nThe jungle monsters are replaced as well, Razorfins takes the place of Wolves, Raptors become Wharf Rats or even Nagakabouros instead of the Baron Nashor.\n\nAnd digging a bit into what&#039;s been released in the Universe Website, any region is adaptable.\n\nEDIT: Also, it would be one more good way to introduce the game's lore to neophytes.","replies":[{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-07-25T15:38:23.670+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would add a new level of immersion to the game.

We've gotten some variety through ARAM's Howling Abyss and Butcher Bridge (make it part of a regular rotation, you cowards!), but it feels like such a waste having an expanding world with impressive designs that isn't represented outside of champions.

( mostly demacians champions = Demacia Skin, and so on )\n- Adding custom music for each Region\n- It would be an option to keep Summoner's Rift basic skin\n- Adding interactions for each Region ( Demacian champions would comment on Noxus, Zaunites would \"bash\" Piltover.... anything related to the lore or how they feel about the Region itself )\n- Adding customs skins for the objectives ( Baron, Dragons, Turrets, Monsters in the jungle )\n- Adding customs Announcer Voices depending on the current Region ( could be just an announcer that fits the Region such as a tone in their voice, an accent that makes you feel like the announcer is from the Region, or a champion of the Region )\n- Adding unique visuals for each Region ( a crowd of soldiers, blood, banners for Noxus, Raptors Riders, overwhelming light, a grand plaza like base for Demacia, stained glass, steams of toxic runoffs, overwhelming technology in Zaun, classy buildings, hextech technology, fine markets for Piltover....and I could go on )\n\nHope this thread will be seen by Riot!\nI would love this to be implemented, since it would feel so much more like a story you're writting in each game, and with a new battlefield.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AugustHeatHaze","date":"2018-07-25T21:53:09.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dota has custom maps and it would be really cool to see this in league!
