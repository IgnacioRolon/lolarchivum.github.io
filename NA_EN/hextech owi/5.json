Ekko was great, since he is a young boy trying to change this dangerous place to grant his family and friends a better future. Another Zaunite champion with noble motivations would be great. The Zaun Grey is still poisoning the people down there, maybe someone is trying to find a cure for this without requiring the people to replace their body parts with steel? Could even fit in the rebellious type of character, I could imagine an alchemist, trying to brew a cure for these problems. And since the chembarons own these biospheres, he/she breaks into them and steals plants for his/her own research. A plant obsessed scientist from Zaun would be something pretty new.
