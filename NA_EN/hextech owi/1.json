The bit of code that called for the music and raven SFX to play at game start was somehow disabled. {{sticker:sg-janna}} Bug confirmed.\n\nAs for the music not always playing, Swain and Zoe both have the music tied to RNG for a few reasons.\n\n1) The main one, to keep it fresh and special. When the song plays, you don't take it for granted.\n\n2) Keeping it subtle lets us make more skins without writing theme music for each one. The Star Guardian skins can have the music always play because it's GUARANTEED to be on point.\n\n3) In Swain's case, the music only plays if ravens appear on game start. We didn't want the ravens to always appear, because we were wary of setting a precedent where every champ calls attention to themselves all the time; it's more an easter egg, and there are easter egg-ish details tied to it that players still haven't discovered. (Find them to unlock the Feather Key.)\n\nAs I said, I'm a huge fan of the music myself, and I don't think we have a firm line in the sand for RNG. It's a feature we're interested in playing with more with future champs and VGUs if there's a cool opportunity, and we'll keep an open mind to tweaking it as we find more stuff that can live in this space.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiure","date":"2018-03-29T00:02:31.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">We didn't want the ravens to always appear, because we were wary of setting a precedent where every champ calls attention to themselves all the time\n\nI understand your concerns, but it's SO thematic for Swain. In fact, I often find myself getting upset that there aren't ENOUGH ravens when Swain is around. His visual and SFX design is so fantastic, but it's only half of his character - the ravens that you see out of the corner of your eye are the other half.\n\nThe ravens are so well done in that they aren't a huge distraction, but their presence is felt. It makes you a little unnerved to see them there. Loud noises like the announcer startle them into motion, but they come back, sitting still and just watching the action, waiting for things to settle down so that they can scavenge for a feast. It's also really fun to walk around the map and have them follow you around, kind of subtly announcing your presence.\n\nIt makes me very sad to hear that the ravens are deliberately downgraded. I don't mind the music not always playing (though please look into Ivern's music, since I think it might also be bugged) but the ravens are essential to Swain's visual presence and to not have them flocking around feels wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2018-03-29T17:28:58.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ampson (Ivern's sound designer) checked, his theme _should_ still be playing on game start.

LOL.\n\nAs for the \"downgrade\" thing, I completely understand the concerns because I've felt that pressure myself when playing or performing...and that's with a small audience of friends and family. I'm sure that when you're dealing with millions of people, you start to get a little concerned about how well something will be received. \n\nMy view on the situation is that Riot is a company of creatives, and you can't oblige creatives to create or avoid features due to the precedent they set. The users aren't blind consumers - they can tell when you ship an effect that is correct for the character (such as Jhin's music or Swain's raven flock), and they can appreciate that by itself without clamoring for, say, Cassiopeia to have an army of tiny snakes slithering around the map.\n\nThe way I see it, and the way you probably argued it to others:\n\nIvern music: Should always play, or at least most of the time. Sets tone of rebirth and new life. Fits into Ivern's storyline as a cruel warlord who was transmuted and redeemed into the guardian of the forest, with a vast new respect for all living things.\nSwain music: Not necessary; RNG is fine, sets mood occasionally but is not an essential part of Swain's character. I like the theme music but I barely notice if it's there or not.\nSwain ravens: Should always flock around. Sets tone of Swain as a foreboding presence who is more than what meets the eye. Slightly unsettling to see those ravens out of the corner of your eye. Fulfills power fantasy for Swain players. BIG part of Swain's characterization. Also, we lost Beatrice for this.\n\nBig fan, love your work, making attempts to build portfolio of narrative design work (especially in gameplay) which is a lot harder and slower than it sounds which means a LOT of respect to you, xoxoxo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2018-03-29T02:58:48.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agh, it hurts to hear you call it a downgrade. {{sticker:sg-soraka}}  I try to see it more \"glass half full\" myselfâ€”this was the way we could ensure the feature would ship _in spite_ of concerns. \n\nI'll pass your feedback on, thanks for sharing how hyped the music and ravens get you; also, I think I know who to ask about Ivern.
