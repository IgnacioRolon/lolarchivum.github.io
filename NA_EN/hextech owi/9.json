Xayah and Rakan can change elements of their appearance but just never do before us. Nidalee and Udyr have diluted Vastayan blood in their veins and I guess the justification for that is that they can transform, but only in very regimented ways. Nidalee can only turn into the same cougar, and Udyr can change his arms into animalistic forms using animal spirit, even old Swain was Vastayan for a little while this too was reflected in his transformation into a scary birb thing. Xayah and Rakan can probably change more free form: color, feather density and the like.\n\nThat's why I think this a pure Vastayashai'rei with every deviation in the gene pool a bit of the willful shapeshifting ability goes away. I like what this does to the whole Vastaya dynamic because Xayah and Rakan looked down on Swain, Nidalee and Udyr.\n\nRakan to Udyr \"It is from our blood your gifts came, and my hand that took it back.\"\nRakan to Swain \"You were given Vastayan blood, yet chose to be blind.\"\n\nWhen they themselves are essentially slightly purer mutts of what they idolize. Then they get angry at Ionian humans for persecuting them while Ionian nationals are pissed off at Noxus for oppressing them signaling this cycle of hatred that really has nothing to do with what people do to one another, but more to do with drawing lines between who is \"us\" and who is \"they\".\n\nIt paints them as hypocrites which is interesting what could only make this better is that if the new champ is a pure Vastayashai'rei and is disinterested by Xayahs' passionate distaste of humans or puzzled by her prideful claiming of a bloodline.","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2018-11-19T00:19:00.177+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"If she does shapeshift into other champs, I'm hoping her taunts are imitation/mockery of the champs in question.\n\nTo Yasuo: \"*fake gruff voice* I don't deserve a name, but it is Yasuo.

The champion may be causing hallucinations or some other form of illusion to appear to be something that it isn&#x27;t, like how a green chameleon sitting completely still could be mistaken for a leaf. Mimicry and illusion are different from true shape shifting, since they don&#x27;t actually change what they are, just what they _appear_ to be.\n\ni feel like they are most definitely shapeshifting because it would be weird if the character could only create accurate illusions for only some characters. the vines and the mist that appears on the “illusions/hallucinations” make it seem like the new characters just transformed into them but it’s imperfect and they can’t hide the transformation completely","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kárma","date":"2018-11-19T01:13:21.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"are they going to release the new champ on pre season or on season 9?","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2018-11-19T01:16:03.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the reveal is tomorrow/the 19th, so I imagine they're getting released not too long after that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krupaz","date":"2018-11-19T05:13:36.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"going on PBE for next cycle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-11-18T21:57:08.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nah, pretty sure she is a plant mage and from Kumungu.","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech OwI","date":"2018-11-18T21:59:35.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sukishoo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=pNXMW9BP,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-11-18T21:57:08.176+0000)\n>\n> Nah, pretty sure she is a plant mage and from Kumungu.\n\n{{champion:143}}?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gentleman Gems","date":"2018-11-19T13:06:37.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_15 RP say's it's going to be able to turn into other champs temporarily._","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gems","date":"2018-11-22T01:18:49.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHERE'S MY 15 RP?!\n\n~~Jk, probably was easy to guess anyway~~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sirus otter","date":"2018-11-19T14:08:25.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because i keep seeing everyone talk about this champ being a shape shifter. they arn't. \nin the video its showing off darius, nunu and ahri and what bothers them the most emotionally.\ndarius lost his wife\nnunu lost his mom\nand ahri believes she is a monster\n\nthe champ isnt shape shifting, they are showing the champions greatest emotional trauma","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech OwI","date":"2018-11-19T14:25:16.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sirus otter,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=pNXMW9BP,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2018-11-19T14:08:25.702+0000)\n>\n> Because i keep seeing everyone talk about this champ being a shape shifter. they arn&#x27;t. \n> in the video its showing off darius, nunu and ahri and what bothers them the most emotionally.\n> darius lost his wife\n> nunu lost his mom\n> and ahri believes she is a monster\n> \n> the champ isnt shape shifting, they are showing the champions greatest emotional trauma\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nWhy would Nunu represent the loss of his mother as himself? \nSince Ahri already sees herself as a monster, why would she further self represent as another monster or something she isn't (which is actually what she might want to be, not herself)? \nDarius having an emotional trauma about his wife by looking at a flower seems like a big jump to a conclusion.\n\nAnd all these floaty bits look like imperfect transformation to me.","replies":[{"poster":"sirus otter","date":"2018-11-19T14:28:12.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"uhm... do you have any idea what your even talking about. honest question","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech OwI","date":"2018-11-19T14:35:11.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sirus otter,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=pNXMW9BP,comment-id=000b00010000,timestamp=2018-11-19T14:28:12.167+0000)\n>\n> uhm... do you have any idea what your even talking about. honest question\n\nNot more than you.
