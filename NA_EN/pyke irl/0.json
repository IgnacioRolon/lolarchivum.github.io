(Mind you I&#039;ve never really done this before but I&#039;m going to do my best.)\r\n\r\n* Overall, the client is a pretty big improvement, and is much more visually appealing.  Especially that freaking one pixel off panel in the old client home screen...\r\n\r\n* People have been asking for a long time, and I&#039;m not sure if there is any old code making this impossible in the store page, but spot saving would be really, really nice when browsing the store.\r\n\r\n* On player profile pages, there is a lot of unused space and looks a bit awkward.  Another thing that kind of confuses me about it, is that the summoner level is still displayed next to their summoner icon, which is kind of an unnecessary thing to me.  Once you hit 30, no one really cares what your summoner level is.\r\n\r\n* The Esports page is well layed out, and looks good, visually.  The one thing I would change, is raise the broadcast selector from the bottom, since there is enough space to do so above it.\r\n\r\n* In the collection page, Champions, spells, and runes are easy to look at, and easy to use.  My issue arises with the Masteries page, the mastery icons are spaced too far apart to really see them, when writing new mastery pages, especially in lobby, clicking the icons is slow and very delayed.  I would like to see the return of clicking 5 piece mastery once, and putting 5 points into it, I liked that and it made writing pages MUCH easier and quicker.\r\n\r\n* The home page feels a little weird to use, now that you can&#039;t minimize the friends list, but I&#039;m fairly certain that will just take some time to get used to.  One thing I would like to recommend is adding the option in your friends list to hide mobile users.  They&#039;re not necessarily online and take up most of the space in my friends list, I almost never interact with those on mobile and would much prefer to only see those actually logged on.\r\n\r\n* The game lobby is a bit weird to look at, considering the background is no longer animated.  I&#039;m sure those with less powerful computers are rejoicing, but for me, the animations remind me that the client is not frozen, and that I am currently searching for the game, as the timer on the right when searching isn&#039;t something that I immediately see when I check to see if I missed the queue pop.\r\n\r\nOther than that the client seems nice and I like it.  Will continue to test, checking for bugs, and other bothersome features/nonfeatures.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-22T00:35:43.459+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Surf Shack Tito,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=B25ts57J,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-21T22:37:46.151+0000)\n>\n> I&amp;#039;ve been using the client for about a week now and have a few initial thoughts.

So, it is a good thing to have, in case you forget.\n\n> * The Esports page is well layed out, and looks good, visually.

There has been a lot of conversations about not being able to edit masteries fast enough right before a match. We are looking into it.\n\n> * The home page feels a little weird to use, now that you can&amp;#039;t minimize the friends list, but I&amp;#039;m fairly certain that will just take some time to get used to.

Hiding mobile users would beat that purpose.\n\n> * The game lobby is a bit weird to look at, considering the background is no longer animated.

We are doing good progress in that area and as the update client matures, more users should be able to execute it at full capacity. It is not easy, but we have a lot of smart people looking into it.\n\n> Other than that the client seems nice and I like it.

I would encourage you to not to view this as \"opting out of interactivity with friends\" but rather recognize this as us asking for the option to remove one UI element, who's function is already being redundant in **some** scenarios, and useless in some others.\n\nI know this is a **big** ask, and something that would only happen 6+ months from now, but I think the optimal implementation of this feature would be on a \"per group\" basis. This way, I could hide mobile users in the \"General\" list, but not in my \"Duo\" list.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-22T19:16:45.448+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Garrotte,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=B25ts57J,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-10-22T07:09:41.208+0000)\n> \n> I know this is a **big** ask, and something that would only happen 6+ months from now, but I think the optimal implementation of this feature would be on a &quot;per group&quot; basis.
