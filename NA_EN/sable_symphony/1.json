Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.\"\r\n\r\nThis is my first post on the boards, the reason being I've never really had a problem. But now, this has really gotten out of hand. I always find myself with this black screen followed by the prompt shown in the link.  This is not a consistent error, and pops up randomly. This occurrence may happen after 3 games, or maybe after 7 games. I never know. It is only due to the fact I enjoy this game I've always just tried to ignore it and play off the low priority queue games.  This cycle has now been done over 3 times. It has gotten to the point where I'm scared to actually play a game because of something like this happening again and placing me into a **5 games 20 minutes low priority queue**.\r\n\r\nI have repaired the application as well as uninstalled and reinstalled the application. Neither have been a definite solution. I've also tried rebooting my computer, and found it does not work either. I believe this is not a problem on my side, because I am typing up this thread right now as I stare at this stupid pop-up. Each time this happens I tell my friends to remake the game, making me lose the usual LP and  time that goes with it. Honestly I'd like a solution to this. I don't know the proper procedures for typing up a complaint but I hope this will suffice.\r\n\r\nIf anybody knows anything about this issue your help would be very much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-14T09:22:51.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-14T21:57:45.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's some great info inside this guide that often resolve this type of error. It's unfortunate that you've received a low priority queue, however, a disconnection from a match negatively impacts everyone, even if it was not intentional. This is a reason why the Leaverbuster system treats all disconnections equally and why any penalties cannot be removed or reduced. \n\nBecause your disconnections are intermittent, it's probable that the issue is with an unstable connection to the servers. Because of this, I'm confident that the connection guide Rineyy linked will put you on the right track to resolving the issue so future penalties are less likely.\n\nLet me know if you continue to see issues after taking the steps in the guide.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"R0GER","date":"2016-07-14T20:18:13.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it just happened to me a few times during ARAM, and i also checked with my isp(my isp has 24 hrs support), they clearly told has nothing to do with my ends.","replies":[]}]}
