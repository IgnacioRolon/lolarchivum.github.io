Other than the obvious things like no splash art yada yada. I ran across that sometimes his  Decimating Smash, Roar of the Slayer, and Unstoppable Onslaught will do no damage. Also, sometimes his decimate won't knock up enemies even when fully charged.\r\n\r\nThanks for all you do.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-26T03:55:58.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, we are having some issues on PBE that might be causing those things to happen. Hopefully the new build tomorrow will resolve most of these issues, if not we are working hard on it!\n\nMoving forward, can we please keep PBE bugs on PBE? http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bugs \nI spend equally as much time on PBE as on this forum (Serious)","replies":[]}]}
