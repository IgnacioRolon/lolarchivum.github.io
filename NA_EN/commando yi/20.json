You could grab purple smite for a significantly faster clear (when it had less cooldown), you could get the enchant that increase damage per stack and your jungler wouldn't hit like a wet noodle at the end of the game. I have the feeling that they pulled too quickly on this one. They should instead of used the power of the jungler items so make jungler impactful during the game rather than bringing them back to being supportive to the team. In example, if you build tanky, you won't be as tanky as your top laner (if he goes tanky). Same goes for damage, you won't be as useful than your mid laner or your adc. That leaves the support style of jungler and at this point, I'd rather just play support and roam once in a while. \n\nI like the actual jungle though post-early game, you have a good choice of vision, objectives, etc. But your character doesn't feel fun anymore (which is why I don't jungle unless I'm stuck with it).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2015-02-26T20:58:13.452+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you for doing this, I much prefer this to the typical whining.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2015-02-28T03:29:15.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was very useful.","replies":[]}]}
