I recently got permabanned for 5 reports in my last 20 games. How can I be heavily reported in 3 games with only 5 reports? I have no idea. I don't know if Riot actually plays their game, but 5 reports in 20 sounds pretty tame. I play jungle, and generally when you start losing everyone looks to the jungler as to why they are losing. That's just generally how it works because lanes expect the jungle to win their lane especially in lower elo's where the just don't understand how the game works. Also, you ever disagree with a person and turns out they're duo? Yeah that's 2 reports right there. I don't know exactly how to reform the banning system, however, I do feel permanent suspension is way too common. I usually play competitive league (as in 5v5 teams formed prior and play in tourneys) and pretty much everyone in that scene has at least one perma banned account. The reasoning is simple, these are people that want to win first and foremost and that makes their dialogue a little rough around the edges. I don't think toxicity should ever lead to perma ban when muting is a feature in the game, toxic gameplay is much more annoying to every single person in the community. Mainly, I'd like some of my money back just to know Riot isn't trying to take it and run with it. I even still had like 3,000 rp on it that I never got to spend. What do you guys think? Is permaban too prevalent? Is Riot falling deeper into the white knight propaganda similar to Overwatch? Or am I just a drama queen?

I don't want to get mad over a dumb video game, but you know what, I do. BUT...I get to choose how I handle that anger. We all have a choice.\n\nChoose to be a part of the community that want to see, don't choose to be a problem in the community that is. Sure, maybe smurfs, inters, and trolls are more common than toxic behavior (I highly doubt that is the case but I can't argue with it because I haven't done the research)...even if that is the case that doesn't actually make toxicity less of an issue. Doesn't make you less of a dick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wonderloss","date":"2019-04-21T23:18:24.391+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one likes toxicity the fact you think it is okay is a huge reason this community is unforgivably toxic especially to new players, just take your head out of your ass and realize what you were doing.
