Tiny issue but still, it&#039;s an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-09T16:06:17.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey YoNightmare7! \nThanks for the report! Are you seeing a green question mark in place of it? I *think* it's a missing asset that's hooked up improperly, and if that's the case, I've got a ticket logged and can have someone look into this today!","replies":[{"poster":"YoNightmare7","date":"2018-04-09T21:29:45.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just see the ability doing it's thing normaly only problem is the bomb explosion animation doesn't show up, but I don't see any green question mark in game.\n\nI noticed during game there's nothing after the bomb explosion but there's a tiny green square after bomb explosion during replays.\n\nI was having a tough time downloading the replay to make it so you guys at riot could view it, so basically i just took 2 screenshots before and after bomb explosion in replay. If there's a way you can see my replays through my account be sure to check ''Zilean bug''. Here's the link to the screenshots!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/isaacrenaud1?lang=fr)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-09T21:41:49.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, yep! The green square has a question mark in it - it's definitely way easier to see when you're in a practice tool and not in game like you were. :P I really appreciate you getting screenshots, though. It makes it much easier to make sure we're both on the same page/seeing the same thing. \n\nI've been talking with a VFX artist today, and it seems the fix is more complex than just the VFX for that part of the spell becoming unhooked, so he's enlisted the help of an engineer to see what might be going on here. :)","replies":[{"poster":"YoNightmare7","date":"2018-04-09T21:48:20.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I'm glad I got useful!
