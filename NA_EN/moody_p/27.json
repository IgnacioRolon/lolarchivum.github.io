I understand that by them hitting Conquerer it’ll hit jax and them as well. But consider it takes them down about the same. He’ll still struggle against his “counters”. He’ll still lose against them, but nerf him and conquerer, you run the risk of nerfing him too hard. His R changes did make a big difference, but we’re also looking at post Conquerer rework. \n\nAnother aspect to see here is those in higher elo also know how to fight him, namely by dropping the Maiden first.

The rest of us are talking about live because, that’s what Moody P started their post with, and Critmaster Garen followed up with, talking about live stats. Not proplay, but the rest. \n\nCurrently, Diamond+ he’s at only 54% winrate, 10% pick rate. High, but not as bad as it could be. https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Yorick/\n\nThis is also disregarding that pro play is the elite, but they’re also an incredibly small sample size. How often have Azir, Kalista, and Ryze been gutted because of pro? Not to say there’s no value in pro stats, but they don’t always paint the best picture as far as solo queue goes.\n\n> i guess pros dont know how to fight him since he's a priority pick\n\nYou say that. Yet he still carries a 57% winrate in pro. They know how to best beat him, but he also isn’t always first pick. Notice most of his matches are against Urgot, a champ that can’t escape his wall, and even then he’s still at 57% against him after 14 games. One of his recent matches was even against a Karma.\n\nYou also have to note the number of games played. \n\nKorea has the most at 9 matches, and he’s at 44% winrate. Won 4 matches.\n\nEUW: 6 matches, 50% WR, so won only 3\nPT and VN: 3 matches: 66.6% WR, won 2 matches\nJP and CIS: 3 matches, won all 3.\nNA: 3 matches, 33.3% WR, so won only one.\nTW and BR: 2 matches, both only won 1.\nES: He won both matches\nLAT: won the one match he played\nIT, TR, FR: he lost his one match in each. \n\nNo, proplay he’s not that bad and is getting shut down, whether used by poorer teams, or the opponent knowing exactly how to beat him (see Yorick vs Jax in the one recent NA match).\n\n> what does this even mean\n\nThis is the scientific method that we learn about in science classes. You take something you want to observe, and change one variable, and then observe. If you change more than one thing at one, you don’t know what caused any chanes you observed.\n\nThe same holds true here. You really adjust one thing at a time. If you adjust too many things, things can shift horribly. Like Aatrox losing his dash charges and his healing on minions. This is why people say to nerf Riven *or* Spear of Shojin. It’s why getting the Sejuani treatment is a thing, too many things changed in a short span caused horrible gutting in season 5. Or in a reverse case, Ornn in season 7 getting overbuffed. It’s why you don’t nerf a champ *and* buff their counters at the same tiem.\n\nThis is a proven way to observe things and make appropriate adjustments. In this instance, don’t nerf Yorick and Conquerer at the same time. Nerf Conquerer, then see where Yorick stands, then tap again if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, since he’s on yor permaban list, might I recommend a champ that can easily avoid his E, take out his ghouls, or simply kill the Maiden as soon as you can. Without her, he loses a lot of strength.","replies":[{"poster":"A Chaotic Mind","date":"2019-02-28T00:05:46.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"54% winrate is literaly the same as riven, champion that the board is having a stroke about, but yorick is also valued in pro play. this happened before conqueror was changed. actually changing conqueror didnt impacted his w/r at all. almost like yorick is too strong. scientific method and all\nim also done arguing with you, dont @ me again","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2019-02-28T01:25:26.323+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Chaotic Mind,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=07Ys1bPL,comment-id=00030000000000000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-28T00:05:46.084+0000)\n>\n> 54% winrate is literaly the same as riven, champion that the board is having a stroke about, but yorick is also valued in pro play. this happened before conqueror was changed. actually changing conqueror didnt impacted his w/r at all. almost like yorick is too strong. scientific method and all\n> im also done arguing with you, dont @ me again\n\nRiven also tends to have a higher playrate, has been complained about much longer than Yorick, and has been a much longer and more obnoxious presence in higher elos.
