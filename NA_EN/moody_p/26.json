Because in the opposite situation you are untouchable. The ADC class has the best damage:counter play ratio out of any class and is therefore immensely valuable. &quot;Late game insurance&quot; has nothing to do with it; marksmen were still must pick back in season 2 when some fighters scaled equally as hard as a marksman. The only counter play to most marksmen is to remove them from the game. In a favorable meta this isn&#039;t even an option; tank meta means you stack tanks, one control mage and maybe an Enchanter and you let the two ADCs stat check down the rest of the team. Enchanter meta - same result. \r\n\r\nAnd before someone says &quot;well reduce the damage and make them tankier.&quot; One, almost none of you actually talk about this until you&#039;re confronted about asking for buffs to the mandatory class. Two, this will not change anything and honestly will probably make the game worse. You still have no mechanical counter play beyond getting removed from the equation entirely. Tankier ADC is just an attempt to sideline the issue; unless you are completely abandoned by your team most enemies can&#039;t do anything to you once you become relevant. Because this game is now DESIGNED around you being strong damage but extremely vulnerable. It&#039;s what assassins are designed to exploit. It&#039;s what enchanters are designed to negate. You have two classes minimum that exist solely around the premise that you are easy to kill. You cant change that on a whim. \r\n\r\nMarksman have never and will probably never be completely irrelevant unless critical strike systems change massively or the champions get reworked to the same standards that carries from other classes have been getting. You know what happens when fighters or assassins are bad? They don&#039;t get picked. At ALL. Marksmen have never had this issue; one kind of marksman ends up weak so you pick another. Late game not happening? We pick Lucian and Draven. Early game doesn&#039;t matter? Bust out the Kog Maw.  Utility carry meta? Sivir and Ashe. This is not a problem of marksmen being pushed out by assassins or mages; marksmen are just as guilty of doing this to each other as anyone else and we have 9 years of history to prove it.\r\n\r\nMarksmen are simultaneously a compulsive pick and yet they are completely at the mercy of the game around them. Marksmen are almost never viable on their own merits and always become strong or weak as a response to the rest of the game, including which ADC itemization is strongest. Because they HAVE to be with the way they work. Yeah, the game doesn&#039;t always suck you off. It happens to all of us. You&#039;ll get your turn again; we all do. Fucking around with crit for the third time does not change this in the long term; if you want this dynamic to change then the champions need to change directly. \r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t to put people down for not enjoying which champions are good right now. It&#039;s perfectly fine to want your champion to be better. But if you want a systemic change then you need to address the real issues surrounding the class. Issues that throwing numbers around on a slider will not solve.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-02-06T14:10:00.961+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":23,"body":"> The ADC class has the best damage:counter play ratio out of any class and is therefore immensely valuable.\n\nNo wait a second.\n\nI thought that was Mages?","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-02-06T15:20:27.722+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Rhinark,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jg3IEvL0,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-02-06T14:10:00.961+0000)\n>\n> No wait a second.\n> \n> I thought that was Mages?\n\nmages tend to have their burst designed around skillshots. skillshots have inherent counterplay. there are exceptions and problematic champions in every class, and even when they do have kit inherent counterplay theyre not neccessarily good champions because of individual problems.\n\nbut marksmens lack of counterplay is a systematic issue with the entire class.\n\nthere are however also very few marksmen who do have counterplay inbuilt into their kits.\n\nhilariously enough those are  {{champion:81}} {{champion:119}} \n\nits just that they have entirely different issues. ezreals q being able to apply on hit effects makes him the king of item abuse. dravens passive makes him so feast or famine that draven players have a reputation of being notoriously toxic, because when theyre not steamrolling games, they tend to be impotent for the entire game, which makes them snap really fast when games are not going well for them.\n\nbut fundamentally speaking, their kits are designed around mechanics that have actual counterplay, and they dont just rely on piling up stats onto their auto attacks alone, but how well they utilize the mechanics their kits offer.\n\nif you make draven drop his axes, you severely cut into his carry potential.\n\nif you manage to dodge ezreals q and especially his w, you are actually able to fight him without having to straight up outstat him, like other adc. he doesnt get to reduce the cooldowns on his abilities when he doesnt hit you, which makes him less mobile.\n\nbasically, their kits have elements theyre built around, that are **unreliable**. this unreliability justifies their carry potential.\n\nif you compare this to champions like {{champion:67}} there is only one single element in her kit that is unreliable and directly outplayable, which is her wall stun, and it doesnt even matter, because its attached to a direct target displacement which is worse than the stun itself for a lot of champions. this makes vayne an entirely 100% stat check champion.

I play ADC as an off role, and these two have a similar fallback pattern to the mages I enjoy. You can succeed by playing well with the team, not just by crushing lane or solo-carrying late. \n\n>A better way to take them IMO is more unique innate steroids that help define their individuality better and give something more to play around.\n\nYour complaint here is pretty specific to attack speed, actually. ADCs already have these unique steroids in some form, but their core builds inherently outscale the need to play around them. Early game ADC power revolves almost entirely around maximizing these steroids and playing around them well. It's a major skill factor in ADC play.\n\nUsing Ashe and Sivir as examples, a good Ashe will stack on minions, maintain the stack, and then trade with Q. A good Sivir will win short trades with a W reset and then gtfo (before 6). Jinx's Q has a good deal of this as well. What you're asking for here already exists in the game, and it's the very thing that most ADC players want to avoid. 100% of focus is spent on how quickly they can buy their way to right-click draintanking without having to leverage their kit.\n\nI think you could find a new balance by using crit as a flat AD multiplier and cutting way back on attack speed scaling from items. This would give you bigger, slower damage without RNG and with a lot more reliance on attack speed steroids, spells, and utility. In short, the ADC baseline would be more along the lines of Jhin, Graves, and Ashe and less like Tristana, Twitch, and Vayne.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AjXtar","date":"2019-02-06T17:12:02.621+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":">we should have the best damage to compensate for that\n\nhuh?

It sucked.\n\nMore or less true, but a lot of people seem to forget the other half of the issue, which is that Riot had been nerfing tank items and making them cheaper (cuz MUH DMG OUTSCALES DEFENSES), which combined with tank dmg buffs and new tank runes gave them a stupid midgame powerspike.\nMy point is the problem wasnt as simple as \"ADCs scaled slower\".\n\n> Now Riot is trying out the other approach: lower damage output, but with more tools and better overall itemization (including viable defensive tools like the new PD shield). Personally, this is the option I would prefer, and I hope that the new system they rolled out performs well in that mission.\n\nThe thing is we already had a similar approach during season 2 and 3. Sure oneshot was harder so the game seemed more forgiving but good luck trying to kill an ADC who rushes BT and finishes his build with 2 tank items (legit tank items like randuins). \nRight now I cant remember the reason they gave to make tank items weaker and cheaper as I said before but I wouldnt be surprised if it was this same problem.\n\nI think the point Moody is trying to make is that ADCs need a radical change in the way they function.

They need more counterplay besides killing them.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-02-06T18:01:38.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I think the point Moody is trying to make is that ADCs need a radical change in the way they function.

They need more counterplay besides killing them.\n\nI talked a lot about it with a Mod here that thinks similar but the problem is that he says that adcs as Ashe are fine kit wise so after that I started to feel that he didn't knew exactly what he wanted, he also always says that Riot was about to rework adcs after 8.11 but the evil adc mains forced Riot to buff them so they stopped reworking them, and it didn't mattered saying to him that it was only on his head, he is still sure and claims that was **obvious** that after 8.11 riot was about to rework all adcs.\n\nHe'll probably come to this thread and read this comment later, if I'm wrong on anything I said, please, Captain, correct me.\n\nIt can be changed, the way of how adcs work can be radically changed, it's not imposible.\n\nBut you have to be sure of what you are asking, and be coherent:\n\nYou are asking for a complete overhaul of the gameplay of:\n\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:203}} (?){{champion:96}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:498}} \n\nAnd no, the kits of more spellcasters as Lucian, MF or Ezreal are not fine if what you want to change is how adcs work, those adcs still share the same core gameplay that all adcs share and if you think that they are fine you dont really want to change adcs, you may think that you want it but deep down you still want adcs to be adcs. (And saying that Ashe wouldn't need a rework in this case is beyond surrealism)\n\nAnd I mean a real overhaul, the Marksman Update of 5.21 would be a joke compared to this.\n\nIs it posible? Yes, technically it can happen.\n\nBut the change isn't just massive, it's **massive** Not only because you would be reworking the core gameplay of 20 champs which is already the biggest change that would ever happen on this game but because the whole concept of the game would drastically change.\n\nAdcs went to Botlane along with a champ that could be useful with no gold in the first place because EUW pro players realized that it was the correct way to play League of Legends, and soon the others regions copied them and all started to play adcs bot. It wasn't Riot at the start who decided to make Botlane for adcs, it was the Community and Riot saw that and then they enforced the idea of having an adc on Botlane for years and years.\n\nLol without adcs would be basically League of Legends 2: Electric Bugaloo (short joke, dont hate me).\n\nAs a conclusion: It's fair to want to have the adcs as they are now removed/reworked, but please then understand exactly what you are asking, how many years it would take Riot to completely rework the gameplay of 20 champs and how would the game be after that.\n\nSinceriously, by someome that has been playing adcs since 2012 and who literally started to play this game when I saw Caitlyn release.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamenawerl","date":"2019-02-06T18:17:48.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough.\n\nStill, I just realized there are 2 simpler approaches: Lets call em the Draven approach and the Ashe approach:\n\n1- The Draven approach: I wouldnt say Draven is the healthiest ADC being so feast or famine and killing everyone in 2 autos but even then he still has some interesting counterplay like someone else said before. You make him drop his axes and he suddenly becomes much less dangerous without the need to kill him. So, counterplayable steroids. The opposite of Kog pressing a button and melting your team just because he pressed a button.\n\n2- The Ashe approach: Basically you make marksmen picked for their utility instead of their insane damage and carry potential (ofc with exceptions, like in every other role). Because lets be honest, Ashe only gets picked when other ADCs are trash tier. She has it harder to 1v5 until way later in the game and she brings something unique to the table (permaslow, ranged initiation and scouting).\n\nThey may not solve everything but they would be a step forward, at least.\n\nMaybe unrelated, but I think the best designed ADC (and my most played one) is Jhin.

Their abilities include their passives; \nGraves will Q2--> Auto ----> E ---> Auto ---> R to kill you. His passive augments his basic attacks, which do massive damage. \nLucian will Q ---> Auto ---> W --> Auto ----> E ----> Auto ----> Q ----> Auto because hes a sheen-caster. Much like Riven, he is designed to weave basic attacks. \nJhin will use his Q to poke, his W to CC, his E to slow, his ult to finish, and his passively augmented basic attacks (his fourth shot) for a majority of his damage. Jhin is assassin-esque where he has the tools to perform absurd damage very quickly. \n\nThe difference between an AD caster and an AP caster is that they _HAVE DIFFERENT ITEMIZATION AVAILABLE_. AP casters dont have access to the same effective bulk that AD casters do, and _actually suffer for it_. A mage who doesnt get at least a Ludens, rabbadons, and a spellbinder will not have the AP required to be truly effective as a burst caster where an AD bruiser who gets Hydra, Steraks, and Black cleaver WILL have enough bulk and damage to be effective.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nAlso, i generally play tanks...

some i wish to debate, you see i dont think marksmen fail to understand rather many just didnt know what to actually ask for to ensure it doesn't come back to bite them later. \n\n\nMarksmen have indeed have had their survival tied to others as a demerit to having the DPS potential that they do, however this creates a massive problem right away, because when the marksman and their assistants are capable of enduring the attackers then the attackers become useless, the main ones here being assassins, burst mages and divers,but when the marksmen and their assistants(supports&peeling frontliners mainly) cant endure they become useless instead. \n\n\nRight from the very start its setup so that at least 2 classes will always be in a state of uselessness, this from my perspective is not something many seems to have actually paid any attention to \n\n\nTo circumvent the problem of botlane being too good at surviving it was made so that often when the attacker plays their cards well it doesnt matter if the botlane did everything they could, they die anyway, which naturally tilts the poor buggers, and the combos were made to be quick to make it so that they wouldnt be easily interrupted once they start as the attackers would be too weak otherwise. \n\nThus we saw a demand for marksmen with enhanced self peel, lucian and kai´sa being prime examples, they have less raw DPS than a kog but they are many times harder to kill in return when played by a experienced hand BUT they still deal enough damage to easily kill most non tank targets which creates a niche for the \"anti tank\" ones to be in. \n\nThen we have a situation where the attackers need more damage once again to be viable, they need enough damage to kill even if something gets dodged....and this is a single attacking person as well, and there was also a need for the defenders to be better at peeling as the nonmobile ones still could not survive on their own. \n\nAssassin/mage/fighter buffs followed by support ones+new items for supports. \n\n\nOh and at a point we had the part with tanks being made tankier to differentiate them from other melee which prompted a need for more damage to compensate for that as well, while other melee either remained the same or were made less durable, which resulted in tanks being so durable that they could not really be killed by anyone except specialists on the basis that their resistances were too high and their healthbars massive as well, which created the idea that true damage and max health damage were good to double down on. \n\n\nThe tank update, the addition of Conqueror, infinity edge reworked into doing true damage and {{item:3151}} buffs, it wasnt until this point i think that marksmen just sat down saying \"FK it man we dont need more damage, we need help to stay alive to use what we have!\"\n\nAt a similar point i think many if not most others also started asking for survival buffs, everyone except the tanks had started dying very very quickly. \n\nBut that request from those marksmen is infact a poorly considered one, it would simply trigger the wheel to spin again, a cycle of a kind which is very much what no one really wants, so those who spent some time thinking instead asked for lower damage but more defenses instead, and it seems this is the path Riot has chosen to go with to a degree.\n\nIts shown with the recent changes of {{item:3046}} and{{item:3031}} to be specific, {{item:3031}} losing its true damage and reverted to a past edition but a nerfed state in exchange for {{item:3046}} becoming a huge survival booster, hopefully something will change with how things play out here, because when the marksmen lose damage they dont need to die so quickly and everyone will have more room to breathe.\n\nBecause if the time is extended then there is more time for things like multiple rotations, multiple skillshots and more need to move around and position correctly. \n\nAssassins can still jump in and deal huge damage, but even if they fail a outright kill they can go back out and then jump in again a couple seconds later, many of them have gained the tools for that. \n\nEnhancers can become more team oriented rather than marksman only. \n\n\nThe only thing left i worry about is the tanks&conqueror deal that is left, because while Conqueror is a issue its also true that tanks just soaking damage like nothing and then using base damage to kill someone building damage before they themselves die is kinda ridiculous......in addition to a few outliers like {{champion:67}} with {{item:3124}}  that are equally ridiculous or worse.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2019-02-06T15:14:04.594+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The only thing left i worry about

items. Fighters and juggernauts continually opt into Trinity over Cleaver, which reduces the power to fight a tank, and Last Whisper items seemed to rarely be picked up. Part of this stems from what you picked up on though, damage coming out faster and higher. Chanps aren’t picking up Cleaver or %Pen because they need the upfront burst to kill the other damage dealers. Perhaps as things shift away from that, some focus could be put back into armor pen items, which do favor the DPS of ADCs and sustained damage Fighters\n\nAs a tank lover, I couldn’t care less if I die faster because you built the items to deal with me.

Then added with removing those truly strange parts like Ornns 80% max health damage or Vayne+rageblade would probably not solve every issue people take with league and it would be a lot of work, but i personally believe that doing so would go a long good way. \n\nClarifying champion identities, their roles, what they should and should not be able to do would in turn help one determine when a champion is out of line or underperforming more easily as well. \n\nBut at some point he did discuss the crit marksmen and their lack of interactive play as well, they just stand there and shoot (often from a long distance) which is unhealthy and a issue on it´s own,  things like that could use in depth work as well to make them more like  {{champion:145}} {{champion:236}}  who even if possibly overtuned now do at least interact with their opponents and have things they let them react to more than autos flying from far far away doing lots of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2019-02-06T19:36:26.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I pick your brains on what you think of Shen out of interest?\n\nI'll drink a barrel of your finest Volibear piss.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-02-06T19:42:14.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't like the floating sword gimmick but I think his W is really cool. \n\nIt's kind of a bummer that riot had to do him so dirty because of pro play.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yotq","date":"2019-02-06T17:57:20.237+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":7,"body":"You obviously don't play ADC.","replies":[]}]}
