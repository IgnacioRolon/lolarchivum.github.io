Pretty sure she's at least on par with Sol, but most likely leagues above his power level. In the scope of the cosmos, all he does is make stars, which isn't that spectacular of a power in terms of godhood. It's more like a specific Greek god's power, as opposed to a semi-omnipotent Abrahamic god's power.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-03-20T02:17:44.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ASol believes he is Naga's and Bards equal.\n\nNaga is explicitly more powerful than Sol.\n\nBard is so far not determined but likely more powerful than Sol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Elemental Lux","date":"2019-03-19T02:22:49.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If it really is inspired by Lovecraft, she/he may find “humans” interesting, Nyarlathotep is a lovecraft god who adored humanity of all the alien races he found.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2019-03-19T10:07:37.495+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't really call Nya's feeling's towards humans to be \"adoration\".","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-03-20T02:19:20.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaruko:_Crawling_with_Love\n\nI'd call it love for a particular person.\n\nXD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2019-03-19T01:17:24.621+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one of the big differences between Nagakaborous and Aurelion Sol is the effective range/ scope of their power.
