This was honestly the worst choice of buff you could give Kled.

So Kled is in fact supposed to counter them. Just as Renekton is now supposed to counter shield champs like Kench.\n\nNow I haven't read every patch notes ever, so perhaps the answer to my question was yes (if that's the case could you show me) and Kled was previously meant to be countered by these champions.\nIf that's the case, then Riot changed their minds, changed his design, and yes, changed matchups.\nThat's not a bad thing.\nWho counters who doesn't have to remain consistent.\nAs of this patch Kled is a counter to healing.

The second he always used to go even with and the last 2 he would tend to loose to.\n\nThe reason for the last 2 being special is that tryndamere doesnt die as soon as kled (ult), so he beats kled weather both or neither of them have life steal and his crits make sure it happens before remount. He still beats Kled to death. This is also why kayle beats kled.\n\nFiora Used to beat Kled as well and she STILL does. Why? Not because of her life steal or ult, but because of her points. Kled has the highest base health of any champ in the game, so % true damage reks him completely. And unlike vayne, smart fioras will go in for 1 point and leave or use ult.\n\n\nIn BOTH of those cases, Kled never won and he still doesn't but it has nothing to do with life steal.
