Op.gg shows him at 48% win rate. \n\nAnd the problem you're complaining about isn't restricted to or even most prominent on Urgot. None of the juggernauts are building tanky like they're intended, instead just having all the sustain they need built-in while they rush a damage item into Sterak's. \n\nHe IS a juggernaut.

He was also at a 51.21% win rate, not 48%. Also, it's not the items that are a problem, the problem, in my opinion, is why is Urgot essentially a damage focused tank with a shield?(Juggernauts are basically damage focused tanks, which is why I used that term, not to say he's a tank, but he builds tank while dealing high damage). If you're saying the items are a problem, of which Urgot is the only juggernaut in S+ tier, then the only solution would be to make Black Cleaver melee specific, and I think that would likely ruin him. Tanks don't generally have shields that scale with them. Only Nautilus has a shield that scales with him(that I can think of) and that's because he's just a big ball of CC with no innate defenses and is actually considered a TANK.\n\nTo add to this, people always complained about Riven having an AD scaling shield, and yet, here we have Urgot with an AD AND HP scaling shield that has 50% higher AD scaling than Riven. The cooldown's longer, but Riven goes in and out of fights, typically builds more AD, and doesn't build much tank stats, whereas Urgot builds much more tanky and stays in the fight until he kills you. An Urgot can have around 1200 bonus health, and around 240 AD, making his shield around a 560 health shield. At level 18 without any runes coming into play, this gives him almost 4k total effective health(3841), on top of damage being delayed as a bleed that he can heal back while fighting you. I would say this is a big reason why Urgot succeeds. You could fight him if he had a reasonable amount of health, but this is pure tank levels of health on top of damage on top of (essentially) damage reduction. Losing the shield he'd still have around 3.3k health. It might mess up his early so they could maybe lower the bonus AD scaling, or remove the bonus HP scaling(or the AD scaling, but at least if he builds more AD that'd be a bigger shield to play around his less health, rather than getting a scaling that just happens naturally over the course of the game and incentivizes him to just be a wall of health that you can't break through).","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-04-12T22:26:47.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VoraciousX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aZ5384x7,comment-id=000300000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-04-12T22:21:48.827+0000)\n>\n> I looked him up on u.gg, which most recently was pretty much proven the most accurate to Riot's internal data.

I seem to have missed the announcement.\n\nPretty simple answer as to why he has a shield though. He doesn't have healing. Nasus, Darius, Garen, and Illaoi all have healing. Mordekaiser also has a shield. That's part of the class. Again, a complaint about Urgot for reasons other than his ranged abilities, is a complaint about the class. He was _already_ fucked out of a juggernaut item when they made Sterak's melee-only.\n\nAnd okay, you can't say, \"Urgot's shield scales more AD,\" as if that's a problem when you then make that point moot by saying he doesn't build AD.

So it doesn't matter that his shield scales higher.\n\nI didn't say he didn't build AD, I said he built LESS AD. If you notice, I mentioned how much AD he could potentially build in his most common builds, and most of those AD items have a little AD and are much more defensive. As for your explanations of why he has a shield, let's look at this. Nasus has 24% healing on auto attacks, of which he builds 25 AD He'd have to do 700 damage in 3 Qs to heal as much as Urgot. Know how hard it is to hit 3 Qs as Nasus when you're going all in(I mean it's easy vs melees but again, he'd need 700 damage per Q to make that goal. He'd likely kill them before he healed as much as Urgot's shield)? Okay, does that equal up to 560 effective health in a fight? I mean Nasus is his own beast but you actually have to initiate on him, and kiting him is generally how you go about it, or make him waste his ultimate. Darius' healing is probably the only valid possible comparison to Urgot, but Darius doesn't build Death's Dance. Garen has in-combat healing? I never knew that...hm....Illaoi heals for 5% missing health, and again, can't engage. She is not gonna outheal one person, unless they get hit by 5 tentacles, which can't happen. You know how much health Illaoi would need to be at to heal 560 health? She'd need 11,200 max health and be at 0% health. K let's look at Mordekaiser. Hm...this is interesting, he doesn't build defensively AT ALL. In fact, he builds full glass cannon with pure AP. No wonder he has a shield....","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shiroe Okazaki","date":"2019-04-12T23:13:58.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgots blowing through everyone top lane where litterally no melee champion can touch him and most ranged even lose to him.

He basically has to be in melee range, so range can (with limited effectiveness depending on champ and skill of players) be an advantage that players can use to beat Urgot down.\n\nfor me personally; I am starting to pick up Fiora, as I learn and experience more about the champ I am also looking at points in other champs that I can use to win. And in the case of urgot I think that the delay on his E is a very big factor for Fiora. I do see that having to move around urgot to proc my vitals is a very big drawback because I effectively give urgot a lot of free damage that he doesn’t need to work for. On the flip side I see the windup on his E as something helpful for me to easily cast W, stun Urgot and then have a window to move around and proc vitals without as much retaliation damage.\n\nBesides my slight “rant” and kinda irrelevant talk on the matchup of Fiora and Urgot, my message in that was to show something that you maybe missed to change the discussion more towards a conversation about Urgot counters instead of this Urgot rant that I saw a lot in this post.
