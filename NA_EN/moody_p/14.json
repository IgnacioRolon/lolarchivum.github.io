Not addressing any real issues and instead shifting him from tank to bruiser with a mediocre stat buff to &quot;even&quot; out the loss of his shield. While I was mulling it over, I came up with a different idea, one that makes Ornn require a little more tact in when and how he uses his W; giving him damage reduction from attacks depending on where he&#039;s hit from.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/a60badf6c186508a6fb5cc4132003366.png\n\nSo, the idea of it --- Enemies that hit Ornn with projectiles or targeted attacks do reduced damage based on where they hit him during his W. So, damage taken in the middle of his flame (the red) would do the least; hitting him from the sides is not as significant, and then hitting him in the back is full damage. \n\nThis would add a lot to him, I think, both as his original tank playstyle and Riot&#039;s advertised bruiser-y mesh; since it adds a lot of decision making unto Ornn&#039;s kit that he currently kind of lacks, and an Ornn who plays smartly with his cooldowns, especially into juke-y fighters and assassin, can then strongly reduce the damage they deal before counter-attacking.\n\nI'd also like to brag about how nice my circle looks. Pretty good for hasty sketch, isn't it? ","replies":[{"poster":"giannishannibal","date":"2018-12-11T00:56:32.855+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats actually a great idea.

He take reduce damage if he get hit in the back and normal damage in the front. This way he can choose does he want the damage or the defense. \n\nAlso make sense like the trope of hitting a fire breather in the mouth because it is their weakness.\n\nBut I guess this way still suck because the enemy either choose to get hit by tons of damage or deal less damage. A lose, lose situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-11T05:27:10.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\\{{champion:brambleback}}\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n######bramblefront","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-12-11T03:58:04.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except that’s still essentially the same problem that made her remove unstoppable from his W before though: that it becomes a “I win every trade” button.\n\nNo one who’s trading with him will be able to hit his back, so it’s still just regular damage reduction for all intents and purposes. All this really does is make it possible to snipe him off as he’s running away I guess?","replies":[{"poster":"Séance","date":"2018-12-11T04:49:58.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:157}} \nJust out of the top lane matchups, I can see all these get behind him pretty easily.\nBut the mobility on these champs allows them to easily dodge most of the damage on the current Ornn W, the people who are suffering most from the \"I win this trade\" button are those that would have no way to move around quickly. I think this type of damage reduction would simply make it worse for those already suffering from Ornn W and make those who don't struggle with it as much  have an easier time dealing with it.\n\nBasically, cool concept and ideas, but I think it makes the problem worse.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gregorovic08","date":"2018-12-11T02:49:22.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a decent idea but I believe riot won't implement it. They have said before that his w has or had too many things going for it. They don't want to add something without taking something else away. Of course, if this is instead of all the changes they are doing then I think it is pretty good. The problem it runs into then is that Riot have said themselves that they want Ornn to be a more damaging tank with less tankiness.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2018-12-11T01:37:49.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That’s an interesting idea. I like it, despite not being a fan of the bruiser-y style Riot wants. They are very much not hitting his biggest pain points outside of the power of CC in coordinated play.\n\nThough, to go with it, the damage in W might need a shift either into power in his other skills or into Brittle itself as the reward. The reasoning given for the shield removal was that W is an “I win” button at the moment, so shifting offensive power out of it would allow the defensive and utility applying nature to shine through. Personally, I would lean toward shifting to E...given how situational it is and encourages going in as opposed to possible Q poke, or shifting into Brittle. But that’s one lower ranked man’s opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-12-11T01:49:57.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"brittle should be applied to autos or something\n\nif im being honest if i had my way i'd hand a hefty rework to ornn because i don't like his weird combo-y nature and the fact that he makes his own niche - brittling enemies to make CC stronger - useless cuz he procs it himself and doesn't get the bonuses. \n\nbut that'd never happen so this is the best I can suggest","replies":[]}]}]}
