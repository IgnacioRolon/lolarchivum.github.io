With a red elixir it's another 15% of all physical damage. And of course this is all amped by 30% when he has Spirit Visage, a core item. I've played it, and the healing is quite insane.\r\n\r\nIf Nasus does need a nerf, and I expect he will soon since he's performing so well in soloQ and his few meta counters are seeing both indirect and direct nerfs, I think the best thing to hit would be his passive lifesteal bonus, just to address it in the light of how much sustain he is stacking right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-02-28T14:38:19.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'd change the Lifesteal on his passive from it's current 12 / 18 / 24% (at levels 1, 7, and 13) to 5 / 10 / 15 / 20% (at levels 1, 6, 11, and 16).\n\nThis should cut down nicely on his sustain and enforce him as a late-game scaling champion with a weak early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Vyntrius","date":"2019-02-28T18:02:07.228+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Rhinark,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pgOEV1ct,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-02-28T14:38:19.723+0000)\n>\n> I'd change the Lifesteal on his passive from it's current 12 / 18 / 24% (at levels 1, 7, and 13) to 5 / 10 / 15 / 20% (at levels 1, 6, 11, and 16).\n> \n> This should cut down nicely on his sustain and enforce him as a late-game scaling champion with a weak early game.\n\nThis change would delete Nasus from the game, or at least in higher elos.

Suggesting that someone takes what they are already taking to make up for a nerf is meaningless.\n\nNot really, when that combo is already immensely strong.\n\nIt's nigh impossible to bully a Nasus with the current 12% Lifesteal, a Doran's Shield, and Second Wind in the Resolve tree, out of lane, which is odd considering he's supposed to have a \"weak\" early game to compensate for his greater mid-to-late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2019-03-01T09:08:37.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are trying to compare power that is allocated as part of a kit to power from a starting item.  \n\n\"Olaf gets up to 99% attack speed from his passive but players can only start with a dagger which gives 12%, so Olaf's attack speed should be reduced to 40%.\"\n\nIt doesn't take into account that a champion's kits/stats give up other things in return for that.

He scales poorly with AD items, has no target access via in built mobility, no longer range abilities that scale with AD. He needs better than mediocre sustain to survive his brutal early game. \n\nSo 5% for starting life steal would dumpster him into trash tier. Nasus's win rate and pick rate are perfect right now.

Most sustain for a good Nasus, early, will come only from last hits with Q and the rest will come from pots and biscuits just so he can survive. Those last hits until he has north of 100 stacks and a sheen will barely heal him for 20-50 HP per hit. \n\nYou are over exaggerating his sustain potential a lot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2019-02-28T16:05:44.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's not nasus problem but every ADs in the game.\n\nLifesteal should have been locked at 10% max per game no matter what items you buy.
