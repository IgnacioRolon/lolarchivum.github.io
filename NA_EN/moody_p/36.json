Take Evelynn for example. Her skins basically WERE chromas, but all got updated very nicely to be unique in their own way, even Shadow, which got a new recall and VFX. \n\nInfernal and Dragon Knight are both 520 skins, which will be the same level essentially as King of Clubs, his 750 skin. His other two skins, Pentakill and Lord are both 975 RP skins. So all the skins will get new models pertaining to their particular theme. Lord and Pentakill SHOULD get new VFX and new recalls to match their price point. I would guess a lot of emphasis will be placed on Pentakill, considering he's the lead of the band. I'd like to think they'd give Infernal some fiery effects instead of base particles, to match the other skins in the line.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-03-19T19:33:55.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot needs to fix their problems where they shorted Transcended and Sinful Succulence before worrying about your theorycrafting.","replies":[]}]}
