I feel like a small update is in order to help stabilize the champion so he isn&#039;t superbly dependent on a very specific meta coming together to make him good. \n\nGiven that Nasus is currently back to being kind of trash - where his &quot;best players&quot; are averaging out at an astonishingly low _50% win rate_ whichis a huge red flag if mains are just barely scraping by on the champion, I think soon would be a good time to give Nasus a more committed tuning. \n\nhttps://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Nasus/Top/ for numbers.\n\nEDIT: To add, while Nasus hasn't gotten buffs recently:\n\n- He gained a power shift (net buff) on his R that changed it from converting damage dealt to bonus AD to gaining Armor and MR over time. Huge defensive boost when combined to his sizable HP gains from the same spell.\n\n- E was changed from flat shred to % armor reduction. While this nerfs his value against squishy targets, it becomes MUCH stronger against tanks and bruisers\n\n- R gained an enormous damage buff in that it reduced his Q cooldown by 50% while active.\n\nDespite all of this, Nasus never sees the spotlight in soloQ for more than a patch at best before he slowly creeps out of it again.

On top of that, he's a noobstomper champion. Some champs (particularly scaling champions like yi and nasus) have kits that just won't pick up in high elo. His kit isn't designed to be good in higher levels of play. He requires perfect cs'ing while not interacting with your laner. Honestly he's in a fine spot. He's theme is really good and has a distinct playstyle in the game, and can be beaten if played right.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-11-27T08:48:27.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus isn't good in low elo either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2018-11-28T15:01:29.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldnt say Nasus needs any form of a rework but the reason for his performance I will argue on would actually be his rune choices. A lot of the runes I say that he desperately needs are all over the place. Thus gating him from reaching his full potential. If I were to get to choose without being forced into investing the rest into a path then it would look a lot like this.\n\nConqueror\nApproach Velocity \nSecond Wind\nTranscendence\nNimbus Cloak \nRavenous Hunter\n\n  \nAnd note that none of my preferred runes are in the same row for the lack of better words. Each of them are in different rows but not on the same path. Anyhow what im trying to get at is that the runes I say he needs inorder to thrive doesnt allow him to synergies with the rest of the path. Sacrificing a rune hurts more to Nasus than it does to another typical champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2018-11-28T14:33:56.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still posting on that alt account","replies":[]}]}
