I could pick any bruisers and get &quot;enough&quot; armor reduction most of the time without needing team followup to make sure the tank actually dies. Some champions could get even MORE because they can buy Black Cleaver on top of whatever innate they have or whatever armor pen they&#039;re stacking with it. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s like the only thing keeping Trundle alive is the fact that he can just fucking shit all over Sejuani on the rare chance she gets picked.

Most juggernauts have an armor shred and access to BC. It doesn't make his resistance (not just armor) *steal* (not shred) useless.\n\nIf his niche, though, was just to beat Sejuani, then he had no niche. Beating *one* champion is not a niche.

Ashe has an innate permaslow and a global initiation. \n\nTrundle's niche is to be an anti-tank.

Half of my champs just seem to get worse with time, either because Riot ignores them or deliberately shits on them. The other half just stays where they are because they abuse soloQ even if they aren't actually good \n\nTrundle just can't justify being picked anymore because 70% of his strength as an anti-tank debuffer has become just a general quality for almost everyone. It doesn't help that top lane continues to shift harder to ultra-generalists who outrange and outdamage everyone else and the jungle is a complete mess","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AbyssmalHydra","date":"2018-11-22T06:30:22.685+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a big time trundle player, I think youre underrating him vastly, he can easily outduel 90% of melee laners, and still outscale them, his R is still insanely powerful, and his pillar is still one of he better catching tools in the game if you max it second. And if anyone runs Aftershock (especially Liss) he can still be really tanky, I think youre playing him too jungle oriented, playing him top is the way to go with him now, epecially since he has the FASTEST tower kill time in the game, throwing demolish + tri force on that will make you eat away at towers in the time enemies were able to recall to their fountain.\n\n\nTL;DR: Trundle top is fine, Trundle JG not so much.
