Frontline champions aren't tanks. To be technical, Bruisers aren't tanks. In LoL, tanks traditionally specifically refer to champs like Naut or Sej or Zac whose primary role is to provide cc and soak up damage, they often boast strong single target damage but rely on base damage and build tank because they don't scale as well with damage stats. Morde is a Juggernaut. Juggernauts are Bruisers and usually have at most 1 hard cc or a strong soft cc (like Illaoi). They dish out some of the highest damage in the game but need to stick onto a target to dish it out. They can do a lot of damage to multiple people but are countered by peeling and kiting. They usually build half damage half tank and are not as tanky as tanks, relying on sustain and shields to soak up damage rather than just raw stats.\nI think riot introduced new wording like calling tanks Vanguards and Wardens or something to make it less confusing idk.\nExamples:\nGaren: Juggernaut\nMaokai: Tank\nMundo: Juggernaut (He builds full tank though)\nSejuani: Tank\nDarius: Juggernaut\nNautilus: Tank\nAatrox: Juggernaut\nChogath: Tank\nYorick: Juggernaut\nNunu: Tank\nTrundle: Juggerugettheidea","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-07-02T06:52:49.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one of the main problems with it is that older players refer to front-line champions as tanks (but have learned to call them by a few names) and Riot decided to throw the whole system into chaos.  What used to be a tank was whatever champion could take the front-line\n\nthen they redefined tank as something that could take damage and apply crowd control\n\neven in other games, the tank is typically whoever can go to the front-lines and attract aggression from the enemies, even if they're a more offensive class\n\nalso, I get the concept of \"defining\" the differences, but who is going to understand the differences between warden, vanguard and all those other technical terms for defining champions that do basically the same job even if they play differently\n\nit seemed like another \"change for the sake of change\" idea","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"goodiesohhi","date":"2019-06-28T18:03:47.374+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TlEfcUsm,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-06-28T16:47:30.446+0000)\n>\n> imagine unironically believing this\n\nHe is not wrong.
