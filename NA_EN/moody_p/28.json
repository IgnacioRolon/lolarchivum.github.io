Skill floor refers only to the champion's mechanical difficulty. Not the difficulty of _winning_ with them. \n\nOld Taric had no skill floor, either. But he was extremely difficult to win with. With that in mind, can you now see why saying a champion requires no skill is not the same as saying they're easy to win with? \n\nWhen a champion that doesn't have mechanical difficulty is too easy to win with, they're no longer fair to play against.

TK and Asol have high strengths that only shine when coordinated well with skilled players. Illaoi is the polar opposite, being disproportionately punishing against enemies who are sloppy or get too greedy for kills and don't respect her which, like many juggernauts who overly punish worse players, makes her hated by the general community until higher ELO. As enemy skill goes up the Illaoi has to improve alongside them, and her ability to rotate and Play around her own win conditions is just as important as a Riven having her combos down correctly. mechanical complexity is not the only measure of skill, it's just the most visible gate.\n\nYou seem to confuse every juggernaut with Garen, who is on a completely separate level from Illaoi who has actual meaningful measures of variance to play around accordingly.

Which isn't fair.\n\nI don't agree with your end assessment. The last two juggernauts we saw who were competitive viable (Urgot and Aatrox) had high value on their kits rather than their numbers. Some, like Olaf, are mainly direct counter picks than general power houses.\n\nWhat juggernauts fundamentally need is to be less extreme in their design; being \"all damage, no range, low utility\" makes for a useless champion because the damage role has already been filled by bottom lane at minimum and usually middle too. Comparing this to another MOBA, Dota 2, the champions who are most \"like\" juggernauts are quite different in that while they don't have (situationally) bullshit damage they will usually have crowd control, most always single target and respectably ranged  which gives them immense more usability than a dumpster heap like Garen has. I don't know if you play it yourself but some examples if you would like to look at are Mars, Bristleback, Ursa, Wraith King, and a few others who's names I can't quite recall right now -- still fairly new to it myself.\n\nThese champions have a MUCH better grasp on the juggernaut design I think should be manifested in League; they have their clear uses and niches, more than potent damage but not too much as to be unreasonable, and heaps more usability than the average juggernaut in LOL. Obviously there are important differences like the items and the fact that turn rate balanced out the ranged advantage there, but the general idea can certainly translate between games.\n\nI have no delusions about my class. I think most of them need a rework from at minimum in par with what Xin Zhao got. What makes me disagree on this is that juggernauts have some \"inherent\" issue that means the class could never be fine or fair. I think Riot has just yet to find the mark on it","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"thefatlazycat","date":"2019-03-22T20:22:08.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is really ironic coming from someone with Darius as their icon, I got an actual laugh when I read the 'too much counterplay' part","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-03-22T18:36:55.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eskyvEgd,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-03-22T18:25:40.471+0000)\n>\n> True damage has nothing to do with it.
