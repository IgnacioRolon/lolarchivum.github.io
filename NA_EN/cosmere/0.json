I'm not asking you to forgive me and give me a second chance. I'm telling you that you are making a mistake for something that I did not do. You guys won't show me any evidence and only respond to my ticket and everyone's else with a \"scripted\" letter stating the terms and service of the game. The only way I can show you that I don't use \"programs\" to get an advantage over other players is by degrading myself and proving to you that I suck. That all these years of grinding for hours and getting to where I am, Plat II, was by programs? I have 185 wins and 168 losses. My most played champs is Leona with a 61.8% win rate and 1.4/5.3/13.2 KDA, while my thresh is currently at a 43.5% win rate, therefore if I were using \"programs\" I would be landing all my hooks and be winning games. I don't know if there were players that reported me for \"cheating\" or what? I rarely play normal and aram but when I do, I go like 20/5 because the system matches me with bronzes and silvers. I don't know if they reported me for my map awareness and mechanics.
