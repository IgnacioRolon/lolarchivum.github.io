My computer is not frozen, just the client. The only solution Ive found is a reboot seeing as the client doesnt close when its frozen via command-Q or command-tab. The mouse still moves and I can control my volume and media buttons atop my keyboard. I have an early 2011 Macbook Pro with 16gb ram, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5, Intel HD Graphics 3000 512 MB card. Just wondering if anyone else running the mac side has been experiencing this or possible solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"Inbi","date":"2015-01-13T01:51:46.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, me and many other mac users have had this problem. Redownloading and repairing doesn't do much, and it almost becomes irritating to reconnect to games after because it usually disconnects you around 100% loading and tells you the net's bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CAPTAlN lNSAN0","date":"2015-02-08T18:18:29.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same issue as well.  Happened after the release of 5.2.   OS 10.9.5.  I have repaired multiple times with no success.

Reset SMC.\n2. Reset PRAM.\n3. Download Onyx for Yosemite (free) and verify and clean your Mac.\n4. Download AdwareMedic by SafeMac (free) and remove the adware files.\n5. During your next match, hit ESC and under the \"Video\" tab, change it from \"Full Screen\" to \"Borderless\".\n6. If this doesn't fix it, disable \"inking\" under the same \"Video\" tab.\n\nHope this works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voltron032","date":"2015-01-13T23:23:57.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem, same Mac prettymuch. Do you have the latest version of yosemite? If so, youre screwed until something with Mac or Riot changes. My buddy has the same computer as me and I updated to the latest Mac OS and he didn't. Couldnt tell you which version he's running, but literally the exact same thing happens to me after the update and his Mac runs flawlessly on the previous OS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MVP Tom Brady","date":"2015-01-13T03:59:42.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, same.  I run the most up to date OS for mac and I've only been having issues recently with the release of patch 4.21.  Whether it's the OS (which I've also recently updated) or this patch specifically, I'm not sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Fire on Fire","date":"2015-01-13T15:04:39.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"One question..
