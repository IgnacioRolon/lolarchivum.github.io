What would be the right thing to do?\r\n\r\nHypothetical Scenario #2\r\n\r\nA team fight breaks out in mid, your team is able to win. You barely have enough time to take the inhibitor turret and the inhibitor but the fight that you won happens near Baron. Should you take Baron or the inhibitor?

Generally when its early to mid game, if you can't do both at the same time, you go for the dragon first. When you have the chance to secure an objective early game, you should take dragon because unlike turrets, its global gold that respawns every 6 minutes. Late game when death timers are much longer, prioritize turrets over dragon/baron.  Besides, you're already accomplishing alot by going for that dragon. You secure ur team global gold from dragon and u deny that minion wave of cs from the enemy since its going to get killed by the turret. \n\nScenario 2:\nIf you are sure its a guaranteed inhibitor(enemy death timers are long enough or you know u can kill the enemy again if they come), You almost always prioritize that inhibitor over baron because once u take down that inhibitor, super minions will spawn and push down that lane. That creates so much pressure in that lane without your team needing to send anyone to push that lane so you can use this advantage to go for other objectives like the inhibitors in the other lanes or getting a free dragon/baron.  You only go for baron in this case if you don't have enough time to get the inhibitor or you absolutely need the buff to win teamfights.\n\nSource: I am a diamond 3 ADC main. I've faced countless situations like these at a higher elo than more people.

Less than 30 seconds? Baron. More than? Inhib.\n30 seconds is a ballpark number btw, it depends more on the situation (this situation being 'can you destroy their stuff before they respawn or not?')","replies":[]}]}
