Or, in some cases, that folks love to hate/have a complicated relationship. And while I usually stay out of the Gameplay forum as there tends to be a lot of negatively, I would like to express my thoughts on how this upcoming patch comes across to me as both a player and a consumer.\n\nFirst of all, regardless of who got what skins, they look amazing. The sheer number of icons, wards, emotes and other bells and whistles that are seeing play testing is delightful and really cool to look at. It makes me want to purchase RP in wait for this super cool content, and I don&#039;t even main any of the champions involved in this particular set of event releases. \n\nHowever.\n\nWhen I scroll down further, I am looking for the much anticipated change list to champions, items and the rune system. The community has been waiting several long weeks while the creators took a break to celebrate the holidays with their loved ones ( which is absolutely awesome), but we&#039;re ready for some changes. Personally, I&#039;ve felt the power creep in the game becoming too high, the chances of comebacks too low, and the near elimination of the team fight phase in my elo. ( I can count on a hand the number of games I&#039;ve experienced over 40 minutes in the past 2 months since preseason hit live.) A certain strategic element seemed to disappear as games rushed to finish, but I played anyway just to keep my skills up and wait for preseason to wind down and things to even out. But when I got to the section where changes were noted it was...nearly barren. There was nothing here to address the problems within the game that I was personally experiencing, and that my friends also complained about/felt discouraged by.  The short games, the weak towers, the overall damage output and lack of thought required in what was once a strategic map. It all kind of felt....ignored.\n\nSo when I look at this patch, I think oh man, this content is awesome! I really want to spend my money on it. But then when I look at what the actual content is, the part wherein I&#039;d actually be playing the game and not seeing any improvement in the issues, feels really bad. It feels like I can&#039;t spend my money on the things I want, because if I do it will be feedback that the game is heading in a direction that I want to play in when it isn&#039;t.\n\nI&#039;m sorry if this came off as a rant. It is just my perspective on the upcoming changes.{{summoner:21}} \n\nTL;DR: I am not sure that I can enjoy the additional content when the baseline needs of the game that directly affect me as a player don&#039;t seem to be met or even explored.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-01-10T03:28:38.673+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"You haven't actually seen 8.2 patch notes, what's on the front page of reddit atm is the notes for 8.1, a patch that was locked before we went on break. We took some the time that would usually have gone into that patch and made 7.24b, now 8.1 is a bit of a smaller patch, but 8.2 is going to be quite a large patch starting to make headway on some of the issues that have been raised.\n\ntl;dr - 8.1 is a small patch since the dev cycle for it is when we were actually out on break, 8.2 will include a lot of changes that had been started before the break or once we got back.

I know that the 8.2 patch notes on the PBE/surrender@20 aren't actually those that are going to (necessarily) hit live. But they are often indicative of what is to come while they test the changes within the smaller community. Those are the ones that I was meaning to reference, and was very excited to see hit the PBE server, then disappointed with how little of the content was gameplay changes versus how much of it was cosmetics. ( That I very much want to purchase, but I feel that certain gameplay aspects could use some work.)\n\nI'm excited to hear that you're working on more adjustments. I'll keep an eye out for more changes coming to the PBE through the cycle and try to be patient.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2018-01-10T04:34:30.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"PBE patches nowadays are very likely to contain only a small part of the upcoming changes in the first PBE update.
