I did not play any other match after the one where I was supposed to get it. Either the issue was fixed or the the issue is some sort of delay before the icon is delivered.\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinayion","date":"2018-02-09T19:31:25.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for confirming the fix.
