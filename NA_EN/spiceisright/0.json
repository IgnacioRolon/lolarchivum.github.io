Only had MH4U, and it's been a while since I've played, but I can't help but feel like Draven's armor reminds me of the Kecha Wacha set in some regard. Might just be me though, because I really liked that armor. Besides 'Orange and sort-of-blue' color scheme with a vest, there's probably not much resemblance.","replies":[]}]}
