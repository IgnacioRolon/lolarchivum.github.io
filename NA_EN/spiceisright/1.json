I looked up to him. That was… until he became soft, tarnished by his studies of the stars and spiritual magics.\n> \n> He spent a great deal of time in his studies, perfecting the art of astral projection that died with him, something I envied. To impact and move about the world around you without even using your physical body… it opened up an entirely different set of opportunities. It was in my attempt to recover and harness this lost art that I discovered my own magical prowess to teleport and project doppelgängers, but I still fell short of my deepest desires. \n> \n> But I digress, Zyx’s naivety in trusting others and obsession with realms unknown were his downfall. The more he studied projection, the more time he spent as a spiritual being than his physical self. It wasn’t long before his apprentice grew weary of his ever-growing fancy and weakening body as a result. I could see it in his aging skin and slowing movement. The toll of his work was steadily increasing. I wouldn’t be taught any further by someone so blind as to not see his own degradation in plain sight. \n> \n> A legend, he had fallen from such heights, I couldn’t let the madness continue. I saw his body there, sound asleep, vulnerable. I could tell that it wasn’t a typical slumber by the faint azure glow about his person as he lay there resting. He wasn’t merely asleep; his spirit was projected who knows where, but there was no sign of him here in this place. And so I spared him a slow death and myself a poor master that very night.\n> \n> I’m writing you now Lord Swain, as rumors speak of a glimmering blue figure making appearances of late. I fear the man may have perished, but the spirit still lingers. This doesn't bode well.\n>\n> ---Matron of the Black Rose","replies":[{"poster":"Nekusen","date":"2015-08-31T23:21:33.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"passive\nsymbiosis: dunno why this is added to the passive and not the spell, might be to hard of a nerf.\n\n* perhaps making it 12 seconds on minions and 5 on jungle monsters\n* making it so true vision ({{item:2043}}  {{item:3364}} , raptors) tells the enemy you are inside a minion/monster\n* not able to target champions\n* if the minion or monster is killed with him inside, he takes 15% max hp in damage is slowed by 25% and attack speed lowered by 15% for 3 seconds (this would increase skill cap on his E)\n\nR\nsome things that would simplify and add counterplay to his ult\n\n* when he successfully channels it, he takes control of his target, he is able to move the enemy and use auto attacks (each autoattack deals 50/60/70 + (30% (Zyx's) AP)) but not use abilities\n* remove Zyx's invulnerability during the effect, instead, he and his target take 50% less damage.","replies":[{"poster":"SpiceIsRight","date":"2015-09-01T22:18:10.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nekusen,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=mdoE33XQ,comment-id=001d,timestamp=2015-08-31T23:21:33.293+0000)\n>\n> passive\n> symbiosis: dunno why this is added to the passive and not the spell, might be to hard of a nerf.\n> \n> * perhaps making it 12 seconds on minions and 5 on jungle monsters\n> * making it so true vision ({{item:2043}}  {{item:3364}} , raptors) tells the enemy you are inside a minion/monster\n> * not able to target champions\n> * if the minion or monster is killed with him inside, he takes 15% max hp in damage is slowed by 25% and attack speed lowered by 15% for 3 seconds (this would increase skill cap on his E)\n> \n> R\n> some things that would simplify and add counterplay to his ult\n> \n> * when he successfully channels it, he takes control of his target, he is able to move the enemy and use auto attacks (each autoattack deals 50/60/70 + (30% (Zyx's) AP)) but not use abilities\n> * remove Zyx's invulnerability during the effect, instead, he and his target take 50% less damage.\n\n- I put Symbiosis in the passive so I didn't have to repeat it for both E and R. You're right that it may be too large a nerf, but I was thinking of adding movement speed perhaps if the target dies? I just don't want the boost to be abused by him jumping in a minion and an ally killing it (this is why it doesn't give bonus healing).\n\n- I will consider your other words of wisdom. True vision would reveal him, yes. Since he can only benefit in an enemy target, jumping into an ally minion is dangerous because if it dies he takes 20% of the damage and can't regenerate it (since he nor allies can kill a friendly target).\n\n- With Symbiosis, he already takes damage even as he damages the target so he is just untargetable (not invulnerable) already. Interesting ideas though! Thanks for the feedback.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Psychoaryama","date":"2015-03-11T00:52:47.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice champion!

I think it would definitely fill a niche/theme we haven't seen yet :) I think some of the scare comes from difficulty in balancing such an aspect as mind control. I know I don't have the answer, but I hope this along with your ideas stimulates enough curiosity from Riot. I think I've done a pretty okay job balancing the idea on his ult? Sort of like simulating a power struggle with the enemy champ- shutting out an ability and altering their movement.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chrysalis monkey","date":"2015-03-08T19:21:35.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you name him based on the xyz factor read backwards?","replies":[{"poster":"SpiceIsRight","date":"2015-03-08T20:15:25.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chrysalis monkey,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=mdoE33XQ,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-03-08T19:21:35.562+0000)\n>\n> did you name him based on the xyz factor read backwards?\n\nActually, I did not, but that's really interesting!

I do know you didnt think this champ would do good with damage recution, but i think instead of 20% of that targets health, a good 40% of damage taken (down to a low of 20% of Zyx's health as so you dont die using the spell, because it also has the downside of you taking over a Garen, and the garen Running into the enemy team to get you killed simply by transfering damage to you) and THEN you do the Above changes as stated for the passive earlier, so it still stays a consistent \"last hit\" option, or a way to guarantee some extra cc with some safe escape in lane/team fights.)\n\nAnyways aside from that, i love the concept of the character, the lore is great, finnaly a new member from the Rose, and i cant find anything else Quote on Quote 'wrong' with him, wrong being just a couple nerfs to bump ratios here and there. \n\nAlso seeing as how you are a character creator yourself, i have made a Void creature, intended to be tanky Top lane/Tanky Support, he is in the Bildgewater Cafe under Ish'rai, The Embodiment of Fear (however i renamed him in the description)  if you could take a quick gander at him that would be amazing! great champ idea and i hope it sees the light of day man!","replies":[{"poster":"SpiceIsRight","date":"2016-02-22T17:06:38.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback!

However, it's current iteration was intended to provide unique and fun ability to traverse the jungle and gank. I didn't want there to be a choice on traveling to the wisp or not because it forces there to be thought before activation. Do I have my a reasonable path planned out? Additionally, I didn't want to simply make a more powerful version of Zed's living shadow. With Zed, you have to zone both his original and show location. Because he is an assassin, he needs this sort of mind game to survive; whereas, I don't think a bruiser like Zyx does. However, your idea is definitely fun and worth me pondering further. Thanks!\n \n> Finally, when it comes to his passive, i understand the shielding, but to restore ALL of your health...\n\nI will have to adjust the tooltip to make things a little more clear. What really happens with his passive is mindful decision-making. Zyx takes 20% of the damage the target he is possessing takes (his target still takes 100% damage) up to 40% of Zyx's max health after which Zyx no longer takes damage, but his target still does. If he or an ally kill the possessed target, Zyx regains that up to 40% damage he took and a small shield. This makes Zyx sacrifice health for using E on lane minions, sneaky counter jungling (i.e. hiding in baron), or poor decision of ultimate target (i.e. ulting the enemy tank). However, smart plays reward him with a shield. If he was 45% before damage and took 40% health (putting him at 5%), after the target is killed, he'd go back to 45% health not 100%. \n \nThanks again for the feedback, I'll be sure to return the favor :)","replies":[{"poster":"Provokist","date":"2016-02-22T19:36:57.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh i see, that deffinately clears up a lot with his toolkit then, and i do suppose it would freshen things up to have another character that HAS to stick to his/her decisions when they make them, though i DO gotta say ONE thing about the W, i think you should Bump it with Extended field of Vision, either that or give it a \"True Vision\" aspect, seeing as how hes kindof an Astral, Spiritual being, i think that being able to see what usually isnt able to be seen, or having a much larger field of vision would seem very much into his character, also it would allow him to actually See if hes gonna make a mistake or not, like say he had extended vision in that form, and went to the enemies red buff, but saw the yii was still there after he Just smite it from lets say, the raptor/turret bush, hed have a chance to either Decide to go in, or turn around and avoid the conflict altogether, also if it Does seem a extra vision buff on the wisp is a bit much, if you do decide to give him true or extended vision, i would recommend taking the vision away from your Physical body, or at least to a bery small range, so that it balances out, just an idea im throwin out there.\n\nanyways thankyou as well for comming to check out my idea, ALSO ik this sounds persistent but i have One more i want to present to you, Rey: Arbiter of the Elements.

I think you're right about silence, I believe at the time they were nerfing silences so I thought they were changing the game paradigm (i.e. Talon), but it would feel better to silence all abilities for sake of ease especially.

For jungling, longer duration would be intent on vision telling you where you could best counter-jungle.\n\n> Regarding the ult, I appreciate your clarification but I'm afraid I retain my original opinion.

Sorry.  :-/\n\nFair enough good sir :) I'll take your thoughts to mind. I did have a mechanic to allow counterplay... but it's super experimental so I have never unveiled it, but while I have your attention and good will maybe I can run it past you?\n\nHere goes the experimental version (Changes are bolded):\n\nR: Takeover\n\nCOOLDOWN: 100/85/70 Sec COST: None RANGE: 625\n\nZyx channels for 1 second in an attempt to transfer himself into an enemy champion for **3 seconds**. If successful, Zyx becomes untargetable and deals the target **5/7/9% (+2% per 100 AP)** Max Health as magic damage per second. **All of Zyx's abilities** become **Mind Grapple** during this time.\n\n**Mind Grapple**- Prevents the use of the corresponding ability by the enemy champion taken over and grants Zyx control of their movement for up to **2 seconds**. All of Zyx's abilities share a cooldown during this time. **COOLDOWN 5 Sec**\n\nEnemies inflicted with Mind Grapple may activate the suppressed ability to enter Stasis for the remainder of Takeover, absorbing damage and healing Zyx for any damage they would have taken during this period (after damage reduction would apply). Healing is capped at 50% of Zyx's Maximum Health.\n\n\n\n\nThis offers afflicted enemies the chance to avoid the damage and loss of movement and still benefits Zyx in that he recoups some health and still manages to prevent an enemies actions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-03T18:53:59.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very interesting and novel idea you've got here, Flux.  I'm getting an AP Zed vibe from Zyx, which isn't a bad thing.  Some key concerns I noticed while reading-\n\n1- I really like the passive but I don't like its reliance on auto attacks to proc.  I feel like it has the opportunity to really let Zyx players make some flashy plays (like Zed) to survive things they shouldn't survive.  They're always going to be auto attacking so the passive becomes a \"nice thing that happens every few seconds\" instead of a cool tool the player has.  I guess what I'm saying is that it lacks agency.  I wish this passive was actually an active ability.\n\n2- I'm not sure how an auto attack can transform into a skillshot.  I'm imagining the first two autos and then the third striking and... where does the skillshot emanate from?  Auto attacks don't have very precise aiming requirements, so it feels like the angle of the skillshot will be kind of random, and therefore unreliable and unrewarding.  What if, while active, Zyx gains increased attack speed.  If able to auto attack three times in the 6 second activation, the ability can be recast as a skillshot?\n\n3- The E is very interesting but I also worry about it.  It requires minions or monsters which means that it likely won't have much use in a lot of different circumstances.  I like the idea of \"hiding\" in a neutral unit and then exploding out, however.  I don't understand why dashing and hiding deals damage, though.  Seems like it should be a short range dash to merge with the unit, then gain vision and otherwise be able to hide there for a while.  Maybe even increase the duration to a max of 30 seconds or so, to really let them camp and stalk their prey if they want.  The energy refund on both hits is a nice idea, but again I think it would be exceptionally rare in practice.  All energy using champions have a way of regenerating energy faster, so I like that you tried it here, but I think it should be moved somewhere else.\n\n4- I have to be blunt and honest here and say that the Ultimate just doesn't work for me.  It removes a huge amount of control from another player in the game and I can easily see this being one of the most anti-fun abilities in the whole game.  It fits thematically and I like the idea from that angle, but in practice I really feel like this ability would be frustrating and broken.","replies":[{"poster":"SpiceIsRight","date":"2015-04-03T20:37:23.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is great! Thank you for the feedback. I don't mind at all if you're critical as it helps develop the idea further. I'll address your points by number:\n\n1. I agree somewhat with the passive lacking that interaction quality. We see similar things with Kassadin or Fizz who get passive defense (end of story, no engagement). There was another iteration that involved proc from ability cast. In that state, Q's low cooldown would offer a similar response. The passive would also offer brief compensation for W's vulnerable root. However, I opted towards the route I did because of his role as a jungler/top laner. I wanted to offer a means of damage reduction (in this case through evasion) that fit the role. Secondly, we actually see a  way for Zyx to engage his passive through his Q even as it is now because it's a mini-auto steroid. Sure, it will offer some auto-pilot procs, but in those moments where it matters, it can be used to stay alive where otherwise death would have occurred. Does this clear things up a bit? In a way I don't want him to be so engaged with the passive that he can choose to become invulnerable regardless of scenario by just using abilities (if he was a mid laner I would reconsider). His passive is most comparable to Pantheon.\n\n2. Perhaps I wasn't so clear in my wording, but I hope this explanation helps. All three attacks are treated as autos. The first two are completely vanilla in that they only receive the attack speed boost. For the 3rd auto, it still operates as an auto-attack in every sense, but it gains 475 range (moving from melee to ranged in status). The other aspect of this 3rd attack is that it is piercing. So Zyx can click on the target of the auto (or continue autoing if in range as the 3rd strike doesn't reset the auto sequence), and essentially a piercing light effect of Lucian occurs. The only difference is that it is auto-based. This is done to allow some poke in Top lane. I.e. auto two minions and then extend for a poke on the champion.\n\n3. I'm completely satisfied as a jungler and laner especially with the opportunities to use this ability. I don't believe finding a chance to use it will be too difficult, especially in the jungle. I also didn't want to give him a free dash as he already has pretty good mobility from other sources. I wish that he could really stalk his prey longer, but unfortunately, from a laning aspect this would let him ride a minion wave from base to his tower. I didn't know if that was quite fair, but it's definitely something I'm willing to tweak (I originally had a longer time). The damage via dash to the target coupled with return of energy and cooldown was an incentive to use the ability for more than mere escape as it would encourage timing and risk management (do I go for the damage/refund, risking pushing too far up in lane and being ganked as a result?). I removed the damage portion as it was ancillary, now it refunds solely on passing through a champion. Zyx cannot regenerate energy while re-embodied now. So this allows for a longer hiding factor.\n\n4. I understand your feelings here. It took me ages to come to a \"mind control\" ultimate that required knowledge to use as well as thematic tie-in and some balance. Lower damage and the channel was a complete must. Zyx has to use this strategically, and most likely during a team-fight or gank only. This being said, I do agree it could be an anti-fun ability. I don't think it takes too much control away, rather the \"anti-fun\" ability could be from small counterplay options. Let me explain:\n\n-A 2 second targeted silence (on only one ability during the ultimate, and it cannot block an ultimate's use from the victim) is far less OP than what we see from what spammable CC in this game brings (i.e. Cho'gath silence or Xerath stun)\n-2 seconds of movement control isn't as powerful as it may seem... \n-His entire ultimate can be cleansed with either the summoner spell or items like QSS.\n-With only 1 second of reflex wiggle room, Zyx has to know his exact plan for use before he ults or risk failing to maximize its potential\n-Being absent from the teamfight for 5 seconds means Zyx has to make his ultimate count.\n\nExample of ult in action:\n\nZyx ults enemy adc, Lucian. He begins with silencing his dash, then proceeds to move him away from the teamfight for 2 seconds. HOWEVER, during this entire process, Lucian can still use his Q/W/R. This means Lucian can still potentially contribute. Another quick example. Zyx ults Ahri and prevents her from using Charm and moves her away from the teamfight. Ahri can use her ultimate to fight the movement away and return back to land her Q and W and finish off your team's adc. In this case, Ahri has plenty control still.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this make things clear?
