It's because young people (kids / teens / young adults) do not have enough experience to understand situations, why do you think they always say we are \"inting\" when we are having a bad game, that supports are bad because of their KDA, their \"reasoning\" is reflected game after game, you saying that it is not true when this game is plagued by the opposite of what you said is disingenuous.\n\nThe player behavioral system was met for extreme cases, racial, death threats, constant flaming and being absolutely mean and unsympathetic to your team mates, if they are being trolls, calling them trolls is not a threat or against the rules, you are purposely reaching for disingenuous reasons to not give me back my honor that I have earned by playing games and being honorable in the first place, just as cordially as I am here on the forums. I speak the raw truth, precise and straight to the point, and I call everything out for exactly what it is, you are being disingenuous.\n\nKids are typically not capable of listening or understanding emotional situations, any field of psychology will vouch for me on this. Their brain's are young and situations in this world have much context that even young adults have not learned how to assess and assimilate. Calling them typical kids is exactly what they are, that's not harassing them, that's not threatening them, that's simply what it is, typical kids, that's what typical kids do,\ndo you not know what \"typical\" means? It refers to their distinctive qualities, this has nothing to do with harassing.\n\nI never ordered them to help me, it's quite sad how much you guys are going to reach for straws to keep people punished, when they are clearly and inevitably not the ones that should have been punished, by looking at the smallest of things you can muster to create a baseless reason to say they deserved it, I simply explained why I died after they blamed me for something they could have prevented by listening to my pings, it's really that simple, you are just being disingenuous as I said.","replies":[{"poster":"XVI Jake IVX","date":"2019-12-13T02:48:03.259+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't have to explain why you die.

Your \"mute all, and hope your team mates can work in unison to win the game\" excuse in dealing with actual toxic players is a cop-out for your blatant incompetence in distinguishing the difference between extreme hate speech and flaming, and someone calling a troll \"a troll\", or a kid \"a kid\". This world has truly gone mad, people just don't use common sense anymore, and even the moderators have lost their minds, something is happening to this world on a global level, and you don't even know it is happening until it's too late, how can you be this daft? It's COMMON SENSE, but this company has clearly created a community that cannot even see what this company is doing to them in plain sight. This is EXACTLY what makes you a typical kid, your responses alone demonstrate how little you understand situations, and how absurd your responses are. You are actually trying to say I deserved the punishment, when there's NOTHING in that chat log that permits ANY punishment, the system is rigged as much as the client is damaged, this company is the problem, not my chat log, you need to open your eyes and stop spouting nonsense that is so easily explained with COMMON SENSE. They probably thought I was typing too much, but in my POST, I SAID \"**I only typed when I could type, I did not type at any point where I could play the game, I only typed while my skills were on cool down, and I was WAITING for them to come back up to finish off the jungle monsters**\". I confirmed that I WAS NOT typing too much, I just type really fast and can write huge paragraphs without any effort, **I got PUNISHED for having astute typing capabilities**! I ALWAYS TYPE FAST IN MY GAMES, AND GUESS WHAT? I WON THEM, AND CARRIED EVEN 4 V 5's WHILE TYPING A LOT -- BEING PUNISHED FOR HAVING TYPING SKILLS IS WHY I TICKED THE PUNISHMENT, MY CHAT LOG PROVES I BROKE ZERO RULES, I AM JUST A REALLY GOOD TYPER -- END OF STORY.

I think maybe you just misunderstood the punishment system. You can be the nicest guy in the world 99% of the time. But if you break the rules, you break the rules. You still get a punishment. That 99% doesnt make you free of punishment, you know? And its an echo chamber because we are addressing your points. We cant all say different shit because that would be off topic. We're all addrssing the same issue, of course its gonna sound like an echo chamber. \n\nAbout the kid thing, I didnt see you ask anyones age. Im 33 and I play this game. They may not be kids, so that point that \"they are kids, kids play this game\" is moot. You dont know that they are kids. To tell an anonymous stranger that they dont understand the situation because theyre a kid, is clearly insulting. You must really think people are stupid if you think we're gonna buy that shit. You used that specific language BECAUSE its condescending. Stop trying to play so innocent about it. We all do it sometimes. Its really fucking obvious, especially considering they were flaming you, so stop insulting my intelligence trying to act like it was completely neutral. \n\nKeep in mind, I've never said anything about you being a jerk or anything. I even said it doesnt make you a bad person. Breaking Riots rules that exist ONLY in the vacuum of this game, does not reflect your character as a person. They are not a moral code to live by, or some kind of life lesson. Im just trying to help you understand the punishment system. \n\nAlso, cherry picking the parts that broke the rules is the only way to help you understand why you got punished. I dont know wtf you want. Should I comment on every single line? What do you expect? \n\nP.S. I've had comments on the boards here removed for condescending. If you report those condescending to you, their comments will get removed. The moderators cant stop people from condescending to you ahead of time, but they will remove it after the fact if that helps :/ I do agree that a lot of people here do get the purpose of these threads wrong. They think its an opportunity to judge someone as a person and virtue signal to them. Its disgusting. Like I said, Riots rules are not a moral code, and I dont take someone getting punished as some sort of indicator of their moral stature. People here should help others understand the system, not shame them for breaking the rules. Thats the whole point of this section... as well as to discuss opinions on the rules/player behavior.

I think maybe you just misunderstood the punishment system. You can be the nicest guy in the world 99% of the time. But if you break the rules, you break the rules. You still get a punishment. That 99% doesnt make you free of punishment, you know? And its an echo chamber because we are addressing your points. We cant all say different shit because that would be off topic. We're all addrssing the same issue, of course its gonna sound like an echo chamber. \n> \n> About the kid thing, I didnt see you ask anyones age. Im 33 and I play this game. They may not be kids, so that point that \"they are kids, kids play this game\" is moot. You dont know that they are kids. To tell an anonymous stranger that they dont understand the situation because theyre a kid, is clearly insulting. You must really think people are stupid if you think we're gonna buy that shit. You used that specific language BECAUSE its condescending. Stop trying to play so innocent about it. We all do it sometimes. Its really fucking obvious, especially considering they were flaming you, so stop insulting my intelligence trying to act like it was completely neutral. \n> \n> Keep in mind, I've never said anything about you being a jerk or anything. I even said it doesnt make you a bad person. Breaking Riots rules that exist ONLY in the vacuum of this game, does not reflect your character as a person. They are not a moral code to live by, or some kind of life lesson. Im just trying to help you understand the punishment system. \n> \n> Also, cherry picking the parts that broke the rules is the only way to help you understand why you got punished. I dont know wtf you want. Should I comment on every single line? What do you expect?\n\nYou are completely missing the point, the point is calling people a kid in the way that I did (not passive-aggressively) is NOT against the rules -- PERIOD, anyone making up a sob story about it is scapegoating, which is not contributing to this thread at all.

These guys are so blinded by their ignorance and self-righteous internet self-proclaimed judgement, that they are actually down voting posts, that disagree with them, not because they are posts with hate, posts that are off-topic, posts that are disgusting or off-limits, but because it goes against their ego, which wants to believe with all of its heart that this punishment was deserved so they can continue to white knight this company, even though it's **100% CLEAR that I was FALSELY punished, I LOST my HONOR that I EARNED for my months of GOOD BEHAVIOR, and this system being FAULTY, and people like them refusing to ADMIT TO ITS FAULTS.**\n\n_Ignore the white knights, take heed to my white text!_  \n\n**I am innocent, no matter how many down votes this thread gets, it does not change the TRUTH!**\n\nI was NOT punished for the chat log (there's nothing in it that breaks any rules),\nI was FALSELY punished for being an elite typographer, I simply type too fast and people think I am typing too much, when it takes seconds for me to write long-winded sentences, the person reviewing my \"report\" ASSUMED that I typed too much, SO PLEASE REVERT MY HONOR (Honor 2, Checkpoint 3),\nI have played THOUSANDS of games typing as fast as I do and WINNING them, these white knights need to be exempted from their privileges on the boards, they have done nothing but accuse, abuse and refuse to be honorable, they have become incapable of fulfilling their authoritative obligation to PROTECT the INNOCENT, instead they white knight and down vote, then turn against the INNOCENT under false pretenses with questionable attitudes and characteristics that do NOT reflect what they expect from the players!
