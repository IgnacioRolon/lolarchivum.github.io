So they came out with ARURF which was a pretty solid solution to that issue. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in spirit of the Holidays, the new Snow Battle ARURF only allows you to play champions that have a winter/holiday/christmas theme skin. Which means, we are back to only seeing the same 20 champions throughout all of our games, except this time those same 20 champions are randomly chosen for you.  I think people will suck it up and play it for a weekend, maybe 2, but will probably not want it coming back ever again. It will get old quickly.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents from spending some time on PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Pixie Storm","date":"2017-12-06T02:21:20.783+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have been playing it on PBE and I hate it. Jax is a HUGE problem, Tryndamere was another, Shaco manage to do nearly 100,000 damage one game I was in, against a Maokai and a Kog maw, laning alone. It will get boring. It will get frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"GeminiRune","date":"2017-12-06T02:51:26.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the Jax issue has always been evident just as Maokai has. It's just that the \"tier list\" is warped to only factor in Winter Champs not named Sona making him more visible than a full scale ARURF (then again, past iterations have your champion pool while this has the entire selection). That's kind of where I draw in a bit of dislike. But my headaches (if you call them headaches or laughing at getting my ass kicked) came more from Draven and Malphite. There are just those champions that freaking hurt.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2017-12-06T01:56:52.401+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would love it if riot just made urf a custom game mode option then ignored it for the rest of time.
