It brings specific skill sets to a whole new light. A game mode where the focus is on extensive champion knowledge, team composition and team fighting. \n\nNo, luck is not the deciding factor in this mode because everyone has the same &quot;luck&quot;. The entirety of the champion pool would have to be unlocked for all players playing ranked aram.\n\nTo my limited knowledge Aram has a respectable population, one that would surely grow if there was a more competitive version just like every other mode.\n\nI&#039;m more than willing to discuss why this can, will, won&#039;t happen. Would this be successful or no? Is it too much to ask from riot? Thoughts?\n\n\n**Edit**: I appreciate the feedback, I am understanding some people's concern with the randomness of aram and why it could be hard to track elo. Though i would like to quote Minarde in response to this concern;  \"Except MMR already exists in ARAM. MMR (and ranked) is based on consistent performance over a large number of games. The LCS players might drop a few games from terrible luck, but if they're consistently losing to the other team, that's not luck at play\"\n \nSo if ranked aram cannot be balanced, then what about ranked Howling Abyss. Where the core focus is still on team composition and 5v5 play but you get to choose and ban champions.","replies":[{"poster":"SchmidttyGames","date":"2017-02-07T21:05:48.426+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is no real way to gauge what we otherwise know as \"elo\" from an entirely random draw.

However, the existence of the casino industry relies on the fact that the final result isn't luck-based. Casinos can profit because, as described by the law of large numbers, the final result tends towards an expected value.

Where the core focus is still on team composition and 5v5 play but you get to choose and ban champions.\n\nI don't think ranked draft HA could work, entirely because draft HA *won't* be balanced. SR handles champ stagnation via frequent balance updates to periodically shuffle which champs are strong and which champs are weak. Unfortunately, Riot historically hasn't applied this philosophy to non-SR maps. Barring reworks, the strong champs on HA have essentially been the same for years. Draft HA would quickly devolve down to \"Pick/ban these 20ish champs. Ignore all others.\"\n\nARAM has the same issue with the lack of Riot balancing attention, but the randomness helps players avoid seeing the same champs over and over. Of course, this ignores the current issue of ARAM-optimized accounts, but that's an implementation detail like number of rerolls, number of bans, and so on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-02-08T05:27:43.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Luck is a deciding factor in everything in life and everyone does not have the same luck.
