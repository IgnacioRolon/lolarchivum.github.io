They see Zoe&#039;s RNG as fine because they say you can play around it.\r\n\r\nI disagree. Which I will explain to you with the following examples.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM NOT SAYING SHE IS OP. I really do not care about her powerlevel in this post, PURELY the RNG part of her kit.**\r\n\r\nIm going to be talking in hypothetical situations here:\r\n\r\nLets say KT is playing VS SKT. Faker locks in Zoe. KT&#039;s jungler (score) is one Elise.\r\nElise is looking to get pawn on viktor ahead early, so he scale or whatever. Doesnt really matter.\r\nElise does standard 2 buffs into camps route and is aiming to gank mid. A bubbled minion spawns.\r\nScore has 2 options. Respect the bubbles potential to drop a free escape and not go for the gank, or go for the gank anyway and risk wasting time. No matter which option he chooses, the rng has already influenced the game here in a way he can not play around.\r\nIf the bubble spawns a cleanse, flash, he wasting his time for the gank and cannot go for it, because there is a bigger chance that he is wasting his time to basically gain nothing.\r\nIf it was spawns a favorable spell/active than Zoe got a FREE gank escape because of the RNG. Maybe in 9/10 situations she will get bad spawns or no bubbles at all and not get a free escape, but this time she does, and its an important game so thats all that matters.\r\nViktor is not in a position to deny her the bubble, and even if he was, the amount of pressure he has to exert in lane or the amount of pressure that is relieved from him, is again, decided by the RNG.\r\n\r\n_Maybe if they played this matchup 100 times, Viktor wins lane 70 times because lets just say that he is a better viktor player than faker is a zoe player. 30% of those games he will not win lane, because Zoe gets lucky summoner drops. (these stats are just an example, in my opinion if zoe wins even 1% of lanes because of lucky summoner drops than it is too much)_\r\n\r\nAnd im not even talking about redemptions map impact, or gunblade giving you a free health advanatage (goodluck zoning her from it, if she picks it up she wins the trade and you cant remove the bubbles)\r\n\r\n* With elemental drakes there is a 6 minute timer ahead of what its going to be. It can still fuck you over, if you draft a lategame team vs an early game team and they get 3 fires which you cant really contest, tough luck. But AT LEAST you get 6 minutes prep time, so perhaps you can get advantages elsewhere, or look to play around it.\r\n\r\n* With crit you are always going to take damage, if it crits or not.\r\n\r\nNeither of those have the impact zoes rng has. 3 fire drakes is huge but games can be decided before they really get into effect. Zoe&#039;s rng has huge impact from the moment she levels it, potentially. A lucky crit will not allow you to impact the entire map as much zoes rng does.\r\n\r\nZoe&#039;s bubble spawns instantly and creates pressure. It could be useless, it could be great, you dont know, and what it is going to drop will affect your playstyle, but you dont know till it drops. And even if you did know, you will get situations where its &quot;oh great, I cant all in zoe because theres an ignite bubble entering lane so its making it much more risky&quot;\r\n\r\n**TL;DR, Zoe&#039;s RANDOM drops are BAD RNG, I explained why.**\r\n\r\n\r\nI love Riot as a company. I like Zoe&#039;s design and theme. I hate the RNG and its impact, and I hope Riot will change their mind on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2017-12-14T15:34:25.820+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":1,"body":"I genuinely feel her W should be castable and to get rid of all these bubbles and item active drops.

There's a part of it that can make or break her laning, of which neither she nor her lane opponent (nor anyone else in the game) has any control over, since it's a random drop. Her whole kit is predicated around landing a single damage ability - so incredibly risk/reward, except the supporting kit around her Q makes it incredibly forgiving for her - from the low cooldown of her Q to the nature of her E, so low risk/high reward.\n\nPeople have aptly pointed out that it's like old-old Nidalee's spears, it doesnt matter how many she throws, she only needs to hit one to kill you or remove you from the fight.\n\nAnd that Nidalee was reworked for a reason.

Then your Zoe gets a teleport drop, and can ruin that entire strategy because of a random drop.

Respect the bubbles potential to drop a free escape and not go for the gank, or go for the gank anyway and risk wasting time. No matter which option he chooses, the rng has already influenced the game here in a way he can not play around.\n\nFalse. He can play around the fact that it's Zoe and go for a gank in a different lane. Respecting a strong Zoe and her W and not going for the gank because of the chance she might outplay me is already an example of the Jungler playing around it. That's the same as me not ganking a strong Akali because I think she has her W up and could outplay me. The bubbles are part of her W ABILITY, the same as any other champion. Why does Zoe and her abilities not deserve the same respect as any other champion? \n\nConsequently, the decision to go for the gank isn't determined by the RNG of Zoe's bubbles either. It's determined by the judgement of the jungler, after seeing the situation that Zoe is in, whether she is overextended or not, and whether they have enough tools to kill her **even accounting for her bubbles.** \n\nIn both cases, Jungler would have had to make against any other champion anyway. The jungler would have had to ask the same question, \"Can we get this enemy despite her abilities?\" and would have decided based on their judgement anyway.\n\nBy Meddler's definition, \"good RNG\" allows players to show their adaptability, adding another type of skill test in addition to the others already present in the game (mechanical skill, coordination with team mates, etc). It can create unexpected situations that test quick thinking, allow unusual actions and can be really exciting. \n\nSounds to me like when it comes to the decision to gank, Zoe's Bubbles are actually GOOD RNG, not bad.\n_________________________________________________________\n\n**OUTCOME OF THE GANK**\n\n> Viktor is not in a position to deny her the bubble, and even if he was, the amount of pressure he has to exert in lane or the amount of pressure that is relieved from him, is again, decided by the RNG.\n\nNot really a fair point. If instead of Viktor, he was playing say Lucian mid, then he could easily deny Zoe's chance to get the bubble. Lane pressure is far less influenced by Zoe's RNG bubbles and far more by champion choice and player skill.\n\nThis entire scenario you gave isn't a good example of Zoe's bubbles being bad RNG, because your entire argument in this part basically rests on the assumption that Zoe's RNG bubbles would unreasonably determine the outcomes of ganks against her. But that scenario assumed the jungler would not have taken Zoe's abilities into account, and it assumed that somehow the laner himself could not contribute to the gank.\n\nEven in the rare scenario that Zoe did get a last-second Flash / Cleanse / Barrier / Exhaust / etc  and undeniably escaped a gank by using it, who's to say that the laner and the jungler couldn't have still succeeded if they had started the gank one second earlier, or what if one of them had the foresight to account for a last-second Flash after seeing the bubble and pre-empt it by placing a skill shot where she'd land?\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n**WINNING LANE**\n\n> Maybe if they played this match-up 100 times, Viktor wins lane 70 times because lets just say that he is a better viktor player than faker is a zoe player. 30% of those games he will not win lane, because Zoe gets lucky summoner drops.\n\nYou've shoe-horned your example to exemplify output randomness. **I F** this situation occurred that frequently, then yes, it'll be mostly luck-based, and that's bad RNG. But in the vast majority of cases, Zoe winning lane could occur due to any number of things, and most reasonably it would happen due to player skill, and assuming equal skill between both players, champion match-up. \n\n> In my opinion if Zoe wins even 1% of lanes because of lucky summoner drops, then it is too much.\n\nEven in this scenario, the Zoe player would still have to make the decision on how to USE the W.
