Nerfing her devourer stacks decrease her snowball potential while the titanic hydra takes away even more clear speed, burst damage, and power spikes. To add to her nerfs, her Q damage was nerfed (% max ad, meaning that her 40% ad nerf is more than just a flat 40ad taken away). Her clear speeds were *again* slowed, while taking away more burst and snowball potential. \n\nIMO it's just too much at once. I feel like she's being overly-nerfed and there is no way to gauge just how bad she'll be until after it's release. By then, Shyvana players will just have to wait until they decide to undo a nerf which will be a while. I'd rather see how she is after the devourer/titanic nerfs and judge whether she needs more nerfs after evaluating the first set.","replies":[{"poster":"Anraton","date":"2016-03-23T17:12:34.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well .. then maybe it was never inteded she is played that way?\n\ndid you read the comment about the nerf? http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-66-notes#patch-champions\n\n\"Lowering her damage in the early stages, especially when dueling champions, should see a stunt in that growth from ‘always on’ to ‘sometimes on’ as her opponents seek to close the gaps in her flame horizon\" \n\nThat is exactly what they wanted and btw it is a 40% damage reduction from 180-->140 thats a damage reduction of about 23% in total ..","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-03-23T17:23:24.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the first part:\nI understand their mission to control her early game and snowball potential, but I feel like they are overdoing it considering the nerf of one of her her powerspike items ({{item:3748}}).

Better Synergy, duelling, and sticking power. So no impact there. Hydra was seen as just being a cheese item on Shyvana and Titanic is REALLY not as strong on Shyvana as people make it out to be. Her power and strength came from two sources:\n\na. She clears so fast that she comes out levels and gold ahead of everyone.\nb. Her damage is mixed, that once she gets ahead in level and gold, its impossible to itemize against her. Good base physical damage, and percentile magic health damage, a combination like that, when it gets ahead, is terrifying. \n\nThat's not to say Titanic doesn't work on Shyvana, it does work, quite well actually, but tangible benefits of Titanic v.s. BORK is not very high, BORK is still a better choice since it covers her weakness of being kited easily. She gets on top of her target, shreds their health fast enough to proc Stormraider's Surge, and its game over, whoever she's targeted is not getting away. Titanic makes it a little more difficult to get to her target, but the trade-off is she melts them faster. Most of those that have played Shyvana for awhile would value the stickiness over the excessive damage. \n\nPeople love to talk about how Titanic increased clear speeds, but Shyvana's burnout already makes clearing among the fastest of any champion, there's no noticeable impact of adding Titanic's cleave to clear speed, it may have made clear speed like .2 seconds shorter, but that's it. She had the fastest clear time, barring maybe Nidalee, before the introduction of Titanic, she'll still maintain the title of fastest clear times. Again, no noticeable impact there. \n\nShyvana mains always value Q for the AA reset, not for its damage, so again, no major or noticeable impact there. Sure, lower damage, but the based damage from Q was mere secondary to the AA reset function. \n\nAll in all, the Shyvana mains actually love this nerf, get the FOTM bandwagon riders off their champion without impacting them badly. and they keep their burnout bonus minion damage.\n\nDon't believe me? http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EAEtxJpe-soon-shyvana-soon\n\nShe still very strong, and in a few weeks, people will realize that again and the circle of QQ will begin again. \n\nJust did a game post-patch to test out. Went 7-0-4 and starved the shit out of their Udyr, four of my kills came in 2v1 situations. It was quite hilarious actually, once at the 9 minute mark, then again at the 19 minute mark. \n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2134268409/217428635?tab=overview\n\nThe devourer nerf was not released live, but even if it was, it would have been a justified nerf. Sated should be happening at about the 20 minute mark, you can consistently get Sated without even being fed or snowballing at the 16-17 minute mark. \n\n<--Shyvana is second most played champion behind Nami since I'm a support main.
