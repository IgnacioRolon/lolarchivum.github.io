It says that i have 0 LP right now, i'm want to play more ranked but i'm not sure what would happen if i lose the first game after my placement. Would i be demoted instantly if i lose?

Getting demoted is neigh impossible to happen just after being placed. \n\nTo get a great in-depth on the Ranked System, I certainly recommend taking a peek at our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ). Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rasikelli","date":"2016-09-04T17:27:30.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, you will be not demoted, you can be calm about this.\nMMR is match making ratio , the higher MMR is more LP u get after win and less u lose after lose. You can lose like 3-4 games in a row I think to get demoted now. www.op.gg you can check your MMR.\nDont be afraid to play rankeds, just dont spam it and stop after few loses. Know your main role and your main 2-3 champions that you can play, and know your secondary role - have few champions in there too. Play basicly 1-3 champions and you will learn the game, watch a lot of videos about league in youtube and guides, know your main champions good. Good luck","replies":[]}]}
