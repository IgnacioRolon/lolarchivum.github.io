I looked at your ticket to check on things for you, and he's in the process of performing repairs including the transfer.  Hit him up in your ticket if you have any concerns, but hang tight-  it should be done in a bit!  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Sonic","date":"2017-06-03T21:05:59.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i responded to him in my ticket about what was up with the transfer because the account is linked to NA already there shouldnt be a transfer of any sort, he never mentioned anything about the transfer, an eta, or that it was even taking place. he also hasnt responded back to me after i replied to him saying my account was restored about the transfer problem. do you know if the account was transferred to another server while it was not under my control?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-03T21:31:55.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Double checked and it looks like he responded back to your ticket.
