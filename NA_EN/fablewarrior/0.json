I was just wondering if that seems right? Like am I just complaining or is there actually some system that screwed me over.\r\n\r\nI love League of Legends, I can deal with awful, toxic teammates, but I feel robbed of my hard work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-19T23:41:55.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the new season everything is getting shuffled down so everyone is likely to find that they placed lower than the previous season.  A soft reset for the season as well as placement matches adjusting will pave the way for divisions/tiers and what they mean for the season.
