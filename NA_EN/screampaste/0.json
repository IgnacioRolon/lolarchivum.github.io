Let&#039;s consider why. \r\n\r\nMy thoughts on the matter are simple; it&#039;s not Jinx herself that is inherently too strong, it&#039;s the tank meta. The tank meta allows Jinx to surround herself with unkillable, hard peeling tanks, so that she can do Jinx things at your team. This covers her greatest and most exploitable weakness: squishy immobility with no reliable self peel whatsoever. \r\n\r\nIt doesn&#039;t matter, though, when she is surrounded by Nautilus, Sejuani, Hec, and Maokai. You simply can&#039;t get to her, and you can&#039;t kill the rest of her team. That, imho, is why Jinx is strong right now, I do not believe she is that strong inherently.

In most case she is a lane bully. On top of that, she has some CC; not the most reliable one but still redundant. Sure you can camp her but this season junglers have been nerfed (current Cinderhulk will be nerfed) and we all know what happens when you gank a Jinx when you are half-health. SMDRocket to your *ss.\n- As a low-mobility champion, you may think that mid-game rotations will impact her because she can't destroy towers fast enough OHWAIT. Also, her passive makes her range even more OP because if someone dies in a midgame teamfight, it's very likely she got an assist for that. There's your mobility.\n- Late game Jinx. I don't think that I need to say more.\n\nHypercarries MUST have weak lanephase as a trade-off. Only a full dedicated team (Maokai, Vi, Zed, Graves, Leona) has an easy time against her.

During the season 4 assassin meta, she was harder to play because of her lack of mobility/escapes compared to most assassins and ADCs with better projection and mobility. With more tanks (and thus CC) running around the Rift she has a better chance of staying alive long enough to have an impact on the game.\n\nSome folks are talking about how she is OP because she can swap between AS-boosted pow-pow or LR fishbones. But remember she has given up a skill slot for that.\n\nHer Get Excited passive is mostly underwhelming and very situational. Something has to die before it procs, and then its active for only a few seconds. Last I checked, an ADC doesn't generally want to suddenly run up to the front line if 1 of the 5 enemies has died. It does function as a nice escape when low after a fight, or as a way to enable a finish. But otherwise, her mobility is certainly no better than average, if even that.\n\nHer ranges effect her dps. If you want the high-dps she has to get into much closer range. If you want the range, you lose dps. You also can't spam rockets early because her base mana pool is very small.\n\nOne thing I agree with is that she has the potential to snowball hard. But if its my pick and the opposing team has already picked Leona, Blitzcrank, Shaco, Graves, Vi, Zed, Leblanc, or Corki for example, I'm not inclined to pick Jinx. Especially Zed. He pretty much insta-gibs Jinx in every fight. And a single grab from blitz is guaranteed death.\n\nImo, Jinx is the least of our worries. Its just that the current tankier meta benefits late-game hyper carries. So she is seeing more use. However, her win rate is stable.\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/champions/jinx&region=all&map=sr&queue=1x1#statistics","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minrog","date":"2015-04-22T13:59:33.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're right OP, but not for Solo Queue.

They are too disorganized to dive/protect the back line so it's not like she's getting peeled for in her matches.\n\nLanding her Zap! skill requires that the enemy champion already be CC'ed, nobody is going to notice if they nerf that.

As you say she can't AOE but if you send someone to fight her they have to be super fed and even then she only has to die if she miscalculates.  In a team fight/siege her 550 range and no skillshots hurts a lot and she has to play less safely to contribute.\n\nCaitlynn and Jinx are built off of the same basic chasis.  Right now Jinx has better bonuses on her autos but Caitlynn is definitely safer.

Secondly, you made several false statements: \"Jinx is 'far less' vulnerable early game than Tristana, Kog, and Vayne.\" Third, I heartily disagree that she's \"mediocre\" early game. She's like pretty much any champion: if you're good enough with them they can be strong at any and all points of the game.\n> \n> I do agree with you that she is a hypercarry though, and can snowball super hard. ;) Plenty of other champs snowball hard though too.\n\ncompared to many other ADCs, Jinx has a terrible early game.  The problem that occurs however is something that Gypsylord noted in another discussion about the nerfs.  He said that the average Jinx \"main\" gets at least 31 games on her compared to an average of 16 or so for most other ADC mains.  This means that your average Jinx player in Solo Queue is going to be far more experienced on the champ than their opponent and they can compensate for just how bad her early game is.\n\nIt's also why so many people keep trying to claim that Jinx is \"far less vulnerable\" than Tristana or Vayne early game even though those two hypercarries have abilities that provide escapes.\n\nThe funny thing is that I play a lot of support or jungle right now as I prepare for ranked play and I've found that Jinx players are very \"feast or famine\"  The good ones tend to be able to slowly assume dominance over the lane unless the jungler is willing to come by and provide a couple of ganks.  The bad ones can be pretty much erased from the game before level 6 and as long as the other team doesn't allow the game to extend too long, Jinx never comes back from that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aych Pii","date":"2015-04-22T13:28:22.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By that logic {{champion:21}} should be just as strong as Jinx in this meta, but I don't really think we'll be seeing much of her.

The other one is Kog.  Anyways, it is slightly true that she is stronger with the tank meta, but because of the tank meta, the ADC's that can dump on her aren't worth taking because they won't be able to kill the tanks late game, which causes the problem I feel.  Yes, they might be able to dump on her in lane if they know what they are doing, but one mistake and she is ahead, basically resulting in you not being able to fight back and just resulting into a longer dragged out game, barring a misplay on her teams part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"metaworldpeace10","date":"2015-04-22T07:34:51.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya I agree with the majority of these posters here. Jinx' rise in popularity is a lie. She's had a win rate between 51-55% over the course of the past year. Her scaling is not smooth at all. She survives until level 6 and can all in at anytime. You can't even sit in lane with half hp against a jinx or else she will all in you and kill you. When you respawn and get to lane? She all ins you again because her ult is up again. Jinx needs nerfs, this is not news. The reason people think it's news is because she's been played in the LCS","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-04-21T23:40:39.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's part of it, but the other hyper carry adcs with a weakness of having weak self peel, (Vayne, Kog, etc) have not been having NEARLY the same success.

My question for you is why do you think she does better in a tank meta than other ADCs?  You'd think Vayne would reign supreme because of her W or twitch/kog/cait because of their range and the ability to shred tanks at long range.\n\nI'm thinking that Jinx's main strength is she's got 2 forms of self peel.  Most other ADCs don't have that and need to hope their team can do the job.  Sivir is doing as well and I think that's because she can E block the other team's CC in addition to pushing and having the R as an engage or as an escape.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-04-23T07:59:07.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd say it isn't Jinx fault for being too strong, but other ADCs to be too weak (xcept cait, graves).\n\nShe's picked cause she can do things other ADCs can't.
