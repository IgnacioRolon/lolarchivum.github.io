CSGO 4. dota 2. \r\n\r\ni have played 3 out of 4 of these games and i have invested in none of them like LoL and i can speak for all the other players one of them my brother wo has spent around a 1000 AED on micro transactions but has stopped playing because of the ping. we support this game, have tourneys and talk about it and watch the lcs like we are watching football. we are a big community and the only thing separating us from being together is a server.\r\n\r\nnow lets talk about solutions. one of them is a region of our but that is a pipe dream i swear i worked so hard for this i have lost all hope from riot. however, there is the garena server which has 80-90 ping which is way better that 150-170. the issue is we dont have access to that server since my country (UAE) isnt allowed for it since it isnt SEA. so, all i am asking is to allow us to make an account there.\r\n\r\ndont tell me to go talk to them. i did and they told me to talk to you. i am not doing that again. dont tell me to check the other regions for ping i did that and don tell me you cant do anything. we are a whole community here an allow us to transfer please, we have spent money on this game and we dont want to lose our 300 dollar skin. \r\n\r\nplease help us we beg you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T02:02:04.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a matter of deciding whether or not to let people transfer to the Garena servers, is a matter of whether we *can*. We simply can't transfer accounts to or from the Garena region since they are hosted on a separate platform and run by a different group. The only way to play on the Garena server is to physically live in that area.","replies":[{"poster":"jaefar","date":"2017-12-29T09:07:38.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair enough. then im afraid i have to transfer to another game. none of my friends play league anymore and there is no use climbing ranked with a disadvantage.","replies":[]}]}]}
