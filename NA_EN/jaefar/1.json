Ping is usually 130-170 which somewhat atrocious to play. We cant climb, let alone enjoy the game that we love so much. If there is any reason to why you cant make a server for either regions we of the arab community would love to hear the reason/reasons why.\r\n\r\nlove\r\n\r\narab league community","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-05T01:35:27.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Broporo said, it's difficult for them to find a suitable place for them to set up servers and not worry about losing those valuable assets. I was born in the Middle East and I can tell you that there the only places in that region that would be suitable to establish a server would probably be Lebanon, Jordan or Israel. North Africa is even more risky - maybe Morocco or Algeria would be the only places in North Africa where they could set up servers. However, the main concern is still securing the stability of those servers in an unstable region. It sucks but that's just the way it is.\n\nSalam Alaikum","replies":[{"poster":"jaefar","date":"2017-08-05T11:47:33.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wa alaikum al salam. the gcc (gulf council countries) are a great place for servers. valve has theirs up there for dota 2 and cs go but if there were more to it than this i would love to hear.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-05T17:29:36.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot Ahab is the one who is responsible for this kind of stuff the last time I checked so you could try and make a thread asking him about it in particular. But again, I'm not sure if he even works at Riot anymore or if that's still the job he does. Or you could ask Broporo in this thread about that too.","replies":[{"poster":"jaefar","date":"2017-08-05T17:33:01.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah im still waiting for broporo's reply.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-05T00:36:59.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest ordeal with trying to get servers setup in those areas is mostly having to find a suitable location for the physical computers that the servers are on. We can still troubleshoot your network to see if we can smooth out that connection a bit though. Let's use this [**network settings guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure certain ports are open, and let's go ahead and flush your DNS while you're at it.

UAE Dubai, i dont think you will find any issues setting up your servers there. valve has theirs up there for dota 2 and cs go. there is also countries like bahrain, saudi arabia and kuwait. if you set up servers in countries like turkey and brazil i think you will have even less of an issue with these countries especially dubai.","replies":[]}]}]}
