After troubleshooting for a while it seems that the best fix is to switch to Verisign's Public DNS server which is 64.6.64.6 and 64.6.65.6 for the alternate. This has been the only solution thus far for anyone else having these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Meowpai","date":"2017-10-28T02:06:52.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the suggestion, but unfortunately that did not work either :(\n\nEDIT: WOW JK IT WORKED.

After you change it then open the client and see if the issue persists.\n\nEdit: Awesome!

It then needs to be set back to the public DNS. Also turn off IPv6 in the properties to avoid any IPv6 connections. If it is using that public DNS and not trying to automatically get another one from Google Fiber, and you have IPv6 turned off then there might be some other issue with Google Fiber beyond the DNS. Hopefully this works for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Meowpai","date":"2017-10-29T05:56:21.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyy I am able to play using these settings now.
