They have good champion diversity, which makes it hard to counterpick/ban, and they do seem very effective at opportunistic and evolving plays.\n\nAlthough it is unlikely they will upset top tier teams such as TSM (which would require either an epic mid game battle or shutting Bjergsen down)... it is very possible they could be looking at a top 6 finish this Summer.  I am hoping  that they don&#039;t shy away from champion diversity (OMG {{champion:55}} in LCS :)) simply because of the \"conventional LCS Meta\".\n\nAlas:  Only Time Shall Tell...\n\n\n\n**BTW Note to NME:**\n\n*The \"E-sports\" part of your name is unnecessary... and as a general note; having \"E-Sports\" or variations thereof, is kinda, uhm, \"funkyiness\" and nonspecific (everyone is a \"E-sports\" team).

Adding the Esports just associates them with a specific community.\n\nEven so... instead of using a generic term such as \"Esports\" they could use a completely unrelated word, such as a noun or adjective of the English language LoL.\n\nI mean... if you are trying to sub-brand your product as part of an organization (I assume this is the logic you are going with) you can do it with something completely different... as my thread title hints to the \"trademark\" of one for example you have \"Comcast\" the cable company with their \"Xfinity\" cable service.\n\nAs to the case of Enemy... something like Enemy+ \"Force, Alliance, Faction, Dominion\" or adjectives such as \"Extreme, Epic, Awesome, Unstoppable\" or whatever LoL... if I had more brain power today I could come up with a better list.\n\nIn either case... whenever I see an Esports teams (which usually is more common with Asian teams/English translation related issues) use \"Esports\" in their team name:  It just sounds redundant and retarded.  I guess one way to explain it is like calling a \"traditional\" sports team, such as RIOT area local MLB \"Anaheim Angles\" the \"Anaheim Angles Sports\" or something.  It just sounds retarded no doubt.\n\n I know that some people continue to insist upon using the \"Esports\" term... but shoving it in your face all the time only induces the opposite physiological effect that is intended:  IT just makes me hate it more.\n\nIf this post isn't good enough explain for you... I presume I could spend some more brain power trying to make a better case for my argument... alas hopefully it works out.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-10T14:08:53.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your argument is that most organizations that sponsor a team give a flying rats backside about anything more than advertising the team will bring them and/or the visibility of their products. Most don't. They make a simple choice to add \"eSports\" or \"Gaming\" or \"Team\" to the some part of the brand to identify that even though it is part of that organization it is not part of the main body.\n\nBelieve me I would rather it be different, but your sports reference does not help or even compare to the same issue. As most sports teams are owned by multiple organizations and as such they are identified by location (LA Lakers, Oakland Raiders) and the owners they have no way to brand themselves as such because of the multiple contributions. \n\neSports teams while being sponsored by multiple organizations are typically own by a single one (which collaborates with said sponsors to get funding for the team). Because of this they have to add it. Most of the biggest names in LoL eSports have \"Gaming\" or \"Team\" or yes even \"esports\" in their name.  With the exception of TSM, UoL, Alliance, Fnatic, and some others. \n\nIn all honesty, I could give little to no thought to what a team calls themselves. Unicorns of Love could have been called TittyMasters Gold for all I care, I simply commented on your \"Side Note\" that didn't seem to understand that most organizations that own a team don't give it much thought. They keep their brand, add a Team, Gaming or Esports and be done with it. And your disagreeing with it is even worth less thought than that.\n\nI don't see why you need brain power on a debate that is inconsequential and pure semantics, but do as you will.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-04-11T02:14:00.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vixanys,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=aHw9ZILO,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-04-10T14:08:53.047+0000)\n>\n> Your argument is that most organizations that sponsor a team give a flying rats backside about anything more than advertising the team will bring them and/or the visibility of their products.

Many LoL players don't even care about LCS, let alone other video gamers of the world.\n\nThis debate may seem trivial... however it is more important as a long term perspective to be considered as to the future of the \"E-sports\" concept.  Branding is everything in the end... it can make or break everything; and of course whether it is logical or not, human emotions makes the concept of branding *very* fundamental to human interactions.\n\n\nIN other words:  If LoL/LCS is to have a positive and success future; to have general acceptance as a \"legitimate culture, sport, or otherwise\", it needs to make sure \"all the bases are covered\" and even small issues such as the team names of LCS teams have lasting and standing authority.\n\nEven disregarding the opinions of \"outsiders\" (non-gamers) for a moment:  One cannot deny that a name such as \"TSM\", being American and in line with the \"U-S-A\" chants of a patriotic nature, is team branding at its finest.  It is all the \"small stuff\" that when added up together can have a big impact.\n\nSo would a Rose, called by any other Name, sound as Sweet?  Probably not...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ethyreon","date":"2015-04-10T01:33:12.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that they have a pretty good chance at being an average or better than average team. They have a very strong understanding of champ select and are well coordinated with good shot calling which might not sound like much but certainly puts them ahead of the bottom teams. I think those things carry over well into the LCS, while mechanical skill is harder to judge. If they tighten it up a bit I bet they will be around 4-5th.\n\nOn the topic of their name I don't see why you are getting so hung up on that. They are an esports team. Their name states that. Real Madrid's full name is Real Madrid Club de Futbol, basically every soccer team is they same way in whatever language. It's pretty common for names to designate what things are.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-04-11T02:03:19.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ethyreon,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=aHw9ZILO,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-10T01:33:12.489+0000)\n\n> On the topic of their name I don't see why you are getting so hung up on that.

CLG (or teams with \"...Gaming\") could be argued to this point because the terms \"Counter-Logic\" for example would grammatically have a predicate following it (in this case \"to game\").  IT does not reference E-Sports however.\n\nMy general disposition against the use of \"E-sports\" term as well probably affects my statement as well... alas again I am not only one who shares this view.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PoisonedTea","date":"2015-04-09T09:04:58.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They dominated the Challenger Scene.
