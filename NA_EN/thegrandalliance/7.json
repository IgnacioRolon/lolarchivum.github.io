A team that cannot even play together won't go anywhere.  Elements aren't losing on play:  They are simply losing on comps.  Changing the players around will not solve their core problems... and just get the team to break apart all together.\n\nIt bad enough they change their team every few seasons.  Alas... they may just fall into 8-9th place and get demoted out of LCS this split all together...\n\n.#FNCWIN\n\nIndeed it is so...","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-03-07T00:26:10.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ELEMENTS 0-2 THIS WEEK....

Last week they were winning hard against Giants but ended up losing because Rekkles and Nyph got caught out of position, and then Kev1n got bursted down right afterwards. You don't lose games like that just because of team compositions.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-02-26T11:25:00.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AndMann,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=pR5wRVdx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-26T04:07:21.181+0000)\n>\n> Elements is most certainly losing to play.

Usually its a Rumble that they cannot use well, or a Regnar that doesn't do much.\n\nTheir comps are always high risk, low probability of success style and unless they are playing that comp well; which this year they are not, they fail.\n\n\nJust moving players around won't solve this...","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-26T18:35:32.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We meet again, First off SkumbagKrepo was never on Alliance (what became of clg.eu) he with Yellowpete and Snoopeh went to NA to form Evil Geniuses. Froggen/Wickd (the remaining of clg.eu) formed Alliance. There was never an Evil Geniuses.EU. So this may have just been a typo or a bit of confusion on your side.\n\nNext, most of failures this split with Elements has been lack of playmaking. Not comp.  Froggen has been playing sometimes supportive champions with no playmaking ability. When he picks Ahri/Kassadin/Lissandra the usually win! When he's on a Lulu/Anivia/EZ (LOLS) the rest of the team plays too passively and they lose! (Note that I say USUALLY)\n\nTheir Rotation of players has been to rotate out people that play passively to bring in more aggressive/playmaking players.\n\nThe problem in my mind is Rekkles. He is just too passive. Even when he was on Fnatic he was forced to play Aggressive by an Aggressive Support in YellowStar.  When Tabbz was on the team (Alliance). Froggen and Shook were the ones that made plays and the Nyph/Tabbz were the clean up. The synergy was there. Now it just seems like with Rekkles they are too passive and too reliant on Froggen to make all the plays.\n\nAlso, I find it funny you say the following:\n> ... alas if you look at all of elements matches this season they lose because of the team comps they choose they cannot play.\n\nThen\n\n>Their comps are always high risk, low probability of success style and unless they are playing that comp well; which this year they are not, they fail.\n\nWhen the key component \"Play the comp\" {{champion:36}} \n\nBut the issue isn't their play {{champion:36}} {{champion:36}} ","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-02-27T22:47:41.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ... alas if you look at all of elements matches this season they lose because of the team comps they choose they cannot play.\n> \n> Their comps are always high risk, low probability of success style and unless they are playing that comp well; which this year they are not, they fail.\n> \n\nWhat I am saying... to combine these two into one sentence; is that, they choose bad team comps that are high risk (for any team), cannot play them no matter how hard they try, and therefore should never have chosen that comp in the first place.  Thus they lose on champion select because they chose a losing comp for the players of Elements.\n\nIN other words... when they choose certain team comps Elements are doomed to fail 90%+ of the time.  Therefore \"them playing the comp better\" isn't an option *Because They Can't* :({{champion:55}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
