Although they can teamfight; the results are not always reliable and because Asian teams have a hyper-aggressive playstyle, they may be caught off guard more then once.\n\nI must say Dyrus did good this time which was surprising alas.  Indeed he did get to play League of Legends.  GG with Lustboy on support {{champion:85}} .  Not only did C9 ban attempts to target support backfire... it actually gave TSM a composition that worked even better.\n\nAlso... why does anyone use {{champion:117}} anymore?  She has been completely a waste of space LCS wise for ages now, and even on the few games her team wins, she has little impact thereof.\n\n\nAll in all:  Outside of first game \"sloppiness\" which seems to follow TSM around, they did dominate the series thereafter.  If they can work on some things they are still shy on, and make sure to get their teamfighting in order for countering Asian playstyles, they should have a shot at MSI.\n\n\nThat is... if Fnatic doesn't stop them first {{champion:40}} \n\n\nIndeed it is so...","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-04-20T01:16:04.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best players in the NA LCS Spring Finals are from Denmark and Korea....\n\nGotta give credit to Wildturtle again though, he gets alot of criticism but in my opinion he is by far the best adc in NA, especially in teamfights he always comes out big.","replies":[{"poster":"Maliginant","date":"2015-04-20T02:12:53.366+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll admit that Wildturtle did well that series, but I also feel that sneaky wasn't really given the same chance to shine in that series due to the fact that his team was normally behind.

These are not large scale projects that alter the game in any way.  World of Warcraft; for example, does this all time even now, alas it is but a shell of its former glory.  Riot has \"bigger fish to fry\" indeed.\n\nLike... is LoL going to be here 20 years from now?  Even you probably would assume it wouldn't last 20 years.  Even 10 years you may agree.  Just because it may be the \"highest viewed on Twich\" is like saying your King of an Empty Wasteland that has few competition, and minimal interest.  Even if the total viewership (**defined as EU/NA; non Asian regions**) is 1-3million (which is a generious estimate) it is still a fraction of the overall game industry.  Elder Scrolls Online may still have approx. 1 million \"users\" (log in at least once a month) but yet nobody here is saying how wonderful that game is.  Guild Wars 2 most certainly has somewhere near that according to their own statistics but yet the same.\n\nThe point is:  If LoL is ever going to \"become something other then a niche' concept\" and broaden its appeal to far greater number of players... the current strategy isn't working.  Every once and awhile there are \"glimmers of hope\" such as with their Original Video ANimations (The New Dawn as example) but without more concrete basis yet nothing.\n\n\nAnd lets not forget:  There is a whole section of this forum about people {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  about the wholesale abandonment of the Game's Lore and continuously broken Riot Promises that \"something is just right around the corner\" (been saying that for years now).\n\nThe conclusion is that; if there is not something \"right around the corner\", this game will forever be limited to a purely \"Player vs Player\" audience, which currently industry wide as a MOBA, is very limited in appeal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-01T04:34:50.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what novels you have been reading but Riot is looking to the future, they have clear definitive plans for the future.

I would be surprised if the game didn't have another 5 years in it at least, though most of the appeal will be generated by various leagues of competitive play as it is right now.\n\nCompetitive League expands upon the Word of Mouth logic and brings in collectively more and more fans.

Lag (for EU), AFKers/Trolls, Bronze Drama, Skill Differential (lack of a proper \"on-boarding process\" for new players), Champion Balance, Meta Issues (the jungle for example)... all of these and more bring the game back around.\n\nIndeed \"popular opinion\" did build up LoL from nothing in 2009 age but now 5 years later it is the very same force that will bring it down.  I have seen many of my friends of a range of levels from Bronze to Master on both NA/EU leave when they otherwise would have stayed.  For LoL to have \"staying power\" it has to have core momentum that is driven by the game, and not by player imput.  Otherwise LoL will simply decay, and \"die\" with time.\n\n\nFurthermore, least you forgot, the \"word of mouth\" approach only got so far.  Throughout it's history LoL has been known as \"a toxic community\".  And although at certain points (such as around lauch) this toxicity was tempered this was always a \"turn off\" for mainstream gamers.  The percentage of gamers who MOBA is still rather quite low... even when compared to other online gaming experiences such as MMORPGs.\n\n\n**With funding and vision the LoL game franchise could be far greater then what it is today; ending far beyond the MOBA it is today, alas I don't yet see it happening here yet.  Indeed once again another game company, coming so close to a Grand Conquest of the Video Game Industry, only to fall at the very end:  This game has at best 1 more season before it completely collapses under it's own weight otherwise.**\n\n\n**Least we not forget:  RIOT (although owned by a mega Chinese Internet company) is a \"One-Game Army\" and if it cannot manage it's future it will eventually go bankrupt.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-30T05:54:18.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with this, is that there is no position (from what I know) at Riot, that is staffed enough for this.

NA as a result is not as competitive, the skills don't advance as far, and Koreans team therefore have an advantage.  In the end it will be which team can play the MSI patch the best who will win... and this could be a team like TSM or perhaps not...","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-23T02:37:14.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Indeed shotcalling is important assuming the team can respond to the calls of course.

I still don't think it is far, but we will see.\n\nAbout the shotcaller, its easy to shotcall when you are ahead, especially when the lead is from laning. I have yet to see TSM have amazing shotcalling when behind. Whereas Hai was a better shotcaller in all situations.

Statistically NA is better than EU right now, but that is all in the stats and is neither here nor there. My problem with Fnatic is Shut down Reignover/Huni. Shut down Fnatic and even moreso, shut down one or the other and you still have a huge advantage to winning. Steelback isn't a carrier.
