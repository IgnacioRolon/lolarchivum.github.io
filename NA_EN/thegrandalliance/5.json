Featuring the Penta, Mic Check, the Last Hit and Fantasy breakdowns, PTL also highlights the biggest games from the LCS, LPL, LMS and LCK and hits up regional experts such as Chobra, Sjokz, and Pastrytime for their inside info.","url":"http://na.lolesports.com/articles/primetime-league-week-14","image":"http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/pD_UfsYL5TI/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since they moved PTL to 4PM it appears to feel different... and no longer broadcasted Live.  This becomes evident in the most recent episode PTL Week 14; as for the Last Hit, they featured a Blooper Reel that included content from the current episode.\n\nIn these outtakes Kobe gave out PTL Awards; as for the award for \"Best MEME\" at [1:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD_UfsYL5TI#t=3930), he \"broke out in laughter\" (\"HOT PINK GG\").  In the original broadcast (56Minutes) it is clean without this breakup.\n\nTherefore, unless certain segments are live and others are not, there can be no other conclusion then that PTL is now tape delayed (recorded at 3PM for a 4PM stream).\n\n\n**YES I FIGURED OUT UR EVIL PLANS RIOT:  YOU&#039;RE NOT SLIPPING PAST ME NOW!** {{item:3364}} \n\n\n\n...AND as to the People who may claim \"It was never live...\"\n\n[Been there, Done That](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports/uXsRQpgU-lol-need-proof-that-ptl-is-live) : Already demonstrated it as to the contrary in a previous thread of mine.\n\n{{champion:114}} \n\n\nIndeed it is so...","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-05-07T04:58:16.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HEY UR SUPPOSED TO BE IN FLORIDA RIGHT NOW NOT TROLLING THREADS AGAIN!  THOUGHT I GET A FEW DAYS BREAK OMG:)\n\n\nAlas... the clip I referenced wasn't intended to be judgmental of the show: It was simply one of possibly many examples to prove/evidence my claim of my thread.  One of the reasons I liked PTL before was the live nature of the show (which is true of any live TV programming).  That is \"anything can happen\".\n\n\nIs it less \"troll fodder\"?  As being one myself to point things out yes perhaps.  Nevertheless the show loses some of its \"magic\".\n\nBTW I am in troll mode OVERRIDE apparently because I am finally getting the attention of RIOT... been getting random and logically unjustified actions against this account for the first time in ever.
