A Big Nerf","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"...call me a noob or whatever alas from what I was able to test with the nerf to her W she doesn&#039;t do enough DMG to Dragon now pre 6 (and even if you stack jungle buffs) and you die before you can kill it.  I would call that a preeeeeety big nerf if a jungler cannot solo kill a dragon (as a nerf to map pressure) vs junglers who still can.\n\nRIOT:  \"YEA EVERYONE USES {{item:3718}} !!! SO WE MUST NERF ALL OTHER PLAYSTYLES!\"\n\nBTW Pre 6 you won't have enough gold for the above item so its \"Shyvana buff\", assuming that logic is even true, is irrelevant.  Its like every time I start to \"L2P\" a new champion of mine and RIOT ALWAYS NERFS IT...\n\nSome points to Mention from Below:\n\n>Alas even assuming there is a \"way\" now to solo dragon lvl 4-6... the point remains that now you have to buy \"more stuff\" then before to be able to do it: No more early lvl 3 Dragon kills... vs for example a champion such as {{champion:20}}.  Now you have to be so far along in gold early game that you will therefore be around lvl 6 anyways before you can do Dragon... which is generally, especially LCS wise, a time that Dagon is focused upon already.\n\n>Therefore it is a NERF and a change to early gameplay jungle strategies of {{champion:102}} .\n\n\n\nIndeed it is so...","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-07-12T02:18:49.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've not had any issues soloing it at level 5 with Skirmisher's Sabre and Dagger.

However because having upgraded {{item:1039}} + even 2 {{item:1042}} isn't enough IDK how pots would make a difference.\n\nBefore you could do Solo Dragon even without upgraded at lvl 5... and sooner if you had at least  {{item:3706}}.  Now even with jungle buffs included it does not appear to be enough.  The point remains that Shyvana used to be able to easily solo dragon... now as I indicated it is far harder to do so now.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-07-12T02:27:14.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=endlesssorcerer\n\nIt shows both normal and ranked games.\n\nAlso, before it gets brought up I must have editted my post after you loaded the page and before you refreshed.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-07-12T02:31:36.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EndlessSorcerer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=roivoeoJ,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-07-12T02:27:14.196+0000)\n>\n> http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=endlesssorcerer\n> \n> It shows both normal and ranked games.\n> \n> Also, before it gets brought up I must have editted my post after you loaded the page and before you refreshed.\n\nYes probably so.\n\n\nAlas even assuming there is a \"way\" now to solo dragon lvl 4-6... the point remains that now you have to buy \"more stuff\" then before to be able to do it: No more early lvl 3 Dragon kills... vs for example a champion such as {{champion:20}}.

It is now documented. Sorry!\n\n> We'll level with you - just like Xin Zhao with Sated Devourer (context on both below!), Shyvana has shown in playtesting to be a universal nightmare. Since 5.11, the Half-Dragon's been tearing the jungle a new one and the prospect of letting the strongest and fastest on-hit centric out into a post-devourer world unscathed left us terrified. Like Xin's pre-emptive changes we're happy to revert these if necessary, but these kinds of precautions could be the difference between a really powerful champion and 'The Great Warwick Incident of Preseason 2015'. And no one wants that. ”\n\n> W - Burnout \n\n>DAMAGE PER SECOND:  20/35/50/65/80 ⇒ 20/33/45/58/70\n\n\nBTW although this \"small change looks small\"... if you want to solo Dragon pre 6 (and esp without items) you need every DMG point you can get because you/dragon are like 1-3 hits from killing each other in general.  Now she is just too week to solo kill Dragon even if you have most of the Devour items.","replies":[]}]}
