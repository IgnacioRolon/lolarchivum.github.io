I guess not.\n\nAs posted in regards to other non-worlds international events:  I fail to understand *why do we care* about this event especially if it will just disappear from the history books as soon as it is over.  If it doesn't exist on Lolesports.com... it is like it never even happened...\n\nIn other words... lets say you completely new to LCS action and just started 1+ month from now.

The fact that RIOT allows a loser Intel-backed organization to pirate its activities and have the arrogance to call itself a \"World Championship\" (especially since Hearthstone, Starcraft II and LoL all have their own company-issued leagues (Blizzard; Riot)) is itself a \"Crime Against Humanity\"...\n\nIn other words... IEM and its 9-year history at its attempt to \"invent E-sports\" is the reason why 90%+ of gamers think that E-sports are fake... because they are.  IEM and its activities are nothing more then a 3-day \"infomercials\" for Intel products... and have no desire to do anything about anything regarding the Video Game industry.\n\n\nI mean come on... Intel still claims that their \"integrated graphics\" can somehow replace the use of a dedicated GPU (Nvidia/AMD).  I mean how can you reason with people who \"deny global warming\"?\n\n/EPICFAIL","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-15T01:56:48.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your reasoning is like Riot/Blizzard is attempting to go to a wedding (IEM) and take it over as their own.

RIOT does terrible job with this (and Esports).\n\nAllowing IEM to take the spotlight, and then make it like it never even happened, hurts the brand image of LoL... It is as if \"real sports\" like the NFL to allow its teams to participate in third-party events.  Or even international ones.  By \"legitimatizing\" IEM you hurt the image andf the significance of LCS... especially since inter-league play here is limited.\n\nNow... you may disagree with this logic... nonetheless the track history of IEM/ESL has consistently shown to wreck the image of E-sports.  Why do so few gamers (even LoL players) disagree with the logic that \"e-sports are a sport?\"  When events such has IEM happen that is why.\n\nJust watch the opening ceremonies for evidence to this effect... IEM competition is a complete trivialization of competitive gaming... throwing random games and players together and calling an event.  Would this be fair if the games in question did not have a pre-established official tournament sequence (such as older or less popular games)?  Perhaps... but if you *actually pay attention to the script of the opening ceremonies;* such as claims that \"the best teams around the world come together to find out who is the best\" and so forth,  it is clear that the IEM people somehow think their event supersedes BlizCon/LCS Worlds in terms of \"skill\"... hence their \"World Championship Title\".  There is only one LoL World Championship... and that is LCS.. not some made up IEM thing.\n\nOf course... being that few of the \"best teams\" even participate in this event it is no wonder either.  Who wins IEM?  Who Cares?..\n\nYou of course might likely be so... nevertheless you're like the 1% of E-Sports fans who do.  If the goal is to promote LoL and other games as \"sports\"... events and false-flag leagues such as ESL just do everything humanly possible to trash this effort  To deny this is to deny the shear statistics that indicate that \"interest\"/Viewership/Revenue or otherwise is almost non-existent for \"E-sports\" when compared to other video games genre participation.\n\nThis has nothing to do with \"personal opinion\"... this is the overwhelming opinion of a supermajority of gamers (and world population even if that is relevant) who could care less about E-Sports.  IEM is a shame to the effort of E-Sports (as other failed leagues before it) and shouldn't exist at all in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2015-03-13T23:01:00.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://en.intelextrememasters.com/season9/worldchampionship/","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-03-15T00:45:01.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skia Asteri,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=T9qcqrEE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-13T23:01:00.266+0000)\n>\n> http://en.intelextrememasters.com/season9/worldchampionship/\n\nLOL yes I know that it exists somewhere on the ESL site... alas the point of this thread is that info/details/VOD of a RIOT-owned game event doesn't appear on a RIOT-owned server (lolesports.com).","replies":[]}]}]}
