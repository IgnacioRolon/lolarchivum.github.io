Why do we care again?... Why do the LCS teams care again either?\r\n\r\nThere is no incentive for any team to \"play their best\" because there is nothing on the line.  Furthermore; as in teams of other \"sports\", they may not play their best... that is any \"secret strategies\" they have will unlikely be used unless something is on the line (in Worlds).  This of course is not to ruin any competitive advantage when they need it most later this year.\r\n\r\nIs it a fun thing to have to get all the teams together?  Perhaps.  But if there isn't any (logical) reason to *win* it other then ego reasons.... well why again?...\r\n\r\n\"BECAUSE I CAN!!!\"{{champion:55}} Apparently is RIOT's response...\r\n\r\nAnd lastly:  (Northern) Florida?.....\r\n\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed it is so...","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-05T17:54:55.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, for some teams, it is important. International Experience. LCS (NA/EU) have extremely limited source of this in their format. Chinese teams have a shit-ton of games throughout their \"season\" but Series of 2 is still limiting in adaptation and evolving to an opponents strengths.\n\nNext, Diversity in meta. Chinese Over-Aggression, EU ADC/MID lane Focus, Jungle Heavy NA, Tilt-creating Korean styles clashing in a tournament that isn't Worlds, helps teams see how they would stack up without having to stress about what the cost of that experience costs.\n\nThe Mid Season Invitational is kind of like a Pre-Worlds preview of what may happen. And gives the teams plenty of time to clean up their play and strats before Championships are on the time. It does also, give dominating regions the ability to see the other regions play styles directly (There is sooo much more to learn from playing again a team that VODs, Match Histories, Past Performances do not show you).\n\nAs I have mentioned in another MSI related thread, North Florida has immediate access to International travelers, and likely provides a venue that will accommodate Time There (not just play but Setup, Promotion, cleanup) and the size they want to make this (in recent time) Eastern US event.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-03-07T00:01:37.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes... that all sounds good... but alas... WHY?...\n\nLCS teams are not limited to playing in their leagues... if they wanted to train out of region there is always soloq/team mode they can train in.\n\nThe point remains that the cost to fly everyone out there on a moment's notice to *northern* Florida (seriously; if ur gonna do Florida, you cannot go mid/Orlando area?...) is hardly justified by this MSI.  Can it be a fun experience?  Yes... however Northern Flordia seriously lacking in the \"activites\" department of course...\n\nCan you \"learn\" something?  Yes you can always learn something by playing other players. HOWEVER... especially as a spectator; or otherwise as some \"unskilled/casual observer of LCS\" action (which apparently accounts for 90%+ of playerbase), someone on the fence or otherwise fails to believe that E-Sports is a \"thing\":  I fail to understand how this event \"advances the cause of E-Sports\"...\n\n\"Last minute tournaments\" are never a good idea in any situation alas...","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-09T15:22:50.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"MSI has been an announced event since the start of the season.

And even that is minor.  \n\nThis is going to be fun, this is going to be entertaining. And this is going to be some encouraging experience for teams going. \n\nToo many things can cause an online event to run into issues. Lag, DDoS, dishonesty (looking at player swaps or playing under another players name) that a LAN environment bypasses.

Can it be \"entertaining\"?  Can anything on YouTube be (possibly) \"entertaining\"?\n\nYes... but that doesn't mean it is worth it for the 7+billion humans to care... even just ones who play video games for that matter....\n\nIn other words:  If the goal is to make \"E-Sports a thing\"... then events like this one are not helping that cause.  Nor does events like this get people who are casual; if that at best, in regards to competitive gaming viewership, to \"become more interested\".\n\nThe most logical comparison to \"normal\" sports is that to All-Star games... rather it be MLB, NFL, or NBA.  Do these events \"exist\"?  Yes.  Do people care?  Generally not....","replies":[{"poster":"B00B00","date":"2015-03-11T19:34:52.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats like saying the community shield, FA cup and the club championships even the europa league (prior to the 2015 season) in english football are useless and WHY are they played, if the goal is to make esports a thing then this is exactly what they need to do, there are multiple cups and invitationals in all sports with not much ''point'' but they are all there and every sport has them. \n\nthe answer as to WHY? - to give experience, entertainment, subs a run out, some lesser known teams some exposure, etc.\n\nnow as for you saying its not really ''entertaining'' as the stakes are so low, if you support a team in any sport more than the others you will love watching them at any event/game regardless of whats at stake same goes for certain players.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGrandAlliance","date":"2015-03-11T22:04:02.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=STRAD SoulShank,realm=EUW,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=0vAxKx0E,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-11T19:34:52.426+0000)\n>\n> thats like saying the community shield, FA cup and the club championships even the europa league (prior to the 2015 season) in english football are useless and WHY are they played, if the goal is to make esports a thing then this is exactly what they need to do, there are multiple cups and invitationals in all sports with not much ''point'' but they are all there and every sport has them. \n> \n> the answer as to WHY? - to give experience, entertainment, subs a run out, some lesser known teams some exposure, etc.\n> \n> now as for you saying its not really ''entertaining'' as the stakes are so low, if you support a team in any sport more than the others you will love watching them at any event/game regardless of whats at stake same goes for certain players.\n\nYes I know for people who care about LCS like you and others here yes...\n\n\nAlas my point is directed to casuals... who may not be engaged with Esports... and take a lot of effort to *get them to care*.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-11T19:55:57.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you STRAD, there doesn't need to be stakes for the general fanbase to want to watch it live. Meet pros from reason they don't live in and overall just have a community event.\n\nThis event is not for the stakes. There isn't an impact on competitive scene beyond NA/EU/CN/KR and the Wild Card teams meeting up and duking it out. The interest for fans, is just that. Meet some KR/CN/EU/NA fans you couldn't meet, have a community event, and just have fun.\n\nThe event is entertaining in the same way League PAX or IEM Events are entertaining. Meetups and Matchups!\n\nWe also have no idea of the prize pool that may or may not be a factor. So speculation on that is not needed. Go to the event if you want. Meet some pros. And enjoy the thing. If that is not your slice of fun, then at least stop complaining about it.\n\nI would definitely go if I could, but *alas* I am a bit too far away for that.
