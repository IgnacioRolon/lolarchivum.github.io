Don't cheat or be a **** and you don't get punished. Riot won't permanently ban an account for the first offense under normal circumstances.\n\nAnd if you read the EULA, it's not theft. Riot owns your account and you are renting their content. The state they reserve the right to rescind any content you have rented at any time.","replies":[]}]}
