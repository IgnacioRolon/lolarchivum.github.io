Yes, I know 77 isn't bad, but if you had a choice for sub 40, or high 70's, I think you'd choose the lower :D. I have the logs that show the increase, and I am not sure why, I contacted AT&amp;T(they suck) and they said they fixed errors in my line >.> whatever, I doubt that works lmao. Imma include the tracert, i think the spike is when it hits an AT&amp;T server though . . . . R.I.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]\r\n(c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation.
