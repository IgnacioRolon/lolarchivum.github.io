After playing a couple games of Nexus blitz, I realized how good the map design, and the game play mechanics (fast gold generation) would be for Hide and Seek, one of League&#039;s most famous user-based made gamemodes. My point of inquiry is to request that nexus Blitz be made available for custom games so that friends can play hide and Seek again. And even if it doesn&#039;t work, at least we&#039;ll have tested the map and discovered if it was a viable candidate to bring back Hide and Seek on. That being said, Some random player can&#039;t make this happen on his own, so I would need support from a lot of other players. If you&#039;re reading this and you&#039;d want to see this happen, generate some noise because Devs need to see enough people wanting something for it to happen. Anyway, thanks for your time","replies":[]}
