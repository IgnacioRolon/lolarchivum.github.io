Whether it be top lane, middle lane, or support. Annie can 100-0 adcs, mid laners, and even supports with 1 combo. If she obtains 40% cdd her ult will have a 48 sec Cd at 16 and it lasts 45 seconds. That means her ult is down for only 3 seconds after casting. Not only that, with Rylais and Liandrys she can provide sustain damage as well as screw over mobility champs. This works even better if it's support annie with Frost Queen. Enemy has YAsuop??? Just ult tibbers, with rylais, and then use active to make Yasuop cir evrtiem","replies":[]}
