I got really excited because I am a Blitzcrank main. Then I left to go to camp for a few days and now that I am home, I see that the shop is closed. Is there any way you can help me out? I was about to spend 5$ to get it when I realized the shop had closed.  \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-25T22:36:29.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your Shop shouldn't go away until June 6th, so it's rather odd that yours isn't showing up anymore. I included a screenshot of where you can find the personal shop again, but if it's still not showing up, take a screenshot of your client and shoot our billing team a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to figure out what's going on and get it fixed up for you there!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/55e8901315cba3751dbee11ddc36f38a.png","replies":[]}]}
