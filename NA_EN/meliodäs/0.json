I just want to ask, why the hell you have to get punished for words in a GAME where you can mute other people. There&#039;s a mute button for reason, so there&#039;s no need to punish people who are toxic. If you want to punish toxic players, delete mute button or don&#039;t punish toxicity(insults etc.) and let mute button be, maybe then someone will finally use it.\n\nPS. If you gonna post something about \"blablabla its ur fault, u deserve it\" you should learn to read, I said i'm fine with, I'm asking why it has to exist. Also if you wanna to trashtalk me, first look at yourself and in how many games you've flamed, I flamed once since 2 years ago and got chat restricted :) ","replies":[{"poster":"o Maui o","date":"2017-04-01T14:25:57.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the time someone has to mute another person in game, it's already gone too far.

Barring hate speech or other major offenses, being consistently reported for mild toxicity is far more likely to get you punished than one bad game out of hundreds.","replies":[{"poster":"Meliodäs","date":"2017-04-02T18:30:40.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I've been chat restricted for one game I've flamed few times.

As I told other guy here, someone flames you? Just mute them, you still can cooperate with pings. You can't? Your own problem. You're saying to me to improve my behavior?

Because I won't care about some random guy trashtalking me in game like all of you do :) Instead of focusing on how people trashtalking you, you should play the game and try to win as you said by yourself.
