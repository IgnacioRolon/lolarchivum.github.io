By an honest discussion, I don&#039;t mean bring in current win rate and LCS pick rate to say he shouldn&#039;t be changed, that&#039;s an issue of meta more than champion design.  If anything, his play rate being the current highest in the game (for jungle, above 2 FOTM champs) should be an accurate indication of the exact opposite.  A 18.92% pick rate for jungle. Using some blatant rounding and fake math as you Lee Sin mains also like to do, ~20% pick rate means that you have a 1/5 probability of seeing a Lee Sin in your game.  But you&#039;re right, He&#039;s doing poorly right now, so people are just playing him that frequently because... right.\n\n**_POINT #1_**- The Blind Human Bullet\nAn argument against the &quot;Lee has no counterplay&quot; statement is &quot;dodge his q&quot;.  If you&#039;ve ever seen a Lee Sin in game, which you have if you&#039;ve played at least 5 games in a row, Lee Sin&#039;s don&#039;t normally use their Q as an initiation tool.  No no.  What they do instead, is walk directly up to you and do one of two things: 1, they wait until they are point blank and hit you with a Q point blank, or if they can&#039;t do that, 2, they ward hop directly on top of you/ behind you and hit you with a Q point blank. Usually there&#039;s a costless ultimate thrown in there somewhere, you know how it goes.\n\nYou may think, &quot;then walk away from him, don&#039;t let him come up to you like that.&quot;  Well see laddie, Lee Sin has a base of 350 Movespeed. Wiith the popularity of Swiftness boots, that gives Lee Sin a minimum movespeed of 415 (410 assuming the swifties nerf goes through).  Assuming you are in mid lane around level 6, and the lane is stuck right in the middle with no shove in either direction, Lee sin can cover, in 2 seconds, 830(MS in units over 2 seconds) + 700 ( max range of W) + 975 ( max range of first part of Q), coming up roughly to a total potential of 2505 units, or in comparison, a level 2 Caitlyn Ultimate. Now I understand, this is an extreme case that requires ridiculously well timed setup to even attempt to match the exact total potential, but the point is he doesn&#039;t need the total potential to accomplish what he needs to do, he needs less than 50% of that to gank an evenly pushed mid lane, and he has it.\n\n**_POINT #2_**- Your Will, My 3000 Damage output\nMath for total damage output in different scenarios (becomes convoluted and hard to follow, all calculations are not taking into account armor/mr)\nDamage Abilities only:\n170 (.9 bonus AD) + 170 (.9 bonus AD) + 8% missing health + 200 (1.0 bonus AD) + 600 (2.0 bonus AD)\n(Assuming AD Reds, AD Quints, Warrior enchant, Black Cleaver and at least level 16 , assuming the 8% is used last)\n170 (117) + 170 (117) + 200 (130) + 600 (260)(294) = 1764 (damage done, otherwise known as missing health) + 141= 1905 Damage on abilities only \n\nAnd that&#039;s without autoing once. Here is the same scenario with the 2 autos woven inbetween (Lvl 16 AD = 107):\n170 (117) + ((107 + 130) x 2) + 170 (117) + ((107 + 130) x 2)+ 200 (130) + ((107 + 130) x 2)+ 600 (260) = 3186 + 255 = 3441 Damage with autos woven.  \n\n**3441** Mixed Damage on 4 ability casts and 6 autos. With only two items that offer damage.  This isn&#039;t even taking into account that he has a decent shield, built in life steal and spell vamp, and a 4 second 60% slow (and I swear if anyone complains that it doesn&#039;t slow Attack speed anymore I swear I&#039;ll find you and shit on your pillow)\n\n**_POINT #3_**-Blindness is no impairment against someone who can&#039;t move and takes more damage for building tank\nIF YOU USE YOUR ULT NOW, YOU WILL DO A 600 DAMAGE NUKE WITH A SCALING OF 200% BONUS AD\nBUT WAIT THERE&#039;S MORE, NOT ONLY IS IT A NUKE, IT&#039;S ALSO A DISPLACEMENT IN THE FORM OF A KNOCKBACK EQUALING 1200 UNITS\nBUT WAIT THERE&#039;S MORE, BEFORE THEY GET KICKED, THEY ACT AS IF THEY WERE ROOTED AND ARE UNABLE TO USE ANY ABILITIES\nBUT WAIT THERE&#039;S MORE, AFTER THEY GET KICKED, THEY ARE STUNNED UPON LANDING\nBUT WAIT THERE&#039;S MORE, YOU GET EXTRA DAMAGE TACKED ON TO THE ULTIMATE IF THE KICKED TARGET HITS ON OF THEIR ALLIES!!!1!\n\nMemes aside, this ability is complete bullshit.  It may be THE single most overloaded ability in the game, even more so than Xin Zhao&#039;s W currently. Even more so than Zed&#039;s ult I would go as far to say (farming those upvotes amirite Zed and Lee Sin mains?). Just for funsies, let&#039;s figure the total amount of damage it could do to a team that&#039;s clumped as 5.\n\nAssumptions: Same items as stated above, target has 2000 bonus health, again no armor is taken into account, this is in a vacuum.\n600 (260) + (600 (260) (420)) x4 = 5980 Total potential damage, on top of a root, a knockback, an aoe knockup, and a stun.  All for the cost of FREE!\nTHAT&#039;S RIGHT FREE! AND IF YOU ORDER NOW I didn&#039;t have a joke here, I just wanted to bring it back up that it&#039;s a smorgasbord of an ability.\n\n**_POINT #4_** Lee Sin, more like &quot;Free Win&quot; (An analysis of the playerbase)\nThis is where I may lose some of you, but it needs to be said in some form.  Lee Sin players are toxic.  Not in the raging-in-all-chat kinda way, not even in the Zed spamming laugh kinda way (seriously though, that HUHUHUHUU with his little arm spasm is tilt poison), but in the kind of way that they promote taking the path of least resistance.\n\n&quot;BUT BOIMANGDINGO, LEE SIN IS REAL HARD TO PLAY SO IT&#039;S OKAY&quot; Alright, skill floor =/= skill ceiling.  When I was just a boy in Season 3, I picked up Lee Sin in hopes of finding a new champion to play.  Upon purchasing him I went into ~~sandbox mode~~ a custom game and messed around with his abilities, and I&#039;ll admit he was next to impossible to learn without looking at guides or watching videos about his abilities.  Once I did learn his combos and how to weave his autos between spells, I believe I spiked to like a 70% winrate over 30ish games (just from memory, could be off by a bit), playing only Lee Sin.  How does this represent the path of least resistance? I was bad with Lee Sin.  Like really bad.  At one point, I tried to set up a macro button to automatically ward hop, and I couldn&#039;t even make that work.  But still, even being a baddie, it didn&#039;t matter because I was playing a champion that has a skill plateau right after the skill floor (meaning once you figure out his abilities, you know how to play him, the only way to improve is to do things faster, thus raising the skill level towards the skill ceiling).\n\nBasically, what I&#039;m saying is that he&#039;s easy once you understand him.  That&#039;s not a problem in the champion however.  It&#039;s a problem in the player base ~~using~~ abusing a champion that&#039;s now easy to them, that has 1250 units/sec movement potential, 3441 damage combo, ridiculously overloaded ult, all the while saying, &quot;I only play him because he&#039;s fun&quot;.  Enough hiding, you play him because you realize he&#039;s broken and you can squeeze wins out of him.\nWant more proof? Check the Win % by games chart being nearly exponential. You may also rebut with other champions have a similar line.  Look at the sample sizes now.  Lee Sin has 39534 games Analyzed This Patch.\n\nTL;DR: Read the whole thing and give me an honest opinion, yes you, Lee Sin Main who looked for the tl;dr. Quit looking for the easy way out :^)\n\n\n**_SOURCES_**\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/LeeSin/Jungle\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/lee-sin-73/details\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/caitlyn-67\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Lee_Sin","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2016-02-18T10:36:14.938+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your logic makes sense entirely, i agree entirely with all points. \"Warrior enchant,cleaver and rest tank?\" Watch as i devastate your team cause my damage is super scaled.

Which means you are saying he needs nerfs. His damage output isn't anything close to what you say. A good Lee will never build {{item:3071}} its a bad item on him. CDR on Lee is a trap that makes you use your energy too fast and the armor pen rarely ever will cap out. You are better off building an extra tank item or different bruiser item on him.\n\nLee does maybe 2k dmg max before resists in a full rotation with the standard build on him. And let's not forget that about 1/4 is magic which he has no way to add penetration to. On top of it all, Lee has to walk into your team or dive head first into his team with his escape and flash in order to do the \"insec\" plays which leaves him wide open to die and if he actually gets to your ADC, they were way out of position.\n\nThe only thing they need to do is revert the buff to Lee that made him 20/10 on energy from his passive and make it back to 15/15.","replies":[{"poster":"Qchan","date":"2016-02-18T17:03:07.605+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Broken doesn't always mean someone needs nerfs, broken means they're either a little too strong or a little too weak, something you can usually fix with minor tweaks.","replies":[{"poster":"Blakers1","date":"2016-02-18T18:12:36.998+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually if you look at the general definition used by the LoL community (the definition you should be using) broken heavily implies a large balance infraction that is usually weighed toward the side of being overpowered. \nDon't care about anyone's opinion either way about Lee, but you are just plain wrong with your definition.","replies":[{"poster":"FiniteParadox22","date":"2016-02-18T19:39:47.317+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've seen a lot it's split between what you claim as essentially Broken~OP and the definition I generally use which is Broken means they are impossible to properly balance without making them too weak or too strong usually due to an overloaded kit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"darkmatchwaldo","date":"2016-02-18T08:36:26.492+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"This may just be my shitty bronze opinion and i recognize that so feel free to tell me i'm wrong and that i'm just not knowlegable on Lee Sin because i only started around like patch 5.11. But i think that as overloaded as his kit is, he's average compared to other Junglers right now. I just don't think he can abuse all the OP jungle items or current meta. I played probably around 75-100 games on him and had a blast doing so last season and with all the meta changes, it just feels like why play {{champion:64}} when you can play:\n\n\nAP{{champion:77}} who once he gets rolling is going to take up so many freaking resources, he'll most likely be able to 1v1 anyone and if you send two he's just gonna run away only to come back seconds later. \n{{champion:60}} who brings arguably better CC for level 3 ganks and crazy burst (i like to think of her as the AP Lee Sin because of her crazy early game). \n{{champion:104}} who will chunk your entire team with one rotation.\nTank {{champion:5}} with {{item:3931}} {{item:3124}} is absolutely stupid. \n{{champion:33}} who is really strong with all the heavy AD comps being played if your team needs a tank.\n {{champion:78}} who can turn a 5v5 over objectives into an easy 2v5 by knocking away 2 people and permaCCing a 3rd. \n{{champion:76}} who can make your junglers life a living hell and has a crazy fast clear time, not to mention how freaking fast she move through the jungle weaving through brushes with {{item:1410}} {{item:3009}} \n\n\nGranted, {{champion:64}} in the right hands is still insanely good. It always will be, he's a low skillfloor/high skill cap champion. I really like that skill plateau thing you said, i hadn't really even thought about it until you pointed it out. My first few games on him were god awful but once i got the hang of it things got so out of hand. I wasn't even using his complex tricks, i just figured out his basic QRQ combos and other similar things and just like that I was carrying games like i never had on any other champion. I just feel like there's so many more problems in the jungle that should be addressed sooner. Mainly how well {{item:3009}} {{item:1410}} and {{item:3931}} {{item:3124}} compliment SO many champions. But he'll never be \"out of meta\" because of how diverse he is, he can fill any role that your team needs. Need a tank? {{champion:64}} got your back, Need someone to take out that pesky {{champion:67}}? {{champion:64}} can take care of that with a quick flank, amazing dragon/baron execution? {{champion:64}} can do that too. I feel that he's a jack of all trades in a meta that's decided by junglers who are really good at ONE thing. \n\nMap pressure?{{champion:77}} \nSnowballing lanes early?{{champion:60}} \nRaw damage?{{champion:104}} \nDuelist? {{champion:5}}\nTank?{{champion:33}} \nTeamfight?{{champion:78}} \nCounterjungle?{{champion:76}} \n\nLee Sin can do all these things but each of these champions does it better, it all just depends on what the teamcomp needs. Lee Sin is so good in SoloQ because most of the time people aren't building actual comps, they're just playing their main. Playing {{champion:64}} lets you first pick your jungler and not have to worry about what your team is going to need. You aren't gonna be screwed if your team doesn't have a tank. You aren't gonna be screwed if you have laners who need early help. You can deal massive damage if your team is lacking it. You can straight up outplay most champions in a 1v1 situation. You can build Tank on top of your {{item:1408}} and your utility is going to off the charts; you can dive into the enemy team, ult their carry, and then tank a crap ton of damage. You're a damn good teamfighter because of that ability to be a tank who will still delete the carry of left unchecked, a properly timed ult WILL win you the fight. You can counterjungle like a freaking fiend because of your ability to outplay people and pull off some super cheeky steals with your Q, then proceed to kill them.\n\nNow that i've been typing this for an hour i'm realizing that it doesn't matter that each champion can do that one thing better because a good Lee Sin is gonna be able to do all of that in one game where they rest of them can ONLY do that one thing. He's gonna be able to use up resources in his powerspike, he's gonna be able to snowball lanes early, he can do that raw team damage if he plays his fights correctly, he can duel like a mofo if he's smart, he can transition into a crazy utility tank, he can teamfight like a boss if his positioning is good, and he can counterjungle with the best of them of course.

Lee Sin players are toxic.  Not in the raging-in-all-chat kinda way, not even in the Zed spamming laugh kinda way (seriously though, that HUHUHUHUU with his little arm spasm is tilt poison), but in the kind of way that they promote taking the path of least resistance.\n> \n> &quot;BUT BOIMANGDINGO, LEE SIN IS REAL HARD TO PLAY SO IT&#039;S OKAY&quot; Alright, skill floor =/= skill ceiling.  When I was just a boy in Season 3, I picked up Lee Sin in hopes of finding a new champion to play.  Upon purchasing him I went into ~~sandbox mode~~ a custom game and messed around with his abilities, and I&#039;ll admit he was next to impossible to learn without looking at guides or watching videos about his abilities.  Once I did learn his combos and how to weave his autos between spells, I believe I spiked to like a 70% winrate over 30ish games (just from memory, could be off by a bit), playing only Lee Sin.  How does this represent the path of least resistance? I was bad with Lee Sin.  Like really bad.  At one point, I tried to set up a macro button to automatically ward hop, and I couldn&#039;t even make that work.  But still, even being a baddie, it didn&#039;t matter because I was playing a champion that has a skill plateau right after the skill floor (meaning once you figure out his abilities, you know how to play him, the only way to improve is to do things faster, thus raising the skill level towards the skill ceiling).\n> \n> Basically, what I&#039;m saying is that he&#039;s easy once you understand him.  That&#039;s not a problem in the champion however.  It&#039;s a problem in the player base ~~using~~ abusing a champion that&#039;s now easy to them, that has 1250 units/sec movement potential, 3441 damage combo, ridiculously overloaded ult, all the while saying, &quot;I only play him because he&#039;s fun&quot;.  Enough hiding, you play him because you realize he&#039;s broken and you can squeeze wins out of him.\n\nThat is not an analysis like you claim, that is an arbitrary example.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=BoyManDog33,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VWsrTrxx,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-18T05:59:04.598+0000)\n>\nEnough hiding, you play him because you realize he&#039;s broken and you can squeeze wins out of him.\n> Want more proof?

Incidentally also the really bad part. \nYour claim: Lee Sin players play him because they \"can squeeze wins out of him.\". \nYour proof: Win % by games played is nearly exponential.\nBut your proof doesn't support your claim.

As you gracefully proved Lee Sin actually gets drastically better the more experience the player has. Too bad that even the most experienced players (125+ wins) manage to win half of their games.
