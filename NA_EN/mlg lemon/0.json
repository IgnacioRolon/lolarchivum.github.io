When playing Ornn in the jungle you&#039;ll be buying cinderhulk which shares a  passive with Sunfire cape. The unique passives from these items don&#039;t stack so there&#039;s no point in buying cape once you have cinderhulk already. This means that Ornn either dosen&#039;t buy a tank item which gives him one of his upgrades or he builds abyssal mask which is annoying seeing as I&#039;d prefer to build a Dead mans plate, stoneplate, warmogs or righteous glory. It&#039;s not the end of the world seeing as abyssal mask isn&#039;t a terrible item on Ornn as he uses quite alot of mana but still it just feels like his options for tank items are incredibly limited by this.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-09-16T21:25:24.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll never know what kind of Korean attempts to build Runic Echoes Ornn & then the world goes ape-shit & starts copycatting it as badly as MF Support & Jungle Ezreal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-09-16T20:51:58.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ornn\n\n> Jungle\n\n\nUh...","replies":[{"poster":"Beas7ie","date":"2017-09-16T21:19:27.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=1Y7htXIM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-16T20:51:58.526+0000)\n>\n> Uh...\n\nIt actually works,  as does Ornn support.","replies":[]}]}]}
