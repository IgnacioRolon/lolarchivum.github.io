I don't have anything installed along side league. i have seen a similar thread but I don't have any programs installed with that name. I don't use anything with League actually so there is nothing to uninstall to fix this problem. \r\n\r\nWindows 7 Ultimate 64 bit fully updated (but this was also a problem when I only had feb. updates)\r\nNvidia GTX 970 fully updated. \r\nIntel Core i5 3570K\r\n8Gb RAM @ 1600Mhz","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T22:04:28.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an issue we've been tracking, and it seems to be happening for a few reasons.  It may be due to a recent windows update, but so far the most common problem has been third party programs that interact with League.  If you have any like play.tv or Overwolf, disable them and try again.  Hopefully, that gets you fixed up and back to crafting!","replies":[]}]}
