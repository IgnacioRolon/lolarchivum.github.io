We&rsquo;ll be implementing a fix on 6.18 (the Worlds patch). Read on for all the details.\n\nYesterday during the NA LCS Semifinals between CLG and TSM, a game had to be remade due to a player seeing a Aurelion Sol&#039;s passive missile in the wrong place.\n\nAurelion Sol&#039;s passive has the longest lasting missiles in League&#039;s history by quite a large margin, and they exposed a set of technical limitations we had never hit before with missiles. Most pertinent: this is the first time a missile is defining its motion around a unit that does not share its visibility. Previous missiles that moved based on another unit, like Ahri&#039;s Fox-Fire, share visibility with their owner - you only see the missile if you see the unit as well.\n\nIn order to cope with this new problem, we put in some handling where the client is sent positional information about Aurelion Sol if one of his missiles is in vision but he himself is not. This allows the missiles to represent their movement without having to fully reveal the champion. However, there is a small time gap between the client gaining visibility of the missile and when it receives this positional information, and that gap is what ultimately led to Sunday&#039;s remake.\n\nA brief timeline, based on [Twitch&#039;s VOD](https://www.twitch.tv/nalcs1/v/84923932):\n - 10:29 game time (43:38 video) - Aurelion Sol&#039;s passive spotted over wall by ward at blue buff\n - 10:31 game time - Aurelion Sol and his passive fully leave TSM&#039;s vision\n - Aurelion Sol remains out of TSM&#039;s vision until:\n - 11:06 game time - Aurelion Sol&#039;s passive spotted in mid lane by Rek&#039;Sai\n\nFor a few frames at game time 11:06, TSM Bjergsen&#039;s client displayed one of Aurelion Sol&#039;s passive missiles at the position it would have been if Aurelion was at his last known position - game time 10:31. It had received the information saying that the missile should be made visible, but had not yet received an update on where the champion was, so it showed the missile relative to his last known position.\n\nThis Aurelion Sol defect has been present since he shipped. We had some code in place to mitigate effects of this nature for him, but they were clearly not enough. In the affected game, the circumstances were such that a player&#039;s decision making was negatively affected, and lead to a remake. We are fixing the issue by preventing the client from showing these missiles in the absence of accurate positional information. This fix will be a part of the 6.18 patch cycle, which is the patch Worlds will be played on.\n\nRegards,\n~Riot Penrif","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-22T21:57:49.441+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is CLS?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Penrif","date":"2016-08-22T21:59:46.026+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Move along, nothing to see here...","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-22T22:04:53.795+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll have you know I am a Support main that sees everything.\n\n{{item:3092}} {{item:2045}} {{item:2043}} {{item:3364}}\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/107e0c957262d3c26cd39fd29c3354e1.png","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-22T22:15:42.587+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"But can you see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?","replies":[{"poster":"TheLazySunbro","date":"2016-08-22T22:20:32.552+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmoa","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fududles","date":"2016-08-22T22:25:37.207+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=999nqkGj,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-08-22T22:04:53.795+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ll have you know I am a Support main that sees everything.\n> \n> {{item:3092}} {{item:2045}} {{item:2043}} {{item:3364}}\n> https://i.gyazo.com/107e0c957262d3c26cd39fd29c3354e1.png\n\nCome on riot make an item with refillable pink ward already","replies":[]},{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2016-08-22T22:14:05.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2016-08-22T22:33:59.746+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this basically the same bug that leaves long trails all over the screen when things like Kindred's Wolf or a champ with DMP exit and enter fog of war?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Penrif","date":"2016-08-22T22:53:56.126+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar kind of thing, probably, but neither of those are missiles.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-22T23:07:56.776+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll take the opportunity to say that:\n\n* also happens with Ekko ghost from his R, in addition to the previously mentioned Wold and DMP\n* it's particularly noticeable, and somewhat disturbing.

You would need to have the other team lose vision of you at an important position, and remain completely out of vision, only to reveal just your passive to that team some point in the future and a missile might show up at the previous position for a couple frames.\n\nIt demonstrates infrequently due to many factors.  One of which is simply that the position and timing of the effect is complicated and doesn't often arise in an organic environment in a way that's noticeable.  There's also a strong timing component to this as well, where the client's framerate and network updates are effectively racing each other.  Initially I had a difficult time replicating the issue on my workstation as I had capped my framerate to 30Hz, which allowed the network sync to usually land in time for the issue to not display.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-08-22T23:05:52.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard (albeit from unconfirmed sources) that it can be reproduced by Aurelion Sol toggling lock/unlock camera while entering fog of war. this is easiest to do in bushes because there is a very clear line.

I realize that new champion sales are a huge part of Riot's profit margin, so that would logically dictate that new champions should be free of all bugs before going live, and champion bugs should not be the butt of a joke during a competitive match, especially a playoff series.\n\nRegardless of how hard a bug is to reproduce, if a bug is known, said bug should be fixed, stabilized and tested before the champion(s) it affects are allowed into competitive.

LCS teams dedicated hours upon hours to picking up {{champion:136}} and building teamcomps around him, yet their time was wasted because you guys let a known bug into the largest stage League of Legends has to offer.\n\nFrom a QA standpoint, this was a MASSIVE failure.  Bugs should be dealt with before champions go live.  There are no excuses.  I realize that new champion sales are a major revenue stream for Riot Games, and this type of issue only serves to highlight the importance of getting a champion as close to bug-free as possible before they hit live.  I realize this isn't always possible, so in cases like {{champion:136}} , he should have not been in the champion pool for LCS until the bug was fixed.  \n\nSimply put, you guys failed.
