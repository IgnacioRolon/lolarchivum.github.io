Most are easily fixed by a simple log in/out of the client, if that doesn't, then it's usually something wrong with the settings for your network config. \n\nSometimes it's a flush of the DNS, or a release/renew, it could be wireless signal loss or a router failing to assign between multiple computers on the same network, which may require a restart of the modem or router...\n\nRunning as admin can be a solution if your computer wasn't set up to let all programs run through whatever firewalls you have, AVG or McAfee, sometimes Windows Defender is running and the player has no idea about it. \n\nIt's not super simple with that error to know exactly where the problem lies, because of the many different things that can interfere as champion selection ends and you are loading into Summoner's Rift. \n\ntl;dr\n\nMost players never see that error message unless something is wrong with the localized connection near their computer. A simple restart of the client can fix it, but if not, they may want to dig into their network setup to see if there's something iffy there.","replies":[{"poster":"Mast3rMahan","date":"2015-04-27T01:57:21.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Restarting your computer is often the easiest fix.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-04-26T20:00:13.938+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been a 100% fix for me:\n\n1.

Maybe the client crashed.  Maybe your ISP throttled your network traffic.  Maybe you deliberately disabled your wireless connection so it couldn't connect.  All the servers know is that the client was sending messages and now it is not.  Similarly, the client doesn't know why it can't talk to the server.\n\nAlso, in cases where the client knows it crashed (by keeping crash logs for example) it still can't be trusted to report those errors to the server.  One of the first rules of computer security is \"never trust the client.\"  Maybe the client crashed, or maybe a determined hacker reverse-engineered the log format, hit End Process, and inserted fake log entries for an error that never occurred.  If an adversary has physical access to the hardware your software is running on (for example, LoL hackers running the game on their own computer), there isn't really much you can do to stop them from monkeying with it.  Trusting the client to report errors introduces trivial Loss Prevention hacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-04-26T11:12:06.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried this?\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/peVhMJAo-the-wrenchmens-toolbox-common-solutions-to-your-problems-technical-issues\n\nIf following that doesn't work, send in a H&S ticket.
