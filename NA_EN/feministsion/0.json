The shroud is just an overloaded ability that has 000000 counter play. \n\n1 She can use it offensively (even under enemy tower now)\n2 She can use it defensively enemy jumps on her and she uses it to hide and prevent taking damage while being able to deal damage.\n3 she can use it to wait for her team 8 seconds is a long time to give her team to come and help its quite awful.\n4 if you are by youself and she is low you have the choice to stay in it or just walk away which is dumb because that is 0 counterplay. \n5 it restores ENERGY NOW. WTF what ability in the game restores? Old Soraka, but other than that. \n\nlook the point is someone who is skilled with this champ is going to be unbelievably annoying with this overloaded ability. I knew this was a huge problem when I was killed by akali while under my tower and she had like 50 health (we were level 3) she shrouded and walked out. \n\nWhy is the one ability that makes her SO frustrating to play against still there. I mean Fizz E is annoying as well but he cant consistently go in and out of it for 8 seconds losing targetability. \n\nInstead of removing this ability they made it even more powerful. If anything change he Q to cost way less energy and have her shroud COST A huge amount of her energy. That fact that is restores energy for free is completely mind boggling. like who thought that was a good idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2018-08-06T10:43:09.462+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"As a mechanic, I (begrudgingly) admit it is balanced, however the with the current uptime it has offers no meaningful counterplay. The CD starts after the BASE duration of the shroud, and she gets to extend it by 3 seconds. That thing has a cd of 11 seconds which is further reduced by her own CDR meaning you're only looking at a window of 6-7 seconds before its up again if she keeps refreshing it. \n\nIt is by far the most overloaded skill in her skillset, the duration extend should just be scrapped altogether, or the cd increased. It really sucks that you force her to blow it, and you can't really engage because by the time you do it's up again (while she heals up with her Q in lane).

My first game I got carried and the second one I somehow scaled,  I guess. To be fair though, I was playing her AD bruiser.\nBut to this point I cannot remember loosing a game against Akali or when, she had as much impact as I did in my 4/10 game.\nWith the limited range on her Q and the E having a low range and not going through minions her fighting ability in lane is really nothing ot be desired.\n\nI guess once she is 6 with gunblade she can make plays but gunblade has always being the biggest powerspike in the game with it high burst active and sustain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HankFrank123","date":"2018-08-06T21:23:58.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali is fine right now, she needs a good defensive kit to be throwing herself into 5 people for damage. \nThink like Akali would think in her W...\nShe’s probably going to be near you if you are lower HP, or near tower if you are higher HP. \nJust fling skillshots where you think she is, and remember: You don’t ever have to fight her if she uses W.
