Team Fnatic's shotcalling is making the difference this year.\r\n\r\nMaking Yellowstar's shotcall execute cleanly is the awesomely accurate Febivan who plays Mid for Fnatic and has a ridiculous KDA of 29 and has not died in the first three games of the LCS EU.  Febivan has made enormous plays on Xenthar and his Ultimate finishing snipes have been awesome LCS big plays all the way through.\r\n\r\nI definitely think Fnatic is the team to beat in the LCS EU right now and is maybe one of the top five teams in the world and my early favorite to make it to the World Championship.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot jayway","date":"2015-01-30T02:16:43.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been watching both LCS' and a few games of LCK/LPL.\n\nIn EU, SK looks really scary since they have all the tools from last year, but arguably upgraded at ADC/Mid. Really looking forward to El Clasico.\n\nWe shouldn't hastily put them so high, there is still a lot of LoL to play. But Yellowstar has 100% upped his game. It feels like he hasn't missed a step since Rekkles left the team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmashKingDex","date":"2015-01-30T12:27:01.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"was there a new champ released??\n\nI wanna play it\n\"Xenthar\"\n\n#NOTEVENCLOSEderpderp{{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-01-30T12:38:24.091+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xenthar the son of Xenalth\nPraised be his name","replies":[{"poster":"Lstrike","date":"2015-02-01T15:57:12.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of his name","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-01-30T13:34:00.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"EU is trash\n\nCLG, TSM, C9, TL, WF, TiP > FnC, SK, EL, UL","replies":[{"poster":"SmashKingDex","date":"2015-01-30T13:39:47.988+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rhlax,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=Q4J5jXHA,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-01-30T13:34:00.762+0000)\n>\n> EU is trash\n> \n> CLG, TSM, C9, TL, WF, TiP > FnC, SK, EL, UL\n\n{{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-01-30T13:48:25.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey now, have this {{summoner:1}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-01-31T01:15:35.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People need to stop doing this stupid \"EU>NA or NA>EU\", they are pretty equal in strength as a region and both get shit on by chinese and korean teams.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-01-31T04:28:04.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little trash talk is fun as long as you don't take it too seriously. \n\nAt the end of the day, who cares who wins?
