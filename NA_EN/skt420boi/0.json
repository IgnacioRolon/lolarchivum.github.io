When I picked Yas my favorite champ , The client responded with this message or something similar \"We Had Trouble Picking Your Character\" and froze. I received a 5-6 min penalty then like 2 minutes later you shut the client publicly off","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T17:49:56.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear that the client froze during champion select, and resulted in that dodge.  :/  It sounds like you might have an unstable connection, which ended up cutting you off from champ select and leaving you behind.  Even if it's not intentional, the [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) system will treat dodges equally.  \n\nYour best bet would be to troubleshoot whatever caused the error so the penalty timer doesn't escalate.  For your specific issue, I suggest going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix that up.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
