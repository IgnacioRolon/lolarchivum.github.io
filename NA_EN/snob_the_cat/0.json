I know the leaving might sometimes be beyond your control, but it doesn't apply onto an account unless it's more than one leave.  These leaves are also treated equally because they cause others a negative experience.  Best thing you can do is stay safe, then play when you know there won't be any interruptions.

If you reached a low priority queue, it means you missed several games before that tornado warning.
