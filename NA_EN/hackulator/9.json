The last couple times I had interviewed him he&#039;s been a little more bright, but today he was a mess again and last night he tried to choke himself  to death with a drawstring he pulled out of a pair of shorts he had. I&#039;m not sure if it was just something that happened, if it was a reaction to new medication, or if it was because his mother told him she was going to visit him and then never showed up. Either way it&#039;s depressing. Inpatient child psychiatry is pretty brutal.\r\n\r\nFeels bad man.","replies":[]}
