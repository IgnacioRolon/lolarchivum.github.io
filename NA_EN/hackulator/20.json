However, I just finished my medical licensing exam and I now have about two months of free time til I start working in a hospital, so I'm going to take the plunge. I have no illusions about being good at this game, so there's a good chance I'm going to be stuck in bronze. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm REALLY interested to see however is whether I start getting reported a lot. I've never even been warned, but since I've been in unranked I know people freak out and report less, or at least that is what people claim. So I'm going to go into ranked and NEVER be rude to people and see if I start getting reported. This will give me a better idea if there's any reality to the complaints people make.","replies":[]}
