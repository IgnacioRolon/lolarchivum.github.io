Specifically with champion match-ups/counterpicking. I have mainly been playing Garen (I main top) in ranked, however there are various champions (including many I have not encountered so am unaware of) that Garen has trouble with. Obviously I'm very strong early and win lane against a lot of champions, but some are really rough, especially people who can outsustain me or poke me well.\n\nI was wondering if people could give me some advice on champions I should NOT pick Garen into, and some options as good alternates against those champions.\n\nOther champs I play: {{champion:75}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:36}}{{champion:62}} ","replies":[]}
