One: while my summoner name has updated in the top-right corner of the screen, and my summoner icon has been correct up there for several months now, trying to get to my boards profile leads me to a \"page not found\" and I have to go to the 4maskwolf boards profile to find my posts.  Two (and not directly related to the name change): I changed my summoner icon to the alpha client tester icon pretty much as soon as I got it, but my boards profile never seems to have registered my summoner icon change except in that top right corner.  On the place where I can find all my posts, I'm still listed as having my old rose icon.  Three: All of my posts, including ones made since the name change, are still posted under \"4maskwolf\" rather than my new name.\r\n\r\nI have logged in and out of the legacy client, the beta client, and the boards since my name change, and none of them seem to have done anything to fix the issue.  To my understanding, summoner name changes are supposed to register on the boards, so the seeming stasis of my boards profile is somewhat baffling.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T22:24:15.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may take a bit for your forum profile to sync up with your account, so you may not see an automatic change.
