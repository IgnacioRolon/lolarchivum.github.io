Really who&#039;s going to report 3 players on your team doing this? the enemy team doesn&#039;t care because it&#039;s a free win for them 9/10 they just leave lobby without making any reports.  Now I hear pro players on stream saying quote &quot;should we open?&quot; I don&#039;t support the &quot;open mid&quot; method it&#039;s toxic for the entire game, players having issues understanding that Riot shorten game times down by 15m... back in season 2 we&#039;d get games that last 35m+ now players think they have enough knowledge to know when a game is &quot;open mid at 8m&quot; I can take the toxic community, honestly over the years I learned how to deal with players typing garbage in /all chat, I just ignore my team before the game starts and use pings, sadly with the open mid method i&#039;m held hostage until the enemy team wins the game playing 1v5 or how many go along with the open mid method......\r\n\r\nComing from a season 2 veteran player Riot please step-up your game for combating this issue, and for pro&#039;s to say &quot;should we open?&quot; it makes me disgusted.  In LCS when the enemy team has a huge lead I don&#039;t see early surrenders coming threw because Riot prevents teams from doing it, imagine how toxic it would look on the big screen every pro game they are behind and it was a for sure loss they just open mid......\r\n\r\n\r\nAll I can do at the moment is move on from each game this happens, is there a post of Riots plans for dealing with this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-16T05:51:35.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Really who's going to report 3 players on your team doing this? the enemy team doesn't care because it's a free win for them 9/10 they just leave lobby without making any reports.\n\nIf they actually stop trying when it's not an unanimous decision, you can report them. You don't need the enemy team to report along at all. 1 report is as good as 9, so yours alone will do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2017-02-16T01:30:27.353+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"People want to just open mid and move to a new game because Riot has made it more difficult to come back in a losing game.  I'm one of them. I don't feel like wasting an additional 15 minutes fighting to keep two inhibitors alive while my adc fights super minions in the third lane 16 minutes in.  Meanwhile the enemy has full control over our jungle, dragon and baron.  Yes, I know; \"the enemy isn't very good so you can always come back.\"  It's just not worth an additional length of a game to me.\n\nWhat's the point?  Just move to a new game and try again.  There's no shame in cutting your losses.\n\nSorry I couldn't be one to agree with you. I'm sure the downvotes will rain on me all night long. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-02-16T17:00:36.984+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll report anyone who says open mid.

Theres really no coming back, but open mid or not, that game will just last like .. 5 more minutes anyways. \n\nIf it is just 1 person that is fed, and the rest of our team is ahead or even, then there is no reason to give up. People in my ELO (bronze / silver) don't know how to push an advantage and normally throw during mid game. Those that say \"gg, open mid, fizz with 4 kills\" are just so short sighted that they can't see the bigger picture of how their lanes are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"F O R F I T Z","date":"2017-02-16T03:26:59.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"for sure, i've started seeing it near plat v i'm sure every tier is somewhat alike.  That's why I play to my fullest its solo queue anything can happen, believe me I'm sure we've all experienced the enemy team throwing.  I have actually come back with 3 inhibs down ace the enemy team pushed mid and won funny thing was it happen to me the next game, never learn from certain mistakes >.<\n\nanyways hopefully player behaviour team comes up with solutions, I'd like to see a better debuff for staying at base well just moving cursor around pretending \"not to be afk\"","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-02-16T10:57:55.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh those afkers get detected.\n\nClaiming open mid is also negative attitude and can yield to punishments.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-02-17T05:26:41.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Join them. If it was close then report them but if they are just gonna afk a ruined game then they've removed any hope of a comeback. If you were so behind 5v5 that they quit you're going to lose for sure 4v5. The real problem is with all the increased snowballing the lockout on ff till 20 is an outdated concept. Really should be 10 minutes these days if they aren't going to fix their pacing problems. 5 min ff for an afk for any reason, and 3 for the remake.","replies":[{"poster":"F O R F I T Z","date":"2017-02-18T18:00:01.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with you, season 2 veteran the old voting system is outdated it was designed for 35+ min games when Riot reduced game times down by 15 min it started this open mid method in korean slowly moving towards eu/na, Gbay99 made a video talking about how Riot wants to decrease surrender vote times by 5 min however Riot said it would require that 5 players agree.\n\nI strongly believe in come backs, it happens at least 1/5 games I play, but its like you said if they are going to ruin a game its completely out of my control and I will just report them after game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-02-17T05:11:56.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I don't get the open mid.

Last season tons of players would joke about it but I have never seen anyone act upon it cause of fear of getting banned, it's actually starting to become a thing.  Like I said i hear pro players talking on stream when they should \"open mid\" because of being stomped early.  Mind you I have never seen any pro player do it, however  when you have a huge group following them it might be in the games best interest if they hadn't talked about it at all by promoting open mid it opens up this game to a whole new toxicity...\n\nthat is why we currently have a vote system for surrendering, because 3 players shouldn't be able to determine if a game is a loss by 8m.\n\nI think Gbay99 recently did a video the other day talking about when you should surrender, I wish he would have discussed how players created the \"open mid\" method to avoid surrender vote times.","replies":[]}]}]}
