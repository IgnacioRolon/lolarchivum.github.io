If you decide to go AD, it means you will have to use your auto attacks, as the two AD ratios are not more powerful than the other four AP ratios. Normally this doesn't cause a problem until you look at Death Lotus. This ability is antithetical to autoattack based champions, only because you cannot autoattack while using a channeled ability. The only reason why Wukong is able to get away with this is because his ultimate is a quasi-channel, AND has its own cc. You still are able to use it even after being cc'd as well. \n\nNow, if we look at an AD Katarina's kit, it can be considered a mediocre pre-rework Fiora. Both need to stick to their targets to deal damage, and both had a lot of aoe potential. The problem with AD Katarina is:\n\nAD Katarina does not have an ultimate that applies on-hit effects, nor does she have an attack speed or movement speed steroid (no, the movement speed on W isn't nearly enough). AD Katarina's ultimate doesn't give her quasi-untargetability either, nor does it make her everywhere in the enemy team at once. Her basic abilities can do that ONLY if she get's a reset. \n\nMoving onto that, ALL of Katarina's basic abilities do magic damage. There are no dual penetration items, so building straight up AD without any magic penetration is considered suicide. Sure, you can get Sorc. Shoes, but it doesn't help her basic ability's horrid damage. \n\nLastly, she loses lots of up front damage because her Q and E don't scale with AD! She's also an assassin. If she loses any burst by putting her damage into AAs, then people will just escape.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2016-08-21T10:11:07.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol. First of all Wukong and Katarina are 2 entirely different champions. You cannot compare them, AT ALL.\n\nSecondly, dealing both physical and magic damage is not bad at all. Let's say you get fed as AD Kat? How is the enemy teams supposed to itemize against you now since you deal both types of damage? There is a reason champs like Corki and Kog'maw used to be/are strong, there is not much you can do when they get ahead.\n\nAlso how would her ultimate (or any ability for that matter) applying on hit effects help AD Kat? Barely any AD item in the game actually gives on hit effects, and those that do give AS and you won't be getting these anyway.\n\n>AD Katarina's ultimate doesn't give her quasi-untargetability either, nor does it make her everywhere in the enemy team at once. Her basic abilities can do that ONLY if she get's a reset.\n\nMaybe go in at the right moment, just like you are supposed to as Kat even while playing AP?","replies":[{"poster":"Infinite Saught","date":"2016-08-22T02:53:49.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the contrary. I just did with their ultimates. They're similar in the fact that they both spin, have AD scalings, and deal damage over time.\n\n\nI don't think you understand how inconsistent the mixed damage is. For one, her mixed damage is initially weak due to the fact of shitty scaling abilities, so you're just really reliant on autoattacks for damage here. Secondly, there's no synergy between auto attacks and her abilities except maybe Sinister Steel (this doesn't have a cast time, so you can AA and W at the same time). Thirdly, autoattacks are SLOW compared to .25 second basic ability combo that's likely to burst a squishy into a damage nuke we call her ultimate when building AP. AD simply does not have that.  Lastly, when I said something about AD Katarina's ultimate, you don't have to take it in the context of regular Katarina **when I'm comparing it to pre-rework Fiora**. I say that **explicitly**.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SmileInABox","date":"2016-08-21T22:51:10.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full AP malphite is fun as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Small Tiddies","date":"2016-08-22T00:29:11.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD used to be a thing before they changed his W.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2016-08-20T04:35:29.816+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'd rather have a champion balanced around 1 stat than a shitshow champion that is OP in certain forms leaving it's other forms completely unviable and giving the balance team a headache to choose a direction","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2016-08-19T22:01:42.227+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"ap {{champion:18}}","replies":[{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2016-08-19T22:38:11.904+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dynikus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=O31Voc4A,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-08-19T22:01:42.227+0000)\n>\n> ap {{champion:18}}\n\nI did play AP Tristana, and it was amazing.
