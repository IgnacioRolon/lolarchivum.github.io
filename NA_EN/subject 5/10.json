ROA offers mana sustain in exchange for taking damage, while burning off mana gives a small bit of HP. Tear reduces the amount of mana spent and can be upgraded from 15% to 25%.\r\n\r\nAD: {{item:3508}} Every single crit that you do, refunds 3% of your maximum mana. Thus- each and every minion wave can give about half of your mana bar back with less than half of an ADC build. As far as replenishing your resources go, the ADC champion pool have the edge of mana sustain with Essence Reaver. (Most of the time you will always be full on mana with this item. It gives crit + 30% CDR + High damage.)\r\n\r\nRound 2: CDR\r\n\r\nAP: {{item:3165}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3157}} One of these items are universal, which can be a flexible pick for most AP champions: {{item:3165}} however Ardent is built by supports and so is gauged for specifically that role with VERY specific champions. The golden sword is another niche item that offers CDR- in other words- you don't build it unless you're Kayle. New Banshee- it is a defensive item that is again- incredibly niche pick. You pick up the item if the enemy team has a Lux, Morgana, Blitz, Thresh, etc. Bane, another niche item. Pick it up if you're Fizz or TF. Zhonya- another niche item. Pick it up if you're up against Syndra, Zed or you're playing a champion like Rumble or Swain. If you combined these items, you have an opportunity for 80% CDR. Notice how the AP junglers don't even get CDR with {{item:1410}} {{item:1402}} {{item:1414}} I guess AD's need CDR more. Than Mages. Do.\r\n\r\nAD: {{item:3508}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3156}} {{item:1412}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3071}} Right out the bat, AD have more items. A few are niche- but then again, that doesn't really matter when you're critting for 800 damage at the end of the game or 400 damage in the mid game. If you combined these items- you can have up to 130% CDR (obviously you can only have up to 45% but this is an opportunity to go more routes than your standard route.) Essence Reaver gives you so much mana, CDR and damage along with the CDR. Youmuus gives you Lethality- a huge damage spike along with a movement spent to either run away or stick to enemies. (Which has been nerfed countless times on supports, but AD is different hah-HAH.) Maw gives you an AP shield, CDR, Lifesteal, 20 AD, and even Spellvamp. Seriously, this item is pretty much a big fuck you to any Mid that blew their load on an AD only to watch it regenerate after a full Lucian Combo. AD jungle item has CDR on it, surprise mother fucker- Graves needs to waveclear faster than your Elise. Trinity Force, basically a bundle of stats that you buy at Target with a 200% AD steroid. Movement speed, extra damage, attack speed, AD, you name it. Iceborn. Let's be honest- this is Ezreals item. DD: \"It would be cool if we made the only counter play to an ADC even harder to achieve if we gave the ADC an even bigger window to just lifesteal back up to HP after a full combo. Yes, we should do this right after the assassin update that makes assassins cosplay as a local serial killer- walking up to folk and giving them a handshake before killing them. Because they can't kill them right off the bat, that would be too quick.) Cleaver, damage - HP - Armor reduction and movement speed. That's basically what you need to know. Overall, the AD diversity has SO much more to offer.\r\n\r\nRound 3: Coming When I'm Bored Again","replies":[{"poster":"forist","date":"2017-06-09T04:28:44.780+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is {{item:3025}}  listed as an ad item?

They're super specific to their class. Similarly, AP has to support mages and enchanters. In actuality, AD does not have more diversity in CDR items because each class is very hard bound to it's items, kinda like mages, except they have more options for mage items and same with supports.\n\nAlso, what's the purpose of this posts? You say items and what they do, but that's it. Where's tying it together?

Riot actually intends for proper mages - laughably - to have 20% CDR and get the rest from runes and blue buff. Their itemization is that poor compared to marksman, AD casters, and bruisers who get their 40% CDR pretty much for free because they sacrifice nothing but gold for it.\n\nAlso... \n{{item:3157}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3102}} {{item:2301}} {{item:3092}} {{item:3100}} are the 10% CDR AP items. \nA \"standard\" build for an AP fighter like ekko or diana would be; {{item:3157}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3020}}. The ONLY reason this build comes up above 400AP is because of rabadans. If rabadans were removed the build would not be possible. It just lacks to much AP compared to the standard mage build.\n\nMages have to actually sacrifice for their cooldown reduction right now, where other classes get it for free. And the only reason it hasnt be addressed is simply due to rabadons deathcap. \nFurther, did you know that the amount of actual AD an AD champion can get far eclipses that of an AP champion? Rengar, with only 25% bonus AD, can get _over 500 AD without trying_ and 40% CDR to boot. 500 is about what you expect from a mage at this point, and mages dont even have higher scalings and bases than AD champions. Just bad itemization for non-assassins and non-machine gun mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Geshultz","date":"2017-06-09T03:29:37.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Expect any item that has cooldown reduction is a cooldown reduction item.
