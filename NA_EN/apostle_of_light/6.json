Even IF you manage to beat him/ go even with him in lane, he will just out run you towards mid or bot and kill mid/jungler. He just feels annoying to play against cause even IF you win, you still lose. The only time I have seen Sett lose is when the game is just a stomp, so he doesnt have a chance to really do anything. If the game is even tho, and he isnt on your team, you most likely lose with how imbalanced he is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2020-01-31T03:28:52.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Public opinion is always reactionary.\n\nWhy I think people were gushing over Sett was because he doesn't feel awful to play against initially. His kit isn't completely unfair like all of the 2019 releases. Sylas, Yuumi, Qiyana, Senna, and Aphelios all have kits that remove their class weakness entirely or they're over compensated in other areas that their weakness doesn't even matter anymore. The problem with Sett seems to be more of a numbers issue rather than a design flaw.\n\nAnother reason he was so popular at the start was because it must have felt good to wipe the floor with Mordekaiser and Darius. For better or worse, he does break the meta top lane.","replies":[]}]}
