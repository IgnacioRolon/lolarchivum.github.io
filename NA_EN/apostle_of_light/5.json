If a matchmaking system is developed that states your team (a group of solos) playing against an enemy team (a 5 man group) has a 50% chance to win, is that a fair game? Considering that the matchmaking algorithms have been highly tested and developed with data inclusions such as an offset for premade size, amount of times that group has played together, as well as MMR and other factors. \n\nI think that system is fair. I believe the issue so many people on reddit and the boards has is a fundamental issue that a solo rating can be derived from a non-solo queue. I wonder why though as the way I see it, if league of legends is a team game, then a team queue should be implemented, and while the rating you get from it is no longer a truly solo rating, the rating is a better reflection of your true skill at league as it represents your skill playing as a team. That part is my opinion so it shows my support of a dynamic queue system.\n\nPutting that aside however, I believe that if Riot further develops their matchmaker so that the system is correct in all instances and puts you between a 53% and 47% chance at winning with the inclusion of the factors above, dynamic queue would seem a lot more fair in the eyes of the solo queue supporters.

If a matchmaking system is developed that states your team (a group of solos) playing against an enemy team (a 5 man group) has a 50% chance to win, is that a fair game?\n\nNo.\n\nhaving the numbers even out to 50% winrate means that you're going to have to do some incredible elo trickery. In other words the enemy team of solos facing against the 5 man group would have to be at least 1 whole tier above the teamed up characters. Keep in mind, the people on the team can have at least 5 divisions between then,\nex:\nA team of Silver 5 to 1 players in a 5 man group would have to face off against a team of Gold 5 - Gold 1 players.... The thing is, Gold 5's skill cap is significantly different from Gold 1's  since they aren't communicating it could cause toxicity issues... also Just because somebody is soloing in gold, doesnt mean they are gold skill, thanks to dynamic boost people can get boosted into gold, without actually belonging there.\n\nand thatere lies the issue, even then, the numbers could never be 50/50.\n\n> I wonder why though as the way I see it, if league of legends is a team game, then a team queue should be implemented,\n\nWe had that, it was called ranked 5's and it worked very well. Golds could play ranked with their bronze friends without the need for a smurf. and here's the thing it was there if you WANTED TO CHOSE TO PLAY with a team... there is that keyword, \"choose\"\n\nAlso here's the kicker EVERY SPORT EVER works the way LoL used to work.\n\nBasketball is a team game\n- you still had the option to play 1 v 1\n- 5 strangers vs 5 strangers\n- or get on a team and practice together\n\n- nowhere in ranked basketball play is a random dude from off the street allowed to fill in for a team with missing members, it's an immediate handicap for both parties.\n\nThat's the problem. Solo ranked is infinitely better\n\n> and while the rating you get from it is no longer a truly solo rating, the rating is a better reflection of your true skill at league as it represents your skill playing as a team. \n\n**FALSE**\nWhat if that same person who played premades to get to gold suddenly played alone for whatever reason? youy're still saying \"he's really gold?\" no he's not really gold, he's a silver player with competent friends and a voice chat advantage\n\nSkill isnt just some 1 dimensional thing. When you play with a team of people you **know**, you're less likely to try new things. What about the ability to adapt to playing with other randoms? Your ability to learn when to carry, and when act more as a support or utility. Leaning how to think quickly and for yourself? Not have somebody in a call tell you where to go to optimize their play, but rather YOU know where to be to optimize their play (or somebody more deserving).\n\nPlaying Solo reflects your ability to play with a team, filled with people you dont know all facing the same circumstance with the same objective. **But you're still playing as a team\n** Playing with 5's is just you playing with people you know.\n\nDont falsely equate \"playing premade\" to \"playing as a team\" That right off the bat is a bad argument to make. Regardless of how you play, you're playing as a team. one queue just requires a LOT more adaptation to your surroundings - which i would argue is inherently a better way to see how skilled somebody is.\n\n\n> Putting that aside however, I believe that if Riot further develops their matchmaker so that the system is correct in all instances and \nputs you between a 53% and 47% chance at winning with the inclusion of the factors above, dynamic queue would seem a lot more fair in the eyes of the solo queue supporters. Im wondering if I'm slightly correct in your eyes on that.\n\nIve said it bvefore, the system is INHERENTLY BROKEN. you will never fix those issues without creating an infuriating game to play in.... at that point you would have to do some massive MMR trickery, and bullshit in a system that also encourages smurfing and boosting. And that's just to \"balance\" the numbers. But here's the thing - this isnt about numbers. \n\nPeople dont want to play with or against large premades. it's not fun. it's inherently more toxic since the solo players get left out. And even still you dont understand.... Getting ganked by a coordinated 5 man, using a communication method NOT NATIVE to the game **IS BROKEN**  it's not a matter of skill at that point, and what;s the solo player to do? type to his team who may all have different agendas? No matter what you do in that situation you will more than likely die, and it doesnt have anything to do with skill, at that point it boils down to which team has more communication. \n\nDynamic queue can never be fair. if you balance the queue to give ceertain players at certain MMRs all it would do is \n1: drastically increase queue times \n2: It wouldnt fix the issue that people playing alone dont want to face a fucking premade\n3: still wouldnt address the massive communication disadvantage\n4: would force those communicating to play against people way higher than their skill thereby NULLIFYING THEIR RANKING.\n\nWhy should ranks even exist if this is the case?\n\nThis is the problem. before you had a solo ranking and a team ranking, now you have a solo ranking that shows off how far you got ass a team. the two should never interact. they're too different with an entirely different set of skills required for each.\n\nat no point in any of this are you even remotely correct.\nBut i do ask you\n\nwhy are you so onboard with riot removing options from the game, and blatantly lying about it to the consumer's face?","replies":[{"poster":"DeathTheHorseman","date":"2016-06-07T15:14:18.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read your entire comment and it boils down to this:\n\n1. Ranked is not your individual skill anymore\n\n2. Premades are toxic to the solo player\n\n3. Voice chat is an unfair advantage.\n\n_**\n\n1. => League of Legends is a team game. There is no INDIVIDUAL in a true team. Meaning your point is invalid. All 5 members need to do their duty to climb the elo. True someone who plays exceptionally well can give them an edge to climb higher but ultimately he won't carry you all the way to his elo. Lets say a diamond is playing with 4 friends who are bronze. He can carry them to silver and maybe even gold but not beyound that unless the 4 bronze tiers improve. They will not always play together and the bronzes will fall  and eventually end up where he is meant to be with a stable MMR.\n\n2. Premades can be toxic to the solo. Especially if he is having a bad game, however this changes nothing from solo que. 1-1-1-1 were as likely to all blame you for losing if you were doing bad as a 4  is. The only difference is that the 4 will probably be a lot less toxic to each other meaning that there will be no arguments in your team even if someone screws up, unless you want to start them.\n\n3. Riot should make voice chat part of the client. This is hands down the issue at the moment. Coordination and co-operation of premades is a lot better because of voice coms and this is where the frustration comes from. \n\n\nSolution: Add voice coms to the client.","replies":[{"poster":"blacknerdtaku","date":"2016-06-09T03:13:01.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1:\"there is in fact an individual in a true team game.\"\nFALSE\n\nRegardless of it being a team game if the individual is incompetent you're going to have a bad time. Solo  queue struck a balance between the individual, and the team. the better you got at communicating and handling toxic situations the higher you climbed.\n\n\n LoL is a team game, cool but there is still and individualist aspect of every team game. Being able to play on a team of premades you trust results in you having less to compensate for. A premade in a chat can just say \"MIA\" or \"watch out dude headed top\" and now you're looking at the map to see where the oncoming gank is from. Had you not been in that premade that couple of seconds of neglegence would have resulted in death. And i still ask what was wrong with ranked 5vs? You had the option to chose between solo, or with a team. There are so many games that can be played solo or with a team. Also what if i dont have close friends that play LoL? then what? \n\nWhy remove features? Your rank means nothing to a ladder that accepts premade 5s as well as solo.\n\nIf you dont believe me look at ANY huge game with a meta. \nYugioh: you have teams and solo play\nMTG: Teams and solo play\nD&D: teams or solo play\nany MMORPG: Teams, Guilds, or lone gun play\nFPS games Teams or solo\nSmash Forumula: Solo, 1v1, random teams, premade teams, pro play\nDOTA2: Solo and Dynamic queue\nIRL sports: Solo practice, 1 v 1, random people teaming up, semi pro, school/work teams, professional.\n\nDont feed me BS about these games having no aspect of the individual. You think any major sports player played every one of his games with teams and didnt have to work on his INDIVIDUAL SKILL to be worth a damn?\n\nif a true team game \"doesnt have individualistc features\" then why do all these other games solo or team OFFER UP OTHER FEATURES? Here's why. because the player can CHOSE how he wants to play.\n\n2: The difference is simple, actually. Usually the team woul harp on whoever is doing the worst, but that's not the problem. Immediate advantage, through an extra party sofware, and a buddy-system. Before, solo those 1 1 1 1 1 players were all under the EXACT SAME CIRCUMSTANCES. Now they're not. Why should a 4 man premade give a fuck about that one random? And again I ask, why remove the feature of ranked 5vs?\n\nSecondly if you think toxicity is just \"arguments\" you're not very bright. As said previously, promenades are usually buddy-buddy. Their LACK OF COMMUNICATION with the solo player is just as bad as chat greifing. and can have the same results. If they [the solo] engage on something the team could have won, you say \"no i dont trust this guy, let me follow my friend Joe\" He gets killed even though it was a great engage. the enemy team gets ahead, he gets behind, and the team is left saying \"man this solo sucks\" not to his face, but it's still there. \n\nHe picked up on an opportunity, he didn't have time to type it out so he had to go on faith that the premades would follow, and got killed as a result. That mutual barrier between players is a BIG problem for a ranking system.\n\n3: Agreed I have posts on it for this season and Last but they dont want to add voice chat. for whatever reason. Riot has proven how shitty they are as a company, the very fact that you cant set the settings of a bot game when every other MOBA lets you is already  huge problem. But again that still has not solved the barrier of trust between players.\n\nNo matter how you shake it, one of the biggest problems with LoL s a game is a lack of trust between players. Dynamic queue, ironically widens the Gap, and kills off ranked integrity in the process. Even a voice chat wont fix that issue. Anybody with a functional brain cell should know that matching alone with other solo players, is NOT the same as matching with teamed up players, so why are they on the same ladder?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InsanitysTheName","date":"2016-06-07T14:46:15.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you bring up a lot of valid points.

Why? because flaming loses games that in a ranked system is an IMMEDIATE set back. All it takes is for one guy on your team to say the wrong thing and KABOOM your team collapses because they're too busy arguing (or damage controlling) inevitably missing plays, and costing the game - which in turn tilts the player. Same story with feeders.
