The art my colleagues worked on was also a huge influence on the music. The theme you hear in the piece was the very first thing I wrote when I sat down to work on Kindred. \r\n\r\n_Why did you choose to use cello and piano?_\r\n\r\nI wanted to portray Lamb&rsquo;s agile and precise attributes, and Wolf&rsquo;s aggressive character. At the same time, both sides of Kindred are intertwined, and it only seemed appropriate to have them dance together and around each other! \r\n\r\n_Will there be more music similar to Kindred&rsquo;s coming from Riot in the future?_\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s not impossible, but very unlikely. The Riot music team strives to come up with unique music for each one of our champions. The music has to encapsulate the art, the lore and the gameplay of the champion within a short track. If we did our job right, that means that music is so specific to each champ that it probably wouldn&rsquo;t fit another character!\r\n\r\n_What are all these sounds around the piano and cello performance?_\r\n\r\nThese are actual recordings of blue magic! Powerful stuff.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease don&#039;t hesitate to ask any Kindred music-related question you&#039;d like!\r\n\r\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"Agent1729","date":"2015-10-14T22:58:37.941+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any update on when we can get the official sheet music for Curse of the Sad Mummy? {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"41619","date":"2015-10-15T02:53:30.612+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive made an arrangement of that on noteflight.
