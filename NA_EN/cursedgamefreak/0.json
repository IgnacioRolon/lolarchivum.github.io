So I&#039;m wondering if they had completely forgotten about it, so those who had large amounts of honor before(I had gathered nearly around 1,000 teamwork, and around 700 of the other 3 combined) are just completely non-existent or is it known if we&#039;re getting something soon in the future? Because I feel like those who followed good sportsmanship before this honor update should be rewarded.","replies":[{"poster":"Simurgh","date":"2017-07-01T09:54:24.757+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're working on it.

Plenty of people out there who frequently play in a premade, and might be proud of their 1k+ old honours (that were mostly received from premade teammates) and want some sort of compensation, but solo joe might have 100 old honours but they're from 100 unique players.\n\nSo theres the person with a lot of honours but a crappy honours/games played ratio, the person with a lot of honours and a great ratio but relatively few unique ones, and the person with few honours but a great ratio. \n\nSince we didn't and don't have a transparent view of our old underlying honour rating(s), it seems really difficult for them to say who deserves compensation without people feeling cheated, as there's assuredly people from all 3 categories who feel that they do deserve an extra reward and that it'd be unfair to exclude them. If they just say \"We calculated everyones underlying honour score and gave an extra reward based on that\", theres going to be a lot of backlash from people who had large counts but weren't eligible.\n\nYou don't really want to indirectly penalise people who played a ton (and so had a meh ratio), nor does it seem prudent for them to exclude groups of friends who are almost always playing as a premade 5 (and hence have relatively few unique honourings) when in various ways they've tried to encourage people to play with friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Supz","date":"2017-07-02T00:31:24.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-07-02T00:41:32.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pointing out that it's going to be hard to explain to the people who had 500+ honours (most of which may have been weighted at little to nothing although they may not have been aware) that it counts for nothing in terms of compensation in the new system, while their friend who had 'only' 100 honours does get compensated (since they were all full weight honours).\n\nTheres lots of backlash over completely reasonable things on the forums as is due to people not really understanding stuff (be it due the explanation being in an obscure spot, or outright stupidity), and here even the brightest among us don't actually know how the underlying weightings work since they simply never told us.\n\nOr maybe they're planning the reward(s) in such a way that sidesteps the various issues, which is why I asked.","replies":[{"poster":"Supz","date":"2017-07-02T02:22:32.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-07-02T02:46:38.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR resets/placements/matchmaking in general are an example that comes to mind where people get angry over things they often don't actually understand. Also, key fragment drops, and really balance changes in general. MMR is probably the most comparable example, since people get upset when they're ranked gold but get matched with silvers, which is a case of the hidden underlying number that actually matters (MMR) being lower than what they think it should be and not corresponding to what they see (their rank).\n\nIs it fair to someone who has played honourably for years with their friends to not get any compensation just because they've exclusively played with their friends? \n\n(Not talking about friends intentionally working together to spam each other honours, but the real group of people who only play league because their friends do, and so will pretty much always be in a premade.)\n\nAs a solo player myself I certainly have no personal objections if their reward criteria favours solo players over those who tended to play in premades, but historically they've always given incentives to group players (bonus ip, extra fragment drop chances, etc.) so it'd be an interesting precedent if the compensation here was biased towards solos (who have 4 potential unique teammates to potentially honour them every game) over premades (who have 3 to even 0 unique teammates to potentially honour them each game). \n\nNow sure, they could be \"Well, the solo players are interacting with more unique people, and making the game enjoyable for more people, and so it's fair they get rewarded extra right? Group players may be out of luck for this particular criteria, but hey, you had fun playing with your friends.\" but I dunno if that's realistic to expect.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jericho Azariah","date":"2017-07-01T13:26:05.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TheEvilQueen135","date":"2017-07-01T13:28:18.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jericho Azariah,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=0xPchYyN,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-07-01T13:26:05.102+0000)\n>\n> U FUCKERS!
