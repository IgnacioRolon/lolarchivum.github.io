Riot, while i do realize that I am being compared to other galio players, if other galio supports have a better KDA than this I will be quite shocked. Just, I&#039;m salty about this and want to get it off my chest. I feel like kill participation should be weighted in this more. I mean, come on, I had a 71% kill participation and 44 god damn assists. Please, just refine this system so supports are more heavily rated on assist rather than kills.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-13T18:13:15.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost 100 kills in a single game, wtf is that elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Avarosa Guide Me","date":"2016-06-13T18:27:07.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=I am Pacman,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T9XJaGx5,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-06-13T18:13:15.050+0000)\n>\n> Almost 100 kills in a single game, wtf is that elo.\n\nAverage ranking was bronze 2.

Even if my warding wasn't great, my kill participation and assistance in objectives was massive comparatively to most average players. This is just my feelings. and i feel as though this grade was too low for the performance I displayed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-06-13T17:41:21.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy crap what is that Garen build...\n\nAs for the actual topic it's just a grade system.  You did well that game, so you got an above average grade.  You did not, however, play like one of the best people who play Galio support.  Wards are a clear point of improvement, however game length typically hurts the grade.  I'd be surprised if anyone got an S that game just due to how long it went on and the lack of truly remarkable stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Powderkegg","date":"2016-06-13T17:38:04.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't upgrade your trinket.","replies":[]}]}
