These people were the champions we know and love/hate.\nMy theory is that the acolyte CLONED the real ones, and putting them in a deep sleep (alive, but not conscious), gave the clones the memories of the originals, as well as their skills and similar weapons. However, he also gave them false memories, in which they served Viktor. \nI think that Clonesuo quickly realized he wasnt the real Yasuo, and so broke out on a quest to find the real Yasuo\n\nPlease comment if you want more.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosUnlimited11","date":"2015-09-09T16:02:54.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps, Yasuo managed to free a few other \"Projects\" i.e. fiora/lucian, because lucian met them outside whereas fiora came in to help. Perhaps someone is helping them. Or maybe due to Yasuo being the 1st to escape, is helping the others so that he can find out what happened.
