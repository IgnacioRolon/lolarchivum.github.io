{"poster":"BIAKaboose","date":"2016-02-27T01:00:13.211+0000","title":"Mount Targon, and why thus far it does nothing.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":15,"down_votes":6,"body":"Negative title, I know, and one that has probably had countless similar posts created however I will say that I have held no real attachment to any of the characters involved beyond a mild dislike of Diana.\r\n\r\n&quot;So why would you have any issues with the new lore if you don&#039;t really care for the characters&quot; You may be asking, well it&#039;s rather simple actually. These events have had a lot of changes with the lore, some good, some bad. I don&#039;t consider myself a good writer by any means, but I do dabble in it as a hobby, and one of the very important aspects of writing is character development (or lack there of, look at Inigo Montoya from the Princess Bride). Notice the key word there, development, as in a change over time, this was something that was showcased extremely well with the Bilgewater event, with TF and Graves coming to terms with their past and not murdering each other, GP and MF having a real solid reason to be fighting beyond maybe GP killing her mother, but that never truly being confirmed.\r\n\r\nGo back to the Freljord event and we have some serious concerns with a full blown retcon of lores, from minor things like Udyr being solidly placed, or Gragas being on his quest for the perfect drink instead of just being around and sometimes getting drunk and fighting people. Then we have Trundle. For anyone who doesn&#039;t remember his original lore, he was basically an outcast who received the disease of his entire tribe in the hopes that he would be accepted, only to be tossed in the muck and despised even more. His connection to the League was one of pure spite, with him opting to keep the disease knowing full well that his entire tribe would die without it. It was a little shaky, sure, but it was still good, it made him unique. Now he&#039;s just a big guy with a large weapon who takes himself way too seriously, sound familiar? {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:23}} \r\n\r\nMy issue here is that yeah, Pantheon and Leona for sure had some outdated lore. It was only sort of half there in a way, but it gave them a purpose, and a good one at that. They retconned the League itself, and now they&#039;re taking all the champions with ties to it and making the character be as far from it as possible. They&#039;re slowly tearing apart everything the game is based on and creating something else. Sure, the writing is good now, it&#039;s a lot more solid, they have somebody who did I think Warhammer 40K, so yeah, the quality of the writing itself has definitely gone up, but what bothers me isn&#039;t that the writing is bad. What bothers me is that the writing doesn&#039;t have character development, it doesn&#039;t have them changing over time, or finding a new purpose, it&#039;s just destroying them and putting someone else in their skin (literally for Pantheon). The Mount Targon change doesn&#039;t advance the story in any way, it doesn&#039;t really change anything about the game, or necessarily about the world as a whole, it&#039;s a waste of writing and potential for the sake of having something to do. Recreating old characters with nothing but lore changes and complete rewrites doesn&#039;t do anything but make the loyal players dislike you.\r\n\r\nWho is going to be next on the rewrite chopping block? They&#039;ve hit the entirety of the Freljord already, a decent chunk of Ionia, Demacia is in a constant state of nobody knowing really what they&#039;re doing, so they just shout the name of their homeland instead. The sad thing is that the interesting characters are all the ones being retconned to oblivion. Trundle was pretty interesting, now he&#039;s just menacing big guy #8. Leona is now Pantheon&#039;s old personality, Pantheon is basically exactly the same except now he hates Leona along with everyone else, Diana is now buddy buddy with the Solari? Like OK, probably going to be some huge event involving another faction, but why rewrite the characters entirely instead of just having them overcome their differences to deal with a more dangerous threat? \r\n\r\nI guess at the end of the day I just don&#039;t get it, what is the actual point here Riot? I know you have a new writer, but he isn&#039;t new to writing, have him build on what is already here, don&#039;t have him just scrap it all for something else. \r\n\r\nI guess I&#039;ll quit nagging now, and sorry if this was all a waste of time for you. Sincerely, someone who actually liked Runeterra the way it was years ago as flawed as it may have been.","replies":[{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2016-02-27T02:42:43.399+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"I think you are being a little unfair, it isn't like these new lore pieces is an event like the Bilgewater one.

It's a lazy way of setting things up for the short term instead of evolving the story over time to be what they want it to be in the end either way, creating more information and more character attachment in the process.\n\nSure it seems rather harsh, but keep in mind the only lore changes that have happened recently are these large events or red posts invalidating previously known things, most of which is just a lot of retcon, and very little character development.","replies":[{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2016-02-27T03:13:06.052+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It is hard to build something when the foundation isn't solid to begin with{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Narsicus","date":"2016-02-28T14:11:49.717+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who wouldn't love to build a story with a demi-god warrior who exists entirely to defend his homeland and whose personality has literally been obliterated?\n\nJust think of all the character progression that can stem from a character who no longer exists!\n\nSeriously, the first thing people will do to add depth to this character is either ignore the fact that his body is now being used by some celestial force or cause him to have slow resurgences of that old personality.

They still haven't recovered from the Great Retcon, so now they need to retcon more stuff to fit in, but that takes time and money that could be spent on new stories and puts it to work writing new origin stories.\n\nIt's like if they rebooted the Marvel Cinematic Universe and had to re-make every single origin movie.

Nothing is really changing except the quality of the writing so far and it annoys me to no end that nothing is really happening most of the time, and then stuff like the Bilgewater event comes along and changes a ton of stuff in like a week, then it's back to nothing for months at a time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kraljdred","date":"2016-02-27T12:08:39.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It seems this is more about you disliking the retcon then anything Mt. Targon related. The retcon will always remain controversial, most people were fine how the old lore was handled with Summoners and JoJ and League Judgements. However, If you look at the work this new lore team did with the new lore, The Bilgewater and Harrowing event, i think it is fair to say that the quality of lore has increased from the old days.\n\nNow for the Mt. Targon itself, this is just the prologue to a more complete story, it only contains backstory and introductions for the main players for the event. When the real event starts, all sort of things could happen that will advance the story, maybe Atreus manages to take back control from Pantheon, maybe Leona and Diana become friends, put in there the chance of an Void invasion, plus Taric and new champs roles to play, all sort of things are possible.\n\nNow, could have this all been done within the old lore? Probably. But if they felt the retcon was so much needed for them to write all of this great material, I think its a good trade.","replies":[{"poster":"BIAKaboose","date":"2016-02-28T13:56:10.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a mix of me disliking retcon as a means of advancement and that thus far (as the title suggests) it doesn't really mean anything at all, it's just sort of there to be there, in other words it (so far, again) is pointless.
