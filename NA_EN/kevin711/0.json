Lately I&#039;ve been getting match ups in normals with much more experienced players, many of them having like 3 years playing experience and ~1000 games played.  Obviously, this is not fun at all for me or my teammates--I get destroyed more often than not, and criticized endlessly by these veteran teammates if not outright flamed for all my mistakes.  I know I am not a good player, but it takes time to learn the basics of the 100+ champs might need to face and such.\r\n\r\nSo maybe gonna uninstall...it&#039;s too bad though because when I did have evenly matched opponents and teammates, this game was really fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-06-08T17:06:17.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grin and bear it! Playing against experienced players is great practice. Beating up on Bronze V players, assuming your own potential is beyond that, doesn't teach you much about the game. \n\nPeople flaming you sucks. There's not a great answer to it. One thing to do, however, is to at least do some research on the metagame choice for your role and adhere to them, especially in ranked. That'll get a lot of folks off your back, because they'll be more likely to accept that you're just having a rough game and/or are outclassed by your opponent. \n\nFor instance, glancing at your match history, taking TP/Heal as Soraka with Deathfire Touch as your keystone would make somebody worry that you're actively trolling them. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but you really should take a bit of time to read up on champs that you're playing and find the best way to pilot them. Soraka is a solid support, but traditionally supports will take Flash and Exhaust/Ignite, and Soraka should virtually always be running Windspeaker's Blessing as her keystone. \n\nLeague has a HARD learning curve, and it's barely even begun at level 30. Stay away from Ranked for a while, and do your best to learn the ins and outs of the meta in norms and via online guides and youtube videos. It makes a huge difference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-06-08T10:32:25.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not the matchmaking messing up, that is you improving and the system giving you better people to face. You are going to lose a lot because you don't know champs and what they do. The only ways to learn about them are extensive research or fighting them and probably losing. You don't learn much by winning.\n\nIf someone is flaming you just mute them.  Don't tell them you are doing it, just do it. They probably aren't going to say or listen to anything useful that you would be missing out on. Even if they decide to take out their aggression in a gameplay related way you will still have learned from and improved on your lane matchup.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kevin711","date":"2017-06-08T19:50:15.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Jooo and Zezo for replies.  Maybe I will just take a break from game for a couple weeks.  I think part of the problem with the matchmaking is my performance is really inconsistent, depending on matchups and if I know the opponent.  If I do I'll work on my runes and masteries too so I can be more competitive at higher tier--honestly never payed much attention to that--I just have 1 page for physical champs and 1 for magic champs lol but didn't think it made much difference.  But my last game I forgot to switch one over and ended up doing really poorly so I guess it is important.\n\nI definitely stay away from ranked--I tried a few placement games and teammates were pissed.  They accused me of ELO boosting lol but not my fault they had me at silver III in tryouts, when my skills are def low bronze right now.","replies":[]}]}
