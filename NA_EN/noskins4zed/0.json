This sorcerer was a genius on the battlefield who was an expert at targeting the weak spot in an enemy's armor in order to maximize the destructive force of his magic. Unfortunately, rito decided to make his scaling absolute shit, but gave him good base damage. Because of this, he decided to imbue his boots with 15 magic penetration; that way he could easily abuse those high base numbers without having to drop a ludicrous amount of gold on his neighbor's stupid looking hat.","replies":[{"poster":"KaRniVooL13","date":"2017-07-21T00:46:42.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"stupid looking hat\" \n\nLMAO \n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LethalTempo Jhin","date":"2017-07-21T01:13:27.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude.\n\n15 Magic penetration means you ignore 15 MR.\n\nThere is no scaling on that, unlike {{item:3134}} items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-07-21T01:32:29.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah.
