I hit the ban button and a dialogue box addressing the error has popped up. I have now been hit with 5 games low priority queue which last 15 minutes each. That will be a good hour and a half matchmaking added.\r\n\r\nIt seems unfair given that I didn't make the client. \r\n\r\nMay you lift me from low priority queue please? I will have 4 clocks left.\r\nWill there be an update to sort this out? Yo thank you if so.\r\n\r\nIt will be a problem if I am perma low priority queue'd.\r\n\r\nta","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-11T02:01:03.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rest assured that you won't be hit with any kind of \"permanent\" low priority queue! We won't be able to do much about leaverbuster's here on the boards, but I _can_ help you figure out what happened when you couldn't click that ban.\n\nYou probably couldn't click ban in time because of something making your connection with our servers unstable.
