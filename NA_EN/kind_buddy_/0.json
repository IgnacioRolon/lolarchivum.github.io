But it gives us players a bit of free will as to who we get to play. Agree or disagree lemme know","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2018-03-19T00:36:12.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not unless Riot starts regularly balancing champs specifically for ARAM. Otherwise, increasing player control over champ picks would make champ variety decrease even further, which would make ARAM feel that much more stagnant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-18T01:21:15.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would likely be nonrandom at that point. Maybe 3 random champions? Some other games do that.\n\nAnother idea i had while pondering this was _Random Draft_:\n\n* Optional: each team could ban 5 champions from selection by the pool\n\n* 14 (seemed like a fair number) champions are selected randomly for the draft pool\n\n* Draft proceeds as normal, with no restrictions on owned champions.\n\nAlternatively, _Balanced Random_:\n\n* A teamcomp is chosen randomly, ie  1 support, 2 ADC, 1 mage, 1 fighter, or 2 support, 2 tank, one mage\n\n* Both teams get randomly selected champions that fill the required comp\n\n* Players can trade champions+roles\n\n* Reroll gives you another champion of the same role\n\n* Overall champ winrate total (or some other metric) of each team should be kept close together","replies":[]}]}
