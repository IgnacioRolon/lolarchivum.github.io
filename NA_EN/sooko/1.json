No doubt the Cinderhulk change has definitely helped him greatly, but I just think he could get one last push.\r\n\r\nWe all know his hidden passive makes him bigger with more HP. More HP = more goo. Pretty neat, yes?\r\n\r\nNow I thought: More goo should probably mean more weight, am I right?\r\n\r\nThen, why not making his E scale off HP or bonus HP instead of AP? The bigger Zac actually is, the more it hurts to be hit by him after he launches himself in the air.\r\n\r\nI have no numbers to balance, just thought this could be a cool thing to be had :3","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-11T22:38:12.737+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool thematic idea, but he would need to have it scale with his secret passive, not his actual health, because he actually gets smaller when he has less than his base health. If it scaled with his current health, it would fit pretty close thematically, but that could end up being a pretty big nerf in the end.","replies":[{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-04-11T23:29:36.566+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, that's actually quite accurate.\n\nBut I don't think Riot has ever actually introduced any mechanic scaling with _your_ current HP. Most I've seen was %missing HP from Olaf or Tryn, but nothing actually scales with current HP at the moment. It would become quite a challenge to balance something like that out to make it usable in those clutchy fights when everyone is low.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-04-12T14:08:08.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if it scaled off 8% of Zac's health?\n\nLike, he has at level 1 is 615 so it would start around +49 damage. And at level 18, he has 2230 so it would go up to +178 damage. If you can get him up to 3000 health, then he could deal 240 and at 4000 health he'd deal 320 damage. If we add this with his AP damage which goes to at most 200 AP, his AP dealing +140, then it can go up to +660 damage +280 for a total of +940 damage. It wouldn't be too powerful and it will be for only late game.","replies":[{"poster":"PoisonedPeace","date":"2015-04-12T17:15:11.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"940+base dmg on a 1300 range CC ability...wut","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-04-12T17:30:04.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it's late game.
