Remember when they buffed Zed after launch?  Or Gnar?  Yeah, turns out people just needed more time to learn how to use the new thing.  Now, that wasn't the story with Cass, but I still think it was useful to give us a while to play the thing so we had high quality feedback.\n\nAlso, I don't think any reworker has interacted more with the community than Stashu.

Deadly Cadence solves none of the problems New Cass has and creates a big new scaling problem.\n\nMoving to a new Cass passive with better poisony feel is possible, but I haven't seen a proposal that really feels right yet.

I'm completely boycotting this game and I suggest others to do the same. You've all seen they have no qualms about absolutely demolishing champs that people paid money for without remorse, and it's just despicable.
