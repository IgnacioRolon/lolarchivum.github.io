These two, for example, have an amazing level of mobility without being really punished for it, and are very usually seen as frustrating to go against. A few other champions I can think of that are unfun, of the top of my head are:\r\n{{champion:429}} Yeah, it might be bias. I play mainly melee champions, but I just hate champions with infinite mobility, especially if they can kite without ever worrying about mana because their mobility skill is free.\r\n{{champion:157}} Speaking of infinite dashes, this guy really makes me want to punch my screen when I see him going through a wave of 6 minions, proccing his Shiv, and almost clearing it completely without any resource. This is especially true if my champion is skill-shot reliant and squishy at the same time, meaning that the more likely I am to land a skill-shot, the more likely he is to dash through me and crit in my face.\r\n{{champion:150}} Well, melee champion bias again, but this little mofo is definitely one annoying pest to deal with if your champion is MS reliant (VoliStruggle) or if he lacks multiple gapclosers to keep up with Gnar.\r\n{{champion:76}} Nidalee's poke is already hell to deal with considering that after a tear, her sustain beats Yorick's and so does her range. But if she had no mobility, she would be only a little different from Xerath (Less CC, more utility like vision and heals), and Xerath, in my opinion, does feel like if I die to him, it was a mistake of mine, and I truly got outplayed, a healthy champion (except on ARAM, to hell with you Xerath players on ARAM). Nidalee, however, can become uncatchable whenever the people she bombards get fed up with it and try to catch her, assuming they can't throw enough CC for her to just run off without mana problems.\r\n{{champion:92}} No comment. Really. An MS GP build of mine could not catch Riven, even with three stacks of my passive to slow her down, Randuins and my ult. I have beaten several Rivens during my days of playing LoL, but I can't say it was fun by any means.\r\n{{champion:84}} I know Riot toned her down recently, but one does not forget an Akali once she gets a double kill from your bot lane, no matter how nerfed she is.\r\nThen of course:\r\n{{champion:64}} A ton of mobility and damage put together in one kit, as well as CC and it lets players feel highly skilled when they play Lee. I don't really hate this champion that much, more his players. But I am sure several people here on Boards truly hate the champion himself.\r\n{{champion:238}} Very smilar to Lee, but with less CC and more reliable mobility (blinks). Plus some Nidalee-ish poke without mana costs, but what I think is most frustrating about him is the fact that he gets to always leave if he isn't chain-CC'd, even if he doesn't blow up his target. (again, mobility related issue)\r\n\r\nSome champions I forbid you from mentioning if you disagree with me:\r\n{{champion:98}} If you think Shen doesn't pay for his mobility you probably play one of the champions above and are in denial. Sorry but a long CD dash that drinks up half of your energy IS costly.\r\n{{champion:85}} Kennen has two choices: either walk in to restore energy, or run away and bear with the whole energy cost of the ability, which is big enough to be reconned with by itself. IMO the most balanced energy champion, taking in account Shen is Underpowered.\r\n{{champion:86}} ... ... ... ... Really?\r\n\r\nSo... yeah, what do you think? Is mobility without any drawbacks an important factor when it comes to a champion being fun to go against?

It's the combination of mobility and unavoidable damage that is the problem.\n\nChampions like Gnar, Riven, and Akali can be dealt with in various ways, as their kits are strong but have clear weaknesses that will be there regardless of the player's playstyle.  They may still be difficult to handle, but once you learn how to handle them you're good to go.\n\nLee Sin, Zed, and Nidalee are very playstyle dependent, and will have different weaknesses depending on how the player uses their strengths.  They can still be dealt with, however you won't always know how to deal with them until you're already facing them in a fight.\n\nNot knowing what to do can lead to a sense of frustration, particularly when the knowledge you picked up on one game does not necessarily apply to another.  It takes a lot of dedication to get around, and not many people are willing to put in the time.  Some don't find that particular type of challenge to be rewarding, and I think that's the heart of the issue.\n\nRiot is attempting to find a balance not in champion strengths and weaknesses, but in people's opinions over what is fun.  Some enjoy the flashy plays of high mobility champions, where as others do not, and whether or not Riot is on the right path here is really an endless debate.  Having proper drawbacks for any strength is very important, and so long as Riot does not forget this I'm fine with having such high mobility champions around.\n\nFor context I'm a Garen main who actively picks Garen into Gnar as a counterpick, and I can't actually remember the last time it didn't work out.","replies":[{"poster":"Sooko","date":"2015-02-16T20:24:25.765+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=redniwediS,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c9E8lc5n,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-16T19:42:40.229+0000)\n> For context I'm a Garen main who actively picks Garen into Gnar as a counterpick, and I can't actually remember the last time it didn't work out.\n\nRespect!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBySky","date":"2015-02-16T21:25:46.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does that lane work?

Yasuo and Riven are probably the biggest violators of this rule because they pay no resource for their mobility, not mentioning their mobility is always accessible without a gate. Riven kind of has a gate to start with, but if you compare it to everyone else's early game it's not much different. After some CDR, she dashes around like crazy. Yasuo already has negligible Cooldowns and his E's low CD makes up for being targeted. I'm not saying either is OP, but I am saying their mobility gives them a ridiculous amount of power that may keep them from ever seeing real balance or proper gameplay adjustments. \n\nKalista is being looked at currently, so I won't so much about her that hasn't already been said. \n\nAt least with Lee and Zed, Riot could (not saying they will, just saying they could) increase their energy costs to where their mobility became always an invest, not some regular aspect of their kit. Given their popularity and success, there is no reason for either to have such small energy costs. It makes Zed ridiculous to lane against and it makes Lee a constant threat no matter how much energy he dispenses in any scenario. If Mana champions have to face being Managated, then Energy Champions should have to face being energy-gated in their own ways. Shen and Kennen are excellent examples.\n\nNidalee is a pain, but not that bad. She nukes someone or dies, even if it feels like bullshit most of the time. I think Akali is okay right now after the recent patch, but again she's mostly just annoying. As far as Gnar goes, I think his problems are less about mobility (he still has to burn Flash more often, unlike Zed/Lee/Nid) and more about his midgame-lategame threat. I think Riot is close to balancing him to a point where he doesn't cloud out other top champions; they simply need to capitalize on what his weaknesses are given it's currently clear what his strengths are.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-02-17T07:49:05.863+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo sort of has a gate on his mobility as he needs a target to dash through.\nYasuo without a minion wave isn't very mobile.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azrael005","date":"2015-02-17T02:07:51.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just think its kind of funny that one of the arguments for energy champs is that they have more limited pools for longer engagements but zed and lee the 2 biggest offenders have instant regains at little-no cost for their energy. Zed better hit those shadow skills free 80 energy per shadow at max ranks if he hits both q and e which also procs on his ult. So potential 160 energy gain for lets say a two cycle so 260 cost and a potential 2 second cd for living shadow if 3 enemy champs are hit per  shadow slash and it gets worse at 20% cd for instant recast if he got youmou's and black cleaver which he usually does.  At which point everything is on cd. So thats a full 3 cycle rotation in about 12 seconds over which he has passively regened another 100 energy. There is no caster other than ryze that comes close to the aoe and even then even burning his ult he isnt matching the aoe and the safety to dash around.  Lee sin suffers a bit from this to.

His Q isn't really costly, but that isn't something that makes it unbalanced. It isn't anything that allows him to fly across the map, or dodge a fast skill-shot like Blitz hook, or lets him dash over walls (every champion I mentioned above asides from Kennen could get through walls easily). Plus the cooldown, despite low, isn't spammable by any means. But, yeah, it is agreeable the ability isn't costy by any means.

If she uses her Shunpo to attack an enemy, it leaves her very vulnerable until it comes back off cooldown, during which time the enemy has a window to make a move against her.  She can use her dash offensively or defensively, but not both in a short time.\nThe same applies to most other champions with dashes:\n{{champion:24}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:35}}\n{{champion:60}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:121}}  {{champion:127}} {{champion:54}}  {{champion:111}}\n{{champion:57}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:80}}  {{champion:133}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:62}}\n\nNow, let's look at some of the most problematic champions in the game, either outright OP, having caused problems in the past, or are just generally unfun to play against:\n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:64}}  {{champion:76}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:254}}  {{champion:157}}\n\nEach of these has the ability to jump in to fight, and still use their mobility to escape again if the fight turns badly for them.\nIs it a coincidence that these are some of the most-hated, most-complained about champions in the game?\nFighting them often becomes extremely frustrating, because it's really hard to punish them for their mistakes.  Often they will over-extend or over-commit, but will be able to use their extra mobility to escape from trouble instead of paying for it.  In Fizz's case, he even gets to be untargetable while doing so, making him even more frustrating to deal with.\nIn Ahri's case, I actually felt that she paid for her burst mobility with a suitably long cooldown, so she was fine - but the new speed boost on her Q almost counts as a second dash, so she goes back into this list.\n\nThere are a few other champions with multiple dashes, but they are generally very specific or can only be used aggressively, or require kills to reset, which makes them much more bearable (though each of these champions have design issues of their own.)\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:121}} \n\n\ntl;dr: Champions who are able to dash more than once in a short time are extremely hard and frustrating to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Thy Red","date":"2015-02-17T17:26:48.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't think you saw how they wanted to change kata few time ago (her general damage would have been lowered but shunpo would've become similar very similar to yasuo's e)","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2015-02-17T22:29:46.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw it, I hated it, I cheered when they decided not to do it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-17T05:10:44.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the case of Lee, it's almost the biggest issue.
