A couple of patches ago I used to get chests often when I or a teammate got a S, I could unlock them with the keys, but now chests don't drop anymore so I keep adding keys to my loot with no way to use them. Are they only useful when buying chests from the shop or there's another utility?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"iFacebook","date":"2017-06-15T18:25:23.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the replies!\n\n>  if someone on your team gets an S, it has to be a premade\n\nDidn't know that. That changed no? What's the logic behind that rule? Someone getting a S or not is influenced by teamplay, what does it change if I know that person or not? I still contributed to his grade no?\n\nYea, didn't get any S recently, but last year, every week I had to wait for the four chests cooldown before getting another. It seems harder to get a S these days, and the last times I did, no chests dropped. If I get a S, I'll get a better chance of having a chest if it's premade?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-15T18:02:42.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery chests have quite a few requirements, including a cooldown period of how many you can earn each week.  Looking at your account, I was unable to locate any games with an S for your champion or premade.  Per the [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide, keep in mind that if someone on your team gets an S, it has to be a premade.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoxerVictor","date":"2017-06-15T17:57:01.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly , let's start off of how to get **CHESTS** and **CHEST KEYS**:\n\n- Chests\n-Obtain rank S on one of your champions. (basic)\n-You can only receive one chest per champion.\n-Every new season , your \"S\" ranks on all champions are reset.\n-You need to wait 6~ days after you consumed all your chest attempts.\n\n*Ugh...What is a chest attempt? Well that's how i like to call it but while you're in the client , logged in you can click on your \"profile\" , under your Summoner Name you can see a small chest icon with a  \"+\" in it's left corner.\n**Hover your mouse over it and you can clearly see how many chests you can achieve / have achieved , etc.\n\n- Keys\n-You have a **chance** to get a key every time you or a premade of yours scores a rank S.\n-The more keys you get , the lower the chance to get the next key. _(however this will reset somehow eventually , allowing you to get periodically enough keys to open at least 1 chest)_\n-The less keys your get , the higher the chance is.\n**-All key drops are key fragments , not the key itself , meaning you need 3 key fragments for one entire key.**\n*_In a nutshell , it means that if you got almost no keys this season you will get a bunch and vice-versa._\n\n* * * \n Ehmm...yea thx but you didin't answer my question...HOW TO CONSUME THEM?!\n\n- Login into your League of Legends account\n- Next to your RP and IP you can see the store , next to it you can see **LOOT **and** STORE** sections , press on the **LOOT** section.\n- You can now easily see all your key fragments , chests , skin shards and champion shards in there!\n* * * \n.......................         _**Reply to this post if you need further assistance , thank you!**_ ....................... \n\n\n* * *","replies":[]}]}
