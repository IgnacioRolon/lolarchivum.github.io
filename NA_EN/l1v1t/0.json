I'm already logged in, but I can't do anything but restart or shutdown client, but I can still use my internet on anything else. and if I launch the Legacy Client I'm greeted with an error that says \"Could not connect to the HTTP server, please check that your internet connection is enabled and that your firewall is not blocking access.\" And closes down on me. I've restarted my router, my computer, everything is up to date, I can use the internet just fine, but the game will not let me do anything after I've played those games earlier today. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-02T02:56:28.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was an external network issue that affected our login service and a few other services briefly.
