If the text does not make sense, let me know in the comments and if the translation is ok, I would also appreciate it if you would tell me in the comments (even with all the complications probably more updated here than in the original).**\noriginal discussion: https://boards.las.leagueoflegends.com/es/c/creaciones-de-la-comunidad/Jj8RNLR1-nuevo-campeon-doble-ren-y-juicio-aspectos-de-targon-resubido\n\nThis double champion will explain much of what we do not know about the Targon Aspects, roles that we do not yet know and secondary tasks that are not unimportant. My biggest ambition is that it has enough potential to be recognized by RIOT and therefore I intend to update the champion's data (specify skills, history, interactions, personality, references and curiosities) over time and not give all the data now (a champion already known has little impact xD).\nThis champion will look generic at first, but that can not be concluded by just seeing the first updates, I invite you to save the link and see the later updates, even if this champion never gets to be seen by a Rioter is a character that I like it very much and I want to share it with you. I also want to warn that the name of the champion is just a prototype and that it can change with the updates just like everything else.\n\n**Update N ° 3:\nHistory:**\nRen is not a native of Targon but has been chosen by one of his Aspects because he is related to one of his representatives and also because of his affinity with magic (consequently to this contact), unlike other vessel, \"Matter\" needs Ren's collaboration for a very unusual task.\n\n**\"The payment of the debt\"**\nA few years ago, as we always do once a week Migra and I meet at noon to present the best hunt, the competitive spirit is probably the best we share as brothers and this time to the surprise of both I am the winner and therefore the loser, Migra, prepares the food.\n\"How did you get this? It is supposed that these birds only live in high parts of the mountain,\" he said a little impressed while flaying \"my pride\".\n\"Yes, this time I wanted to try the animals of the mountain, you always get better prey at the base so I wanted to vary a bit\" I said without giving importance to what was said while he looked at me with a frown. \"I know, I know, I do not have to climb the mountain a lot, but if we go up, we may see that woman again.\"\n\"Stop thinking about that, I also want to thank her but that happened long ago and we already heard the legends everything indicates that she is one of the immortals of the sky, sighting one of them is something incredibly rare, you may die old without see her again \"now he played down the topic. \"Better not think about that again\"\nThat was the last time we talked about her, but now, 5 years later, what is she doing here? out of nowhere in front of us, with his white hair and strong look.\n\"I saved them a long time ago, I wonder if they would do something about what I did,\" she said without much ado.\n\"What are you doing here?\" said Migra surprised and intimidated.\n\"I come to collect the favor I gave them, Targon has a problem that has to be solved and is Matter who has to do it, we are already quite busy\" he said without getting us to understand what he wants. \"They've been watching you and they're the best option at hand, Ren. Would you be the Matter vassel?\"\nAfter a long discussion with my brother we decided that we would offer our help as long as we agreed with what they want. Now we are going Migra, Diana (as she told us her name was) and me to the summit where \"Matter\" will tell us everythin\n\n**\"The need for Targon\"**\nWe Aspects are born with a general mission and a unique role to achieve it, within our greatest objectives is to stop the advance of the Void (none question our mission) and to achieve it, I, Matter, am the one who is responsible for carrying my colleagues to a vassel apt for the work of each one. Our power is greater in our existential plane however with our bodies we can not intervene in the mortal world, the only way to do it is to introduce our consciousness into a body of the plane in which we want to intervene. I am the one who decides that mortals are or are not useful and I am responsible for putting the Aspect in the vessel in two ways:\n- The first is to fuse the aspect with the conscience and body of the mortal, this method I usually use with Aspects that can not risk sacrificing so much power (these tend to choose strong receptacles and have been able to climb the mountain by themselves) however there are risks, in our purest existence we all go hand in hand even though our personality is different, but the fusion of conscience creates in the aspect values ​​and interests of the mortal and depending on the strength of will of vessel the fusion can be more or less pure, for my peace of mind taking a couple of cases our most common problem had been the personality of Pantheon to merge with Atreus (the aspect of the war was already quite arrogant from its inception as to further worsen the situation). **This category of Aspects are called \"Harmony\".**\n- And the other method is to introduce the consciousness of the aspect in the mortal body without fusing them together, this method I use with aspects with which for no reason can corrupt their personality, the twilight aspect is the best example (although it was a big mistake in allowing him to use that little girl as vessel), if his power to change reality and create dimensional passages fell into corrupt hands, to get rid of it would be almost impossible without the help of a certain aspect (It's hard enough with the girl and Twilight on \"vacation\" leaving her to do what wants), the problem with this method is that he needs full cooperation from the vessel and therefore, the aspect has to try to respect the values ​​of the host while it is doing its job (to achieve our mission without stepping on deadly values ​​is quite difficult), the other problem is that the unfused body limits the power that we can use and grant it to the vessel, therefore it requires someone with magical affinity or great potential, a stagnant vessel is useless. **This category of Aspects are called \"Broken\".**\nAs an Aspect of Matter never left my existential plane, it is crucial that I keep here since only in this place can I communicate with my colleagues regardless of the distance, without a receptacle it is only from here that I can fulfill my work and if our situation current would have been different, never risk Targon involving a mortal in the work of Matter, however we lost one of ours, the aspect of the Will forced me to put it in a vessel, my memory of the moment is not clear but we not had to Twilight so close, to the safest thing is that by not bringing the vessel to the top of the mountain the merger has not been safe, Will never answered my call after recovering my control so we can assume that it was fused with a mortal and that the New aspect of the Will is a threat to Targon, we have to find it and then separate them, for that I need the help of both. Ren, Migra, I have been observing them after the first contact they had with Diana, Ren has more affinity with magic and Migra has greater potential, their values ​​do not seem to be a great obstacle for Targon so they are our best option. We do not know the goal of new Will, but someone with his power, without someone stopping it could also be a threat to the world they know. Ren, will you become my vessel cooperating with Targon?\n\n**Harmony and Broken souls**\n\"Mat, why do they call Harmony and Broken the two types of Aspects in their Vessel?\"\nI asked him while Migra looked at me surprised as if he were talking to a ghost even if he understood the situation.\n\"They are called harmony because both consciousness fuses perfectly, there is no internal struggle (at least not conscious), in the end the conscience with greater determination is reflected more in the personality of the new being, but as I said there is no internal conflict, that's why we call them harmony\". \nI understood him but he still bothers me the voice of the grave when he speaks to me from inside.\n\"And then what about \"Broken\"? I suppose it is because our conscience (which should be one) is divided into two parts, right?\" I said.\n\"Yes, although I would like it to be just that, there is another reason. The aspects that a body shares with its hosts usually live many experiences together, struggles, duties, trivialities (of which they would not worry if they were alone), failures, and in most cases are usually hundreds or thousands of years together, the aspect learns a lot from the host, is infected by their values, the appreciation that the aspect has on its environment is transformed, although the priority of the aspect is always its duty, empathizes much more with the host and his world, but everything has an end, we prevent the old age death of the vessel, but they are not immortal and we do, both entities are destined to separate and who ends with a heart (as you call them) broken is the aspect, for that reason they are called Broken\".\n He said very dryly although his words were so altruistic.\n\"So this method is very problematic, but I'm not so weak, my duty is everything, but instead the Twilight Aspect is vague due to the mourning for its previous hostess, I still can not contact him or the crazy girl , but we'll see what it says when I separate it from the brat\". \nIt seems that he hates the \"crazy girl\" and the twilight, although I suppose that the irresponsibility in a being of the stars is not very good.\n\"Anyway, the talk is over, go to that clear place, I'll try to use your body\".\nHe told me in a very authoritarian way, I think he does not know what it is to live together.\n\n **have no experience writing stories, do not judge me :c**\n\n**Enemies:**{{champion:266}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:90}} and Aspect of the Will\n**Allies:**{{champion:131}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:16}} \n**Neutral:**{{champion:142}} \n\n\n**Gameplay:**\nRen (Main role - Magician / secondary role - Shooter)\n\n**Passive:** Ren can fly, allowing him to use skills and basic attacks that scale with magical damage while moving. In addition to the mana bar, Ren has a bar of euphoria that increases its movement speed depending on how full it is and allows you to load \"exhausting beam\" when it is full.\n\n**Q:** Multiple skill (like Riven or Aatrox) of long range.\nFirst Q \"heavy ball\": Ren sends a core of gravity towards an enemy champion, a basic beat or \"exhausting beam\" of Ren activates the core relentizando the target for a short period of time (it fills the euphoria bar a little).\n**Second Q \"Sensitive Star\":** Ren sends an unstable miniature star to an enemy champion, if Ren uses a basic atack or \"exhausting beam\" on the affected target the star explodes causing magical damage (it fills the euphoria bar a little).\n**Third Q \"exhausting beam\":** Ren shoots with his two hands dark and stellar energy doing magic damage, if he reaches an enemy the bar of euphoria is filled a bit. As long as the euphoria bar is full Ren can compress the beam to increase the damage and the scope of the beam (triple by decreasing the thickness of this proportionally) by emptying the euphoria bar and deforming the space causing the beam to start meters away from Ren.\n\n**W:** Protection against Skill shots, frontal basics and charge skills.\n\"Solid Matter\": Matter outside Ren's body protecting him for a very short period of time, if he succeeds, he absorbs the blocked energy allowing him to return sooner and completely filling the bar with euphoria.\nAuthor's comment: It is a skill that requires an advanced Timing, with a waiting time less than the W of Fiora and that only protects you from frontal attacks so in the low elo it will be unusable, it must be like that because a Magician with unbridled protection would be too much strong, but it is a skill that well used rewards you with reduction of cooling and euphoria.\n\n**E:** CC combeable with Q\n\"In / Out\": Ren throws a gravitational mass, holds it in front of it and then shoots it, can reach a great distance, if the skill is used again nearby enemies will be quickly attracted to the mass, if not activated Ren can cast \"exhausting beam\" in the direction of the mass which will cause it to repel all nearby enemies, if it catches more than one the bar of euphoria is filled a little. (\"Inside / Outside\" can be targeted by \"Heavy ball\" and \"Star sensitive\"\n\n**R**: Buff skills and role change.\n\"Sparkling zone and lending body\": Matter materializes to create a magical zone. In this zone Ren has his euphoria to the maximum, \"Heavy ball\" and \"Sensitive star\" bounce off the nearby enemy champions, the ability \"Solid Matter\" changes to \"Liquid Matter\" state in which the matter of Ren is separated from external agents (crosses skill shots) and finally the \"In / Out\" area increases. At the end of the \"Sparkling Zone\" time, Ren remains immobile until he gives the body to Matter, if Ren leaves the \"Sparkling Zone\" when he still does not disappear it is canceled and there is no role change.\nIf the R is available and kept tight, Matter enters the body without using \"Sparkling Zone\" and the CD is reduced by a quarter of the total\n\n**Balance:**\n**Passive:** if the passive is very weak or strong you just have to modify the speed of movement that gives the euphoria or remove the option to use basic attacks while you move.\n**Q:** if the orbs (first two Q) are very strong or weak change the damage and slow down and if the beam is the problem you can modify the necessary euphoria, the damage and the distance or the thickness of the beam.\n**W: **if it is a problem to increase or decrease the time of Matter materialization, however I would not like it to be an easy skill to use, you can also modify the reduction of cooling or the euphoria granted if it is successfully achieved.\n**E:** if it is a problem to modify the area of effect and travel speed of the mass.\n**R:** if it is a problem to modify the waiting time for the change of consciousness, the cd and in the worst case completely remove \"Sparkling Zone\" which would require a buff of your other skills.\n\n**Strong against:** {{champion:25}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:142}} \n**weak against:** {{champion:84}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:91}} \n\n\n**Physical and visual characteristics of the champion (Updatable):**\n[https://www.instagram.com/vi_zexion_vi/p/Bu5XsiDHH-H/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1drvqfyxu7j5s]\n**I dont know draw and also I did the draw with my finger on a cell phone, do not expect something very nice xd.**\n-Unordered hair (at least frontally)\n- Approximate age to Ezreal\n- Agil\n**Personality, customs and psychological aspects of the champion (Updatable):**\n- Ren is a smart guy but not the apparent.\n- Although he is responsible tends to joke in complicated situations as long as it does not merit his seriousness.\n- Learn quickly, proof of this is that Matter could teach him \"magic\" (as Ren calls him) own of celestial entities without great complications and he can apply as best suits him.\n- He often plays the fool and put nicknames on the things that Matter teaches him only to annoy him.\n- He usually thinks that Mstter is too serious.\n- He understands perfectly how crucial his complete cooperation is and empathizes with Matter after he explained his duty.\n- He usually laughs easily.\n**Interactions:** (distant update)\n**References:** (Not too distant update)\n\n**Matter (Main Role - Assassin / Sub Role - Wrestler)**\n**Q:** (distant update)\n**W:** (distant update)\n**E:** (distant update)\n**A:** (distant update)\n**Physical and visual characteristics of the champion:** (distant update)\n[https://www.instagram.com/vi_zexion_vi/p/Bu5XzDEHy1j/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=kdpobi2yezse]\n**I dont know draw and also I did the draw with my finger on a cell phone, do not expect something very nice xd.**\n\n**Personality, customs and psychological aspects of champion:** (distant update)\n**Interactions:** (distant update)\n**References:** (distant update)\n\n**Aspect o the Will:**(distant update)","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-12T06:27:29.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ren, Ter, and their nemesis, Landlord.
