Please keep in mind that \"curse words\" are **not** against the rules - but flaming, berating, and blaming your teammates is.\n\nThe only way to gain honor is to be honorable. You were not honorable, thus you do not deserve honor. Furthermore, punishments escalate if you get them more frequently than every few months of *active* play. As such, it doesn't matter whether you \"mind\" or think you \"only\" deserve a chat restriction - if you have been recently punished and continued misbehaving, your next punishment will be higher up to and including a permanent suspension.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YoshiMatrix","date":"2019-10-18T04:03:03.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah you were very threatening.","replies":[{"poster":"ASCECITY12","date":"2019-10-18T18:10:51.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"She/he was running it down you want me to say ?","replies":[{"poster":"YoshiMatrix","date":"2019-10-18T21:46:29.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about them it's about you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arngrim31","date":"2019-10-18T17:29:29.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ASCECITY12: not trying to be an asshole but could you guys stop inting?\n\n> ASCECITY12: stfu you inted your ass off\n\n> ASCECITY12: fuck you\n\n> ASCECITY12: fucking supp\n\n> ASCECITY12: LOL like youre fucking cool\n\n> I only used 2 curse words.\n\nReally now? because i count 6 and you said them all in a toxic manner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-18T02:03:33.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes honor this dishonorable player lol come on rito.

LoL's punishment system (the IFS, or Instant Feedback System) places a punishment on your account when it deems your behavior bad. Behaving well sometimes doesn't mean you behave well all the time. In this instance - and possibly others, since the IFS punishes based on severity and consistency, and the reform card doesn't necessarily display logs for every match where you were validly reported - you behaved poorly. Poor behavior is very impactful and thus carries a lot of weight with the IFS, so to regain Honor and avoid losing it you'll have to work on controlling your behavior. The IFS does forgive the occasional bad day, but if that kind of behavior becomes habitual, you might be greeted with a reform card telling you to rein it in, or with a permaban message if the temporary punishments haven't worked.","replies":[]}]}
