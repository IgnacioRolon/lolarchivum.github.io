Riot doesn't care about your stupid excuse.  You can send in a support ticket but you will get a similar response.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-09-02T13:05:00.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Please explain me why i got banned because i wanted the game to be lost \n\nThis, right here is enough for a punishment. You must try to win, trying to lose is considered griefing. Also, as others  said, intentionally feeding is also a problem. Two (huge) strikes in one game? Not surprised you got punished. I am surprised that you weren't elevated to a permanent ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-09-03T08:38:08.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"why did I get banned for intentionally feeding\"\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TKM Axe","date":"2018-09-03T07:12:02.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hey you look out,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KTq4tjIF,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-02T11:55:33.404+0000)\n>\n\n> Now please Riot explain me why i got banned for 14 days. i troll \n\nyou admit you trolled then?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2018-09-02T15:19:57.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with one thing ** You shouldn't intentionally feed** However if you do feed and do bad because a {{champion:119}}  did indeed go into the lane steal CS / Farm / XP, and Take kills intentionally upsetting you then that needs to be manually investigated by Riot as well so you may need to file a support ticket and let them check the replay of the match or something if he did that.\n\nI've had players before Intentionally run into my lanes and tilt multiple times then getting upset at things going bad.","replies":[]}]}
