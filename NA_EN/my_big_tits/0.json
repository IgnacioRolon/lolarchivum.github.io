I really want to use it but it's super laggy when I enter a lobby. I run league on my laptop and I don't have anything else to play it on. I like the new client but I'm not sure how to make it run smoother. Any suggestions?\n\nI already know I can use the legacy client, so don't say just to use that lol","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-23T00:01:46.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having lag issues during champion select or a lobby, then the legacy client probably won't fix this as it sounds like a connection issue.  I suggest starting out with the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help resolve any local connection issues.  Hopefully, that will do the trick!","replies":[{"poster":"My Big Tits","date":"2016-11-23T03:57:58.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, legacy client works fine for me. The alpha client itself is lagging when I try to go into the store or trying to pick a champ during champ select. My ping is a constant 19 at my house and my connection is fine.","replies":[]}]}]}
