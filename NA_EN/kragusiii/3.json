Especially when you&#039;re stuck in the hell that is Bronze. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, i&#039;ve made a list of simple concepts to help people like me get some better games and more wins!\r\n\r\nTeamwork OP: \r\nThere&#039;s a nifty little video that explains this one!\r\n\r\nKS= Kill secured: \r\nDon&#039;t ever be upset that your team got a kill. It makes no sense.\r\n\r\nObjectives win games:\r\n Prioritize Towers, Inhibs, drag, baron, over chasing down low champs. Speaking of which...\r\n\r\nChase rhymes with bait: \r\n75% of chases end up in baits.  Even if they&#039;re low.That&#039;s what global ults are for. SUPA MEGA DEATH ROCKET!!\r\n\r\nCommunication is key: \r\nUse that time in the champ select to learn your team. Don&#039;t be afraid to ping during games, especially if you&#039;re bot lane.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t be toxic: \r\nEveryone has bad games. don&#039;t call someone out or make them feel like shit because they happen to be having one. We&#039;ve all been the dead weight in a game before. Support your teammates. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not all about you!\r\nNo matter how well you do in lane, or mow many kills you get, or how much you think you can carry, remember that the team wins together and looses together.","replies":[]}
