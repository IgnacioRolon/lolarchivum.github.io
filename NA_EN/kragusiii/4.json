Every time I enter a game, I have to roll the dice because At least one of the players on your team is gonna be an asshole. \r\n\r\nLet me specify, this does not extend into bad players, or players who are feeding. we all have off games. \r\n\r\nThe players who see it as their duty to respond and let players know what they&#039;re doing wrong. \r\nBasically the players that think think they&#039;re entitled to tell people how to play. No one really cares what you know if you come at them like a jerk. There&#039;s no need in going all Keyboard warrior on someone you have to cooperate with to win.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I do what I can to spread positive play.  There are ways.\r\nFor example, I&#039;ve seen a lot of players who don&#039;t know that muting a player keeps them from seeing what you type as well as vice versa. RITO! LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS!( I once got my entire team to mute a toxic player and we were able to communicate and nearly win the game. It does happen.)\r\n\r\nRight now, Leauge of legends is like the pretty girl with a bitchy attitude. The game is still one of the greatest MOBAS out there, but the more time I spend with it/her....I understand why I can&#039;t go steady with Leauge.\r\n\r\n...At least there&#039;s Overwatch.","replies":[]}
