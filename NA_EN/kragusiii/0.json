On the surface, it seems great. It allows players to try new roles, and increases the frequency of games played. However, I think there&#039;s a huge problem that&#039;s been overlooked, and that&#039;s the way some players (Iron/Bronze/Silver) react to being auto filed in the first place. \r\nEither 1- The player doesn&#039;t know how to play the role they filled into.\r\n2- The player is a one-trick and decides Karthus Jung is a viable option\r\n3- the player asks for a swap, gets denied, and decides to troll the entire team for sweet sweet revenge.\r\nNow, I know this probably only applies to a percentage of overall players in league, but seeing as this is a team game, it&#039;s very important that every player is at least on the same page as far as team comp, strategy, etc. And I just want to pose the question, &quot;Is auto fill good for ranked play?&quot; \r\nWe&#039;ve all been in a situation where the game becomes a 4v6 because someone on your team got auto filled and pitches a fit about it. As a support main myself, I don&#039;t typically get auto filled into a different spot (Support is the least picked role) But if I had a quarter for every time I&#039;ve had to carry an auto filled ADC or deal with laning with a Darius one trick, I could afford to buy a switch and just play Smash bros. lol\r\nHow would you guys feel if Riot removed auto fill just from ranked play? Personally, I would deal with fewer games and longer queue times if it meant having a more cohesive team experience once i&#039;m actually in game. I&#039;m no expert, just a player trying to climb the ranks.\r\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
