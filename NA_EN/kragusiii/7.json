The games just aren&#039;t fun anymore. I don&#039;t have a group of friends to play with and the trolls are just too much. When you cant depend on the client to find 4 other like-minded players in order to achieve success, then what&#039;s the point in playing? I&#039;m tired of playing against the other team, and one or 2 of my own teammates. As much as I&#039;d like to &quot;Get gud&quot; enough to carry with that handicap, It makes the game needlessly more difficult. Having to play top and team mediator isn&#039;t what i que&#039;d up for.\r\nThe worst part? There are less and less new players on this game. I read through the boards. I see the horror stories about players who don&#039;t even make it to lv. 30 because the trolls kick them out. I guess I had a little more fortitude, but enough is enough even for me. I can&#039;t even convince my own friends to give the game a shot, because they see how frustrated I get when I play. They see how one person can ruin a team. (There aren&#039;t enough of us to make a full team) There doesn&#039;t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Complaints and requests and suggestions on how to fix the problem fall on deaf ears. Rito talks about an improved system, leaver buster, etc. but where is the progress? Players should feel a difference. There still shouldn&#039;t be obvious trolls slipping through the growing cracks in a system riot claims to be fixing. Even the Remake function is a band-aid. Players join the game and either die instantly (Which overrides the remake) Or they play until 5 minutes in and then quit. I&#039;ve been the victim of both of those scenarios. It&#039;s just not fun. I&#039;ve spent more than a few bucks on the game. I participate in the surveys, I watch E sports highlights and championships concerning League. And it hurts me to say that Riot seems content in letting trolls ruin an otherwise terrific experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-08-13T16:46:08.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to have you leave, but have fun wherever you plan to go.\n\nIf you want suggestions Starbound is pretty fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2016-08-13T16:49:17.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loving that game!

They just give us a shiit remake and really it's shiit. i can see alot of ppl troll game, afk, feeding, boosted but they still there. I really don't know what Riot suppose us to do when you are in your ranked game and someone fail your game for some stupid reason, and what we do is ..... you talk to them by softly word?, or afk? or stand in your base? or... if u do one of them u get banned but that troller get nothing from them.
