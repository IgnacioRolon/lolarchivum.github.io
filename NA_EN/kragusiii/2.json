I&#039;m on the rift daily, grinding for the Gold tier and above. In fact, I just hit SilverV at the end of this season so that&#039;s pretty exciting. What kind of sucks though, is the lengths I (And others, according to Reddit) need to go to just to get out of Bronze.\r\nI&#039;m talking about obsessively checking LOL.gg for my teammates (And i use that term VERY lightly) MMR, win/loss streak, best champs, etc.\r\nThe amount of anxiety when I see a Panth one trick on a 5 game loss streak on my team is sometimes overwhelming. I try to be nice in chat and suggest another champ, or a counterpick for them. and 8/10 times I&#039;m invited to suck their d*ck.\r\nI get it. they&#039;re probably tilted from the last few losses. And league is a toxic af community. So now I have a choice. \r\n\r\nI can roll the dice with this Panth and pray that the opposing team has someone who&#039;s more tilted than he is.\r\nOr I can dodge, take time penalty, and roll _those_ dice and pray I don&#039;t end up with someone worse.\r\n\r\nOne simple google on how to climb more effectively  in League will take you to posts, threads and guides about How to dodge properly when matchmaking fails. Or a tier list of champs based on how easy it is to climb or 1v9.\r\nThat&#039;s where I learned this strategy to keep your MMR where it should be. _And it works._ that points to a HUGE problem with the ranked system.\r\nI know I know, there&#039;s hella issues with Ranked. And i&#039;m sure its super difficult to tune matchmaking. But league is supposed to be a team game, right? It really sucks that in order to climb the ranks, you have to play this macro game of stat checking, dodging, and playing Garen all the time. It feels like I&#039;m fighting the game itself before I even get into the rift to fight the other team.\r\n\r\nTLDR; It sucks having to dodge, stat check, and be forced to play carries just to protect your MMR and rank.","replies":[]}
