He then proceeded to call me autistic, make threats against me, and told me and all other autistic people in the world to just kill themselves. All of this was during the game.\n\nAfter the game I reported him to Riot for verbal harassment, hate speech, and negative attitude\n\nHe then proceeded to send me a friend request. I accepted, curious as to what else this internet tough guy had to say to me. We had a short exchange wherein he told me that my grandmother had Aids and should kill herself. I did write a rebuttal, but not nearly in the same harsh and disrespectful manner as his. I have a screenshot of the last conversation as proof, although i don&#039;t know how to post them here.\n\nIt would be nice to know that this incredibly rude and disrespectful player was banned. The community doesn&#039;t need another toxic player on the rift. I&#039;d be happy to share the screenshot of the last conversation if anyone knows how to post pictures on the boards.\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-05-30T06:40:08.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naming and shaming is against the rules, dude.
