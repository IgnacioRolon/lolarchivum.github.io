We flamed him a bit and threatened to report him and this guy offers to boost us on his main account, which is also cheating btw. I mean this guy was literally running from teamfights, ruining into their base typing free kill over and over again. He was so bad that our mid laner went afk for a while, but eventually came back. We ended up muting the ADC and trying to win, which we almost did. But his cheating and trolling unfortunately prevailed.\r\n\r\nThere are too many stories like mine in the leauge community and frankly I don&#039;t think Riot is doing enough about it. I understand that being a free to play game literally opens the floodgates to all sorts of people, but it&#039;s no secret that Leauge has one of the most toxic player bases out there.  \r\nMy question is: When is Riot going to do anything about it?\r\n\r\nTake a few notes from blizzard and their Moba. Ban accounts. delete accounts. IF they&#039;re smurfs they aren&#039;t buying anything on those accounts anyway. I know it wont solve every case of toxic behavior but  at least make the trolls have to work to ruin the gsme for 4 other people. I love leauge. And when you get paired with good players it&#039;s amazing. But being put ona good team is starting to feel more like winning the lottery than the sunrising. (You cant count on it)\r\n\r\nBottom line, Riot needs to do more to ensure positive play.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-08-06T15:49:59.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KragusIII,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=anB3czju,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-08-06T15:05:22.417+0000)\n>\n> My question is: When is Riot going to do anything about it?\n\nRiot does ban intentional feeding, the system does a pretty good job in identifying them. Its just that you don't see it, as you'll only receive the notifications if your report was the game that got them punished, and not while it was building towards their case. \n\nAKA the visibility on the behavioral system sucks.\n\nThe good thing is that Riot is putting a pretty high priorty on improving behavioral visibility, though you probably won't see it until after the new client is up and running smoothly.\n\n> Bottom line, Riot needs to do more to ensure positive play.\n\nEncouraging positive play is also on the docket! Tribunal 2.0 is in the works and encourages and offers more interaction with the honor system!! However, that is FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRR down the road.","replies":[{"poster":"KragusIII","date":"2016-08-06T16:30:14.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hearing that there are things in the works makes me feel a bit better about things.

If a Banned smurf makes 5 more accounts, identify them and ban them as well. I'm not pretending to have all of the answers, I'm saying Riot shouldn't let the fact that their game is free to play keep them from ensuring that players aren't being dicks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-08-06T15:16:47.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's not smurfing that's reverse boosting. its becoming popular cause people wanna get famous for having some insane kda/win rate with a champ. \nIt started with fps games now it's spreading to league. Best example i cna give atm the teemo main that is on top of the leaderboards on LOLskill with 80+ win rate on teemo over 300games . Just look at his heimer stats you can see he loses on purpose to win as teemo later and get that insane kda/win rate. This is worse than boosting to my eyes personally cause you ruin games by losing and then you ruin games by stomping lower elo.","replies":[]}]}
