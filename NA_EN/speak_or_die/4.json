Come before Axamuk (who's stated to be the last Mage King of Icathia before the Shuriman subjugation), yet still be replaced by him without being dead.\n\n2. Survive for thousands of years (although, given his mastery of time magic, this might not be that hard. He's already stated to be immortal in current lore).\n\n3. Survive the invasion of the Void.\n\nPlus, being attuned to spirits sounds more like something a shaman ( {{champion:77}} ) or a mystical warrior ( {{champion:98}} ) would be, not Mage royalty.","replies":[{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2018-10-19T11:19:16.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In truth, a new Mage King appeared when Icathia rebeled:\n> But the Kohari are reborn, rising to serve **the new Mage King** and reclaim their honor.\n\nAnd well...Zilean already is a Icathian who survived the invasion of the Void.\nI'm not trying to reinforce the \"attuned to spirirts\" theory but Zilean being a Mage King is pretty possible in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-10-19T13:20:55.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atgo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=OzwKbsU6,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-19T11:19:16.532+0000)\n>\n> In truth, a new Mage King appeared when Icathia rebeled:\n> \n> And well...Zilean already is a Icathian who survived the invasion of the Void.\n> I&#x27;m not trying to reinforce the &quot;attuned to spirirts&quot; theory but Zilean being a Mage King is pretty possible in my opinion.\n\nZilean isn't a king. That's part of what makes him special. He's just a wizard who has spent his life studying this magic and technology, and then when it all goes to hell, he tried to cast the ultimate spell, which ended up displacing him in time, akin to the TARDIS if it never stopped anywhere for more than 10 minutes. \nMaking Zilean a king and giving him governmental power of ANY sort ruins what we know of him as a character. I'm not saying he's the most developed at this time, but making him a king would be an entirely too dramatic shift of character and personality, because there's a degree of charisma and confidence that Zilean simply doesn't exhibit. It would be like if instead of reworking Irelia into being a blade dancer, they suddenly reworked her into a timid priestess under Karma's guidance.\nI am just firmly against this Mage King option because it tears Zilean into a direction that simply does not fit who he is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-10-19T13:02:16.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atgo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=OzwKbsU6,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-19T11:19:16.532+0000)\n>\n> In truth, a new Mage King appeared when Icathia rebeled:\n\nOh, I didn't actually know this.\n\nNeat.\n\nIs it stated whether or not this \"new Mage King\" survived?\n\n> \n> And well...Zilean already is a Icathian who survived the invasion of the Void.\n\nYeah, but you'd assume someone like *the leader of the whole nation* wouldn't be one to flee, right?\n\n> I&#x27;m not trying to reinforce the &quot;attuned to spirirts&quot; theory but Zilean being a Mage King is pretty possible in my opinion.\n\nPossible, yes, but I think it a bit unlikely.\n\nI do not see Zilean as much of a freedom fighter, nor one to sanction the unleashing of the Void.","replies":[{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2018-10-19T17:25:01.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Is it stated whether or not this \"new Mage King\" survived?\n\nUnfornately, the quote I sent before is the only mention of the new Mage King.
