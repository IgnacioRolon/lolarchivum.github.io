Doesn't mean that human wouldn't be dinner against this wolf in a combat.\n\nI will give you that Aspects are usually more powerful yes, but that's because most of the Ascended are not high tier. Vast majority of the Ascended falls in mid tier, which they even age. They don't carry enough \"soul\" power or body resistant or whatever to reach their maximum potential. Such rare of humans are capable of being transformed to an high tier Ascended, like Nasus, Aatrox etc. (Our entire Ascended cast), and they outperforms other Ascended a lot.\n\nI mean, the Ascended outnumbers Aspects overwhelmingly because Shurima Empire had this power. Why wouldn't they abuse? Why wouldn't they create their demigods when they are capable of? It is okay for humans to be not perfect for the ritual, just don't be trash enough to be obliterated by power of the Sun. Even a weak-ass Ascended is win-win for Shurima. For that, Aspects in general are more powerful than the Ascended general. But it definitely doesn't mean Xerath couldn't annihilate an Aspect's ass if he catches the chance. Myisha admits she is surprised by how well the Ascended handled the Void, and how they were more dangerous to each other than the Void. Scathlocke says high tier Ascended are functionally immortal and there aren't much to kill them. Maybe that's why Aatrox, Varus and Rhaast were imprisoned, too powerful to kill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-09-07T17:50:26.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Celestial Ideal*\n\nI was confused too.
