We are to be your servants. He welcomes you to his new capital at Nerimazeth.”_\n\nPower is illusion. The ruler is who people choose to be one, not somebody of what you call 'royal blood', therefore Xerath, as person chosen by some people is technicaly speaking, a leader on specific teritory and grows from there in oposition to Azir, while Azir is God knows where exacly, doing God knows what and is generaly untrusted by population of shurimians like Sivir, Taliyah and other citizens. Hell even Nasus has no idea what Azir is doing with his life and is on Azirs side out of pure spite! Because he hates and fears Xerath! \n\n**\"Bloodline\" story quote:**\n_“What does Azir want with her?” asked Taliyah. “And what is he going to do now that he’s back? Does he want to make us slaves?”\n“She asks a lot of questions,” said Sivir.\nNasus hesitated before answering.\n“In truth, I do not know what Azir plans. That he will stand against Xerath is enough for me. Now you can both meekly bare your necks, or you can live to fight another day.”_\n\nThats kind of immoral of Nasus(?). At least i get this impression. He acknowledges: \"Oh shit. I really fucked up bad and Im scared of that dude. The other one might be warlord and slavery enforcer (what we players know isnt true, at least second part of the statement, but in the universe onone knows except of Xerath) but if he will stand with me against the guy who apparently is doing pretty well and wanted to forgive me for wrecking him mentaly, im okay with it since im badass God warrior and my status will stay untouched.\"\n\nAnd Xerath, reminding first quote, was eager to forgive Nasus (who tehnicaly Burried Him Alive trapping him in a coffin without a single hesitation when Xerath wasnt stated to be agressive at all and later imprisoned him in magicaly sealed tomb in which he was rotting in the darkness and silence for millenia and almost lost his mind from stumiuli defficency) and accept him in his new organised society in Nerizameth.\n\nWhat kind of leadership is that what Azir represents? Curently Xerath is more of a emperor with his acolites and capital. He is at least doing something. Interacting with outside world, bringing people together, while \"real\" capital has ghostlike hidden \"emperor\" and is attracting people mostly beacuse WATER OMG WATER!","replies":[{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-03-27T19:29:13.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I only really called the Shuriman Capital that because it has no real name to speak of","replies":[{"poster":"Gabriela8thGuard","date":"2019-03-28T23:57:23.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mrmeddyman,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3BMUW5gO,comment-id=000c00000000,timestamp=2019-03-27T19:29:13.541+0000)\n>\n> Well I only really called the Shuriman Capital that because it has no real name to speak of\n\nunderstandable. it had a name but i cant find it either. xD","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2019-03-11T16:42:58.091+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kinda surprised that no one mentioned the kumungu jungles yet.\n\nWas really hoping that they'd be counted as their own region with the release of {{champion:518}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-03-11T13:15:27.582+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably Arbormark.\n\nArjen seemed like a pretty chill dude so I imagine the rest of Arbormark follows suit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MF is my Waifu","date":"2019-03-11T21:59:06.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miss Fortune's room.\n\nDo I really have to say why?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yara0","date":"2019-03-11T19:12:39.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zaun is just the most interesting and the art style for it is amazing.
