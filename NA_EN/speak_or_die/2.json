That would just ruin him. He's a doddering old time wizard who made a breakthrough at the expense of his anchor in reality. So while I am ok with them making it so he's not perpetually mentally lost in time, he still needs to remain the time wizard who vanished in his city's hour of need.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2018-09-18T19:57:42.752+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Given how outdated Zilean is as a champion and how much potential he has within his theme, I think he could be taken in a lot of different directions that isn't just \"doddering old time wizard\". That may be the most desirable option for people attached to his current lore, gameplay and VO, but as someone who sees potential within the \"chronolord\" archetype I think he could be so much more; even an Aspect of Time, which would probably be the most epic realization of the fantasy you could achieve within the League universe.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-09-20T15:42:38.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, a hard no. I've had my fill of making everything with a remotely mystical background or high scope of power related to Mount Targon. There should be other sources of power and there should be other individuals who have managed to grasp ahold of power by their own merit, other than being \"blessed by Targon.\" The whole Aspect of XXX thing is getting tired and overused, and I feel like it would completely devalue Zilean.\nAs for Zilean as a \"chronolord,\" not every single champion who's a powerful mage has to have had that power escalate straight to their heads. Zilean is lovable because he is pretty humble about his capabilities. He's not some insane lord of time, nor is he some power wielding mage-king. He's just a regular academic who stumbled onto some intensely powerful magic and tried to use that magic to reroute history to avert a disaster, but failed in doing so. Nothing about who he is points to us believing he should be some king or god-being. He's just a mage who harnessed the power of time - like a scientist who discovered how to harness electricity. He's an academic first and foremost, and he's always been trying to use his research for the betterment of the world. Making him a god-being or lord of time just shits on everything that Zilean encapsulates as a character.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Budget Yami","date":"2018-09-19T23:09:24.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uhm.... this isnt related to the thread but where do u get that icon?

A Scientist who was involved in the a-typical hero story of lab accident gone wrong grants super powers. For Ol' PP he was flung through space and time for eons until he went mad then after a while \"he grew tired of being mad so he went sane...very sane\".
