I also tried to uninstall the client and re-install it. This too did nothing, so now every time i log in it says that the game is still in progress (which i know it isn't because the game was two hours ago) and it won't let me do anything. Can anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-20T00:40:07.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh this sounds like a classic ghost game. They don't happen too often and are caused when the game ends but the server never received the end of game notification. Once it's been a solid 2 hours since the game ended you'll be able to queue back up. If it's already been over 2 hours, try giving your pc a quick restart and let me know if you still can't queue up.","replies":[{"poster":"M치s칩n","date":"2017-06-20T00:43:42.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've just restarted my computer (its been about 2 hours and 30 mins) and the same still happens when I start up my client, it goes right into the game and never loads and I still get stuck on the reconnect screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Goxzy","date":"2017-06-20T01:23:31.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im still having the same issue. restarted my pc and everything.
