Non stop making the entire game un winnable even after game chat Zyra admitted that her and YI were int feeding.  (this is the shit people rage about people purposely trolling on throw away accounts to get those on main accounts in trouble for getting frustrated) \n\nGame 2 -  Seriously Again i have a malz spamming \" NAsus is hacking using Cheating hacks.\" all game long feeding nasus kills then lets him free farm all game long while he spams this over and over.. \n\nGame 3.  -  i pretty much said nothing not sure how i got reported there but ok. \n\n************************************************\nSo Update. I cut a few things out like the Rioter name viewing my case but this was basically the result of what i was told. \n\nI've taken some time to go through your logs and I'll admit, I’m really sorry you had to deal with that kind of behavior. I’ll take a look at the match and follow up with any players who were negative and make sure appropriate actions were taken. I’m sorry to say, but when it comes to the placement of this penalty, I don't have great news. I won’t be able to reduce this for you, but I want to take this time to provide you with context as to why this penalty has been applied and tips to prevent any future ones when faced with these types of games.\n\nAfter taking some time to look through your chat, it does look like there was quite a lot of typing. When queuing up for a match, we all have the same goal in mind and that's to get a win. Communicating with your teammates is absolutely critical in helping your team achieve victory but sometimes typing too much can be more of a hindrance - rather than helpful.\n\nIf other players are causing issues in your game, please do make liberal use of your mute function. Players often forget how powerful this simple feature can change the course of the match.\n\nShort phrases like:“Ult soon, ward dragon”, \"Catch somebody out there, wait with me\", are really effective and get straight to the point. In addition, I'd suggest using smart pings and emotes when you need to communicate quickly. The less time we spend in chat, the more time we can think about executing a plan of action.\n\nso in short... I was suspended from chat.. Not for being negative. But, instead i was punished cause i type to much. \n\nThe frick?\nIn-Game\nF1uttershy2075: bg muting team and pings\nF1uttershy2075: you feed two early kills and then blame us for your bad mistakes and being behind?\nF1uttershy2075: we agreeing to surrender at 15?\nF1uttershy2075: muting team and pings then .. just farming\nF1uttershy2075: no idea how you are suppose to climb out of bronze this season\nF1uttershy2075: he's int feeding along with this zyra. just let it go not worth it\nF1uttershy2075: dude you didn't even get one support item\nF1uttershy2075: ...\nF1uttershy2075: nuff said\nF1uttershy2075: no we need to click yes on surrender\nF1uttershy2075: meh we got 2 int feeders just pls win and not be toxic\nF1uttershy2075: not really just int feeding zyra and yi are broken\nF1uttershy2075: i don't deserve this team.. jesus.. christ.. i hate ranked this season\nF1uttershy2075: of course the duo queue votes no.\nF1uttershy2075: pretty sure the zyra and yi are\nF1uttershy2075: same.. just these two int feeders made it impossible to even try to carry\nF1uttershy2075: its just what ever.. just report them after. sucks that riot won't do any thing about people making throw away accounts to troll\nF1uttershy2075: Yas hush..\nF1uttershy2075: seriously got a jungle that was handing you kills with this support\nGame 2\nIn-Game\nF1uttershy2075: i'm done\nF1uttershy2075: muting team and pings bg\nF1uttershy2075: grats on your win\nF1uttershy2075: wouldn't sweat it nasus you easily won that lane.. gj\nF1uttershy2075: ok i'll bite how is his account getting banned?\nF1uttershy2075: honestly i'd care.. but malz is just trolling .. i'm done with this match\nF1uttershy2075: what kinda sucks is now i see why its so dang hard to get out of bronze from iron.. every other game you got a troll in it\nF1uttershy2075: honestly ashe chill..\nF1uttershy2075: games pretty much over.. just focus on working on your CS\nF1uttershy2075: ashe pls chill out\nF1uttershy2075: sorry nasus i refuse to give out a perfect game\nF1uttershy2075: other then that you easily got the win GJ on countering him\nF1uttershy2075: don't worry about it..\nF1uttershy2075: ashe chill\nF1uttershy2075: i'm going to enjoy reporting malz i really am\nF1uttershy2075: you know all stuff aside if malz wasn't purposely trolling we could have easily won this\nF1uttershy2075: not really just is when you get to free farm\nF1uttershy2075: BG\nGame 3\nIn-Game\nF1uttershy2075: yea i'm done muting team and pings\nF1uttershy2075: better team i suppose\nF1uttershy2075: bg  grats on your win\nF1uttershy2075: seriously who voted no..\nF1uttershy2075: i'm trash ..\nF1uttershy2075: you literally lost 3 kills to a riven top lane..\nF1uttershy2075: you know what nvm.. i'm not even going to deal with thi s. back to muting you guys\nF1uttershy2075: we have to win to throw","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2020-01-23T03:51:43.442+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if you actually muted when you said you were muting, you wouldn't have this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"F1uttershy2075","date":"2020-01-23T03:55:34.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"team was muted.

I was ADC and my Senna support kept taking CS, literally purposely denying me farm by last hitting whatever I was trying to kill. Then flaming me and calling me names, etc.\n\nI lost my cool and called him a \"fking moron\" and then these 2 spent the rest of the game flaming me, then they campaigned in /all chat to 9x report me.

They had me if they got enough reports on me.  \n\n3 games later I got hit with the restriction and my honor is back to level 1. Damn.\n\nOh well. On the plus side, after the punishment I've won every game and already got through the 10 game restriction.

It's a real test of patience and I'm sure we aren't alone in the normally chill players who lose their patience and their cool and then get hit with punishments.\n\nI just hope to hit Honor 2 before clash starts.

It's difficult for a computer to tell whether one person just dislikes someone and reports them or if the talking was truly disruptive. If multiple people who are not partied up make a report, the algorithm can assign it a higher probability of being disruptive. It takes no more system resources.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Happy Mustache","date":"2020-01-23T13:25:26.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is my opinion and what I suspect.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2020-01-23T13:09:34.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"jesus...{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}\n\nwhat kind of mental gymnastics do you have to pull off to think a multi-million dollar, international company is straight up lying to the players on their own support page? \n\nwow...just wow","replies":[{"poster":"Happy Mustache","date":"2020-01-23T13:16:33.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I believe they are doing it with good intentions.","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2020-01-23T13:18:02.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"literally makes **ZERO SENSE**\n\ni explained it in my other response to you","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LeafieGreens2","date":"2020-01-23T04:04:54.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7WLh7l1A,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2020-01-23T03:58:39.135+0000)\n>\n> Not a factor at all.

We're not asking you. You were the one who asked us. And we are telling you that you broke the rules. Whining in chat about \"bg\" is indeed offensive and against the rules. Stating that you're going to mute someone is annoying and against the rules. Most of your behavior in chat was negative and rule-breaking.\n\nYou certainly can voice your opinion, but Riot can also hand out consequences for it if you do it on their platform in a way that breaks their rules.\n\nMost of your time chatting was spent flaming. Being silent instead of saying positive things doesn't remove the negative things.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you think of your punishment or the rules or any of this, because LoL is owned by Riot and not you. If they tell you not to behave in a certain way or you'll get punishments up to and including losing your account, that's what's gonna happen.
