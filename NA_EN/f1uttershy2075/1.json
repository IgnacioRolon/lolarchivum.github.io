As others have already pointed out, there are many pitfalls to IP bans as well as easy ways to get around them.  A better solution would be to require phone numbers and two factor authentication.  That is, you need to provide an active mobile number, and each time you log in, you need to provide a key that is sent to the mobile number.  It adds a few seconds to the login process, but it drastically improves security since your password cannot be bruteforced, but it also creates a realistic limit on account creation AND makes it harder to sell accounts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2020-01-22T02:49:13.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"They need players, even the bad ones, since they've lost a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2020-01-22T02:51:56.733+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nea104,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=iLIyRVIp,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2020-01-22T02:49:13.882+0000)\n>\n> They need players, even the bad ones, since they've lost a lot.\n\nLeague of Legends has 8 million daily concurrent players.
