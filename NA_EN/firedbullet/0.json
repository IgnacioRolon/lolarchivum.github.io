Nothing in this game is balanced i swear to god they are focusing on chat when that inst even the problem in the game because deserved to be yelled at so they feel like they failed so they can improve on what the failed on.  Another reason the game is shit is because you need to play 100games to get a 6300 champ so you basicly want us to pay for a 4800 or a 6300 cause it isnt fun playing the same champ until level 30 to get a 6300champ if you win 100games you get level 30 and so you only have enough for 1 champion for 100 games. This game is full of shit and can continue RIOT YOU LITTERLY HAVE 100000000 enployies and cant do shit for the company ,but dota have like 10 and they can keep up to your shit game please fix your crap","replies":[{"poster":"catastrophicSkil","date":"2016-08-30T22:50:12.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"akali vayne and jhin are not OP\n\nVlad needs a nerf on his healing not too much just a slight tune down\nZed has always been a problem champ \n\nDota sucks","replies":[{"poster":"firedbullet","date":"2016-08-30T22:53:41.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"akali can ult auto 1 kill and can do that again in another 2seconds","replies":[{"poster":"firedbullet","date":"2016-08-30T22:55:23.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vayne to srong get 2 items at 18min you kill anyone and can snowball free win and jhin litterly zones early no hope for csing","replies":[{"poster":"Akenero","date":"2016-08-31T06:36:27.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And you litterly need to learn how to spell.
