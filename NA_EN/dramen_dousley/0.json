When i open it, it says \"Rads error: Couldnt connect to the http servers. Please make sure youre connected to the internet.\"\n\nThere are numerous fixes on the internet, but nothing worked so far. Anyone else getting this issue?\n\nHere's what i tried so far: -Running as admin, -dnsflush, -setting my dns to the google ones, -some weird fix that included a windows data (hosts file), rebooting my PC/router\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: Small update guys. It actually fixed itself? It was really late yesterday, so i gave it a go today morning and it worked fine, like nothing ever happened. Sorry that i probably can't contribute to the debate anymore, but please share your experiences as well, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-21T15:18:19.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The error message here might be a little confusing, because the issue might actually be with your client not having permission to load properly.

I installed the patch about 6 hours ago; opening LoL now always triggers said error. Restarting my pc surprisingly solves the issue until I close the client again, which leads me to think that it has something to do with windows 10 and some of the local files they create while computer is operating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SerpentHole","date":"2016-09-21T13:10:33.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the same issue, i installed the patch yesterday and it worked fine until i tried to open the game just a few minutes ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jokahn","date":"2016-09-21T12:41:33.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same issue.
