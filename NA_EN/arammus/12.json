As well, you should also add a note, specifying what you thought was the sexist or otherwise offensive.\n\nIf there are any questions about this action, please feel free to reach out to us on the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Real Sexy Yoona","date":"2018-04-13T01:51:51.918+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all, my sincere sympathies for your friend Jennifer. \nHere is my answer to your question:\n\nSystematically, sexism might be a lot harder to detect due to it's broader usage in context to any conversation. In the other hand, the category of what's acceptable while using Racist terms is very narrow or non-existent. In fact, saying racist things (especially the N word) might be one of the fastest way to get banned or suspended in League. \n\nSocially, it's quite the phenomenon. People get so mad over someone saying the N word in public, regardless of it's context. (ex. fortnite streamer Ninja accidentally saying the N word while rapping) Yet, nobody seems to hold anything against the music industry that uses the word Bitch casually. Society has somehow accepted the word Bitch to be okay even though it's a derogatory term directed towards females. I'm in no way undermining the severity of saying the N word, however I am hinting towards a questionable mindset that gets worked up over the N word while being completely fine saying bitch or other words that objectify and dehumanize females. \n\nI guess it all boils down to words lacking intrinsic value. Like how the word \"purple\" means nothing to a person born blind. Humans give meaning and value to words. And somehow we as humans tolerate the vulgar words of sexism more than the vulgar words of racism. \n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Brain ErrÃ¶r 404","date":"2018-04-13T02:23:49.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I find the N word even more hilarious.

I get the idea of throwing them all out- or in this case protecting yourself against the problems that may happen if you do certain things, the option being to not indulge in eggs that could lead to rotten outcomes.

The people with the usernames that are getting picked on for whatever reason are passive, they made a name they enjoyed to give them more immersion or etc doing something every other user has a right to do- create a name that they want to be known as.

Fixation on ones gender is disturbing and to a certain point I'll call it toxic. Imagine being in public and experiencing the crap people say, it would not fly!\n\nedit- Unless you're a friend, you need to treat strangers with respect. Honestly though, it seems many of the people who resort to sexism vs total strangers have some kind of social issues who do not understand how it is from our point of view. Then they try to add you after talking crap about pimping, making sandwiches, and other stuff {{sticker:sg-lux-2}} ","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-04-13T00:09:26.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like we are on the same page....\n\n> Sexism=Toxic though\n\nFully agree, but the problem is the system seems to care more about random minorities then an ENTIRE SEX OF PEOPLE.
