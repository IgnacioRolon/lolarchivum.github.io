Also the fact that's it's % max health true damage is a little ridiculous. I would accept %current HP true damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2018-04-28T23:32:50.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=36dduEnA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-28T23:28:44.072+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3143}} does more against just about any marksman that has any crit.\n> \n> 40 less armor and 400 more hp + 20% less crit damage adds up to more EHP in most cases, plus it has the active slow.\n\nAgreed, IDK why anyone would pick FH over it if they have 0 mana. The 55% slow should never be understated.
