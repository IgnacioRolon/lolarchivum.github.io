If so, it'd be like the other 1 pure damage ticks, which are not in place to give assists, but instead to draw said turret aggro and disrupt overly safe diving mechanics, such as Trundle Pillar (when he tanks up hardcore) or Zilean Bombs (extremely safe poke with next to no chance of aggro without damage on land).\n\nOn the other hand, if Bard doesn't draw tower aggro on ulti, it's not damage, and DH is actually procced on non-damaging spells.
