He may have a reputation for carrying, but it is completely undeserved. Of the numerous times I've seen him played, most of the time he's done exactly nothing for his team. He only works when the enemy are REALLY bad, or have a hilarious amount of cc between the 4 laners.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-04T02:01:52.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is overpowered in really low ELO, and really bad in high ELO.\n\nHe is a duelist with high mobility and no CC, any team that can ward and/or CC him will win easily.. Ones that cant make him fed.\n\nPlaying him requires you to be better than the people you are steamrolling so you can exploit their (lack of)  map awareness and strategic errors, which is why you dont see him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-03-04T01:54:44.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol or the classic one you try to give advice and they say noon player get to diamond and I'll listen . There was this malz who wasn't the reason we lost it's his damage fell off. He should've been running transcedence and gathering storm . Builds void staff against a team who had 0 mr. Also had cdr boots and didn't have Moro ( flat magic pent) . But calls me a noob . Or hey I'm renekton I know I counter nasus but I'm gonna ban him.
