Makes sense.\n\nIn what, exactly, is the new one \"shit\"? In what did the old one excel at compared to this one?\nMind you, we're talking about the main client, not the ingame one. The client upgrade is the reason why we can have cool shit like: skin collection, ranked stats, new gamemodes on the fly, transitioning from one game mode to the other without leaving party, etc\n\nI'm really curious to know exactly what the old client did better.\n######The new client is noticeably more laggy because it's heavier. If that's the only thing the old one did better, then... yeah.","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2019-01-01T05:05:15.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk if youre trolling or serious lol but the new client was made by mordekaiser as both share a similar amount of bugs and error. \n\nsince im too lazy, https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/3TdcZLK4-its-frankly-an-embarrassment-how-bad-of-a-state-the-client-is-left-in have this link and enjoy.\n\nas vandiril and other said: old client was ugly and not the best, but at least it was able to do the most basic things correct.\n\nand one more thing: all the \"cool shit\" you mentioned is the type of stuff that bugs out half the time.\njust the fact that for 4 months straight it said i own wardskins i dont have and several ward skins i apparently owned more than 10 times.

I blame that one on my machine though.\nEverything else? Nope, doesn't happen.

Now that I think about it, there's one other bug that really messes with me sometimes. It's very rare, but annoying when happens. I had similar problems with the old client.\n\nSo far, most of the features work perfectly, except the Loot page.\n***\n> [{quoted}](name=Arammus,realm=EUW,application-id=EBBIvmVK,discussion-id=RhAlA5gT,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-01-01T05:05:15.863+0000)\n>\n> just the fact that for 4 months straight it said i own wardskins i dont have and several ward skins i apparently owned more than 10 times.

We can't both be right.\n***\n> [{quoted}](name=Arammus,realm=EUW,application-id=EBBIvmVK,discussion-id=RhAlA5gT,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-01-01T05:05:15.863+0000)\n>\n> and new gamemodes on the fly? dont make me laugh you seem to be stuck in season 7 lol\n\nThe technology is there. Just because it isn't used, doesn't mean it can't be used. With the old client it was the latter.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
