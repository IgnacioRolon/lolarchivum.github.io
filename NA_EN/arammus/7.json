A lot of top laners don't know how to lane against her and she has ranged advantage on most of them.  At least early game until they build lots of MR.\n\nIn my elo a lot of people only build damage so it works :)\n\nI think building all of the same items is typically a troll build.  But at least it wasn't all tears.  This at least gives her AP. \n\nI played ADC Janna for fun once and we won.

The unique passive does not stack, yeah, but the rest of the stats still do (the purpose of that Yi build is to stack AS, MS, and Crit, which all 3 Zeal and PD provide, in this case of Ahri's build, it's to stack both CDR, AP, and Mana from Luden's; while utilising the item unique passive that's beneficial to the champs, Phantom Dancer's passive is ideal for Yi, Luden's passive is ideal for Ahri), albeit typically with varying results of inefficiency but not outright unviable, hence a troll build.\n\n.....\n\nThis Ahri based on other descriptions, isn't really a troll player themselves it would seem, just someone curious enough to try a troll build while trying to make it work.\n\nThat reminds me of the couple days earlier where I was trying AD Ryze because I wanted to run into fight to root someone and AA them to death. The builds didn't work out that well, though.","replies":[]}]}
