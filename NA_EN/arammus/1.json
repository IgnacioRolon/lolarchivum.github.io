If, for instance, the enemy has a Janna shield on them, the first phase would leave them with only the amount of health the shield had. Then, it would start to deal larger and larger amounts of true damage in order to finish the job. It doesn't start at dealing 9999999 damage, it only increases to that amount if the target doesn't die quickly.
