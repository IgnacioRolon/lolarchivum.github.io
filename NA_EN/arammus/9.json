A person who has a poor mentality and blames others for their mistakes is certainly in the wrong. And they should be stopped, or as a last resort, muted. I'm with you on this.\n\n2. Twisting a persons words back on them or pointing blame back at them will most likely make them angry and escalate the situation. This is objectively true.\n\n3. Angering a person does the opposite of stopping them from flaming. When the person reacts and the situation escalates, it is obvious that our efforts failed to stop them flaming.\n\n4. Thus it is perfectly logical to not use the same method in the future when faced with a similar situation. Provided that you genuinely want that player to \"stop flaming.\"\n\nThere are much better methods for \"stopping a flamer\" than what the OP did. Additionally, what OP did made things worse. So yes it is my opinion that what the OP did was wrong, but it is a well-founded opinion that is backed up by solid reasoning.\n\nIf one genuinely wants their teammate to stop flaming, then they should probably switch from ineffective methods and instead use more effective ones.
