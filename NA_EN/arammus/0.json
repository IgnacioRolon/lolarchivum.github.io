The hitbox and the range indicator are not the same thing.  If the projectile hits your hitbox, the skillshot connects.  What they've changed in the case of Jhin is they've made the range indicator slightly shorter for Jhin and slightly longer for the enemy.  The effect of this is that it minimizes the negative feeling of being Jhin and missing someone whose hitbox is ambiguously close to the full range and the negative feeling of being an enemy hit by Jhin when you thought you were out of the projectile range but were actually 1 pixel within it.

What Subdue stated is true. Riot has these slightly different skill shot indicators not to piss anyone off, but to minimize negative feelings when the player's perception was off by an extremely small amount.\n\nFeel free to argue that it's not worth it, but Riot doesn't have this difference just for the sake of pissing off the player. Quite the opposite.\n\n> 2. How is this in any world still justifiable?

A skillshot should again, look and feel the same for both players.\n\nGames are filled with these. Did you know 20% crit doesn't actually mean 20% crit every shot? The first shot has a much lower chance of a crit then it steadily builds up until you crit.\n\nProgramming around player emotions is part of a game developers job as well.\n\nHeck, if you've played XCOM (the remake, not the really old one) they lie about the percentages. They intentionally made your chance to hit often higher than what was listed because people would get unreasonably upset with the game when they miss shots that had 85% or so.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, consider this skillshot indicator range difference another aspect of the skill ceiling. If you're skilled enough you should know that your skillshot will still hit when it's slightly past the indicator range.\n\nThis thread just serves as another testament to why the developers rightfully dislike posting on the boards. Not only did the OP falsely paraphrase the intention of the design decision, they also used an incorrect term that wasn't even part of the design choice (OP claimed it was the hitboxes that were affected instead of the indicator).

They allow for intellectual mastery, whereby a player can see a state in the game, and make a powerful reaction that has a clear impact. They also create room for us to push strengths. Healing champions would need to be much more limited in a world without GW, for example. Most champions on their own don’t push the need for a release valve, but when comps can stack similarly sharp characters, release valves allow opponents a way to deal with dramatically skewed power. \n\nYou see, they think they can give everyone some kind of special treatment and let them \"feel powerful\" and make a balanced game at the same time, obviously doesn't work.

It's not supposed to. What its meant for is to create times when you miss a CS because that minion had 105 HP, took 30 damage, and you only have 74 ad. So you miss the minion (and it immediately dies to an in-flight minion attack landing after your auto) and miss out on 21g. \nThat 21g means it takes 10 seconds longer for you to back to get a long sword; 25 or so to get an Amp tome, if the rest of your farming is unaffected. \nThat lost time means having lower stats than you would normally - 13 AD on a marksman, or 3AD and 12% aspeed - which means you might miss 2 or 3 more minions because of it, slowing down the rate at which you gain gold. it's more of a mid-game nerf than an early one, in terms of champ v champ combat (very early, you havent lost significant gold and 3 ad will almost never influence the result of trades in lane. Very late, and you bought items already and even if your 'late game' is 20 seconds later than it was before, it's still only 3AD weaker.)","replies":[{"poster":"GonahtanuGepardi","date":"2019-12-20T22:02:21.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The effectiveness of those 3 ad nerfs changes though when the champion is a sheen user like corki.

The first post I agree with and makes sense, it acts slightly as a buffer to give a player a hit when they thought it might be a miss and this is specifically with the caster's indicator only. The second post actually seems like he's saying the exact opposite, where the actual range is slightly between the two shown, and that the caster's indicator is actually longer than the missile length??? \n\nAlso, I disagree with the statement \"Enemies who see ground indicators expect to be safe when they're 'almost outside'\". If I see a ground indicator I only expect to not be hit if I'm fully outside that indicator. If he had said partly outside I could understand, but almost outside is a ridiculous thing to expect.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreaktastic","date":"2019-12-21T18:12:41.625+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The statement is from someone with a technical mind. There is no \"partially\", nor is there \"almost\" in programming. Either the character capsule is in, or it's out. Period. No question, no exceptions. Visually, a character can have its feet outside of the line, yet their collision capsule can still be in range (and thus can be hit by Jhin's ult projectile). THAT is what he's referring to. \"Almost outside\" would mean they player THINKS they are outside, yet the collision capsule is still inside.\n\nIf the range indicator is slightly smaller for Jhin and his allies, and slightly larger for the enemy team (which is the case -- the screenshotted posts are typos, you can test it with friends in a custom game to validate), it inherently means that if their FEET are outside of the indicator, the character capsule will not be hit. Whereas if the indicator was exactly the same for everyone, moving to what appears to be outside of the indicator line may not actually be outside of it. Collision capsules are very often wider than the span of feet, and a good deal (2-3 times) larger in regards to forward/backward from the feet. When you account for armor and other visuals (think Garen) the capsule can be a great deal larger than where the feet are.\n\nOP does not understand the first thing about game mechanics. This is 100% industry standard, exists in every game, and is nothing new. It's a GOOD thing to do. It provides a small but crucial visual buffer to allow someone to visually KNOW where they need to stand to not get hit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l Ryden l","date":"2019-12-20T20:53:39.940+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"Okay and?\n\nThis post is written as if the employee was guilty for behavioral misconduct ( using words like, \"employee intentionally clearly admitted X Y Z to fuck with you.\" ) when really the Rioter was being transparent and explaining the reasons behind their design choices.
