(mainly cause the pure hatred i felt when i read this change isnt satisfied with you dying)\ni just hope the worst things possible happen to you.\ni hope you feel so much pain and sadness this year that even in death your soul will suffer more than i can imagine.\n\nwords or actions cant describe the insane hatred i feel for a person who goes \"lets give him x2 x5 times the damage ON AN ASSASSIN\"\nnothing i could ever say or do to you or anything you love could bring out my hatred for you.\ni am dead fucking serious. i hate you more than the person who killed one of my best friends years ago. yup im going this personal.\n\nalso to \"end this thread on a positive note\"\ni want to thank you aswell: the first patch of 2020, and its most likely the worst one this entire year.\ntheres only a handful of things i can imagine that would be worse but none of them will ever happen (like increasing rengars jump damage by 200%)\nso thank you. you made it so that even if you sit on my face and fire a load of diarrhea down my throat, it will be better than how you started this year off.\nthank you :) thank you for caring and for listening.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-02T09:21:51.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruh, that's his shield, not damage.
