I reached level 30 and duo qued ranked, my friend played support and I was adc. It was my second ranked match ever and the game was going really good. I was 10-0 in lane and was having a really happy attitude. Mid lane fed, flamed and said gg for the whole game. We ended up losing because of the mid laner. Anyways I was wondering if this would effect me getting placed, if you carry but you lose does it effect where you&#039;re getting placed in a negative way?\r\n\r\nPlease help, I think this thread would help others in the future too :)\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"no dad stop","date":"2015-05-26T05:01:32.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're judged by your win/loss ratio only, it has nothing to do with your performance. Losing is losing, winning is winning no matter how well or terrible you did.\nProtip: One team mate can't lose you a game (at least outside of high level play). You'll learn this as you play more.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-26T08:17:18.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not entirely accurate, it is based alot off of your win loss but not the sole factor, lots of small things factor in, but win loss is, to public knowledge the biggest chunk","replies":[]}]}]}
