His 4 second Q is nice mobility for the battlefield. His W burst is great for focusing down squishies. And his R makes his a tanky beast. The only way he's bad at teamfights is if you buy 5 damage items.","replies":[{"poster":"Chuck Charles","date":"2015-09-17T08:19:17.756+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's decent in teamfights but that's not his strength as he is a fighter who cannot be the one to initiate or jump in first. even with a few tank items you will still blow up relatively faster than a tank cuz you built trinity/bork(or gunblade). his ult gives him a lot of tankiness and you build a lot of health, but he still is relatively not the uber tank that can withstand a focus of all the team. however, if you act as cleanup duty once the fight starts...you can get easy pentas. most of my triple kills playing this game have been as jax. \n\nhis late game is as stated...godly. you can literally 1 v 5 against certain comps and you're dueling power is just ridiculous. they need to send at least 3 people to take you down and if you are fed that might not be enough. If you get 3 dmg items and 2 tank with tanky boots you are pretty damn scary in fights where they cannot instantly delete you. I've had games where I have trinity, bork, gunblade, visage, randuins, boots. and lemme tell ya. he is a god. any extended trade jax will win outright by default because his sustain is unmatched and his power only gets stronger the longer a fight goes. his cooldowns are insanely short come late game. even the E is short considering what it does.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-09-16T23:44:08.505+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"I laughed out loud when he said that.
