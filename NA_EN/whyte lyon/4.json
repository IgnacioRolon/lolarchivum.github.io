When Shurima Empire wasn't even built, how can he say they were developed? Even before the empire, did \"shurimans\" have another country or others just sucked really bad? I mean, it means if Aurelion Sol saw the peak/prime time of Shurima he would be impressed.","replies":[{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2018-10-06T09:49:57.622+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aurelion was talking about Targon, not Shurima.

Lo and behold, a massive Sun Disc is under construction. The poor enslaved laborers beat their heads and rend their clothes in my wake. Their cruel masters see me, a streaking bolt of fire, as a portent of good omen, no doubt. My passing will be etched in their uncouth pictograms upon common stone, an homage to the great comet, the blessing of the sky-god gracing their holy works and so forth. The Disc’s sole purpose is to funnel the sun’s majesty into the most “renowned” of these fleshy humanoids, transforming them into exactly what this planet needs: more insufferable demigods. This effort will undoubtedly backfire. But I suppose they might last a brief while, perhaps a thousand years or so, before they fall and are supplanted by others.\n\nwe clearly see he describes Shurima, with enslaved laborers and many others.","replies":[{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2018-10-06T13:11:13.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> In a vast stretch of desert, I feel the twinge of familiar magic emanating from the seat of the premiere civilization amongst these savages.\n\nHere he feel the celestial magic of the Sun Disc, as you said, Aurelion is familiar with Targon, thats why he calls the celestial magic familiar. Celestial magic emanate from the celestial realm, where the seat of Targon is located.\n\nI agree that the rest of the quote is about Shurima, but now that I explained it better, can you see why I think that the \"premiere civilization\" is Targon?","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-10-06T14:24:44.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...
