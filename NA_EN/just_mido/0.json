I know its about getting the best talent to win and what not. But isnt that a bit discouraging for our challenger players? Like if teams could have 5 korean players do you think they would? It just sucks for they high elo players having the dream to make it big when theres a korean player who probably can play it better. Idk how do we know that these players aren&#039;t great if we don&#039;t  give them a chance?\r\nFor me i like watching and playing this game but when we see pro teams just full of outside players whats the inspiration to continue to play? Not saying in good at all im just trying to see the game from a different prospective. We don&#039;t see korean teams looking on the na solo q ladder....","replies":[{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2016-12-16T18:33:38.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the Koreans and then everyone else.

To me the import/international players forced the domestic players to improve to compete. \n\nI think Huni coming to NA was the best thing to ever happen to the NA LCS.  Our top lane was an unbelievable shit show before huni started man handling people making them improve.  Bjergson with mid is a little questionable because it seems to be the #1 imported slot for the region, but I do think directly after he transferred we saw improvements in the domestic mid laners.","replies":[{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2016-12-17T03:25:53.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What domestic mid-laners are improving?

Pobelter has always been fun to watch and is a NA player, but he&#x27;s the only domestic NA mid that is fun to watch.\n\nI recognized that by far mid lane is the most imported slot in our region.  People who watched NA LCS pre-bjergson should remember how bad our mid lane game play was.  You had people like shiptur who had an insane KDA because he never did any thing except wave clear and afk at turret for 20 minutes before taking 0 risks in team fights.  Then you had the exact opposite in Reginald where he would suicidially make plays that he hoped would work out.  It's harder to point to specific players, but I do think the mid lane as a whole improved dramatically.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2016-12-17T03:27:33.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yasu Yoru,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=UXt6hxh6,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-12-17T03:25:53.506+0000)\n>\n> What domestic mid-laners are improving?

Barring fenix, it's full of non-import mids as teams would rather use their import slots on adc's and jg's.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-12-16T21:32:11.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Killing the game? No.\n\nThere is some truth to the idea that not taking top players from NA soloq kills the incentive for players not in the LCS already to play as hard as they can.\n\nLike at the end of last season when they offered a free jacket to anyone in challenger and suddenly Master and Challenger were way more competitive then they had been. Now if people did all that work for a jacket imagine what they would do if people were giving away high paying LCS slots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jax Cramer","date":"2016-12-16T12:52:32.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well to be fair, imports are the only reason NA managed to \"compete\" internationally. Until Season 4 NA never managed to make it out of groups at worlds (unless they were already seeded in the qfs, then they would lose there immediately).\n\nThey still have never gotten past quarters at worlds or ever won a box series (or a group) but atleast they had 3 teams making it out of groups since Season 4 while they had 0 before Season 4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2016-12-16T09:33:04.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once Upon a time The NA region did give the Challenger scene a chance at the LCS and NA didn't really started to import players etc it was way back during the 2009-2012 years where we just stunk even at All Stars NA was the laughing stock and still are today for that matter.  \n\nWhile I do agree that the LCS/NA does seem less and less NA at the same time I look outside my window and realize I'm in America AKA the Melting pot of the world so for a game to have foreign players never really bothered me BUT I do understand where you are coming from.  \n\nDiscipline is really the reason why teams are trying to go for these humble- work hard Korean players instead of these want,want,want NA players.  NA has talent Natural born talent but once certain things become an issue and certain objects come into play the talent is no more.  Look at QTPie that dude has talent and I would bank on him winning and performing more so than say 75% NA players in the LCS to do well either put up better stats or win more games but yet he doesn't come back why because of $.  \n  While NA talent is creating \"dank memes\" other regions are creating a new \" META\" for NA to follow.  \n\nAt the end of the day NA in reality won't win or do much of anything other than be a viewer of what they can't ever seem to reach for in the LCS!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2017-01-04T00:27:16.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"and they still donÂ´t amount to anything internationally - I think Korean dominance shows mainly one thing: a good coaching staff and managment is a lot more important for a team than individual talent. \nSo it would do NA a lot more good to scout at home and bring teams together for some long-term investment i think than just buying a new Korean every season and then doing fine one split only and still going down internationally.","replies":[]}]}
