When I did so, i bought a tiamat and the components for the ravenous hydra, but the tiamat didnt show up in my inventory, although the gold was removed. I recalled after farming some more and noticed that I didnt have a tiamat, so I went to buy it again, and the same thing happened again. At this point im frustrated beyond belief, and so i farm 3000 gold and go back and buy the ravenous hydra straight up, and it works well enough until I recalled and went into shop to change it into the other tiamat item, where i got neither the ravenous hydra nor the other item, and my ravenous hydra dissapeared without the option to undo what I had just done in the shop. At this point, the bug had cost me 5950 gold and almost lost me the game because it made me literally useless. Please Please Please disable and fix this item.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-11T21:47:55.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Bjergsen Bot,\n\nThanks for the report!
