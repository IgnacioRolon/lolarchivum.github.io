Calm down guys, its not the first time you seen a girl and there&#039;s TONS of girl twitch LoL players. And stop blaming her for any bad plays or why the game lasted an hour. Its not her fault, both teams in general played high defense looking for an opening on one another, not every team is super aggressive ending the game in 25-30 mins like an SKT","replies":[{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-01-17T10:08:21.876+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude just dont. this is twitch chat. if they show someone dying on cancer i bet over 50% would still spam \"haha this is what you kids get one day\" there is no hope for twitch chat.\nLoL streams are the only ones where i usually turn the chat off","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2016-01-17T13:32:10.239+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why you go to the official Riot site.

There were too many times when he was unnecessarily in front of the team at tower points soaking up needless damage and constantly popping his ult, just to stay alive.  And those were not even engagements.  I'll give him a pass on the flubbed combos, because it was his first experience int he NA LCS infront of a huge crowd.  But the repetitive damage soaking that shouldn't happen is a glaring weakness.  I guarantee teams are going to target him in the future because of this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Angelofchaos16x","date":"2016-01-17T12:25:47.115+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"She posted on twitter after the match, saying that she was sorry that her plays were not the cleanest, because she was super nervous.
