To make this clear, I have NEVER in my life Afk in a game, even if were losing and someone is trolling with Nunu top i still stay because i do or DID enjoy this game very much. however i am finding it very hard to enjoy a game that falsely accuses me of things i did not do. it is tiring, i have very limited time to play the game so a 5 game 20 min wait basically makes it so that i can only play one to two games instead of 3-4. i wrote this hoping someone would read it but now that its coming to a conclusion i realize that riot definitely wont however if anyone in the community has any advice for me i would appreciate it. thanks, i don&#039;t know if this site is active or not but ig i will see now. also i must say you guys have done well with the new skins ( Sona and Yasuo especially)i was planning on picking a few up but idk now because idk if i will be able to ever use them when i cant get into a game :p","replies":[{"poster":"GrãñðmãstêrShãçø","date":"2018-09-15T12:03:16.172+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same stuff here, old client was waaaay more reliable","replies":[{"poster":"Thats unlucky 4U","date":"2019-01-24T17:37:48.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BogAnubis123,realm=EUNE,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=hXKZA3xi,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-15T12:03:16.172+0000)\n>\n> Same stuff here, old client was waaaay more reliable\n\nyeah its crazy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrulýSlothful","date":"2018-09-16T09:23:11.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this issue has been occurring a lot for me lately as well, and it's getting really damn annoying getting low priority queues for a reason that I didn't commit ","replies":[{"poster":"Thats unlucky 4U","date":"2019-01-24T17:38:24.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, its really annoying to deal with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EviLxNoPain","date":"2018-09-15T15:00:39.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here :((","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hooks Are Real","date":"2018-09-15T12:49:35.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem for like 7 months i beg u riot , i beg u deeply in my heart do something about it !
