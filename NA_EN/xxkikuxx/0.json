I got one reply saying that someone will help me. Still have no one helping me. I heard that the Riot Support team was quick and always helping people, but I think that's a lie now. So much for purchasing RP when you can't even use it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T05:52:19.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friend, I'm sorry to hear you had issues with your Prepaid RP Card. I'm sure that wasn't a great way to spend the holiday. Speaking of holidays, they've had us pretty slammed with support requests, so responses are a bit longer than what's considered *normal*. While it will take a bit longer than normal, I'm confident one of our billing specialists will reach back out just as soon as possible.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions. ^.^","replies":[]}]}
