This is not the first time, I have had this occur 10 maybe even 15+ times.\r\n\r\nAccording to the video my mouse changes for like 3 secs and the box does pop-up when it is closing, so it is impossible to accept.\r\n\r\nP.S. it occurs at 1:30 and I just got a 30 min penalty after that 6 min penalty...lets see how far I can go!\r\n\r\nUpdate I just got another recording of it and I lost 10 lp(did I lose lp for the 6 and 30 penalty, I don't even f*g care anymore), can not even press the \"Queue up\" button, and my heart has broken because of rito...here it is and all of it!
