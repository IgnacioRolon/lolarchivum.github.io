The problem is, I get lag spikes ONLY during team fights, and the longer the game lasts, the more intense the spikes get. While running around alone in lane, my ping is 28 MS. The second I engage in combat, it jumps anywhere from 115-500 MS. My framerate is always high, and doesn't change during the spike. I have tried changing my DNS server, as well as editing some of the network adapter settings, and changing some settings in gpedit. (it did help a tiny bit)\r\n\r\nHas anyone ever experienced this before? Is there a fix? \r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-17T20:37:55.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection seems to be degrading or experiencing packet loss.
