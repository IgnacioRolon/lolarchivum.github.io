So if you want to look at some more reasoning/analysis go watch the video.\n\nSo we all know Kled is Noxian folk hero, but where did he get all of this power to earn every accolade possible, and never back down in a fight (and he&#039;s fought in every campaign since the founding of Noxus). Yes, obviously Riot is making it quite clear that he is a folk hero and these might be exaggerated, but its confirmed he was around when Sion was too because he quotes saying he \"liked (Sion) better when (Sion) was alive\". \n\nHow does this get to Aatrox? Well after his confrontation with Aatrox Tryndamere mastered the barbaric ways and learned not to give up a fight just as much as Kled, even if it means death. Kled shows a lot of bloodlust through his sound barrier breaking screaming he does when he&#039;s fighting. When Aatrox showed up in the Protectorate vs Magelord war, he caused  &quot;The warriors to find themselves imbued with a potent thirst for battle. They followed Aatrox into the fray, each fighting with the furious strength of ten until they had won a most unlikely victory.&quot;. \n\nNow we saw a scene of Kled fighting dozens of noxian soldiers, &quot;with the furious strength of ten&quot;, in the reveal Riot put out. We also know that there are OLD tales in Noxian war poems Ezreal found that speak of a Darkin figure with a drawing of Aatrox. Kled is a very OLD yordle, said to have been around Noxus while it was being founded. He could have been around during the time that Aatrox made an appearance. \n\nObviously it&#039;s not 100% true, but i think its still a possibility","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-07-30T02:07:09.686+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"prob worth mentioning  Aatrox was the game designer's previous champ...

It always describes how they would feel if the met. And most of the champs selected to be taunted are lore \"related\" but a few are selected as easter eggs.   \n\nIf it seems really odd that a champ would know or have an interaction with a champ they have a taunt for... It's probably a joke about the metagame or a team-member who made it.   (Not always , we also hide some lore that players don't know yet.)\n\nI.e Jhin's has lines about Zed and Shen.   Illaoi has lines about Gangplank and the bilgewater champs. Those are lore focused - though some haven't occured in the narrative yet.  \nIllaoi's also has lines about Rek'Sai and Tahm Kench.  She mocks the \"design\" of Reksai (the game designer's previous champ) and Tahm's script ( ie myself).  Now  simultaneously it's possible that Illaoi could meet Rek'Sai in the future and quite possible she has encountered Tahm Kench in bilgewater-- and those lines accurately reflect how she would feel about them. Thus those lines weren't added to the VO script for lore reasons but are still true.\n\nMake sense?\n\n(Written on my fone plz ignore spelling and punctuation mistakes)","replies":[{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2016-07-30T18:39:18.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just love how Riots finally communicate with players other than articles and PBE..\nSo did you just confirm that Aatrox's rework is coming in the very late future?

So when Kled's taunting Aatrox that's not saying he's ever met or even knows about Aatrox, but the VO gives an indication of how Kled might react to that champion, while also being a nice inside joke for you rioters. I suppose that's the kind of leniency you can get when the gameplay isn't canon, it's all a \"what if\", even down to the VO.\n\nI imagine that it can get tricky to not go too overboard in making the taunts be too meta in that sense.

Also, as i mentioned before, Aatrox is friend of Tahmn Kench... and it would be a really bad move to give more power to an enemy of his friend. \n\n> \n> At your first point I can&#x27;t believe I would overlook that, but we don&#x27;t know Du Couteau age.

He wants to feed his appetite, and whether or not Aatrox would give a yordle power I don't think he would find too much of an issue with that.

This could be supported by the old JoJ, because a member of the Du Coteau Familly (Katarina) agrees with Noxus having yordles in their army.","replies":[{"poster":"YouCantClickThis","date":"2016-07-30T13:18:33.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ebonmaw Dragon,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BZwnm9L8,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-29T21:13:38.162+0000)\n>\n> The official page actually list them as Friends, Aatrox is not an acual demon and Kled knows that. \n> \n> Im pretty sure that Tahm would have problems with it after hearing that Kled dislikes Tahm and calls him a liar.\n> \n\nI know Aatrox is not an actual demon, I just said he shares characteristics of a demon. \n\nTahm's lore literally has less than 100 words, I just don't think you can assume such a heavy connection between them if he wasn't even mentioned in his lore.
