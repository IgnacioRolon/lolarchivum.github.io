They were resolved and I played a successful string of games where nothing happened and I was off the LeaverBuster.\r\n\r\nThis morning, I was trying to play Ivern and could not leave the fountain. When I went to reconnect, my team voted to remake after I asked them not to. Now I am on the LeaverBuster again for 10min. \r\n\r\nI find this incredibly unfair, as if you look at my history of League, I have almost NEVER left a game. Now, all of the sudden, I am having some weird computer issues and am getting shit on by League and the client for this? I understand that it is partially my fault for having the problems, but this feels so unfair. I am not doing this on purpose and have done everything I can to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nI do not want to get banned for having computer issues, when I can't afford a new one right now and am working with what I've got. It shouldn't cause too many more issues, but I don't want the leaverbuster nonsense to continue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T21:13:19.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of League issues on a mac can be connection related.   Getting stuck at loading does suggest a possible problem with your network staying stable enough to fully connect to the game server.  It's good to hear that it's solid when you are in-game, but it's got we need to check for blocks along the way.  To start off, run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  Test it out in a custom game and let me know how it goes.","replies":[{"poster":"FoHAge","date":"2017-01-28T22:53:08.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could my issue have anything to do with the league server today? They just sent out a notification that it's not just me.... And if so. Can I have my leaverbuster status returned to normal, because it's clearly some type of bug and i don't want to be penalized for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T22:58:44.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't able to alter game stats or leaverbuster penalties.  Even if there's server issues, an account would need to have a history of leaving to receive a leaverbuster penalty, and not just one game.  Since your issue was a bit ago I doubt it's part of the issues we're looking into currently.  Even if it was though I'd still recommend going over the guide just to be extra safe and sure.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T16:56:58.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you complete your required games, it's important to continue playing without leaving to continue moving your standing with [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) in a positive direction.

My computer just has an issue actually loading League. My load time is long, but my internet is great. Always 30-50ms and almost never lags during game at all.\n\nIt's just the load screen and time. I'm playing on a Mac, so IDK if that has much to do with it, but I am not actually leaving games, it's just a loading issue that sometimes d/c me from server and it takes me about 4min to reconnect. But nobody waits, so they FF right away =/.","replies":[]}]}]}
