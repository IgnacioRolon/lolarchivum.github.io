Some times i can play whole games normaly , otther times from a moment to annother  the ping will just go all the way up to 200-900 , or even 2k out of nowhere. Sometimes it will just stop at 500Ms , and when that happens it will freeze in a \"infinite\" \"Attemping to reconect\" Screen , and i have to reload the game myself , even tought most of the times when this happens it won't even allow me to connect to the game again. \r\nThis is extremely annoying , and only started a few days ago. I'm sure that the problem is not my internet conection. Everything else works normaly , even during the lag spikes , and i still can play normaly otther games , even the ones that require a better connection than Lol.\r\n \r\nSo , what can i do to solve this ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-02T18:10:51.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, it sounds like your network is having a super tough time.  Your description sounds like packet loss to outright loss of comms to the game server.  Though your internet seems to work fine, you can still have blocks and issues reaching specific services like the game server.  You should go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and fix up any blocks.
