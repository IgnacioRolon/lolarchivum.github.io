Not usually about myself (I'm ugly enough to be comfortable in my skin), but I'm pretty protective of the Narrative discipline, so when some of the finest people I've ever known are accused of being various things, it does get to me a bit, I won't lie. However, I know where those mistakes come from: a love of LoL from you, and a lack of visibility from us.\n\nThere is only so much visibility we can provide while still maintaining our ability to do what we do and, which is completely their choice, some people just prefer to be a bit more private.\n\nWe can still do better though, and I know we, and I, have been trying to do so.\n\nIn the spirit of visibility, I was having a chat with someone who frequents these boards via DMs a while back (before my recent absence from here), about a variety of things that he was most gracious in keeping private. One of those things was a fun creative exercise I wanted to do with everyone on the boards (but haven't been able to, I'll do so tomorrow. Oh bugger, I just saw the time. Ok, later today).\n\nAnother topic that he called me on was the lack of understanding about leadership on Narrative, and I've seen some folks say there isn't any leadership, which is, of course, incorrect. The gentleman in question also said that there's a certain history (that I wasn't completely aware of, to be honest) on these and the previous boards of having a name to attach certain things to about how things are developing on Narrative and lore.\n\nAs I've said before, Narrative doesn't do story alone, it helps make stories and characters for teams, so we don't ever decide things in a vacuum.\n\nHowever, the person in DMs, an absolutely passionate player, said I should clearly state that I'm the Narrative Lead on League of Legends, mainly because it would help with transparency for the long-attending members of the boards. So, I just did.\n\nWith that out of the way (I didn't say it specifically before that conversation because I didn't really think it was important), and with clarity of where I'm coming from, let me state categorically that every single member of the Narrative discipline works tirelessly to create awesome things for the players. We succeed or fail together, but it is always because we want you to continue to love this game and this world in the way that we do. In the way that your appreciation, your passion, and yes, even your anger sometimes, drives us further onward to do better. That never comes from a place of hate. \n\nEver.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-05-22T20:31:14.230+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"It has been a while!

I know you've read much of this before, but on the topic of secrecy, I'd like to take a moment to attempt to distill my essential requests regarding \"secrecy\" and what I see as important competing values.\n\nMy general tl;dr: would be:\n\n1. Please avoid disruptive retcons that break backwards compatibility. (e.g., don't smack down new lore declaring that Veigar is a mad scientist from Zaun who was never imprisoned and just discovered space-magic one day.) Try not to emulate the bulldozer that appears outside Arthur Dent's house at the start of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n2. If you feel that a disruptive retcon is truly necessary, at least give the community some chance to convince you otherwise, or to propose a compromise variant that breaks prior lore less. (e.g., if you really believe Veigar MUST be from Zaun, consider adding in something about Noxian agents abducting him from his lab, and him unleashing his space-magic for the first time to escape.)\n3. In the case of upcoming lore that does not involve a disruptive retcon, and this should be most lore, still consider soliciting community ideas where appropriate. (e.g., if you're simply adding in some lore about relations between Noxus and Bandle City, still consider asking the community for ideas about how those factions might get along.)\n\nI think these are pretty reasonable requests. Sometimes I'm concerned that Narrative believes the community is making some kind of outrageous demand for \"design by democracy\". In case such a misapprehension exists, I hope this post helps dispel it. My own view, and I've heard a lot of others in the community echo this sentiment, is simply that we don't like it when you go \"blank slate\" on established lore, and that we crave the kind of community involvement that has been a hallmark of Riot's development process in every other area.\n\nI've elaborated on these requests below.\n\n# Avoid major retcons presented as shock reveals with no prior community discussion\n**tl;dr: Community discussion is often helpful, but should be seen as absolutely crucial when Riot plans to make radical alterations to established lore.** (Speaking of radical alterations to established lore, they should be strongly disfavored. The focus should be on adding to the universe, not tearing up its foundations.)\n\n*See also: [this thread.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/1Bi3Xi6w-link-this-thread-next-time-narrative-makes-a-massive-change-with-no-prior-community-input)*\n\nThe enjoyment of fictional settings relies upon immersion, and using the imagination to make these fictional settings \"real\", consistent places. This also serves a functional purpose: a self-consistent setting allows community members to create their own stories, as traditional fiction, or roleplay, or artwork, or what-have-you.\n\nShock reveals that disrupt established lore damage both of these aspects, and are fundamentally alienating. Aesthetically, it is not fun to see a \"Word of God\" announcement telling you that the fictional reality you enjoy is \"not real anymore\". Of course, it was never \"real\" in a literal sense, but imagination had started to make it real in the community's minds. And there's a functional problem, too: such changes break \"backwards compatibility\" and destroy the foundations of prior works, whether canonical or community-created. If you remake Veigar into a mad Zaunite techno-mage, you break every prior Veigar story. Even worse, if you scrap Veigar's backstory and toss in only a vague placeholder about an angry yordle with a mysterious past who wields space-magic and might maybe be from Zaun, you both break past lore and block the development of future lore: you can't really write a story on a foundation of \"this character is dark and mysterious and could be connected to Zaun but also might not be.\" For all practical purposes, such a retcon would take Veigar \"out of play\".\n\nSome examples of what I consider to have been violations of this principle, which ought not be casually repeated:\n\n* **The Great Retcon.** I no longer consider it a fight worth fighting, but I will continue to protest the self-evident absurdity of retconning the League of Legends from the lore of League of Legends. I don't think the setting is better off without its most novel and interesting feature. Even if it were, I cannot imagine a more disruptive change.\n* **Skarner.** He misses missing his kind. :( Seriously, talk about a radical change: his backstory has been completely stripped away and replaced. For months now, the community has had no idea whether the Brackern are part of his story, or if he's going to be revealed to be some mutated Ascended monster, or what. Forget writing a Skarner story: I can't even try to  *empathize* with this character in the abstract while playing him. Every time he says something in-game, it now has a little bracketed (or so he might say, in the old lore) after it.\n* **The map.** The Black Mists lore somewhat haphazardly included the apparent erasure of the established map of Valoran. I do not see what purpose this served. It appears to break a lot of prior lore for no good reason. I seriously don't even know what the continent of Valoran looks like anymore. Not only was the map seemingly demolished, but nothing substantial has been put forward in its place. If you gave us some kind of sketch of new Valoran, we could at least transition over to that. Instead, all we know is what Valoran *doesn't* look like anymore.\n\nTo be clear, I'm talking about **disruptive retcons,** not additions to the lore that expand upon established foundations or introduce brand new elements. A story that talks about Garen's first battle, or exploring Lux's study of light magic before ~~joining the League~~ *wandering Valoran on a quest for vengeance,* is not a disruptive retcon. Community discussion might be salutary, but is not vital. In contrast, a new story that reveals that Lux is a Piltovian robot who has infiltrated Demacia really should not be slapped down without giving Lux fans (and others) some kind of a chance to speak up and at least propose ways to make this new Lux vaguely compatible with prior Lux lore.\n\nFor example, it seems Taric is slated for a rework. I think IronStylus deserves great commendation for starting a few threads about Taric, in which he and the community discussed the character and his essential thematic and visual attributes. I like to think that this helped IronStylus develop his ideas for Taric, and that whatever new Taric we get will be better for it. The new Taric is also more likely to be \"backwards compatible\", because so long as the new Taric aligns with the core elements of old Taric, it should be possible to smooth over more nuanced continuity glitches. For example, he probably won't be from another planet, but if the community thinks that it's important that he's something of an outsider, hopefully the new Taric will retain that element, and (e.g.) a story about Taric chastising mages for their hasty resort to destructive magic will still make sense, *mutatis mutandis.*\n\n# Where appropriate, try to bring the community into the early development process when making new lore\n**tl;dr: Even where no disruptive retcon is involved, the excitement of a surprise reveal should not always trump the benefits of the deep community involvement that has helped make League what it is today.**\n\nThis is more of a situational, \"if it makes sense in context\" kind of request, but I think it's an important one nonetheless.\n\nOne of League's greatest strengths, I would submit, is the high degree of community involvement. You'll see Morello and company showing up on the boards to have honest discussions about balance decisions and new mechanics. Before reworking a Champion's kit, for instance, devs might come by and start a thread asking for thoughts on what people think about that Champion, and gathering ideas for improvements. Then the devs go off and do their thing. It's not design by democracy, but it is design that's informed by community involvement, and I imagine most devs could read off a long list of ideas they've implemented that had origins in community proposals.\n\nThis certainly *has* happened in the lore context, though more rarely. For instance, I recall that the community didn't like the way Jayce's lore made Viktor out to be kind of a chump, and Runaan (I believe?) went back and revised Jayce's lore a bit to make it more balanced in that regard. Narrative has also had a few \"champ ideas\" threads, like **[this one by Carnival Knights.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/6EofhoHW-lets-talk-biographies)** My main issue with that thread was that it was *so* broad as to be kind of hard to get involved in. It wasn't clear which Champions were slated for a major rewrite, or if any were, so we were kind of taking shots in the dark. A long argument about why Veigar's lore should stay the same is kind of a waste of time if Riot never had any plans of changing his background in the first place. Still, it was a step in the right direction, and I'd like to see Narrative follow up on Carnival Knights' good work there with more such acts of meaningful community engagement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"John Berserk","date":"2015-05-22T11:56:29.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I'll tell you my frustration when it comes to the folks on this board: I can't show you what we want to do (and are doing) to answer many of your concerns.

You need to see them.\n> \n> I hope you like them when you do.\n\nThere's a difference between summing up someone's past, and giving us the scenic route through their present and future. The neat thing about the old League-based format, was that there was a concrete divide between \"then\" and \"now\"--you could tell us anything you wanted about a champion's past, and that wouldn't spoil what you could do with them later, because the point at which they became relevant was the point at which they became a champion in the League of Legends, at which point they were available as playable characters in a game that also happened to be called \"League of Legends.\"\n\nYou could have teaser comics, bios that do more than give us a brief glimpse at their basic character traits (since most of the time it's just the champion in a void--Vel'Koz, Bard, Kalista, Braum, Rek'Sai, Yasuo, Jinx [who we are told has a \"rivalry\" with Vi, but we never actually see any interaction], Amumu etc.--interacting with a nameless NPC we have no incentive to care about and will never see again), and every other sort of story vessel imaginable to paint a pretty picture of these characters and their rich histories, then continue to create a story where champions interact and establish relationships. You could do a quick setup, then sweep us off our feet because you no longer have to stay mum because there's a defined line between all the information you can freely give us (without us having to make up a story on our own, like a dog chewing on a bone), and stuff you're excited to surprise us with later.\n\nAll the events so far, all the lore snippets so far, and *especially* at the pace they're being delivered (glacial), are an odd combination of throwing out content that was already established and setting up content that will reach some sort of actual development \"Soon TM\". There's a pattern, here: introduce a faction we already know about, rewrite other characters so that they now \"fit\" in that faction and only have two sentences of canon lore to their name, establish the Big Players for that faction, release a champion that is proportionally much more powerful/influential than the other champions in that faction, then drop that story thread and do the same thing with a different faction 2 years later. If you're familiar with Pokemon, it's like using Dragon Dance on your Gyarados 5 times while your opponent Roars/Whirlwinds it out while you go for a 6th. You just lost 6 turns, man!\n\nBut to be honest, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't at least a little excited for the Bilgewater reboot we'll be seeing in 6 years. It might even get a nifty little storybook cinematic!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bresn","date":"2015-06-01T22:02:42.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How are you supposed to make any lore when the only thing we see is new champions with stories PACKED into them, and with champions broken like {{champion:24}} or loreless like {{champion:33}} ?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2015-05-20T21:30:22.660+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eyrgos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=p70VEgLh,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-20T21:18:36.775+0000)lore shipping\n\nUh\n\nCan you rephrase that?","replies":[{"poster":"Eyrgos","date":"2015-05-20T21:40:01.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Motajo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=p70VEgLh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-20T21:30:22.660+0000)\n>\n> Uh\n> \n> Can you rephrase that?\n\nDelivering lore to the players.","replies":[{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2015-05-20T21:41:16.891+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eyrgos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=p70VEgLh,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-20T21:40:01.918+0000)Delivering lore to the players.\n\nHeh, just making sure","replies":[{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2015-05-21T17:55:29.708+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"You know what I'm going to give you?\" I whispered in her ear.\nShe was almost in tears from anticipation - \"I don't want to wait any longer... please.\"\n\nAnd then I wrote her a 5000 word short fiction piece.
