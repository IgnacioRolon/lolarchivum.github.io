My game is not launching! I tried to open it this morning and it wouldn't open, even after several tries. Any advice on how to fix it (without absolutely killing my computer) would be appreciated. It's opening to a Windows error menu telling me that it cant open.\r\n\r\nThanks guys,\r\nCourtesy","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T03:20:25.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.. I'm seeing quite a lot of these going around lately. o.O\n\nAre you launching League as admin? This issue pops up a lot if League isn't assigned the right privileges to run. I recommend you right-click on the League shortcut, then select *run as administrator*. Please let me know if this worked for ya!","replies":[{"poster":"Z1sH","date":"2017-01-15T16:29:12.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have same type of problem when i press launch it give me a error menu then it would close the game. \nany help on fixing it. thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"courtesyflu5h","date":"2016-12-20T06:57:56.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!\n\nIt worked and now I'm gonna play a bit, thanks for helping!\n\nCourtesy","replies":[]}]}]}
