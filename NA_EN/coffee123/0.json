As the game goes on, it gets worse, animations stop, minion kills are late, abilities are late and I am forced to restart my game, which not long ago caused me to lose a game, that is why I am writing now. It needs to stop. If I restart my game it stops. I have never had any fps lag ever, I am running on full graphics and my internet is fine, I never really experience lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-14T18:26:22.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lagging sometimes can be caused by packet loss, and when unstable, could happen randomly or unexpectedly.

Regardless, I am very sure that it has nothing to do with packet loss. I play with my brother, and we both experienced it several times, however, never at the same time. Restarting the game works for both of us.\n(edit) I will give the log reader a try","replies":[]}]}]}
