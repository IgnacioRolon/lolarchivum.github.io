This is because the adc is viable in all meta because of its function in terms of objective control and sustained damage. So the meta always evolves based on the best current way to kill/neutralize the enemy ADC. Thus it never really feels fun to them because they are always the target.\n\nBlame the game design because what I just said is the absolute truth. Its hard to be happy when the game more or less depends on you being able to do your job and you are the number one target every game all game. Meanwhile if you die early the team rages and reports you. ALL while the enemy is typically playing the style/champs that most effectively kill you.\n\nEdit:  I am happy to see such a conversation about this topic that hasn't devolved into a bunch of finger pointing.  I think we are all in agreement that the ADC plays such a vital role in the game that it really does shape the way everyone else plays the game.

I just think its funny that the community expects the ADC players to not mind that the community at large plays whatever can kill them the most effectively and ENJOY being the most wanted man on the rift.\n\nYou're seeing one side of the coin. The meta isn't just based on killing the ADC most effectively, it's based on killing the enemy ADC most effectively while also giving your team's ADC the highest chance of success. Why do you think everyone is talking about Jinx right now? Because the tanky meta means her teammates excel at peeling for ADCs that need peel right now. You get focused and hunted a lot? Sure, but you also have an ally on your team who is explicitly playing to keep you alive and set up kills for you, every other role (except assassins because they're designed to be selfish) will put you first because they realise you're more important AND at the end of a winning game, you're the one who's wrecked all the towers and probably got the highest amount of kills by far. \n\nADCs get all the negative stuff because they are the single most important part of their team, but being that important comes with good stuff too. The meta is based around the best way to shut down the enemy ADC but you're a fool if you think the current meta isn't also built to set up your team's ADC too. And at the end of the day you get highs no other role gets, so it is only fair that you get more lows too.

Kog'maw is perhaps the strongest straight-up \"right click to win\" champion in the game, and he has NOTHING in his kit that he can use to outplay his opponent, only his R to desperately try to secure a kill.\nThere's a reason most ADCs are interchangeable, and people just overall play whichever ADC is currently favored the most by *what other people are playing in other roles*: They're not really capable of effecting much change in a game, and their one job is to not die. That's it. Don't die. It's not \"isolate X target\" or \"CC this guy\" or \"disrupt the enemy team\" or \"effectively take objectives solo\" etc etc. it's \"Don't die, because as long as your team keeps you alive you will win fights by sheer force of existing.\" ADCs can't do anything by themselves, and if they CAN because they're so monstrously fed, they STILL are most effective just following their teammates around and outputting damage.\n\n\nI've kinda stopped playing ADC much lately even though it's perhaps my best role, because it's so dull having no real impact on the game.
