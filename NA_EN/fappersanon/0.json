I&#039;m a writer, I love writing and I especially love fantasy, and to be quite frank Riot, you used to have amazing lore and gripping backstories that made me want to learn about each champion; now it&#039;s absolutely horrendous. Every time I look back a champions had their lore changed from about 6 paragraphs to 3 sentences, I think a good example of this is Ekko&#039;s extremely lackluster background info.\r\n\r\nI remember the days of the journal and reading about the various champions exploits and interactions, or the judgment where you got to learn about the champion WHY they came to the league ( my favorite judgment being Urgots and Talons). Now it appears that the go-to plot device is &quot;I went into the desert, now i&#039;m a whole new person&quot;! a glaring insult being Trundles overhaul, his lore was griping and you could really feel his pain, taking on the curse/disease for his tribe because he was the only one whose healing factor was strong enough to withstand it, but in the process turned him into an outcast.\r\n\r\n Also look at Xerath, his was a tale of a man too engulfed in power to care about much else, he strove for power so much that he was literally devoured by that power, killing his acquaintances (accidentally but still man, cmon)  Now he (of course) went into the desert and literally came out a slave We went from a man so consumed in his desires for power that he was literally consumed by that which he coveted most, to a slave just wanting to be of use to Azir. I can go on and on about the literary roundhouse kicks and throat chops being applied to once amazing backstories and replacing them with a husk of their former self a barrel of oranges and a note that reads &quot;k&quot;. However with that extremely long winded introduction I was wondering what possibilities there are for those who would love to write for you, character backgrounds, lore, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-13T16:01:49.120+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [Riot Career page is kept pretty up to date](http://www.riotgames.com/careers), and you can see that there is (at time of writing) a listing for Senior Narrative Writer.

I think if you had a great portfolio of published written works that were well received, then you'd have a good shot at getting that team's attention!  I may be wrong, but I'm not sure they're currently actively seeking people on the less-experienced end of the scale right now - that's just what I'm interpreting from there only being a posting for a Senior Narrative Writer.\n\nBasically; keep writing, and get published!  Can't hurt, right? :)","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-08-14T05:53:18.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Bio for jumping on this. Bio is completely correct. Keep writing, grow your craft get used to being told it isn't good, hang on to those who will tell you why, keep learning and strive to be the best you can.\n\nEvery writer is always learning, no matter how experienced. \n\nThe Senior Narrative Writer position is for folks who have executed with excellence professionally. Currently we don't have any entry level positions, but I'll certainly point folks on this board in the direction of the listing if and when that happens.\n\nCheers,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Renthaeus","date":"2015-08-13T18:50:49.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
