If your getting by a max Rang Q of Zoe's and you aren't asleep. Then you just suck man. Syndra can do it, Lux can do it, LB can do it (slow, but all the same). Only difference is Zoe has to hit you with an obviously telegraphed skill shot that is beyond easy to predict even if its fast. A Lux Q + Ult will do the same to you as a Zoe Q. Also considering Zoe Only has two real ways to damage you meaningful; Q and passive. Then she SHOULD DO THAT MUCH WITH HER Q. You don't want to get chunked by Q? Then Git Gud.
