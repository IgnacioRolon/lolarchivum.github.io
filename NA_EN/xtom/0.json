The \"X\" on the upper right of it wouldn't do anything no matter how many times I pressed it. I couldn't lock in a champion so it forced me to dodge.\n\nI submitted a bug report recently showing the same thing, but I thought I'd add it to this thread to show it's been replicated. \n\nP.S. Happy ending: despite the dodge failing my promos, it put me at 90 LP and I completed the promos again. Didn't give me the free win in those promos though, probably because I dodged out instead of losing out. Could've been 40 LP higher than where I am because of it, but at least it's not all bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-25T18:15:10.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really strange issue, and curious if you're able to hit the X on the top right corner?

Your patch on the updated client may not have gone well and resulting in this problem, so a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) may be necessary.
