Please help.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if this is a bug or not but I'm not getting Hextech chests anymore from league games. I thought even if your premade teammate got a S- rank or higher in a game you would get a Hextech chest, as long as you have available chest slots. Is this not still the case?\n\nI ask because when I go to my LoL client profile and hover over my 4 available chests icon it says \"Get an S- by yourself or with your premade to earn chests\". This sentence could be interpreted as meaning only you have to get an S-, or both you and premade can get a S- to earn your chest. So either it's bugging out and not giving me my chests even though it's not on cooldown, or they changed it to only I can earn it with my own S- rank.\n\nIf indeed I can only earn chests with my own S- rank that puts me in a bit of a pickle. Most of the friends I play with are high platinum while I am low gold at best, so when I play with them I don't often earn S- ranks. Not to mention even when I am not playing with them I am still put against higher ranking players. If I stopped playing with my friends altogether to lower the difficulty league would no longer be fun for me because it's not challenging enough, and it's not nearly as fun playing without friends. \n\nTo be clear I'm not sure if I've gotten a S- during this bug but I do know multiple times my friends have while playing with me. I've never experienced this bug before but it seems it is lasting a few days for me so far. For the first time in a very long time I am up keys with no chests.\n\nEdit: By S- rank I mean grade.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T02:01:05.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like it got cleared up!
