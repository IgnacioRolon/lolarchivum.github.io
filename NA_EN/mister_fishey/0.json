Or a pound of salt. Or a bag.)\r\n\r\nGreetings!\r\n\r\nToday I&#039;m giving my thoughts on why I think Riot is removing Smite buffs and also why I agree with their decision to do so. I don&#039;t expect everyone to agree with me, frankly I&#039;d be surprised if any of you agree with me, but, since there&#039;s been a lot of negativity directed towards the upcoming Jungle changes, I figured I&#039;d balance things out a bit and provide a more positive perspective on the whole scenario.\r\n\r\nNow, based off my experience, Riot has about 3 overarching goals when working on the Jungle:\r\n1) Make jungling more fun for Junglers.\r\n2) Give Junglers more strategic options.\r\n3) Increase Champion Diversity in the Jungle.\r\n\r\nMaking the Jungle more fun is pretty important, because fighting unchanging monsters in the jungle, in the exact same way, over and over, can get really boring, really fast.\r\n\r\nGiving Junglers more strategic options is important because, not only does it make jungling more fun, but it also adds depth to the gameplay, which is valuable, &#039;cause the more depth there is in the game, the more opportunity there is for players to show off their skill.\r\n\r\nAnd increasing Champion Diversity is always a core goal in every role. When you&#039;re forced to pick from a pool of only a few champions because those champs are the best right now, that isn&#039;t fun, as that takes away choice from the player. This is even more painful when you hate playing whoever is Meta right now, but if you want to have the highest chance at winning you have to pick them anyway. Having to play the exact same champions over and over again, whether you want to or not, is a legitimate threat to how fun the game can be, especially in the Jungle, where the gameplay is already at significant risk of being repetitive and dull.\r\n\r\nThe influence of these goals is evident in every change Riot has ever made to the Jungle. For example, they added different types of Smite and the ability to Smite enemy champions, which is incredibly fun. It also added strategic depth, as you had to pick which Smite you wanted while also deciding what to use it on. And in order to increase Champion Diversity they added a Blasting Smite that dealt AoE damage to camps while restoring Health and Mana. The idea was that if weaker Junglers had an easier time clearing, then maybe they could compete with the other S Tier Junglers. While a good idea on paper, Blasting Smite ended up being just as good on the best Junglers as it was on the weaker Junglers, and when everyone on the Tier List gets an equal boost in power, the worst stay the worst while the best stay the best, and that meant the Champion Diversity was mostly unaffected. Making the best better wasn&#039;t the point of Blasting Smite, so they retired it, but while their third goal was not achieved, the different Smites did achieve their first and second goals, and that&#039;s why they are still in the game.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to Smite buffs. It is in my opinion that the reason these are being retired is because they failed to realize the majority of Riot&#039;s goals. Let&#039;s cover the list.\r\n\r\n**Goal 1: Make jungling more fun for Junglers.**\r\n\r\nWhat counts as fun is obviously subjective, but, honestly, I really don&#039;t think the majority of Smite Buffs are all that fun. The Wolf Spirit is neat, and properly utilizing Krugs to clear camps can be satisfying, but that&#039;s really it. The rest of the Buffs are either boring and useless, like Smiting Blue, or boring and strong, like Smiting Raptors. Oh wow, now I can _clear wards_. What enthralling gameplay. -_-  But seriously, even if you enjoy the Smite Buffs, they are definitely not as fun as Smiting Enemy champions. Regardless of which is more tactically advantageous, Smiting Champion is always far more interactive and engaging than Smiting Jungle creeps. Or at least that&#039;s how I see it. Again, whether this goal was achieved is entirely subjective, so you guys have to decide for yourselves whether it was a success. Did you find that Smite Buffs enriched your games? Feel free to let me know. Thankfully, the other Goals are far more objective, and as such easier to analyze.\r\n\r\n**Goal 2: Give Junglers more strategic options.**\r\n\r\nY&#039;all might find this surprising, but this is where I am 100% certain that Smite Buffs failed. Why? Because, Junglers have two primary objectives: Gank Lanes and secure Epic Monsters. And the only Smite Buff that significantly helps Junglers do either of those is Raptor Buff. The rest are useless at worst, and mediocre at best. Don&#039;t believe me? Well then lets go through the list.\r\n\r\n**_Gromp:_** Provides mini-Thornmail effect, scaling with Bonus Health.\r\n\r\n1) Ganks: Useless. The amount of things that must go perfectly for this to do anything at all in a Gank is ridiculous. You have to be stacking Health, you have to be Ganking a Lane that has an Auto Attack oriented enemy Champion, and said enemy has to choose to Auto you instead of running away or attacking a different Champion, all just to get any use out of this Buff whatsoever. And, since the Buff relies on Bonus Health to do damage, a stat you have very little of during the time when you&#039;re going to be Ganking, even if you do get the perfect scenario in a Gank where this Buff comes into play, the damage you&#039;re going to be getting out of it is absolutely minuscule. You&#039;re better off saving your Smite to use on the Champion you&#039;re Ganking.\r\n\r\n2) Epic Monsters: Dragon only uses spells, Baron uses a mix of spells and Auto Attacks, and Rift Herald just uses Auto Attacks. This means that the Gromp Buff only works _half_ of the time. Note I said &quot;works&quot;, not &quot;is useful&quot;. Due to how the Rift Herald has to be taken before 20 minutes, you are unlikely to have much Bonus Health, and as such the Buff just does not contribute anything significant to clearing it. And while you should have more Bonus Health by the time you go for Baron, considering Baron only uses Autos half the time, and the fact that it is more likely to switch targets since your whole team is there, Gromp Buff&#039;s usefulness is drastically reduced. And something that I cannot emphasize enough, is that in all of these scenarios where the Gromp Buff works, it only does so _IF_ the user is a tank. On anyone else it is useless. So in short, this is a Buff that only works on _specific_ Champions against _specific_ enemy Champions in _specific_ scenarios at _specific_ times, and even when it works, the advantage it provides is mediocre _at best_. This Buff adds absolutely nothing to this game at all.\r\n\r\n_**Blue Buff:**_ Gives Mana. Whoopty freaking doo. Everyone knows Smiting Blue is worthless. I don&#039;t even need to split this into two sections to explain how bad it is. Any good Jungler gets sufficient Mana sustain from their Jungle item, and if they don&#039;t they get Hunter&#039;s Potion. While you could imagine someone Smiting Red for some sort of outplay, the idea of someone Smiting Blue, specifically to get Mana for an outplay, seems so incredibly rare and unlikely that if Riot were to tell me that no such outplay had ever happened, I would believe them. Smiting Blue is useless. Moving on.\r\n\r\n**_Wolves:_** Gives vision in the quadrant of the Jungle it was Smited in via an enemy-tracking Wolf Spirit.\r\n\r\n1) Ganks: Only works in the Jungle, ergo, is useless in Ganks.\r\n\r\n2) Epic Monsters: The only way this could possible affect the taking of Epic Monsters is if you use it to spot the enemy coming towards you while you&#039;re taking said monsters. The problem with this is that it is visible to the enemy, meaning that it may alert the enemy to the possibility that you&#039;re taking an Epic Monster. Plus, while the tracking provided by Wolf Spirit is theoretically valuable, it also makes the vision it provides unreliable. The Wolf is indiscriminate in who it chases, meaning that the vision it provides may get wasted on someone inconsequential, like the Support, while allowing the enemy Jungler to move towards you unseen for the potential steal on the Epic Monster. As a whole, this Smite Buff is basically just a less subtle and less reliable version of a ward, and when the advantage a Smite Buff provides is less valuable than something I can get for free on my Trinket, you know it&#039;s pretty bad.\r\n\r\n**_Raptors:_** Gives a better version of a Sweeping Lens.\r\n\r\n1) Ganks: This is incredibly powerful in Ganks. First off it gives Junglers the ability to deny vision, which is a tool that has been incredibly powerful and important for Junglers to have since the inception of League. And secondly, this Buff also allows you to know if you&#039;ve been spotted, and having the knowledge that an enemy Laner is unaware of your presence can have a massive impact on whether your Gank will succeed or not.\r\n\r\n2) Epic Monsters: This is also fantastic for taking Epic Monsters. Having the ability to clear vision and take control of the area around a major objective is always incredibly valuable. And since Raptor Buff lets you know if you&#039;ve been spotted, this opens the door to letting you potentially sneak an Epic Monster, which can singlehandedly win you the game.\r\n\r\n**_Red Buff:_** Heals you. I don&#039;t really have anything to say about this buff, since it&#039;s the only Smite Buff that&#039;s survivng into the next Season. So yeah. NEXT!\r\n\r\n**_Krugs:_** Occasionally stuns monsters, consumes Buff for True Damage proc on Towers.\r\n\r\n1) Ganks: Useless. Has no impact on whether your Gank will succeed.\r\n\r\n2) Epic Monsters: Useless. Does not affect Epic Monsters.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou beginning to see what I mean? Riot has been saying that their reason for retiring Smite Buffs is because these Buffs ended up just being a puzzle to be solved, in that they provide several wrong choices and one legitimate choice, which was not what they were supposed to do. These Buffs were intended to provide a range of equally viable strategic options for Junglers to choose from, and at first glance they appear to do so, but upon closer inspection, as I have shown, this is far from the case. Raptors provide a significant and reliable advantage to Junglers that can be game-changing, whereas the rest of the Smite Buffs range from completely useless to situationally mediocre. To put it another way, Smite Buffs add complexity instead of adding depth. Depth is achieved when players are provided with legitimate and meaningful ways to impact their game in a way that highlights their skill as a player. Complexity is achieved when systems are added to the game that provide little to no benefit, even when you utilize them properly, and instead just make the game more muddled and difficult to learn. When the majority of Smite Buffs give little to no benefit, they end up just making the game more cluttered, forcing players to dig through worthless mechanics in order to find the legitimate ones. In short, Smite Buffs absolutely fail to add any meaningful choices to the game, which means that Riot&#039;s second goal was certainly not achieved.\r\n\r\n**Goal 3: Increase Champion Diversity in the Jungle.** \r\n\r\nSimilarly to the Blasting Smite before it, the majority of Smite Buffs were intended to help weaker Junglers clear. Krugs, Red, and Gromp all directly help you survive the Jungle, and Wolf warns you if you&#039;re getting invaded by a stronger enemy Jungler. The problem is that, like Blasting Smite, these Buffs ended up helping the best Junglers as much as the worst Junglers. In fact, you could make a legitimate argument that Smite Buffs help top tier Junglers more than weaker ones on account of the fact that the best Junglers, who don&#039;t need help clearing, can save their Smite for Raptors or Ganking, and proceed to have an impact on the map, whereas weaker Junglers have to waste their Smite on inferior Buffs just to survive the Jungle. This discrepancy heavily discourages the picking of weaker Junglers, and, unfortunately, this may have actually hampered Champion Diversity more than it helped it, which is literally the opposite of what Riot was hoping to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile whether Smite Buffs are fun or not is a matter of opinion, with regards to the other two goals, Smite Buffs didn&#039;t just fail, they failed miserably. Instead of adding strategic depth, they added pointless complexity. Instead of improving Champion Diverstity, they worsened it. Improving the Jungle is arguably the most difficult task on Riot&#039;s plate, and by having useless and complicated systems littering the Jungle, it just becomes more difficult for Riot to improve it. As such, I agree wholeheartedly with the removal of Smite Buffs.\r\n\r\nAs for the new systems that are replacing Smite Buffs, only time will tell if they are a success. At first glance I think they have a lot of potential, but I won&#039;t bother judging them until they are on Live, as judging incomplete features before I&#039;ve gotten to try them myself is silly and pointless. (HINT HINT)\r\n\r\nAnd those are my thoughts on Smite Buffs. If you actually bothered to read this whole post, THANK YOU!

After lane phase and when you aren't planning to take an epic monster soon, Gromp and Krugs can be legitimate picks.  If you are planning to tank it up in a teamfight, Gromp will help get that enemy carry down in health.  If you plan to split push then Krugs can be helpful, that extra chunk of damage can be the difference between a tower going down or not.\n\nYet, as I said, I still primarily agree with you.

Rather, ganking is an important part of providing map pressure, by being an unknown force on the map, something that has to be in the back of the mind of all enemy players: Where is the jungler now? What does he do? Could I get the kill/get out if he would be here right now?\n\nThis is obviously more important in higher tiers and especially in organized play - in unorganized play, the two aspects you mention are much more important and prevalent.\n\nThis is also what makes Wolf Smite so good - since it automatically tracks whoever is entering that part of the jungle, it gives away the position of the enemy jungler and allows players to answer the questions above. More specifically, it makes the third question irrelevant, since you know the exact position of the enemy jungler right now and also where he is not for the next 15-30 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Fishey","date":"2016-10-31T01:11:57.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks! :D\n\nAnd you're right about map pressure and what not, the Jungle has far more depth and nuance than just Ganking and Epic Monsters, but I was trying to focus on the primary and most universal goals of Junglers, as this post was already going to be long enough as it is. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2016-10-31T01:55:24.015+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mister Fishey,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=60HKlKUN,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-30T16:43:30.177+0000)\n>\n> **_Wolves:_** Gives vision in the quadrant of the Jungle it was Smited in via an enemy-tracking Wolf Spirit.\n> \n> 1) Ganks: Only works in the Jungle, ergo, is useless in Ganks.\n\n\nAlso the other thing you kinda didn't mention is ENEMY side smiting (this is pretty big with wolfs) I personaly don't play as much {{champion:203}} but my friends do, it helps to get a smite on wolves so you know if their coming while taking the mark. \n \nOh and it does help in ganks. It's one of those, if you know the jungler is on that side of the map then it's safe to gank the other side without threat of countergank. Or taking an objective :)\n\n> 2) Epic Monsters: The only way this could possible affect the taking of Epic Monsters is if you use it to spot the enemy coming towards you while you&amp;#039;re taking said monsters.

Being that it's a following ward, and it is UNKILLABLE. It's similar to the skuttle in effect, just because you know the skuttle vision is there it doesn't mean the skuttle loses all power.

It's pretty weird. Although talon jungle was pretty fun ^.^\nIt feels like riot mainly focused on red side leaving blue side camps alone.

So removing Smite Buffs, although it may remove a neat feature or two, is what I think is best for the long term improvement of the Jungle, as the fewer factors that are involved in the Jungle, the easier it will be to understand, balance and improve it.

The first is the most obvious: the sentry cannot be destroyed or disabled. Yes it only tracks one person but the enemy support can't press 4 to turn it off. You are guaranteed to get vision of SOMETHING for the entire duration.\n\nThe second reason is that it doesn't just reveal the presence of champions who move over it. It pings. Human error is a factor whether high level players want to admit it or not. Everyone tunnels. Wolf spirit will give you info whether you are watching the map or not. \n\nThe third reason is that it watches the entire quadrant. You get info from when the enemy enters from their base side just as easily as you get info from someone entering from the river or mid. \n\nPoint 2) The removal of Smite buffs is not as problematic as the increase to Smite's cooldown. \n\nEven with the heavy 50 second increase in respawn time per camp, a 20 second increase to the charge of each Smite is immense. If I depend on this new Smite heal to help me in the jungle then I am less incentivized to Smite enemy champs during ganks, which as you pointed out is the most fun use of it.\n\nAlso RIP Ivern, seriously.\n\nPoint 3) Teamfights\n\nThe Gromp Smite buff was changed to give tanks a bit more power in the late game. It's about using White Smite as a combat summoner. Tanks usually need the wards to prevent invades so they get behind when they don't have blue or red Smite in the late game. To help that, they get their own Smite buff that helps in team fights. Without it champions who have to take Trackers Knife to survive the early game give up a huge amount of power late.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2016-10-31T03:38:05.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like how this post was well-though out, and had to upvote it on that alone. I also like its content, and had to support it by adding to the conversation it started.\n\nI feel like your grasp of the smite buffs' strategic usefulness might be a bit misleading. A jungler's primary focuses are to gank lanes and secure objectives, but that wasn't all they had to do. They could choose to counterjungle (in which smiting the enemy wolf camp was extremely powerful) or you could just farm the jungle (in which Gromp and Krugs were decent, although not very interesting). In addition, taking Gromp into a teamfight was really good on tanks, and the Wolf smite's vision control was an extremely powerful vision control tool in the mid-late stages of the game.\n\nI think your thoughts on smite buffs not increasing champion diversity in the jungle is perfectly reasonable, although there's one thing that you might have forgotten about (or possible not thought of at all considering how most people won't think about it), and that's the possibility that champions that don't have good synergy with the smite buffs but were almost usable in the jungle could have been rendered unviable due to their lack of synergy with said smite buffs.

Removing the buffs on the epic monsters in return for a small heal is fine as long as they kept the red and blue buff intact, instead we get Pseudo-RNG plants which not only kills strategy but makes the jungle much more casual, which I guess would be okay for non jungle mains right?\n\n3) Jungle champion diversity is a bad thing and we've all seen that with season 3 and 4 jungle. Season 6 (post-bloodrazor) is probably the healthiest jungle I've seen so far in this game and making it easier for more champions to jungle (ie like in S3 and S4) is just counter-productive.\n\nWhat I personally think they should change for the current jungle (not pbe) are to make skarners jungle relics a permanent addition to the game that can only be captured by champions with smite AND a completed Tier 2 or Tier 3 jungle item. This makes it so early game invades still stay intact while also giving the jungler a way to have some sort of offensive/defensive answer like laners do with turrets once they start investing into the jungle items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-10-31T01:10:49.247+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">1) Make jungling more fun for Junglers.\n2) Give Junglers more strategic options.\n3) Increase Champion Diversity in the Jungle.\n\nTheir changes fail abysmally at these goals, I don't believe these are Riots goals because the changes Riot has put out do the exact opposite.\n\nRiot are slashing jungle diversity in the preseason. Farming as a jungle playstyle is utterly dead, you can't farm creeps with a 150 second respawn timer. That means tank junglers have no fallback and carry junglers have nothing. So playing a tank jungler is now a giant risk as if you ever fall even slightly behind you're fucked and carry junglers are now non-existent because they can't farm up in the early game. What does that leave you with then? Lee Sin, Elise, Nidalee and Rek'sai, basically the cancer of the jungle is staying the same while every other champ is losing reliability. This is the worst possible change for the jungle. That alone kills fun for many junglers and kills champion diversity.\n\nPlants don't offer much in the way of actual strategy either. I've seen high elo players play on the PBE and what they do is destroy every plant they see regardless of whether it's useful to them. The reason for this is that plants have an attackers bias, if you're invading into the jungle the plants are more useful for you. \n\nHitting a vision plant to spot out an invader is really fucking hard, because you have to know the time on the invade already, which makes the vision plant questionably useful defensively. In contrast hitting it as an attacker always gives useful information, it either tells me where the enemy is or where they're not. In either case it's usable info.\n\nSince the Blast Cones spawn into the jungle they're only useful for getting onto jungle, not away. This means that an invader can close the gap to you with one, but you can't really re-open it.\n\nThe logistics of where the healing plant spawn make it more accessible for a fleeing invader than someone chasing them, this one's just a common sense thing.\n\nWith all that in mind, what do you do with every plant you see in your jungle? You just destroy them, because the risk for leaving them up is way too high. You may occasionally be able to set up a gank with one, but even then, is that creating more choices than Raptor buff. I'd argue no.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Fishey","date":"2016-10-31T02:09:01.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot has stated that these are their goals time and time again, and there's evidence of the influence of these goals in every change they've made, so that's not really up for debate.

And yes the removal of smitebuffs goes hand in hand with the plants...\nThe smite buffs may need some tweaks to be better, but those changes do NOT improve anything... You need to look ahead and not just behind.. \nbut alot of people get that wrong so i dont blame you\n\n\"fun\"\nThe bombplant does not increase \"fun\", just because you can jump over some walls to be faster at a camp, and those plants will be cleared before drakes/barons will be startet in about 99% of all cases. And the plants do not interact with your jungle clear at all! Meanwhile they can be used to better/safer counterjungle, get bullies a mana/hp sustain and free vision of your position + clearing all of your wards. \nYes technicly the \"stronger\" junglers/laners will have a bit more fun, because snowballing and opressing the enemy is easier with those plants, but the weaker ones can get totaly rect... So i dont think those plants or the removal of smite buffs increases fun, rather the excactly oppisite :/\n\n\"Stratigic Decision\" will be LOWERED to:\n 1) smite enemy champion\n 2) smite for a tiny bit of hp(its only usefull in the early game, mid to late its the same as the krugs buff) and\n 3) Epics. If you take the warding smite item you are down to 2!...\n\nWhile you had: \n1) Krugs(for early AA junglers, later close to useless, but could be used for Scuttle or a bit faster tower push)\n2) Gromp(lategame for tanks, early for slow clearspeed), \n3) lets combine red and blue smite buff here beeing ~same level like the new smite buff,\n4) Wolfs, usefull vs counterjunglers and to detect possible wards/traps\n5) Raptors, a better version of the swepper, because it only activates when a ward is detected\n6) vs Champs\n7) Epics\nSooo \"more\" stratigic options? I dont think so.\n\n\"Diversity\"\ntechnicly yes, making every smite a heal, makes some picks better, but it will not be super important, the stun from krugs, tick dmg from gromp are roundabout the same impact of a 10% max hp smite(which will have a longer cd btw) (IF you have 600Hp, the smite gives you 60... i would rather stun red or the big raptor and maybe cc chain them too, instead of this \"60\" hp back, and dont forget scuttle will get its resistance reduced if you dont have any cc and have krugs buff!!! \nBut the \"Gameplay\" will not be any different, its just a smite with a 1 time only effect, so it might be even less then the current version.\n\nSo we can see that the smite changes are basicly **terrible**.\n\nPlants may be \"interesting\" but they need some tweaks till they become a \"stratigic decision\", if youre interested in some ideas, i can give you some.\n \nSo what would be better? Changing the smite buffs! How?!\nHere:\n\n- smiting **Krugs** now reveals a monster, if they hit them with an AA/Ability for 2-3 seconds.\n- smiting **Scuttle** increases the duration of the zone by x1.5/x2 \n- smiting **Gromp** slows attacker AS by 10% (works on monster too)\n_possible red and blue smite changes: (remember only for the jungler to get)_\n- smiting **Red** gives an extra buff for a short time (30s ish or for the full duration) (could be Attackspeed, movementspeed or even a bit of armor)\n- smiting **Blue** gives an extra buff too, again 30s or the full duration ( Cdr, movementspeed or a bit of MR) \n- smiting **Raptors** gets rid of the reveal of the VisionPlant\n- smiting **Wolfs** gives a bit more movementspeed for the jungler/team in the part where the wolf was smited and VERY IMPORTANT!!! the ghost gets changed to the Devour Wolf!\n\nOr even completly change some buffs.\nThis would make the jungle more interesting, even more stratigic decision making, and possibly a better diversity too.\nBut in the end the \"stratigic\" decision will be reduced to: \"Thats the best, in that certain situation\" everytime, which is, unfortunly, close to impossilbe to avoid. \n\nAnd lastly \"judging\" an incomplete features as a final product may be bad, but giving concerns, other balance options, new ideas is the best thing for a incomplete feature to make it COMPLETE and possible BETTER at its release.

Those plants give you nothing if youre behind and can/will make it harder for the already weaker team to comeback.\nIf you smite your raptors you can remove the enemy wards in your jungle, wolf keeps you safe from traps, gromp gives tanks a bit more dmg. Its not much, but atleast its something! \nThe heal on the other side is only usefull, if you got catched, but survived, your camps still beeing up(which is unlickely) and you still having atleast 2 smite charges(because you want 1 charge for baron/drake steals) and then they only give you 100+10% hp back(300hp/500hp for 2k/4k hp) which is basicly nothing lategame.
