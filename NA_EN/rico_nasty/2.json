However there are a lot of areas that very rarely get answers.\n\nSure individual Rioters can't answer to all issues, but Rioat as a whole can.\n\nAn the other excuse I hear often, that writing posts takes too much time from actual work, doesn't count either.

Hell I made one a while ago joking about Riot getting ready to gut Karthus because he destroyed Zed in an LCS match that day, it got hundreds of upvotes and comments within hours. You don't see many of them today because balance is pretty healthy right now, but early season 5 where big changes introduced huge balance problems, there were constant threads accusing Riot of intentionally leaving {{champion:238}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:254}} etc. intentionally overpowered for **LC$BIGPLAY$**, even though that was not the case, the current itemization and jungle changes just happened to make certain champs far more powerful than the others, that was rectified later on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2015-07-19T15:46:56.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think they don't want to get themselves into trouble commenting on stuff about the game.  they would have to be very careful what they write or people will quote them and use it against them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LHAJPggV7l","date":"2015-07-21T07:49:34.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot certainly don't care about their game doesn't work for me and other players...
