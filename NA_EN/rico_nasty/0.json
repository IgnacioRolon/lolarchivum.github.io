It finished, so I clicked \"Launch\", and all it gave me was the attached picture -- a crash report. So i clicked \"Ok\" and attempted to re-open League. Same crash report. Clicked OK. Tried to re-open it. Repeat about 5 times until I realized this damn thing wasn't gonna open.\nSo I deleted LoL and re-installed it. Waited for it to update. Clicked \"Launch\", expecting it to take me to the login page but NOPE. SAME THING HAPPENED. I'm really lost as of what to do, re-installing hasn't helped, re-opening hasn't helped, clicking \"OK\" on the crash report page hasn't helped, and all I wanna do is play League. I am running a Macbook Pro (don't give me shit for it lol) and I'd really appreciate any help.\nThanks!\n\n_**EDIT:**_ Tried for the 9th time today and still nothing.
