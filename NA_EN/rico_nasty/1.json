How is it working for everyone else?\n\nSounds about right, I've been trying it out now that the client no longer crashes for me. So I put my setting back up to medium and the frames are still about 20 lower than they used to be but at least there isn't any audio bugs or major frame drops that I've noticed at the moment. It's slightly better so far but I haven't tested it too much yet. Update: I'm also getting the periodic lag that affects me pretty badly, there isn't a fps drop or ping spike, the game just stops responding.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Juniors","date":"2016-04-21T01:51:50.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The more I have played the lesser the audio bugs, and the FPS drops have seemed go away as well.  The lowered FPS is an annoyance.  The low FPS feels almost like its an Frame Rate cap (mine hasn't gone past 60 even though I have no cap set).   As for the lag/bug that is exactly what is happening to me as well as my friends. I agree that this is bad, but still an improvement to the incapability to team fight.  All in all, this is an improvement, but it isn't all good.  It does feel good to know they care and they are trying to fix it though!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lumina Flowlight","date":"2016-04-15T13:26:58.075+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"fix: don't game on a mac.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\ntotally kidding, but that is the exact response I got after telling my team I couldn't go into team fights without bugging out terribly (thankfully just an aram, still an extremely annoying response from a team mate tho)... anywho, this needs a fix ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-04-19T00:54:23.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've gotten better at splitpushing/forcing small skirmishes to avoid full on teamfights tho :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElysMustache","date":"2016-04-19T12:28:41.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You may be joking, but I started playing this game on Linux.
