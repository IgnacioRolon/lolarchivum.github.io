Been playing since season 1 and I've never had this problem before.\nEDIT2: Just tried to reconnect to a custom bot game and the loading screen changed to a yellow version of the ingame screen at around 60% loaded, and then stopped working.\nEDIT3: Updating my graphics drivers also didn't do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T21:30:57.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being able to hear sounds but not the game suggests a failing driver or graphics card issue.

It might be helpful to note that I was able to play the game just fine a week a or two before season 6 ended. Tried to play 3 days before the end to go back up to platinum before the season was over and ran into this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-12T16:42:38.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bummer to hear, and makes me wonder if there's a hardware problem.

Just wanted to check back in and explain how I finally resolved this after having given up for a while since I don't play much League during the preseason usually anyway. Bit of a long story but here we go.\n\nI bought Dragon's Dogma for PC today (great game, owned it on PS3 before, highly recommend it) and couldn't play it whatsoever. I spent atleast 6 hours trying everything I could think of to get it to work but it would just keep crashing within the first minute or so of the prologue. Fast forward a few hours and I've done a complete safe mode uninstallation and reinstallation of my graphics drivers for my GTX 970 using Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) made by Wagnard. Alas this also had no effect. However, while using DDU it listed 3 different video drivers, 1 naturally being my current GTX 970's drivers, another being my old GTX 760's drivers and lastly drivers for something called spacedesk. Spacedesk is a program that lets you essentially create a multi monitor setup with other devices like laptops which I now remembered I had installed during the LCS World Championships so I could watch and play at the same time. It rather sucked however, having a massive delay on my second 'monitor' and numerous other issues so I simply turned it off and forgot about it. In hindsight, I realized this was around the time League had stopped working for me as per described in my initial post. So, naturally, I went ahead and uninstalled spacedesk to see if it would change anything and, wouldn't you know it, both League and Dragon's Dogma now work smooth as butter like they should!\n\nTL;DR: Don't use spacedesk, buy a second monitor ya cheapskate.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"wildfire457","date":"2016-11-12T05:10:00.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/X6sPFPu8-fps-drops-and-crashes-after-the-windows-10-anniversary-update","replies":[{"poster":"GG Stephan","date":"2016-11-12T16:26:26.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm using windows 7.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CivacsMane","date":"2016-11-11T21:21:20.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exact same thing happens to me, already got placed in low priority queue because of this, hopefully someone finds a fix to this because I don't deserve lower priority queue for it not being my fault.","replies":[]}]}
