If you have time to answer a couple short questions, it&#039;ll help us a ton. For all you PTT enthusiasts out there...\n\n* What PTT key do you typically use in other games to broadcast? What would you use in League?\n* Would you change any other keys you typically use to make room for your preferred PTT key? If so, which ones?\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n**EDIT:** Also to clarify: you'll be able to change the key. We're interested for thinking about defaults and looking at overlap with keys that already have jobs (which we don't want to take away, it's a rough world out there).\n\n**EDIT:** And for those who aren't PTT fans, voice activation will be an option. As long as you close your mouth when you breathe.\n\n**EDIT:** Hey all! Thank you so much for all the info and taking the time to respond! This will be incredibly helpful for us.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2018-02-09T19:42:02.013+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":1,"body":"I use the squiggly key (tilde key).
