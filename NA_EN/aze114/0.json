This can occur if these skins were gifted by a friend, and the chargeback occurred on their end, too. \n\nIf you believe that content you have purchased/received on your account has gone missing and is not due to either of these two scenarios, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  We can look into your account and investigate further!","replies":[{"poster":"aze114","date":"2017-05-31T12:48:41.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1st thx\n1\n\nRiot KateyKhaos (NA) u re comment really helped me understand and 2nd so this mean there is no way to me to get it back ???","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-31T19:29:09.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi hi! \n\nNo worries, always happy to help! If there was a chargeback, you wouldn't be able to get the skins back, no. Basically, a chargeback means you dispute the charge, so your credit/debit card would have the money refunded to it, which ultimately means you didn't pay for the skin(s), which is why they're removed from your account. \n\nThat said, if you don't think this occurred, and the skins are actually missing, please do submit a ticket, and we'll be happy to investigate further. :)","replies":[{"poster":"aze114","date":"2017-05-31T20:48:41.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"but I paid it by gift cards \nRiot KateyKhaos (NA)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-01T16:38:44.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case, please submit a ticket (click the link in my original post), and our support team can take a look at your account and see why the content was removed.
