I cannot play a video game because some judgmental prick system you made was abused by 12 year old trolls. If you cannot solve your own problems in the game, you should not be playing the game.

Or maybe they just started doing it regularly but haven't quite hit the point of being punished yet. Or maybe they're between punishments, and that continued behavior is just going to be one more instance leading to further punishments.

Personally, I have a couple views that people would probably scream SJW about, but let's be honest.  Grand Theft Auto did have a more beating of hookers and rape than it needed, and a lot of stuff is geared towards men. But men have a lot of society generated gender norms that aren't helpful. \n\nWe could probably stop playing up the macho man angle for absolutely everything but that doesn't mean I still don't think Mr. Torgue is the best character and having games where you are a big buff polish jewish american boot stomping nazis on the neck and dual wielding missile launchers should be thrown out entirely. \n\nThere's a middle ground in there, hey maybe we shouldn't be so quick to squash freedom of expression, but hey, maybe our generation needs to relearn how to not be dicks, hey, maybe we need to rethink gender standards in this day and age, be more open, but hey, maybe we need to draw the line somewhere. Instead we hear the most about youtube comment kids and fat 'triggered' feminists. \n\nhttp://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20130407.gif","replies":[{"poster":"dapositiveviking","date":"2016-05-03T22:58:47.180+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i disagree, I personally advocate myself as a feminist bc i believe in breaking down gender roles and fighting for equal rights and acceptance. and as far as your nazi-stomping example, sure it's cool to play to that fantasy but it doesn't have to be gendered fantasy.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-05-03T23:07:42.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dapositiveviking,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KwuBh5XE,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-03T22:58:47.180+0000)\n>\n> i disagree, I personally advocate myself as a feminist bc i believe in breaking down gender roles and fighting for equal rights and acceptance. and as far as your nazi-stomping example, sure it&#x27;s cool to play to that fantasy but it doesn&#x27;t have to be gendered fantasy.\n\nThat's true, we could have more Samus types boot stomping on nazis and Mrs. Torgue. I just mean we don't need to get RID of the masculine cliche fantasy, just stop making the entire shooter/action genres be run by them. Beyond the name used, I'm fairly sure we are at least on the same street.","replies":[{"poster":"dapositiveviking","date":"2016-05-03T23:11:07.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean your first sentence still misidentified feminism as ONLY for female empowerment, but yeah i think we are. \nbut yes, samus characters and also more feminine or androgynous men too, or gay men who arent thrown away as just being \"fabulous\", so props to gearbox for sir hammerlock","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
