There are many fights that are lost, simply because I was too slow to even hit the person. Morde has no built in CC and his W is the only MS ability, but is a little unreliable to use as such. It would not be such a problem if not for his Q stacks deteriorating so quickly also, all someone has to do is back off for like, a second or so. Especially when compared to other Juggs in the game, he is laughable because he wins all 1v1's mostly, but only if the person you're playing against is too dumb to realize you just back off and Morde is too slow to kill you. Not a Juggernaut, but take Yasuo for instance, has a base of 345 MS, a .5second dash, and will almost assuredly get a %MVT speed item in his build as it is core, that's not including boots. Now take Nasus, he has 350 base MS and a massive slow that is almost off cooldown. Darius has 340 and two built in slows. 325 base MS is comparable to mages and long range adcs, it is ridiculous. Why does the only champion without CC have the lowest base MS option?","replies":[]}
