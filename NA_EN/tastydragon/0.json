These are listed based on how often I've seen it or had it happen to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Common:**\r\n\r\nEmperor's Divide - You had to know this one was coming, right? I've witnessed, sometimes multiple times in one match (yes I know I play a lot of AI games, now hush.), situations where Azir's ultimate isn't working correctly. The most common I've seen are all cases where the opponent takes the proper amount of damage, but then the wall portion is very wild and unpredictable.\r\nI've seen cases where the knockback effect just doesn't happen.\r\nI've seen cases where initially it will, but then the opponent gets to walk right back through it (once I saw that happen with the opponent being slowed by about 20%... weird).\r\nI've seen cases where the opponent was able to dash through the wall even though it says they shouldn't be able to, but I'm surprisingly okay with that because as far as I'm concerned, it's just another instance of player-made terrain... sort-of.\r\n\r\nThe problem with these bugs is you can't MAKE them happen. They just kind of choose when they want to appear, like old Twitch or old Eve with their 50-second stealth!\r\n\r\n\r\nConquering Sands - This is one that some of you might have had, some might not have had, but I think I may have figured out part of the problem.\r\nSometimes, casting Conquering Sands with more than one soldier will cause it to not trigger, and that might just be a problem between it and the soldiers themselves. It's more a misinformation bug than a game-breaking one, but it's a bug I've been able to replicate with mild success.\r\nIf I summon a soldier, order it to attack with Conquering Sands, then summon another soldier, Conquering Sands has a moderate chance to appear as though it's off cooldown before it actually is, and that can be a problem for players trying to get Azir to make some flashy plays.\r\n\r\n\r\nArise! -  This one I've been able to replicate fairly consistently. If Azir stands near an enemy nexus (probably, you know, attacking it) and summons a soldier on it, there is a good chance Azir will stop attacking and he and his soldier will stand there looking pretty until Azir moves out of, and then back into, range to attack the inhibitor, or until he switches targets. Not as bad as some of what people have had, but it's still a bug.\r\n\r\n**Uncommon or erratic:**\r\n\r\nEmperor's Divide - This bug (or maybe it's actually a tactical move disguised as a bug) is dependent on the one that causes the wall to not function correctly to appear. If you manage to pin an enemy against a wall well enough, he or she will start bouncing around in the air between the terrain and Azir's wall of sodiers, completely unable to do anything until either the **Bug Gods** say so or the soldier wall dissipates. I've only had this happen once, myself, despite multiple attempts. It should be noted it is hilarious.\r\n\r\n\r\nArise! + Conquering Sands - Sometimes if a soldier is summoned and then sent to a new location, it will attack immediately upon arrival regardless of whether or not Azir has recently thrown a basic attack. Sometimes the soldier will interrupt Azir mid-attack (I've seen cases where even the projectile thing he shoots disappeared).\r\nAnd on the opposite end of the spectrum, sometimes the soldier will cancel Azir's next attack AND the next one, effectively making him wait two auto-attack cycles before he or the soldier start attacking properly again. I've had it happen multiple times, but it's incredibly random. RNGods plz.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome good news! I've not found a single case where Shifting Sands has not done what it is supposed to do! ...But maybe someone else has.\r\n\r\nIf I've missed something or failed at properly explaining a bug, please inform me. If you can reliably replicate something I've claimed is unpredictable, say so and if I can get it to happen I'll rewrite the section to state how.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - Ritoplz bugfix nao plox <3","replies":[{"poster":"humjack","date":"2014-10-07T23:36:09.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After a couple dozen games on Azir, I have to say the most consistent and annoying bug is simply with his cooldown indicators. \n\nMy R *frequently* does not visually go on cooldown after casting it. This is very frustrating because I have no idea when it's actually available again. One one occasion I've had the same problem happen with his sun disc passive. I've seen some posts about the same bug occurring with his other skills; there's obviously something wonky going on with this champ's cooldown indicators across the board. \n\nAnother bug I've experienced on one occasion was Azir was unable to attack a specific minion that was *just outside* my soldier's autoattack range, yet *well within* Azir's autoattack range. Right-clicking the minion did nothing until I finally re-positioned Azir. \n\nFinally, there have been occasions where I swear I've auto-casted Azir's E (dash) to a nearby soldier but it wouldn't trigger. I haven't attempted to really test this though; perhaps I am just not clicking in the exact correct spot...\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. Sounds like Riot is on the case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArchLord James","date":"2014-09-26T07:53:24.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i can confirm the bug with his abilities not casting, and it happens with just one soldier out for me. I dont need to have two or more soldiers out for this bug to occur. I think it has to do with his soldiers auto attacks cancelling the spell cast since he has to go into that attack animation to make his soldiers attack\n\nAlso you left out a huge bug where turning line missile indicators on makes the skill shot lines on Q extend way past the ACTUAL range of the ability. Azir is practically unplayable with line missile indicators ON.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-25T22:00:41.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the report.
