that may have led you down this path.  I'm seeing a bit of name calling, and the entirety of your chat is crusading against your teammates and nothing to do with the actual game.  I know that other players can be jerks sometimes, but your best bet is always to use Mute and the reporting tool post game.  I know you want to defend yourself, but there's really no better way.  If you need anymore context, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our PB team can help!","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-29T18:47:53.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he wasn't toxic at all lol, he only said \"children\" a couple of times, i don't think that is worth a report. Other than that why not defend yourself? A person keeps on accusing you falsely and you try to defend yourself, then because of that the police sents you to prison. Like wtf.\n\nLike let's say for 40 minutes someone keeps accusing me for being bad, i say 200 times \"no i'm not\" and the end i say \"you're a child\". I get banned. Is that how it works?\n\nEDIT: grammar errors","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FuhrerVonMuth","date":"2017-08-29T18:30:52.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks a bunch, i already did and currently waiting for a reply. i do agree with you that i was on a bit of a crusade. only they kept being pushy and forcing responces, ill take your advice and just start muting even before this all starts.  i still  this was my first offence, no racism, or really going extreme... i mean i figure if i was to be punished it would just be a warning.. ill have to see what they say, i did look up how i could get a instand 14 day suspension, usually people say its because of lots of hate or racism. but i would think this wasnt extreme at all, givin what they were doing and acting.
