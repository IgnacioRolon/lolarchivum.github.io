I don't often post in the forums but I feel that someone needs to at least bring some attention to an issue a few of my friends seem to be having. I am not sure if this is the correct board for this, but I figure it falls into this category since it isn't a \"bug\" per say.\r\n\r\nTwo of my friends can not see the color red, and describe it to me as seeing it as a brownish color instead. This also means that they can not tell the difference between the colors blue and purple. \"Protanopia\" I believe it is called.\r\n\r\nBasically the problem is that they can not tell the difference between Sona's Q and her E except by noticing the glowing hands or the speed blur. With Riot's emphasis on readability I thought that I would take it upon myself to point out this flaw. I do not know how many others are effected by this problem, but this obviously something that I feel should be at least looked into. I do not know if it would be a lot of work to change it so colorblind mode would have different colors, but surely something can be done for those like my friends.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2014-08-01T20:48:28.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"...That's not a \"new\" problem. In fact, if anything, new Sona is way easier on the eyes on determining what the hell she's doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Nexodas","date":"2014-08-01T20:55:39.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps. I am merely pointing out the grievances that my friends with protanopia have relayed to me. That is that they can not tell which aura currently surrounds Sona at all and thus have a bit more trouble making informed choices on the fly.\n\nPersonally I love the new visual effects, but I can understand their plight.\n\nAnd besides even if new Sona is easier on the eyes, it does not clear up the fact that there is a problem with visual clarity that seems like an easy fix.\n\nAs I said I do not lurk/post often, but I felt I should get the word out there on the off chance people were not yet aware of this problem with her rework.\n\nI did not mean that the problem was new, merely that is was a problem with the new Sona.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-08-01T21:48:16.336+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the post!
