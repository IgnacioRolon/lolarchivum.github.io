I feel like I did fairly well, but I'd like someone more experienced to look at this.\n\nI tried to pin priority targets and call out what I was doing and where I was going as much as I could. I know I could have warded more( bad habit I need to break), but just looking for anything else you can gleam.\n\nedit: I really wish they had a playback feature for games lol","replies":[{"poster":"Ulltima","date":"2014-11-01T05:12:35.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes well from what I can tell our Riven wasn't the best( it was the riven telling me she would need help). Also the pre 6 warwick thing is something I take advantage of. \n\nMost people don't expect to see you, so when you pop up behind them at 4 (1 in q---2 in w---1 in e) can really surprise people. \n\nI suppose it was a bad judgement call on my part to go top then cause I was literally helping everywhere I could. Multiple ganks at multiple lanes can be taxing on ur farm but I felt it was worth it.\n\nedit: didnt read your bottom part yet    \n\nNo I don't do cleanup. I ask who needs a gank and come in with an open. I dont like cleanup, I like slamming into the enemy team out of nowhere and be gone just as fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-01T05:04:05.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so whoever \"informed\" you is incorrect. Mundo will lose out on trades vs riven early game, especially since riven has an ignite. You should farm to 6 because quite frankly, unless mundo is at rivens turret (pretty much impossible unless riven is terribad in which case you should avoid top like the plague), you won't be able to get  a successful gank pre-6.\n\nWhenever I play this matchup (as Mundo), all I can do is farm with my axe and keep my distance from riven, until I get my first item (I would build a sunfire vs riven, and only poke at riven with my axe). Everytime you see a warwick jungle, you know the chances of seeing them pre-6 is next to nil, so its an invitation to go ham. Now if mundo had exhaust instead of heal, you getting ganked at mundos turret would secure a kill pre-6, if warwick had red buff.\n\nbased on your itemization (no resistences) it looks like all you can do is dive in for 1 kill then get melted by their adc, so I'm guessing the only way you got your score is by playing like yi- cleaning up after your team created a sloppy mess.","replies":[]}]}
