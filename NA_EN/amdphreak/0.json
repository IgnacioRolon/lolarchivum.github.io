It is getting ZERO attention, and I cannot determine how much of this is a bug and how much of this is RIOT ignoring its customers.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I received a random popup in the middle of waiting in a lobby about \"leaving games\" and how it was inconsiderate. The popup wanted me to type \"I Agree.\" I figured it was a glitch, so I typed it and hit Submit 6 times in a row. The popup would not go away.\r\n\r\nA few days later, I had my internet disconnected during a ranked match at the beginning of the match (2:10 into the game, or thereabouts). I have no doubt my allies reported me, because they didn't have any clue what happened, and I couldn't tell them, obviously, because my internet was gone.\r\n\r\nAfter that match, I got this ridiculous Leaverbuster punishment, making me wait 5 minutes before queuing up. The restriction didn't seem to be in effect, when I played one Team Builder game with a friend, but it was in effect for every other queue, including ones with friends. Despite not being in effect for the Team Builder queue, the match counted toward my \"time served\".\r\n\r\nI just played my 5th out of 5 \"low-priority\" matches, and when I joined a queue afterward, I still saw the ridiculous Leaverbuster 5 minute penalty. This is utter bullshit. The client doesn't even display a remaining number of \"low-priority\" matches to be played. It's just punishing me without even the pretense of legitimacy.\r\n\r\nI want this fixed immediately. RIOT has already punished me for a crime I didn't commit, and now RIOT is punishing me \"just cuz.\"\r\n\r\n@Riotlyte I hardly use the forums, so I don't know if tagging you in this post will help at all, but I see other people do it, in vain hopes that it will.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-12-18T01:43:22.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey AMDphreak!\n\nIt sounds like there are two separate issues here that I want to make sure I help answer.  First, regarding your LeaverBuster notification window bug, does this still consistently happen even know when this window appears?  We looked into your account and it appears that after you first received the window, you did not type \"I agree\" for 2 weeks, which might be a factor as to why this bug occurred.  We would love to look into it further if you can provide some info!\n\nAs to your 5th game that should have removed your low-priority queue, this is something we are currently looking into where games are not counting towards this.  Digital Ram recently made a post about this [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/1agWkaum-stuck-in-low-priority-que?comment=000c).\n\nWe are working to get this resolved as quickly as possible!","replies":[{"poster":"AMDphreak","date":"2014-12-18T06:49:37.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! Thank you for the quick reply.\n\nI forgot to include the rest of the story on this post, so I will paraphrase my bug report post: The popup showed up in a lobby. I had not played a game since the day before, and I am fairly confident that I didn't disconnect during that game, although I don't remember.\n\nThe dialog/popup wouldn't go away until I restarted the PVP.net client. Note that the normal interface was beneath the popup, so I had to force-close the process. I'm running it on Windows 8 Pro. I've seen several other dialogs pop up in the PVP.net client, but they're usually unintrusive and have no consequence. The reason I submitted a ticket for this one is that I couldn't dismiss it, and I figure that I received Leaverbuster punishment as a consequence of the glitch. But, I shouldn't have to type \"I Agree\" in the first place, because I do not frequently or habitually leave games or AFK'ing. I get those kinds of people all the freaking time, and despite them leaving, I play the game out, even if it's 2 v 5 or 1 v 3. If your magical algorithm was coded correctly, it would be able to determine that from my match history.\n\nYou looked into my account and it appears that after I first received the window, I did not type \"I agree\" for 2 weeks? Have you bothered to look at my match history? How do you expect I played games during those supposed 2 weeks that I was faced with a Leaverbuster dialog, if the dialog window pops up before a game? Your program is BUGGED.\n\nAlso, how do you explain that it popped up randomly, after a good number of games with no disconnection issue? I can't tell from my online match history which ones may have been disconnects, but I know I rarely have disconnection issues, and I know I have left exactly 1 game a few years ago, out of all of the games I've ever played on League of Legends (over 1000). I got sick during one other game on Christmas eve a few years ago, and I never received any punishment for either of these examples. I've had these same Comcast-related lag and disconnection issues several other times in my history of playing this game, and never once have I received even a warning about AFK/Leaving, BECAUSE THERE IS NO LEAVER/AFK BEHAVIOR TO SPEAK OF.\n\nI have used other \"smurf\" accounts, and never received any punishment for leaving or AFK'ing, BECAUSE I DON'T AFK OR LEAVE.\n\nI have not seen the Leaverbuster popup on any other account. Only this account.\n\nI read another post that indicated that an \"update\" to Leaverbuster was recently released, seemingly within the last week or two, and that everyone gets the popup after their first \"offense.\" I don't know why this would be implemented this way. It's better to set a higher threshold value for these Leaverbuster warnings than what appears to be a magical 1 or 2. Statistical methods could be applied easily to detecting a long-term pattern of leaving and AFK behaviors on an account. People are not always in the best of moods. People have bad days. Build a better Leaverbuster that incorporates proper statistics for what exemplifies bad behavior. Zero tolerance policies have never worked for non-life-threatening offenses in any aspect of life. You read about these absurdities in the news every day. What is stopping me from taking this example and exposing it to Reddit and news media outlets for the scandal it is? Nothing but my own respect for your programmers.\n\nAs a computer science student about to graduate from college, what I see in your Leaverbuster system is a probable deeper bug relating these two incidences. There is just too much stuff not aligning with the reality of the situation for either of these two issues to be valid for my account. Either one glitch enabled the other, or both are related to a statistical miscalculation with your Leaverbuster engine.","replies":[{"poster":"sharkster1","date":"2014-12-19T02:32:58.642+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is it, I think I finally found the post that actually explains BEST just how stupid this new system is...\nRiot, do yourself, and everybody else a favor, and get rid of this piece of garbage system, and bring back the Tribunal.\nYou say that you guys listen to the community, yet iv'e seen dozens of posts on this, and yet, *GASP* nothing has been done. \nGood work, riot, really slick.\n\n+1 from a fellow annoyed summoner :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"timmyp789","date":"2015-06-02T23:58:44.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just bought my friend arcade{{champion:21}} and myself {{champion:39}} then we tried to play a game and he got a 20 minute leaver buster without leaving ANY games recently date is 6/2/2015 PLEASE help!!!!!!{{item:3070}}{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}   his name is LordDimensionX","replies":[]},{"poster":"Foxymillion","date":"2014-12-17T14:00:06.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im stuck with a 35 ranked ban, no matter how many games i play it still says 35 left","replies":[{"poster":"SuBearu","date":"2014-12-17T19:37:29.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the Ranked bans are You must WIN 35 Normal DRAFT games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Date A Clock","date":"2014-12-17T04:36:12.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on my 20th game, and I have to wait 20 mins each time I queue.\n\nAbout to just quit all together.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RAV1NGWALRUS","date":"2017-06-01T04:46:28.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm only level 9 and this has been happening to me I had not gone AFk in any games yet I randomly got the 5 minute leaver buster once I served my time in which case it didn't show to remaining games I was fine for about 3 days now all of a sudden there's a 10 minute queue despite not having gone afk from any games I believe this is due to false reporting as I was stuck with a bunch of morons who threw multiple games and I let them know they were morons","replies":[]},{"poster":"cody2750","date":"2016-05-16T14:36:14.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem .e. \nleaverbuster won't go away, after waiting 5 mins I play a game, and when I play another game it comes back all over again .\nI already played like  10 games and it won't go away ...{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Japan LCS","date":"2016-05-13T12:03:30.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here...\neverytime I start a new game I have to wait 5min and I don't even quit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ördög","date":"2015-12-23T09:18:13.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this problem to.
