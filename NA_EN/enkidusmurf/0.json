(Link above, scroll down one or two Teemos.)\r\n\r\nI thought Graves was in a pretty good spot. He&#039;s strong early game and falls off late. He&#039;s good at burst but somewhat lacking in sustained damage (partly because of his range). He&#039;s powerful but not oppressive. Strong champion, but clear trade-offs and weaknesses.\r\n\r\nSo, now we&#039;re nerfing his burst? Why? \r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t a &quot;QQ my main adc can&#039;t steamroll unconditionally anymore&quot; thing. I actually almost always prefer to play Quinn, who can&#039;t be reasonably accused of being OP. My friends do usually insist I play Graves, because he&#039;s the only adc who&#039;s tanky enough for the kind of stupid shenanigans I pull, but I wouldn&#039;t say I main him, and I don&#039;t want him to be OP. I just didn&#039;t think he was.\r\n\r\nAlso, the compensation he gets for hitting one target with more than one bullet&mdash;does that even mean anything? I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve *ever* been able to pull that off. If it&#039;s possible, it requires invading their personal space more than I&#039;ve been comfortable doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-29T06:42:42.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just prove it on the pbe, feel like the same.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahurath","date":"2015-04-28T18:17:47.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played graves alot like 200 games over a 5 month period and I think he's kinda overpowerd.

He's doing very well. A nerf isn't out of line. If you dash into range of an enemy, you'll do similar damage, and that's a fine requirement for Graves. It is perfectly possible to hit someone with all 3 bullets, and 2 isn't hard.\n\nHe has trade-offs and weaknesses, but that doesn't mean he isn't overpowered. Shifting some damage from the full-range Q into the melee Q doesn't hurt him much. It's been done before, and it's always just a slight power decrease.","replies":[{"poster":"Enkidusmurf","date":"2015-04-28T16:02:33.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a good case for it. I'm willing to wait and see what happens here, I guess.\n\nMy main concern is that this is going to hurt him against hyper-carry adcs, especially Jinx. The gameplan that comes with his kit is to bully, take towers, and win early. His Q was his main tool for bullying. Isn't this going to cause him to sacrifice a lot of pressure and run a huge risk of snowballing the enemy carry?\n\nOn the other hand, with the nerf to Jinx's R, I could see this shaping out toward a balanced bigger picture. Early game carries: semi-mobile, high burst, want to jump on their opponent early, bully them out, take the early towers and the early nexus. Hyper-carries: Immobile, squishier, high sustained damage, want to stay back and farm up, stall the game out, and steamroll late.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-04-28T16:12:45.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">His Q was his main tool for bullying.

You have a dash and resistances, so going in hard is something you're encouraged to do anyway. It introduces a little risk, but a little more risk is something Graves could use right now.\n\nWhich hyper carries are you concerned about? Jinx got a nerf that specifically makes her vulnerable to enemies going into close range with her, something Graves is very well posed to do. There isn't really a problem with any other high-scaling champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Enkidusmurf","date":"2015-04-28T16:33:01.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx was the main one, and I did see that nerf. My concern was more the pre-level 6 damage. It seems like she has a lot of it, and once she gets a kill or two, there's just no stopping her. So, if you've got to go in to trade with her, it seems like that's just one counter removed for her, in exchange for lowering the point blank damage of a global ult. \n\nI would have said that Graves had plenty of risk involved before, because of his short range (on his AA as well as his Q, relative to other skill shots).\n\nI see your point, and I'm not sure I disagree. It just didn't seem necessary. But I guess we'll see how it plays out.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-04-28T17:41:31.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">So, if you've got to go in to trade with her, it seems like that's just one counter removed for her,\n\nI'm not sure that follows. Going in to trade with her was always your best option against her, because trying to poke from long range with your Q was a great opening for her to harass and bully you with rockets while your Q was down. He can preform just as well as before if he goes in on her, and he also has the advantage of her not being able to respond with her ultimate. I'd say that the matchup should be going more in Graves' favor than it was before because going in has less opportunity for him to be punished. I actually consider Jinx a counter to Graves because she is good at mitigating his early advantages and can deal with him easily due to range late game. [Statistically, she's one of the hardest champions for him to deal with](http://champion.gg/champion/Graves). This should be decreased now that her ultimate is so hard to utilize against him in lane. He's not the only thing keeping hypercarries in check, so I don't think there is too much to worry about there.\n\n>I would have said that Graves had plenty of risk involved before, because of his short range \n\nSure, but the potential reward was overtuned in relation to the risk, especially against short range carries and offensive supports. \n\nEven if it wasn't necessary, it's a very small hit. It shouldn't be a significant hit to him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-28T15:15:57.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he has more burst and a way better autoattack animation/steroids than Corki, who is also an early game champ.

I wasn't really thinking of Corki as a reference, but that's a good point. But, isn't he supposed to spike in the mid-game when he finished Trinity Force? I never thought he was supposed to be an early game bully. In any case, wouldn't you agree that Corki probably just needs some buffs?\n\nI've mainly been thinking of Graves in contrast to hyper-carries. They're supposed to have bad early games, and then scale up massively late game. Graves's strong point against them is that he's able to bully them out of lane. \n\nAlready, hyper-carries are stronger than they should be in lane, in my opinion. It just seems odd to nerf one of the champs who's supposed to (sort of) counter them.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-28T16:02:42.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Corki's spike happens at Sheen.
