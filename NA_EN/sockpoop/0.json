But what happens when it crashes is a bright blue screen will appear on my monitor, I can hear the game but only the music and minions attacking each other, nothing else. It will either restart my computer for me or I'll have to hold the power button for at least 5 seconds. I have a GTX 970 with an i7 processor along with 32 G's of ram and I run on windows 10. This doesn't happen with any other game I play only League. It has caused many series games along with me just getting low priority q's and it is very annoying. \n\nAlso, after my computer restarts a screen will pop up and say \"overclocking failed\" it brings me to a page where it tells me how my fans are doing and stuff like that. It's strange because I haven't overclocked this computer. This only happens when I play league, not once has this happened to me with any other game I play. I have to keep my frames locked at 144 on very high settings, if I don't the problem I explained will happen. I have a 1080p HD monitor so I don't think its screen tearing. I tried looking up the problem I have and I can't seem to find any other people who have had the same problem. \n\nIf you have any idea of how to fix this issue please let me know. Thank you.\nI also should've added this doesn't happen to me all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T04:15:56.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These symptoms are often tied to issues with your system hardware configuration and conflicts with that configuration.

I then played an aram match today and again, it crashed. It seems like this happens more when I play aram.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-21T22:22:34.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may want to attach those logs to your ticket after submitting a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so one of our techs can help you from here.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sockpoop","date":"2017-02-16T06:01:52.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you for the help!","replies":[]}]}]}
