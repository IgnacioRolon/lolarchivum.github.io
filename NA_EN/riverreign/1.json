Im hoping you add a slide for all the short story&#039;s in an index format.\r\n\r\nBefore you had lots of short story&#039;s in the latest part of the website but sense time has past its full of the Camille story and champion incite. \r\n\r\nRiot , please add a story index to the slide function , it takes so long going through every champion just to read more about the world. You dont know weather or not the champion has any short story&#039;s other then there 5 sentences of explanation.\r\n\r\n It would make the site a lot better. \r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"LeaoC","date":"2016-12-01T21:03:34.378+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great idea!

IE: if I'm looking at shadow and fortune it might be nice if there's a link to burning tides. or if you're reading bloodline, a link to Taliyah's color text about going home","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-12-01T22:29:19.096+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got the touch!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2016-12-01T22:03:09.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also it would be nice if they are in chronological order, specially for someone like Taliyah whose stories and media go in a certain order.","replies":[]}]}
