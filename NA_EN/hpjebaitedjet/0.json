I know it's frustrating if youre loosing the game, but hey at least it's draft. However I got a teammember who was extremely toxic and was insulting everyone and everywhere he could. I assume it is a new account and was banned on the previouis one : https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/summoner/na/Avalon+Of+Saber\n\nI'm here to having a good time, but such people who are so extremely toxic are ruining the game, even if you trying to understand the game it's not fair having such teammembers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ash Lockheart","date":"2020-03-01T04:50:47.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its simple really. The game evolves around how your whole team plays, not how well you play. So if a video game is base off of what everyone does, and not mainly what you do when it comes to winning or losing, then you are at the mercy of every one in the match. \n\nSo what control do you have? You can have 12 kills, and 0 Deaths, but will that win the match? No. You have to destroy the towers, inibs, and the nexus in order to win the match. Can you be the only player in the match to destroy's the towers,inib, and Nexus? No unless the enemy players are willing to let you have them. Is it very easy to kill 5 enemy players by your self? No. Can you force random players you don't know to take out the towers, inibs, and nexus? No. \n\nSo when you have very little control in a video game how can you stay happy? How can you stay cool, and calm? \n\nIn my opinion people could carry them self's back when League had the mastery tree, and the old ruin system because one very fed player had more of a impact in the match, and the matches avg 52 mins. But those days are gone. \n\nSo if you really want to know why people are Toxic, and hateful then just look at the game it's self. Its not hard to see why people become toxic, and hateful.","replies":[{"poster":"Thats Down Right","date":"2020-03-01T22:15:49.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the first guy to make sense about the toxic community in awhile.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-03-01T18:08:29.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other words, the game itself promotes negativity from causing frustration. And the potential relief from that frustration can be denied by competence and unity in the enemy combined with incompetent or incompatible allies.\n\nOr the player's own incompetence. Which is a likely thing, especially when it is not recognised. It would be like playing Dark Souls with a shield up the entire time. (It's a bad idea but a lot of people do it... It's better to Not have a shield at all unless it's for parry or passive bonuses, no matter the skill level)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shovel Bot","date":"2020-03-01T20:17:56.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When they killed tribunal and the ability to strategize in select; they killed the community's brain to get more chemical chasing normies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thats Down Right","date":"2020-03-01T22:06:31.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cyber bullying is hilarious.
