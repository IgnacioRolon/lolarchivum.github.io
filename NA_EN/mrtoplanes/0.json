Why do I have to be a LeaverBuster Because of the Repairing Client. I know its because my file have corrupted. but if thats the cause then its not my fault but why must it be happen in loading screen? couldnt it be in the time when you logged online? and this happen twice today.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T01:54:10.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap, that does really suck that the crash/repair didn't happen until the loading screen. The client isn't constantly scanning your files for errors, otherwise, it'd be one heckin' slow-moving client that's for sure. \n\nIt's unfortunate this happened, but you also shouldn't get hit with an LPQ unless the system notices a recent history of multiple leaves. Once that repair finishes, be sure you test it in a custom/practice game to make sure it worked correctly. Feel free to hit me back up if it's still not letting you play the game normally!","replies":[]},{"poster":"72991874DEL1","date":"2018-01-19T02:53:11.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me. 20 min LPQ :(","replies":[]}]}
