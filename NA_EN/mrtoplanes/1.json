Although, it doesn't look like this account has a punishment for anything so you should be okay. \n\nIt's not that \"it was your fault the game crashed\", but this is more of a sign that you need to fix up those crashes before it gets worse. Be sure to do some general troubleshooting since it's a little hard to know exactly what went wrong there. I'd start with a quick repair and test it in a custom/practice match, and if that doesn't help check out the other steps in the [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) or let me know a little more about what happened when you crashed (eg error codes/crash messages/when it crashed).","replies":[]}]}
