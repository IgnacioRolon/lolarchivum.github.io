So, here it is.\r\n\r\nYour lore and characterizations are absurdly black and white.\r\n\r\nThe 'good' guys are blatantly good, and the evil ones, blatantly evil. We've got Demacia run by a guy named Lightshield, and Noxus formerly run by a guy named Darkwill. I thought and hoped that you had moved past that, but the Sion rework has made you guys drag Darkwill back up and expand further upon it. \r\n\r\nI also remember one of the early JoJs, where you guys had Katarina say something to the effect of \"those Ionians should be THANKING us for giving them technology and actual culture. I don't understand what they're complaining about\". Noxus slaughtered them (even innocent civilians begging for mercy, as was written in Riven's lore), and she claims Ionia should thank them for it. Heil, Katarina du Fuhrer.\r\n\r\nAnd it even comes down to things as simple as the in-game quotes, which I think can best be summed up by a sampling of Garen and Kat:\r\n\r\nGaren: Fear not, I'm coming!\r\nKat: BLOOD FOR NOXUS.\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nRiot, as long as you're trying to retcon everything and write a bunch of new stuff, I'd like very much for you to take a moment and reconsider all of this. \r\n1. Where are the thousands of Noxian protesters speaking out against Noxian attacks on Ionia/Freljord/even Demacia? Every nation, no matter how brainwashed and zealous, has that. Why not Noxus? \r\n2. Why do Noxians have to live in a giant skull, as if the city was designed by Dr. Wily? \r\n3. And what about Demacia? Are we to believe that Demacia is the first military in the history of humanity to have soldiers who have never committed horrible war crimes when they thought nobody was watching? \r\n4. Why is Riven the only Noxian to not take \"we value strength in all its forms\" to \"I have the right to kill you because I'm capable of it\"? \r\n5. Why is every scientist in Piltover a noble researcher, and every scientist in Zaun a maniac? \r\n6. Why is there no expansion on Annie's family and their Gray Order, which apparently are moderate and tame enough to tentatively work alongside Demacia for the greater good of peace?\r\n\r\nAnd even just coming down to plain and simple motivations. \r\n1. Why do you HAVE to depict Sejuani as being more inclined to burn a farm down for being \"a weak way of living life\" than use said farm to feed her starving people? \r\n2. Why does LeBlanc, whose supposed goal is to restore the Noxian Aristocracy's power, have to be a megalomaniac? The lore claimed Noxus was far more tame and peaceful when the Aristocracy was in power, so why is LB yet another insane, power hungry Noxian?\r\n3. Swain opposed the Ionian campaign, so why does he have to immediately become a power mad tyrant upon finally disposing of Darkwill? Can we not go five minutes without a cartoon villain ruling Noxus?\r\n4. Why do you HAVE to depict Sivir as only refusing to work with Noxus in their Ionian campaign because \"their strategy sucked\", as opposed to, you know, opposing slaughtering innocent people because LOLSTRENGTH?\r\n5. Why is Miss Fortune constantly depicted as working with Noxians over anyone else, even though she's supposedly a pirate hunter and \"good\" Bilgewater resident, even sharing many of noble smuggler Han Solo's traits? I must have missed the movie where Han and Vader tag teamed.\r\n\r\nBut a few of many questions, all of that. And what kills me is, the final JoJs had Kat and Talon working alongside J4 for a greater good. Garen fended off his own soldiers to ensure they didn't harm the Noxians, and everyone was working to expose the JoJ's attempt to incite violence between Demacia and Noxus. I really thought you guys were moving past the saturday morning cartoon writing you were putting into Demacia/Noxus, and all of LoL's lore in general. But now I see you slipping back to all that Darkwill and PASSIONATE PASSION crap, and it bothers me more than your want to retcon everything. It's not enough that you want to retcon, but you want to only bring back the cartoonish writing? Come on.\r\n\r\nNo nation is entirely good or evil. No conflict is between entirely good and evil. No PERSON is entirely good or evil. And I think I speak for most of us when I say that we'd like for your lore to start reflecting that. A little less Katarina du Hitler wondering why the Ionians aren't thanking her for killing them, and a little more Katarina working with J4 for a lasting peace.\r\n\r\nYay, my first rant on the new boards.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2014-10-03T13:09:29.080+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"HEY!\n\n{{champion:112}} is not a maniac!

However, Bilgewater itself usually enjoys a small relationship with Noxus and geographically they're located nearest with Bilgewater, therefore, they give a better, practical bounty job to fund her campaign to unify Bilgewater and find her mother's killer. Really, it seems more practical to contact the nearest city state rather than a city state that is too far away. \n\nIf TV Tropes would have something to describe {{champion:21}}, it's [Punch Clock Villain](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain), she probably held no ill wills to the Ionians or any other targets of Noxians, it's just a job. Bounty Hunters aren't supposed to be shining paragons of good (and I thought in Star Wars, the Bounty Hunter is being Jabba the Hut?), they take any jobs, dirty or not, to get paid. For {{champion:21}}, what took top priority is the welfare of Bilgewater, her crews and her mother's killer (the last one is just so she can question or kill him), not something like 'goodness'. And while she is a noble figure amongst Bilgewater, the state itself is stated to be a den full of crimes, piracy and chaos (most humans there have a record of crime, such as {{champion:104}} (conman) and {{champion:4}} (card shark)), and mostly that is how the rest of the world saw it, which kind of fueled her villainy portrayal, but the most she could garner was just a 'Punch Clock Villain'.\n\nI think if there IS a Bilgewater arc coming, that will decide where MF stands, either she converts into a ruthless pirate girl, or she becomes more open in her 'nobleness'.\n\nThat being said, remember how in the first promotional video, {{champion:75}} was counted amongst the bad team? I think the same deal goes with {{champion:21}}.\n\nAnd as far as {{champion:113}} goes... uhm... that description of 'feeding people with the farm' is something that {{champion:22}} would do, something that goes against {{champion:113}}'s upbringing that the winter and Freljord are a very harsh place. She grew up believing that strength is everything and kindness has no place in the world, it wasn't her fault that she had such upbringing and no peaceful people ever brought her to senses. Her belief is that might, not peace, makes right. If she would just let them farm, we'll just have another clone of {{champion:22}}\n\nAnd if anything, she also stood opposed to {{champion:127}}, and the only ruthless guy to be at her side is {{champion:2}}. Are you going to say that {{champion:106}} is not at all peaceful despite his lore saying that he's protective to the Ursine, because he took his lot to Sejuani? Or are you going to say {{champion:77}} has foregone {{champion:64}}'s teachings by siding with Sejuani instead of Ashe when he returned to Freljord? I think the answer is that they may realize that sometimes, a cruel individual like that has a point: A great might is needed in order to either ensure peace or take down {{champion:127}}, and it is their right to think that Ashe is not up for the job, despite not hating her.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsaalyo","date":"2014-10-04T01:05:20.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your point about {{champion:21}} gives her the same problem I had with {{champion:15}} , and her being opposed to the Ionian campaign solely because the slaughter wasn't planned out properly enough. There ARE bounty hunters with a shred of morality, even if it's as something as little as \"I don't kill kids\". Why does every bounty hunter, gun for hire, or otherwise questionable person automatically have to side with the 'evil' guys? I'm sure {{champion:21}} could find plenty of targets in Demacia, Bandle, or Freljord. Would she hit up some targets Noxus posts? Sure. But what I'm saying is, why is ONLY that depicted? The point of my rant is, everyone is too black and white. And what I'm worried about is Riot trying to write {{champion:21}} as willing to shoot ANYONE for coin. {{champion:21}} goes for the targets that pay? Fair enough. But I'm sure there's bounty placed on 'bad' people, too. \n\nAs for {{champion:113}} and the people who sided with her, I agree. But what I'm saying is, {{champion:113}} takes it to cartoonish proportions. Their own lore for {{champion:113}} states that she'd rather burn that farm down than even just take it over. She lives in a frozen wasteland, hardly anything grows, the only animals to hunt are animals that are hunting YOU as you hunt them, and her people are starving. But she'd rather torch a farm than harvest it, because picking an apple is for the weak? That's my problem. Some characters are morally this way or that way, some characters value this virtue or that virtue. That's fine, that's good, that's the only way to write a story. But to take it to that cartoonish extreme makes for lousy lore, and it's what I'm hoping Riot can find a way to stop producing.","replies":[{"poster":"NeoJusteBelmont","date":"2014-10-04T03:26:40.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, there is a story about {{champion:21}} doing something humane, in which the story she bought out a crew of {{champion:41}} that was nearly executed for failing him, pretty much saving his life, even if she already got a supply of crews herself. I thought Riot also coincided this with how {{champion:41}} can no longer deny minions.\n\nAnd if you look at the map, Bilgewater and Blue Flame Islands are located on around east/southeast of Valoran. It's nearest to Noxus, it's the most practical thing for money source for her goals. This is why she rarely went to Demacia, because it's too far away and the bounty put there might not be beneficial. Not to mention she might be mistaken as the same as the other criminals around Bilgewater, and you know how Demacia hate that kind of stereotype. Bandle City already have a bad reputation with Bilgewater, why would they give a job to a Bilgewater resident? And Freljord... it's even further away than Demacia and going there would be murder to {{champion:21}}'s body due to the difference of temperature and her being used to live in warm places. That and most of the citizens there rarely puts on bounties for her to claim.

If that was the case, then part of MF's 'villainization' is because the players chose her as part of Noxus pool. It could have been anyone, but the players chose her instead. Again, CMIIW.\n\nMost of {{champion:113}} attitude was due to her upbringing. She's left alone in the winter and grew there by being the toughest there is and faced off the winter by herself, and became obsessed with the fact that the strong survives, the weak dies, and compassion is for the weak. She truly believed that it is the right thing, so in spite of doing something horrible, she's not a cackling \"Lulz, I do it because I can.\", she's only doing what she thinks is right: Fighting and being strong is the most important thing, and compassion and peaceful farming are an insult to that. There's also rumors that she herself is kind of manipulated with {{champion:127}}, who said that she's destined to be the Queen of Freljord one day. She wants to make Freljord a power-based country based on her beliefs. \n\nThe Winter's Claw has always been one of the strongest clans in Freljord, so I don't think they HAVE hunger or starvation problems. Probably because her ideals say that they should be carnivorous and either eat from hunted meats or things they plundered. Yes, actually I don't think {{champion:113}} always play the \"Burn this farm\" card. If it is advantageous to her, she would instead seize them for her clan's welfare. Still it hits a bad thing too, because stealing is bad.\n\nI'd say if you wish for a compelling and conflicting virtue story, you may want to look at the Mt. Targon story. Excepting {{champion:80}} who's kinda left in the dust, the conflict of {{champion:89}} vs {{champion:131}} remain grey even if {{champion:89}} is portrayed as the 'really good' virtue.
