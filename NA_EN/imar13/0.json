It's to do with how the Death Realm works. \n\nThink of it as a parallel Summoner's Rift. Both spaces are separate. So an ability that you cast on SR does not exist and will not deal damage in the Death Realm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-07-12T00:04:11.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, not a bug. You need to use it after he picks you. If he realms you mid-case, then he's simply outplayed you.\n\nDeath Realm isn't a movement ability. That's why it doesn't function like one.
