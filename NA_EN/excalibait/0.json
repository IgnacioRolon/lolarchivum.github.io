Is there a reason this pops up now, after I've even played a game today without any real issues? Is there a chance I run into any scam when accepting? It also feels weird that there's apparently an update running in the background.\n\nI don't want to send a support ticket for this, as I rather hope for a more immediate response/help.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/VCiEiFL.png\n\nEdit: accepting the ToS brings up a screen where it tells me that desktop icons will be updated and that admin permission might be requested. I'm really scared now, please help.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KG4xYo1.png","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-13T18:50:00.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grayamir has offered some solid advice, I really wouldn't worry about this.  The prompts that you're getting is common when the legacy client updates to the updated version.  The updated client is also cool in that it can quickly apply updates or hotfixes seamlessly without needing to relog, so you might see processes in the background.  \n\nThe shortcut prompt is a request to change the old League of Legends icon to the new picture and pathway, but it needs your permission to do that.  Hope that helps offer some ease.","replies":[]},{"poster":"grayamir","date":"2017-09-13T17:20:08.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't panic.\n\nThis is normal, sometimes patches change things in the ToS, so you have to \"re-read\" it and accept the changes.\n\nThe update in background is how the newer client patches.","replies":[{"poster":"Excalibait","date":"2017-09-13T17:21:42.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem is, I already patched it today and played a game.

There may be a lot of updates to get through, it's been a while since new client was released.\n\n*Since the post title says computer restarted, it's possible your computer system restored itself to an older version?","replies":[{"poster":"Excalibait","date":"2017-09-13T17:35:50.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i doubt it. the loading screen states that i'm already on 7.18","replies":[{"poster":"grayamir","date":"2017-09-13T17:52:13.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another possibility is the game repaired itself, which it will do after crashing.
