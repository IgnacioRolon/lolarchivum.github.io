Can anyone explain me, if that is intended to happen and and if so, what exactly happened that caused this situation?","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-03-11T06:00:38.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could also be a spectator client side bug as the players didn't seem phased by it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2016-03-10T22:03:19.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naut ult will fizzle if you loose vision of the target before the cast animation completes (not out of range, out of vision).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-03-10T20:16:54.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has come up as a bug in the past, but was said to be fixed.

He sat on Essence Reaver and Statik Shiv at the time. There was also no Mikaels, if that'd be another option.\n\nI just rewatched it and Lucian flashed the moment Naut used his Ult. You heard the sound of Depth Charge clearly so it was started, but maybe the flash got him out of cast range within the channel time?","replies":[]}]}]}
