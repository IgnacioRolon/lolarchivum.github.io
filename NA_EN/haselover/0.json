It doesn&#039;t even have to be a swear word just something negative even if its the truth. Riot has made system which banns you without considering the circumstances. Don&#039;t get me wrong alot of people deserve banns etc. but there are many good players who carry games but still want to voice their opinion. Riot doesn&#039;t put in the effort necessary which is needed for it to be fair really, all they say is mute, carry on and report after. \r\nI think part of a solution would be Riot making a warning system for people telling them that they are close to getting banned showing chatlogs on both sides at least also acknowledging that you didn&#039;t start flaming/harrasing people but responded in a way which they do not appreciate.\r\n\r\n(basically they teach you to be a snitch instead of a man voicing your opinion tbh.)\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-09-10T00:21:02.882+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What happens: You say \"you guys suck\" but still try to win\n> --> 14 day bann without warning if they decide to report you\n\nCare to show chat logs? 'Cause, there's obviously more to it, and even still, if you were punished for that alone and given a 14-day ban, it means _you've ignored a previous 25-game Chat Restriction, and Riot is telling you to **stop**_.\n\nYou don't just get a 14-day ban out of the blue for telling someone that they suck.

Both players participated in a flame war, both players get punished when they're reported for it.\n\nThere's no reason to try and gratify the person who decided to flame back by acknowledging \"oh, well, you didn't start shit, so I guess you're almost cool\" - they still flamed.
