There's nothing wrong with expecting people to have some basic common sense, decency, maturity and sportsmanship, nor is it wrong to punish those that refuse to show it.\n\nWe live in a world with tons of entertainment options, and people are more likely to stop using an entertainment option if they're no longer getting any enjoyment out of it, such as when a whole bunch of people are using it as a place to abuse and harass others. Companies like Riot know this, hence why they set some basic guidelines to follow that encourage mature and respectful interaction &amp; discourage the opposite. Why? Well to quote [Kei143](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mmh6PidR-the-dreaded-downvoteers-in-this-discussion-board?comment=0001000100000000000100000004): \n\n>When Riot permabans someone, their philosophy is \"the chances of this guy reforming isn't a whole lot, we'd rather not have him in the game\". Thus in their eyes, they have already written off the toxic player as a paying client.\n\n>From a business standpoint, do they want to remove the toxic guy who has spent $500 but is causing a negative environment for 4-9 other players in every game? Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.\n\nAlso to quote [Umbral Regent]( https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/bIQEEAVN-perma-bans?comment=0000): \n\n>If you got your main account permanently banned, the only way you can prove your reform is to not get any further accounts banned.\n\n>Riot isn't going to give you infinite chances, they have to put their foot down somewhere - and that somewhere happens to be after the 14-day ban. If you can't be bothered to listen to three separate warnings _at the very least_, then, why should your main account be given a fourth try? You've already proven three separate times that you don't care about the rules.\n\n>My opinion is that if you're worth getting your account back, you wouldn't have gotten it banned in the first place.\n\nSo as you can see consistently disruptive people drive business away, so it's in the company's best interest to discourage them from acting like that since satisfied customers=more business while dissatisfied customers=less business. It's not worth trying to do business with or associate with someone who's constantly causing trouble for others. If being forced to mind your manners when around others is too much to ask for you then multiplayer games are just not for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2020-01-30T04:26:18.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few things:\n\nTrash talking:\n(Someone misses an easy shot/execute/smite/etc): *Nice one, way to get that kill|smite|etc*\n\nHarassment\n(Someone misses an easy shot/execute/smite/etc): *you're legit brain damaged* (to use one of your examples).\n\n> Hey look someone who is probably fairly new to online gaming.

Just because someone is breaking the rules does not give you license to do so as well.\n\n> Reporting for verbal gets more a response than someone feeding so spare me the \"report for feeding and move on\".\n\nNo, it is more frequently, and quickly, punished because it is easier to detect. If inting was as easy to detect as chat behavior, I guarantee the boards would be flooded with people complaining that \"I wasn't inting, it was just a bad game!\" There is also confirmation bias going on here. In many cases, people truly don't understand why their chat is unacceptable or they disagree with the rules. Most people truly inting, and punished for it, one can surmise that they know they were and know that it is against the rules. So they take their lumps and don't post here about it.\n\n> I personally find nothing more frustrating than doing everything right just to have someone come and mess it up then demand they be showered with praise.\n\nTo be honest, the fact that this is a team game, and it requires team effort to play well, anything other than 5v5 teams seems crazy to me. It is like playing in an organized league of basketball/baseball/soccer/football/hockey/etc with a bunch of random people you found at the local Starbucks. It makes no sense. The problem is most of the playerbase don't have the time to put in the time to practice enough for 5v5s. This is exactly why I don't and never will, play ranked solo/duo.\n\n> If you don't think people are assholes online then I have to ask where have you been? There's no changing how people are going to act behind a screen instead change yourself to be strong and not take things said in an online game seriously.\n\nHow about instead of treating the internet as a protective shield where you act like a complete and utter jackass in the face of anonymity, treat the random players as they are sitting right next to you; remember that there is an actual person at the other end of that chatbox.\n\n> So instead of venting to either an afk troll or someone who feeds from misplays then afks you would rather players just go to forums to vent where they will be told they are acting foolish. Instead of venting to other people in the game and have some sort of moment of collective hatred for the one or more persons ruining for everyone and you want to ban people for that instead of just letting what needs to be said out to the person who caused it. Because humans are so special yet they cant handling things said in a virtual space?\n\nCollective hatred helps...how?\n\n###### Hint: it doesn't help at all\n\nWhat needs to be said? You need to start flaming? Is it going to help?\n\n###### Answers: 1) Nothing, 2) No, 3) No\n\nAll it serves is to breed further discontent within the team. If you are losing at the time you start berating your teammates, you will surely be losing even harder after. Again, pretend you are in-person, playing a pick-up game of basketball, because that is essentially what solo/duo queue.\n\n> I'm not the one trying to get someone banned from a game because i do poorly and get flamed.

Try being constructive if youre going to criticize him.\n\nI disagree with the idea that online harassment is a joke and feel like the sheltered argument could be applied to those people as well. Being online awards a certain amount of anonymity, and some people like to use that as an excuse to say and do things to others they would never do offline as they know they'd get in major trouble for it if they acted that way offline. Now that they can't get away with behaving that way online they're mad about it &amp; claim that it's stuff like a snowflake society or whatever.\n\nWhile people shouldn't let stuff offend them too much, I do think that the \"you hate it cause you're offended\" argument can only go so far before it falls apart so-to-speak. For many it's not about being offended, it's about expecting others to behave themselves even when online or face the consequences like they would if they behaved poorly offline, and I don't see a problem with holding accountable those who think \"online anonymity=no rules or consequences\".","replies":[]}]}]}
