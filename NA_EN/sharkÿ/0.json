I've encountered a random problem with League lately where I keep disconnecting from the games and I can't for the life of me figure it out.\r\nWhen I play other games like, PUBG, Gears of War, Counter Strike and so on I never run into this problem. It's literally just League.\r\nAny advice would help, I appreciate it.
