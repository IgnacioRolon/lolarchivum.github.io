Our player in question was playing as lux, and was silent for most of the early game. while in the mid game and the enemy was grouping in mid. it was around this time when some stuff irl came up and i had to text someone back, so i sat in a midlane side bush. our team doesnt engage, but one of us dies, and lux goes INSANE. she blames the whole thing on me, which i thought was fine, but i explained to her that i had some stuff irl come up and had to go afk for a second. she rages a little bit more, i dont say anything other than \"sorry i had irl stuff come up\", and eventually she tells me \"then kill yourself\". i swear i have not cut out any part of the story, i didnt say anything extremely offensive to her, she jsut went form 0 to 100 like that. i tell her to enjoy her ban, she just says i will, and then proceeds to bs some more. at one point she said \"i wasnt mean\" which i thought was hilarious. i never said anything about being depressed or anything along those lines, but she started to say \"this isnt a pitty party\", showing she had ZERO remorse for such a toxic statement. i would like to point out that this is most likely a smurf do to the name, and they are on a differant account. they are on this account MOST LIKELY for being banned due to toxicity, meaning riot has not yet fixed the problem that this player creates. in short, perma ban all accounts, bc ur method right now is not working. i will be quitting league until i know that this player has been banned on AT  LEAST this account. i urge all of u readers to do the same if u come across this kind of behavior. thank you for reading, and i will keep the post updated if anything happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Crispy0Snake","date":"2019-06-14T02:07:17.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a support ticket, you can report them there\n\nThis post will be removed for naming and shaming, hopefully the toxic player will receive a ban though","replies":[{"poster":"BomeiSha","date":"2019-06-14T02:11:12.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"would it stay up if i took the players name out r something? i want to do everything withing my power to keep this up while i can.\nbtw, thanks for the comment","replies":[{"poster":"Crispy0Snake","date":"2019-06-14T02:25:50.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, I think it would remain if you removed the players name\n\nI'm not a moderator though, I can't make any guarantees here lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-06-14T02:23:39.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, it would.

Being mad about it wont do anything except make the trolls happy.\n\nIncidentally, anyone who said that 100% got banned shortly after, regardless of if you got a feedback notification. that is one of the absolute zero tolerance acts, on top of being very easy for the system to detect, since it is just chat.\n\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/2214126382319680\n\nLooks like they get in one more game.. If no more appear, you can safely assume they got smote by the banhammer.\n\nThe chat restriction you got is proof of how brutal the system is against any variant on that term, but you may be able to get it reversed if you explain it was a quote.
