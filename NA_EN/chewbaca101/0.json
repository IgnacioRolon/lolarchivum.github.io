Riot for what seems no reason removed the smart ping button that was on the mini map. Now I do not know how much this bothers other players but for me it bothers me a lot. I used the button a lot and I found it quite easier than using the short cuts to ping on my keyboard. I see no reason on why it has been removed and I would like to think that it wouldn&#039;t be that hard to add the buttons back into the game and if they were to be added again would like them to be on the mini map again. If others have noticed this please help me in bringing  back the smart ping buttons.","replies":[{"poster":"Magneto81","date":"2015-08-06T16:43:22.801+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely!

Know everything is on the keyboard and I feel i know have to many keys that I need know how to use properly. The smart ping buttons were very nice.","replies":[{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-08-06T21:53:51.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have the ping wheel set to letter g, and I've memorized what direction what ping is like the \"?\" \"!\" \"assist\" it takes .00000000000000000000001 seconds to use","replies":[{"poster":"chewbaca101","date":"2015-08-06T22:14:40.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=freya od,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8tEmoNQL,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-08-06T21:53:51.786+0000)\n>\n> I have the ping wheel set to letter g, and I've memorized what direction what ping is like the \"?\" \"!\" \"assist\" it takes .00000000000000000000001 seconds to use\n\nYeah, there was still no reason to remove it and know people who didn't use it on g have to get used to using it on g. I have to get rid of a habit that I have been using since I started this game in season 4 for no reason.  Its like making it mandatory to have flash on f, when I keep it on d. It throws off  your muscle memory that you have in the game. It also took about the same time using the buttons. I just find it weird that they removed it and it annoys me.","replies":[{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-08-06T22:34:09.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chewbaca101,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8tEmoNQL,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-06T22:14:40.263+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, there was still no reason to remove it\n\nYes there was... they were REDUNDANT.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=chewbaca101,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8tEmoNQL,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-06T22:14:40.263+0000)\n>\n>  Its like making it mandatory to have flash on f, when I keep it on d. \n\nNo, it's not ... it would be like making it mandatory to click the flash icon on your hud.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=chewbaca101,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8tEmoNQL,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-06T22:14:40.263+0000)\n>\n>It also took about the same time using the buttons. \n\nNo it doesn't, unless you are doing something very wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"chewbaca101","date":"2015-08-06T22:52:26.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Çerastes,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8tEmoNQL,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-06T22:34:09.123+0000)\n>\n> Yes there was... they were REDUNDANT.\n> \n> No, it's not ... it would be like making it mandatory to click the flash icon on your hud.\n> \n> No it doesn't, unless you are doing something very wrong. \n\nSince when is having redundancy a bad thing? My example works because it still throws off muscle memory, which was my point. Also you make it seem like using the buttons is horrible. Also you still have to position your mouse and move the cursor in both scenarios to use smart pings. So there is no reason my way should take longer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-08-06T22:26:47.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No.\n\nPlease, learn to play properly.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=chewbaca101,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8tEmoNQL,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-06T16:36:51.855+0000)\n>\n> I used the button a lot and I found it quite easier than using the short cuts to ping on my keyboard. \n\nWell then there is something wrong with how you play this game, if you really think it's somehow easier to first move your cursor to the minimap area, click the ping-icon and then move the cursor back to where you want to ping and release the mouse button... instead of pressing ONE SINGLE BUTTON on your keyboard or your mouse (depending where you bind it) and you don't even need to move your cursor anywhere like you have to with your method.\n\nNot to mention that the one key will provide the whole menu for all the pings.","replies":[{"poster":"wyDCJcgPiA","date":"2015-08-10T00:16:44.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe he liked the button!
