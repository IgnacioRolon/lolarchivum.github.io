Rant of a Lowbie","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"LoL needs to block level 30 players from boosting lowbie accounts. It makes little guys like me rage and mad as hell.  Level 18 and I found that there were 3 level 30&#039;s and on level 10 in a game I played the other was a 21 but I understand I&#039;m going to be against those players.   But c&#039;mon 3 level 30&#039;s . Level 3 tier runes!! Max Masteries!! These guys shouldn&#039;t have wins counted as these are easy wins. I believe its their way of boosting their own account as well.   I ended up raging like hell. A level 30 adc and support against me a level 18 adc and a level 5 support. Not cool Lol","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-09T17:15:20.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's absolutely ridiculous that Riot limits the power of players according to their account levels and then pits differently leveled accounts together. Either give equal access to every spell/mastery/rune from the start or make it so that pre-30 nobody has any access to them at all. \n\nBeing outskilled is one thing, but losing because of unfair advantages given by the system is unexcusable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kilanost","date":"2017-04-09T17:08:24.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're new to the game, the biggest reason you're having such a hard time is that you are learning.  Most people who have played ranked significantly, even if they haven't climbed very far, could make a level 1 account, grab nothing but tier 1 runes, and start bullying you around in game regardless of you having the rune and mastery advantage.\n\nJust have to take it as the learning experience it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-09T16:00:51.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"... it's not booting in Normals, it's playing with friends or match making.\n\nIf Riot didn't allow it, all that would do would be cause more people to create Smurf accounts, using up more summoner names and you'd be in the exact same boat.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-09T17:18:31.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that high level accounts have built-in advantages since they have access to more rune slots and masteries (and pre-10, more summoner spells). There's no excuse to make the skill problem worse by making higher leveled accounts stronger in addition to the players being more skilled.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-09T17:29:49.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At level 10 you've got access to every spell, but even before that you have access to enough to not be at a massive disadvantage spell-wise. Your biggest disadvantage is the personal experience, which should be accounted for in match making putting someone equally skilled on your team.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
