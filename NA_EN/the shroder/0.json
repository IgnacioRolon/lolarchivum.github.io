When I play on NA, for some reason my mouse is very unresponsive and doesn't have consistent sensitivity. I've tried making my mouse sensitivity higher and lowering all my graphic settings to near unplayable levels yet none of that solves the issue. My MS is generally never higher than 30 and my FPS is always around 60 when this is happening. The weirdest part about this issue is that when I alt-tab out of the game the problems disappear, and the time I played a few games with my old friends on EUW the problems also disappeared. Any thoughts on how I could solve this issue? I am playing on a Mac.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-07T15:26:54.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your mouse settings in-game is independent of your PC settings, so it may vary.
