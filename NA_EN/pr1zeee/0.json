Maybe there's some kind of loophole in Discord, that enables an attacker to set the discord server's icon to a URL of a specially designed file that is executed to extract the image but actually installs a keylogger as a drive by download attack.\n\nThen they request you to do something in you account like changing the summoner icon, to give you an incentive to log in, which is when they steal your password via the logger.
