It used to pop up immediately for me, but recently its been taking 30-45 seconds to pop up. What could be causing this and how do I fix it?\r\n\r\nBTW, I uninstalled and reinstalled already, but that didnt fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T01:34:15.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client can take awhile to show the honor screen if you have the option \"close client during game\" turned on.
