When that happens, nobody has fun. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not having fun getting raged at by Faker Jr, or watching him ask the enemy team to report me because I died a few times in a videogame. Faker Jr isn&#039;t having any fun with a guy went support Teemo, is joking about Harambe in the all chat and doesn&#039;t particularly care if he gets killed.\r\n\r\nNeither of us is wrong. Both of us are paying customers. Both of us are just trying to enjoy the game in the way that&#039;s the most fun to each of us. Neither of us should be punished but more importantly, neither of us should ever cross paths. People who want to be serious should be paired with other people who want to be serious.

Personally I don't go looking up everyone's match history before reading and responding to posts. The OP just brought up an interesting idea, and people are interested in discussing it. And honestly, for OP to be self-aware enough to admit that perhaps their style of playing League doesn't line up with others' and want to be able to separate the two is pretty awesome.\n\nAnd in no way did anybody say this 'troll queue' is actually happening.

Silliness is an inherent quality of games like Hexakill or Legend of the Poro King. However, even in games like URF or Ascension, you still find people obsessed with winning. I'll still get flamed if I don't go 3000/0/Infinity as Teemo, or oneshot a turret as Master Yi.\n\nCustom games would be an excellent way to circumvent the (to be fair) small portion of the community that will never be satisfied without a complete victory. However, you need 10 like-minded people to start a silly game on Summoner's Rift, and ten people willing to play a throwaway game is difficult, even among friends, not to mention caps to the amount of friends you can have, and whether or not they're all on at one time! So a troll queue would not only be a gameplay judgement-free place, but also a place for people from other continents to connect and watch an attack speed Bard destroy in bottom lane. \n\nTherefore, I think a \"troll queue\" would consist of games without any reward- no experience, no IP, no chests, nothing- thus creating an incentive for serious players to play anything but the Troll games.
