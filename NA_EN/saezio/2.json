Which are the requirement for 24/7 ques. Honor system in custom games is really bad for overall match quality. People lie about skill so you had  weak players in \"pros only\" And you had very experienced players in \"noobs only\"  A single 1 off  game would frequently have gross misdistributions of teams.\n\nWhich is fine, if your doing a string of games. Because you can readjust the teammates for the next game.  In older years of Leauge I have done this with friends and we have made some pretty great games with large skill gaps in players.\n\n> And lastly, it would make duoing have actual visible drawbacks. With the added benefit of being able to play AGAINST your duo if it so happens\n\nThe only fear I have for that is some one soft ints to win trade.\n\nThe things I'm contemplating are if its possible to have a Player draft into 5 man teams and if the Club System can be reworked into something to encourage 5 man Premades for Competitive Ranked games.\n\nMostly trying to find how many ways things can be abused because that's absolutely what will happen if you give folks the opportunity >&lt;","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2020-01-28T19:47:48.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't lie about skill if all your stats are there.\n\nRole Winrate, matches played, favored champs, winrate on champs.

I don't see a way to build a Training set for a Machine learning program that is not going to have some real Bias issues.\n\nSo Main champs and WR are what's likely to remain helpful but Main champions wont help when some one goes off the wall and picks something random.\n\n> Also, this is only for solo/duo queue not for draft.\n\nMake the fleshed out idea. Write out the steps and what's needed to accomplish them. IMO when you try to build something then tear it apart you learn a lot of useful information.\n\n> And if you are duo with someone and want to wintrade, it would be pretty easy for the system to detect that. also, you got no guarantee you won't end up in the same team anyway.\n\nI would shy away from allowing premades in this model personally.  Of topic but I would like to see Riot work on lowering Smurfs in ranked. Targeting the folks who are not looking to win but to pub stomp.  Some one makes a new account and climbs to X rank to prove hey they can do it consistently?  I am ok with that. \n\nSome one who goes and loses 35 games back to back so they can pub stomp the next 20? Not cool.  55 matches just got trashed for some ones ego impacting up to a max  mix of 495 players with unpredictable negativity.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-28T01:03:09.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why, though?\n\nNobody would put any thought into picking utter randoms they know nothing about, and it would just be a waste of time and room for more drama/quitting.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2020-01-28T01:13:12.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you would see their stats, rank, champions picked etc when picking.\n\nSimilar to what you see with addons, but for all other 9 players","replies":[]}]}]}
