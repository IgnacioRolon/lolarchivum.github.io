But it's just so damn dangerous in TFT.\r\n\r\nEven if you win a TFT match the game only lasts like what 35 mins? I think that is too low and it should be closer to 45-50 minutes.\r\n\r\nAlso, on another note, how does it make any sense that 1st place gets more points than 8th place loses? Or even 2nd place at some instances. Or does this just happen if MMR is good?","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-09-09T15:20:59.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The higher loss than win has always been a feature of ANY Riot game to ensure climbing is \"Legitimate.\"\n\nFrom what I can tell, it's working too, because one guy has TWO of the top 10 Challenger accounts.\n\nMeaning...... this is a skill based game, because that wouldn't occur on \"Luck.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-09-09T16:18:16.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand the first sentence of your comment. \n\nI agree skill is a huge part of TFT, especially if we make a large sample size (sure you need a bit of luck to be 1st place amongst others with the same MMR) like 100 tft matches.\n\nIn fact you are one of the few people on these boards that share my view on how TFT is a mode based mostly on tactical prowess and also to an extent QUICK FUCKING CLICKING.\n\n\nEdit: if your first sentence refers to my last remark about LP, I said the opposite, that I get more LP for winning and lose LESS for losing.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-09-09T18:00:46.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saezio,realm=EUNE,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=ZjkOUjvN,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-09-09T16:18:16.967+0000)\n>\n> I don't understand the first sentence of your comment. \n> \n> I agree skill is a huge part of TFT, especially if we make a large sample size (sure you need a bit of luck to be 1st place amongst others with the same MMR) like 100 tft matches.\n> \n> In fact you are one of the few people on these boards that share my view on how TFT is a mode based mostly on tactical prowess and also to an extent QUICK FUCKING CLICKING.\n> \n> \n> Edit: if your first sentence refers to my last remark about LP, I said the opposite, that I get more LP for winning and lose LESS for losing.\n\n8th place loses anywhere from 30-80 LP depending on Elo UNLESS you hit 0 LP.\n\nThe best time to lose a match is when you are 7-8 LP, if you have to average out and lose matches, because 0 is a hard basement.\n\nIn other words, USUALLY, losing loses more LP than winning gains. Even at good MMR.\n\nIf your #1 wins are giving a lot of LP, your account is new and low elo.\n\nAnd yes. Game is about knowing R button exists, and evaluating your opponents and building what is given to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-09-09T18:57:52.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've not played much.

If you spend your gold early, you're making a risk by not getting interest, so there needs to be an effective benefit.  Right now that benefit is being able to knock out your opponents unless they're able to catch up in time.  \n\nLikewise you should have a reward for risking being knocked out when you save up your money.  Right now if you can survive while saving, you end up being able to vastly over-roll and over-buy compared to your opponents that went for an early stat.  If the game were lengthened by not damaging as much, you would remove the risk of saving, and there would be only one strat: save to 50 before spending.\n\nKeeping it the way it is is healthy for allowing multiple strategies.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-09-08T18:06:47.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"getting from 50 to 30 hp in one round should not be a thing imo.\n\nBut I guess we got different views on the matter.\n\nThe thing is, sometimes you are FORCED to save money, you are never forced to spend early though.","replies":[]}]}]}
