Because making this skill grab sett's sides would actually introduce skill to the fucking champ. When you chase you would need to turn sideways to grab your target.\r\n\r\nRight now it just feels stupid to me.\r\n\r\nWhat do you people think? Have you EVER in the history of EVER, or in any fiction seen ANYONE bash 2 heads together like Sett does it?\r\n\r\nJust wondering.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2020-02-14T10:58:52.975+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"...
