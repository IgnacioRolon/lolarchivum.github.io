I am saying consistent honorable behaviour should cancel past valid reports THAT DID NOT RESULT IN PUNISHMENT provided the good behaviour is long enough. \nso if you call someone a noob once every 1000 games for 3k games your punishment should not be the same as someone who does this in the span of 30 games.

But the point is that honorable behaviour is not nearly as detrimental to one's account standing as dishonorable behaviour. \nMy question is : how many honorable games should cancel out one dishonorable game. 50?100? 200?

The whole point of having a high honor standing is to know that you're displaying a sportsmanlike and positive behaviour (or at least remaining neutral).

I also question the morality of diminishing negative behavior because of past good behavior -- as well as being fairly exploitable. \n\nCourts in the US (even traffic/magistrate courts) utilize mitigating/aggravating circumstances, one of those being past behavior. But they never use them to try and **completely** balance the scale because we still need to be judged in the present for the most part.\n\nTo one of your points though... I think not allowing enemies to honor each other is completely ludicrous for exactly the reason you pointed out. I understand their logic: we want as many chances to find bad behavior as we possibly can. Like you mentioned though, why shouldn't we also be looking for chances to find **great behavior** as well? \n\nI _hate_ the fixation with finding negativity.
