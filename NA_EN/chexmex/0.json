Thou shall not blame thy teammate for thy death, for thy death was likely the cause of thy own stupidity. Thou shalt make better choices and use thy head.\r\n\r\n2. Thy rank reflects upon thy skill level, if subject is bronze, that person plays like bronze. If you deserve a rank, you will most definitely reach it.\r\n\r\n3. Our good lord Rito blessed us with the mute button, use it if you must. Careful to not use it too much, you are subject to being banned for refusing to communicate (It happened to the innocents, our good lord Rito is wrong most of the time).\r\n\r\n4. Thou must understand bad games occur. Just because somebody does poorly in a game does not automatically mean they are bad and should kill themselves or uninstall (Yes, players actually say this to eachother).\r\n\r\n5. Thou shalt not pester thy support for wards, for each good man may only place wards thrice. Be a good man of Rito and place some yourself.\r\n\r\n6. If thou whishest to climb upon the ladder of ELO, you must understand that even though your team is pulling you down - you must climb even harder.\r\n\r\n7. Worship no other Rito.\r\n\r\n8. Often times, players who have no idea what they are talking about think they know everything solely because they don&#039;t know exactly how much they don&#039;t know. On the flipside, players that know significantly more pressure themselves more for being ignorant. Be a good Ritostian and follow the path of Challenger with an open mind. You do not know everything, yet you do not know nothing.\r\n\r\n9. If thou is unranked, please do not be bashful to offer advice to other players above your rank, however please at the same time do not argue with a Challenger player thinking thou knowest more. If thou is challenger, please offer whatever advice you can give and do not belittle players for not knowing as much as you. Do not flaunt your knowledge... Or your lack of.\r\n\r\n10.  Understand that Reginald is the only pro player without a video of his highlights.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-05-25T22:00:15.134+0000","up_votes":65,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Commandment 0]  Thou shalt kill Teemo whenever an opportunity shall arise, for the Devil resides 'neath its fur and it's blood is toxic to the righteous.","replies":[{"poster":"DittleLick","date":"2015-05-25T23:24:21.082+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"omg yes LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Commit Sudoku","date":"2015-05-25T20:03:35.020+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":1,"body":"Top lane Commandments\n1.
