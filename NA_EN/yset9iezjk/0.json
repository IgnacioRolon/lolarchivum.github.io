Vel&#x27;koz is objectively a bad champion right now. Pick an assassin into Vel and he will be eaten alive. Yasuo, Talon, Zed, Akali, Kassadin, etc. Play Anivia into him and blow him up. Play Syndra and one shot him. \n> \n> I understand that he might be a frustrating champion for you, but he is harmless to the vast, vast majority of players which means it is a you thing and not a champion thing.\n> \n> Now, you can send me a paragraph long, detailed description of why he is OP, but he isn&#x27;t. You&#x27;re simply playing badly, or playing poor champions into him.\n\nNot agreeing with the op, but I wouldn't say he's countered by assassins and weak right now.\n\nIf anything he's one of the go to champions against assassins since any of them with a blink can be knocked up and combo'd to oblivion.\n\nIf akali Q+R and a good vel puts down an E in them, that akali is taking all his spells to the face losing 80% of her health followed by a true damage ultimate. The only assassin I'd say is good against vel is zed maybe and thats because he has ranged free poke under tower and able to dive+escape vel easily, but thats zed against anything. Yasuo looks like a counter in theory due to wall and manaless, but that wall is only available so much and vel still has his other abilities and can q to the side behind it, also it doesn't block his ultimate if vel cast his ultimate before yasuo cast windwall (tested, it just divides the ulti making a weird split).\n\nRight now he's strong cause he's low risk, high reward and players don't know how to cope with low risk high reward champions. He can just stand back under tower and farm all day while shooting a side Q to land, then combo for an instant kill. The only thing bad about vel'koz is he is immobile, and easy to gank by the jungle if he pushes even slightly. He's weak as a seige champion since outside of his tower he's vurnable and can't take towers quickly before getting stopped. He's basically extremely safe and hard to lose lane as, but winning lane himself isn't the best.\n\nHonestly, I don't find vel anymore universally uncounterable than {{champion:103}} who has poke and mobility and more reliable CC, but he's just as safe for a blind pick mid.

Then he has his knock up ability, which on top of that was one major mis'conception i had with Vel'koz's true damage schmick.\n\nOriginally i thought once he hits stack 3, his abilities would have partial true damage for its duration but instead its just a bonus damage hit when that third stack hit that does bonus true damage with a base and 50% bonus AP scaling. Plus his ultimate only requires you to have a single stack of 'deconstructing' on it to translate the ultimate's damage to true damage and it still applies deconstructing stacks once every .7 seconds during it (thank god its capped to 3) so he has a second detonation of true damage which makes it so powerful.\n\nThe critical downside to his kit is that its not very good against mobile champions who can easily get away from his linear sort of telegraph'd attacks and since his autos cant really 'place' stacks, then he isn't as much of a problem. The important part to counter Vel'koz early game is to avoid the majority of his shot style attack pattern and take advantage between them to trade blast him in the process while he's stuck on a few CDs. He can only spam his Q once every 7 seconds without CDR and its 19~15 'recharge time' seconds for his stock spam and 16~12 for his knock up. So if he isn't building CDR yet, you can likely get away with trade blasting him a bit if you manage to dodge his knock up and maybe his Q too. Just obviously don't trade for too long so he can't get his Q slow on you to then wombo it into his E and his W combo.\n\nIts ultimately a matter of not letting him free hit enemies to get his true damage power to fire off so when he isn't focused on he can freely rip apart any champion's hp with those true damage gimmicks. I will ATLEAST admit that Vel'koz is not as horrible as other champions who don't need as many button presses because they have passive gimmicks to overload them into massacre level tier. I won't list them because i'm already a broken record in listing them.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DJMason88","date":"2016-08-30T22:12:17.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You cant let him get a full combo off.
