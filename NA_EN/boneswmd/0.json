Seems to be only on league, no other games.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So for the past two weeks or so my ping will shoot up to around 300-500 ping every 2 minutes or so. As you probably can tell, that is completely unplayable. I have tried resetting my router multiple times, I have reset the ethernet, reconnected to wifi. Is there anything else that can help me fix this issue?
