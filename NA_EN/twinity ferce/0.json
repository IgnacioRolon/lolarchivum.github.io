You'll find any important announcements about these and other events on our [**News Page**](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/).\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Twinity Ferce","date":"2017-02-06T12:16:49.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. \n\nWell, i do actually. \n\nHow many unique event types do you think the game can support? \n\nWill there ever be events that come with their own \"custom items\" such as the ones we got to play with in Black market brawlers? Or was that a one time only thing?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-08T21:48:31.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I'm not sure. Since I work on the Player Support team, I don't have a lot of visibility of what our teams are doing with Events or Game Modes and the challenges they face. I'm sure they're working on some awesome content for us and I can't wait to see what the rest of the year holds for League of Legends of the community as a whole. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Twinity Ferce","date":"2017-02-08T21:58:34.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well then, regarding player support - do you have a lot of people working in that team? I frequently see comments and threads complaining about all the \"automatic\" responses related to support.\n\nAlso, if it isn't confidential, how many messages related to permanent bans do you recieve on average per week?\n\nDo you keep a record over how many accounts are banned?\n\nHow many players have recieved indefinite bans in this game? Such as Tyler1, that is? Its fine if you cant disclose their nicknames due to the rule against naming and shaming, i'm just interested in the numbers.\n\nOh and lastly, one a little more personal: Do you have a specific role in your team?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-02-09T22:16:12.183+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw your questions and wanted to help answer them as best as I can:\n\nWhile I can't give you an exact number, there are quite a lot of people who work in Player Support.  We have [offices all around the world](http://www.riotgames.com/riot-manifesto), and there is a Player Support presence in the majority of these offices so we can provide the best experience for each individual region.  \n\nAbout how we respond to requests, our agents do sometimes use prepared  responses, but they are all customized and handwritten before we send a response.  We do use automated responses for a few select issues, but in these cases we tell you immediately and up-front that you are talking to a bot, and you can talk to a real person if you want to.\n\nRegarding your data/metrics questions, these are things I'm not really able to share.  However, we do collect a massive amount of information to let us know how we are doing, and how we can provide even better support.\n\nLastly, as for a specific role, Targons Blade is in Player Support helping answer player questions on Boards, as well as on our @RiotSupport Twitter account.  Myself, I help manage various social media platforms (including Boards) specifically regarding Support.\n\nI know I wasn't able to answer all of your questions, but I hope this satisfies some curiosity!","replies":[{"poster":"Twinity Ferce","date":"2017-02-09T22:49:20.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is much more than i thought i'd get!
