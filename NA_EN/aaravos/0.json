Most single target ults are targeted - Lee Sin, Syndra, etc, so if you want Liss's ult to be a skillshot it has to become an AOE stun.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-02-05T15:34:15.743+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"—and we have Sejuani for that already, soooo, single target stun makes more sense (especially since she can also ult herself).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lojician","date":"2015-02-05T15:00:01.448+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'm going to actually talk about lissandra and not care about the intended point of op's thread because she really is a broken piece of shit.

After she facerolls lane she's just blatantly superior to the people she just facerolled because of utility, cc, and damage creep.\n\nI would say her scaling is quite poor compared to your average mage, though she does come with more CC than your average mage (and mobility is also quite unique to her). That said her invincibility is tied to either Zhonya's or her ult and if she uses both of those on herself then her CC is actually mediocre, consisting entirely of two separate slows and an AOE snare (which isn't bad but if you're choosing someone for their CC you expect actual disables).\n\nShe has trade-offs - if she goes for survivability by ulting herself then she instantly becomes less of a team fight presence than (as regards mid laners) someone like Orianna (I'd take Shockwave over Lissandra's AOE slow/snare) or Syndra and (as regards top laners), people like Sion and Gnar. Plus, the act of teleporting into the enemy team leaves you very vulnerable unless your invincibility can ride out the entire team fight. As an APC she is very, very prone to being focused and when your entire team fight plan is \"dive in and hope your invincibility is enough to keep you safe for the entire fight\", you're taking a big risk.\n\nLiss to me seems like a meta pick rather than a \"sleeper OP\" champ. She's one of the best anti-assassins in the game, being one of few mages capable of fending off Zed, and her mana passive is more valuable than typically due to the recent gutting of Athene's Unholy Grail. Both of those things are massive advantages to her. Team fight compositions are popular right now and Liss fits right in there too, alongside other popular top laners like Gnar, Sion and more recently Lulu.\n\nLiss is arguably a bit too good *in this meta* but I don't think that's because of any inherent toxic nature in her kit, because I think a lot of it really is quite fair. I would say she is only performing so strongly because the game right now is arguably about as Lissandra-friendly as it could possibly be, while being very unfriendly to everyone she competes with. If she gets nerfed and then the meta changes to not suit her she will completely collapse in playability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pleep","date":"2015-02-05T20:13:47.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lojician,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9b13GkZ7,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-02-05T15:00:01.448+0000)\n>\n> I'm going to actually talk about lissandra and not care about the intended point of op's thread because she really is a broken piece of shit.
