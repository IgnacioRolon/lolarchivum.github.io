I also am the only one to ever access the account and have never used a boosting service that may have used 3rd party software on the account. The ban completely dumbfounds me and is 100% a mistake.  I have spent so much time and money on that account only to have it taken away in a mistake.\n\nI made a support ticket explaining the situation but have yet to receive a response. I also have noticed several other players seem to be dealing with the same issue as me. It seems Riot has banned quite a few accounts incorrectly for 3rd party program use in their latest ban wave. If anyone has any suggestions for what i should do to get my account back please let me know. This is bullshit.\n\nEdit 1: Just got a seemingly automated response from Riot saying this. \n\"Our system has accurate evidence that your account was in violation of our Terms of Use due to the usage of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in the game. After I double checked your account, it doesn't look like this was a mistake.\n\nFor security purposes on our investigative methods, I will not be sharing more detailed evidence or specific details. We will not be lifting the ban on this account under any circumstances. \"\n\nI am absolutely crushed. As i said before, I have never, NEVER, used any 3rd party software or messed with the client. This is 100% a mistake and now it seems my account is gone. I have no idea what do, possibly pursue legal action? Let me know if anyone knows what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2017-04-11T23:33:16.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you get an automated response you just have to respond to that.
