I won't say how things go in high elo though.) You had damage/range balance to a T, no traditional support/adc duo required.\n\nWhat gets iffy though are all-melee teams. I mean, sure, you might win. But sometimes, you reach this massive up-hill climb near midgame, where you CANNOT gain further objectives, even if you're ahead. No ranged against a team with ranged just... crushes your siege potential.\n\nI bet there are solutions to that though:\n\n{{champion:107}} : Hey Rammy, go stand under that tower for me.\n{{champion:33}} : Okay.\n{{champion:107}} : I know y- ... wow that was easy.\n\nDid I mention his ult damages towers?
