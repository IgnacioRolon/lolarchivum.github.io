Is that adding a bot is basically pointless for a few reasons.\n\n1: it has only two difficulty options, and i can&#039;t edit then mid game.\n2: it will never become fed or spend gold how I want it to\n3: It will take forever for it to have exp.\n\nSo  let&#039;s say i&#039;m an Ahri main, and I want to test out/find THE BEST BUILD for killing tanks who stacked magic resist. Unless I physically sit down and start number crunching on my own. I have no way to actually find out outside of experience. Something I feel will make practice tool great if I can do the following.\n\nI can have a bot in my game, I can control if it fights me or not, I can control how i want it to play, aggressive or scared, and I can control what items it buys, and what level I want it to be.\n\nExample\n\nI want the ability to make sion level 18, I want him to stand completely still and not fight me, I want to give him {{item:3194}} {{item:3193}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3748}}. \n\nFor the practice dummies are useful and serve their own feature, but they lack a way to reliably see &quot;how fast can I kill actual champions&quot; \n\nJust the simple ability to create my own practice dummy, chose what champ it is, and what items and levels it has, would be great.\n\nPlease consider \n","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-26T00:59:36.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So let's say i'm an Ahri main, and I want to test out/find THE BEST BUILD for killing tanks who stacked magic resist.\n\nDo some basic math instead of hitting shit in PT and eyeballing the results.\n\nHint: you basically have one choice: {{item:3135}} ","replies":[]}]}
