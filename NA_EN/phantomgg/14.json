They were actually what they were supposed to be for once. Any ADC that got to late game did fine and could carry. The only issue was the whole first turret gold and people all going bot lane early, but ADCs came online when they were supposed to. It's not that everyone's complaining about the same thing when change takes place. There are different people who have different opinions. There are quite a lot of people who play league.

The only time I remember ADCs being talked about being \"bad\" was when there were 4 man bot ganks because junglers got ahead faster than anyone, and the whole first turret gold thing first came about, making it really easy to snowball one side. ADCs weren't bad at that point, literally nothing changed about them. when they got ahead, or got to actual late game, they carried. Most games just didn't last that long and ADCs cried until Riot buffed their asses to where they could kill everyone at one and a half items, while also buffing supports, taking mid laner items and giving them to them, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-05-14T05:41:10.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atrushan2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EvYc3Foy,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2018-05-14T05:32:11.218+0000)\n>\n> Lethality came after that, and at that point Jhin/MF were basically owning the game.

Otherwise you mean the one week before lethality got nerfed and the whole varus/ash started? that last around 3 months maybe 2 tbh\n\nafter that crit adcs came back after people complained that they were bad","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-05-14T05:45:03.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Too Unlucky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EvYc3Foy,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-14T05:41:10.819+0000)\n>\n> Are you talking about when lethality was first intoduced? or right before when ghostblade gave attackspeed and twitch/draven handled everyone with that as first item?
