Some people can&#039;t even get into the game at all or just DC all together.\r\n\r\nWe have a problem with the game, when players are to afraid to play ranked for they have to ask themselves\r\n\r\n&quot;is league going to behave today, or am I going to get a unjust timer penalty because the client chose to crash&quot;\r\n\r\nI will also say &quot;just use legacy&quot; is not a huge solution either, for legacy itself was already a bad client, that was the whole reason riot spent a year making a new one.\r\n\r\nSo what are the players stuck with?\r\n\r\nTwo shitty clients that don&#039;t work.\r\n\r\nRiot stop making new champions. Stop making new skins.\r\n\r\nGet your teams to just make a good client already.\r\n\r\nHire some coders who actually know what they are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"CleverSloth","date":"2016-12-13T01:21:23.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, I have experienced two main things:\n\nFirst and most frustrating, I go in and get a game, then instead of the loading screen a popup comes up saying my internet connection was lost.

This has been affecting a lot of players, and it had a pretty odd user path.  So yay for that fix.\n\nFor the fps issue, do you happen to have more info to what you're seeing?  Are you seeing any process hitches for the LeagueClient, or is it strictly game related?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ruach","date":"2016-12-13T21:08:36.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus, useless leaver buster can't even filter out if the user had a connection error or intentionally exit (or afk) the game.

I have had the most unusual errors in game and loading games recently. I am fed up with how slow riot is to resolve these issues. It isn't hard to listen to the the public, and fix these minor  issues. I have no way to submit feedback or glitches. It is beyond acceptable to have a partially working game for weeks. There is my most biased opinion for you all.

I`m tired of relogging every time I get high ping because of the shitty alpha client.","replies":[]}]}
