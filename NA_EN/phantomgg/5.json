There was complaining that we were in a damage meta and that masteries were the biggest contributor to this. A big part of it was all the %damage increases that were loaded into the ferocity and cunning trees.\n\nthe other big part was brand and zyra dominating the support role and topscoring damage every game.\n\nThe masteries were fixed at some point though, when they outright nerfed the %damage increases all around the trees and the only problem that existed with the game then became ardent censer.\n\nI can only assume that the reason why the refuse to just revert to the old system when it was functionally perfection, is because they believe that they can fix the current runes the same way.\n\n\nPersonally I think one of the best changes they could do, is to remove the passive stats (attackspeed, ad/ap adaptive/flat health) and just put that power into our starting items. One of the things we were going to get with runes reforged was a rework to our starting items (a dorans blade variant that came with attackspeed for instance) but it never came because of time constraints.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Percentages","date":"2018-08-02T10:52:29.489+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"I would kill your cat in a sacrifice to satan to have old runes back...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2018-08-02T14:42:46.498+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":7,"body":"Old runes and mastery tree was also a LOT of freedom and more fun to play with.

I don't think reverting runes to the old system is a good idea, as we should strive for something that allows you to customize how you want to play your champions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-08-02T14:37:26.183+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"I personally vote that we remove runes altogether at this point. For sure, the old system was better than the current one, but it had some serious issues as well, namely that the stat customization options it offered were fixed in the vast majority of cases. Keystones from the previous seasons also warped gameplay, whereas the masteries beforehand all offered less visible bonuses that may have well been more stats or item passives (many of the new ones could be the latter as well). In every case, there was little choice involved, because people still gravitated towards around one set build per champion. Cutting out all of this, and instead allowing champions better customization within matches, I think should be the way to go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-08-02T08:28:31.140+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":8,"body":"Here's the core issue: Popularity\n\nIt isn't that you don't have options.
