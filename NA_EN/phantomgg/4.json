He has some swipes and of course, his glowing eyes when he activates bloodscent.\n\nThese \"new\" Eve skins are also awesome, her before rework model was horribly outdated. But it still doesn't change the fact that she hasn't had a skin in years, with gaps of years between skins. That's the reason why i want some justice for Eve and also because i main her so that's a given. She's quickly going down the road where Viktor and Cass were before their skins.\n\nOn the side note, i saw on some FB page that there's a rumor on more SG skins and among those are Eve and Cait. I love Star Guardian skin line but i don't particularly care for them in general. They aren't the types of skins i want to own. If this turns out to be true, i'd be pretty disappointed in a _**long awaited**_ skin for Eve, only for it to turn out to be a  Star Guardian. But i'd still begrudgingly buy it from My Shop or wait for a discount/hextech crafting to drop because i want to own all of her skins. It doesn't mean i'd use it at all.\n\nIt doesn't even mean the rumored skin itself is going to be bad (subpar), it's just that i don't see how Eve would fit into it except by force. Unless they do her VO to support the skin itself, her whole thing about getting pleasure from pain and suffering of others is directly in conflict of what Star Guardians are supposed to stand for. So the skin itself would have to at least be 1820 RP (if VO is included). If this isn't included, then the skin would feel forced on her just for the sake of giving her a skin.\n\nI'd much rather see a Dark Star Eve or even \"Ancient\" Eve skin that could Darkin-ify her in some sexy way.","replies":[{"poster":"AIIan","date":"2017-12-21T18:29:04.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tomoe Gozen,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Pyd2fJ8J,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-21T14:27:48.986+0000)\n>\n> >I want a new Eve's skin\n> >Actually, I don't simply want old but reworked skins, I want **entirely new** skins.\n> >Scrap that, I don't want a new skin, I want a new skin I like based on my entirely personal tastes.\n\nGood Lord.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2017-12-21T19:11:51.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"My personal tastes have no bearing to what's actually being made for Eve, if the rumor for SG Eve is true.

Maybe they could release the skin on the day it self??\nAlso it’s the year of the dog! Warwick or a skin and he is a wolf. You know who else is a wolf!? All I’m saying is this would be a COMPLETE missed opportunity!

She/they aren't going to be popular or really used until then or she/they are moved bot lane. Because she/they honestly suck as a jungler and really don't fit many team comps as a jungler. At least graves has a bunch of front loaded burst. Kindred doesn't and can be set behind very easily.\n\nOnly reason she/they aren't used is because a jungle marksmen is a liability unless they are oppressive early like graves and Ezreal. Both of them have very high damage early game so when they gank early they can contribute. Kindred doesn't really that much until she has stacks and at least 2 items.\n\nNow how this relates is she/they isn't going to be played much so she/they won't get many skins because of it. If her/their game balance is improved and players are given a reliable reason to pick her/them and bring their pick rate up. Then riot will make skins for her/them.\n\nPopularity and pick rate determine skin frequency.

Hell, marksmen as a whole aren't not balanceable as junglers, they are barely balanced as duo laners or solo laners. Either send Kindred bot or let them mid lane as a roamer type champion. Which by way would still fit their hunting theme. I mean if you want them to always be influx of either OP or so weak that people make memes about \"who is that?\" on the levels of Aatrox. Then go ahead and keep that head buried in the sand. Far be it from me to tell you the truth if you want to play a poorly thought out champ and want to be on that pendulum ride of nerfs and buffs.\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"AlexTheGrandWolf","date":"2017-12-22T10:57:17.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how the fuck would kindred mid work?how can she roam to gank and at the same time get her marks and at the same time fucking farm at mid and at the same time get her mark objectives?","replies":[{"poster":"Jinx Hunter","date":"2017-12-22T15:02:44.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Easy.

They're not weak, and they're not much stronger than other Junglers. Only advantages they have are their early ganks and the fact that they can scale into the lategame if they have marks.\n\nThey're not a burden if the player (temporarily) takes armor items. (Don't nerf a champion just because some players won't play it properly. That's how you end up with Azir.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
