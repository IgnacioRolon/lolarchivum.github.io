My main got banned perm (I deserved it) so I had this as my original account and was using it as a smurf. In preseason, when my alt was banned, I climbed from B5-S5 before the reset and man that shit was hella annoying.\nBut this season I've tried something new. \nI've been super positive in all my games and have been shotcalling a ton and roaming/ganking and just doing as much as I can to put my team ahead and I have a 60% winrate right now and have climbed from b5 - my placement, to almost b1 now in like 45 games :)\nThe best part is, this time climbing out has been soo much less stressful than climbing out in preseason.\n\nBeing a gold player in bronze is obv helping with the wins but theres no way my winrate would be over 50% if I wasnt overly positive and shotcalling..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2016-02-24T05:32:13.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on playstyle and meta.  My best support, Sona, is kinda meh right now IMO, so I don't really play the role much currently because I feel super useless.  Last season though I had a 75% winrate or something absurd like that on her and just flattened people in lane and then dominated the game with ward control.\n\nNow that wards are trash compared to last season my playstyle got nerfed, and I'm suffering in my other roles too because ward control in midlane especially was one of my biggest strengths as a player.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-02-24T05:17:00.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've cruised up a full tier now since my placements with no sign of slowing pretty much exlcusively as support (and almost exclusively Janna support at that). \n\nPeople can climb/carry as any role if they're good at it, lots of people are just rather bad at support since they think it's 'easy' mindless warding or whatever, and then complain when that doesn't win them their game.","replies":[{"poster":"Beldair","date":"2016-02-24T05:23:23.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But some Support loses are from the team not working well together.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-02-24T05:30:52.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So are some <insert any other role> losses. It is a team game, and even a diamond+ smurf is going to have a hard time carrying if the team won't work together.\n\nYou might say that a diamond+ smurf is going to have their best chance of carrying if they're on a champ that can potentially 1v5 (i.e. not most support champs), but really a particularly skilled support is going to be able to basically spoon feed kills to a carry and/or being able to intervene and prevent their suicidal teammates from feeding by well timed shields/heals/peel.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-02-24T05:27:49.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Started at Bronze 3 this placement,\nAlmost Gold 5 (Silver 1 Currently), playing around 1 game a day as exclusively support, I think my win rate so far is somewhere in the high 60/low 70 percent range as a support. \n\nIts definitely possible to carry yourself as a support, and you don't need to use Brand or Lux to do it, I've been doing it almost exclusively with Nami.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paladin 0f Life","date":"2016-02-24T05:18:24.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the sup.
