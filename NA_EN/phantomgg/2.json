Mathematically unless the enemy team with 5 does the most major screw up, the team with four will always lose.\n\nTo those who go\n\n&quot;Ive won four v fives&quot;\n\nYou only won it for the enemy team allowed you to win, mathematically you should not of won it at all or had a chance.\n\nIn a legit four v five where the enemy team knows simply off pure basic addition that they are stronger, they will turn the game into a bully charge as a five man group and take all the towers, as the team with four is near helpless.\n\nWhat should be implemented?\n\nIf a person dcs within the first twenty minutes of the game and has not reconnected within 4 minutes the game should be automatically canceled no lp or ip given to either party.\n\nTo those who say this is a abuseable season\n\nRiot is a smart group of people, they should be able to figure something out\n\nThis is not a salt post, this is a issue that has existed for over 4 years that has yet to be given a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-03-03T04:28:42.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks for clearing that up about the loading screen dcs.\n\nAs for Dcs in the first 20 min of the game.\n\nI like the idea of punishing anyone in a que with them to ward off the exploit of smurf accounts or accounts people would use to dodge when playing with friends.  \n\nThe only other problem is toxicity in game as a result.  (I believe riot may have addressed this as one of their reasons for not implementing a lp refund for dcs yet but I can't find the source) \n\nI can easily see 4 people abusing whoever is 0/4 or 0/5 until they leave the game.

They don't happen enough to affect your overall rank by the end of the season and statistically speaking they happen just as much to the enemy team if not more. \n\nThis particular dc is even more rare.  Typically people dc midway through a match. 10-15 min in, they rage quit or ping spikes or have to go eat dinner or whatever their reason is.
