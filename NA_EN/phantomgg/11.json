In other words, the game persists and hasn't died because the money is there with the teams and players that keep its economy solid. Faker got a 2.5 million dollar contract to play with SKT which is akin to some low level, bench riding players in professional sports. \n\nAs long as the money and the critical acclaim to professional leaguing remains, it will never die. Once Faker and other pro players and streamers decide to jump ship, then the game will start to decay. Unfortunately, most of the players on league don't give a fuck about the game. They don't read the patch notes, they don't study the game. Instead, they come home, zone out and remain in a low level of awareness in a game that demands a coherent community.

Oh wait yeah because real supports dont have an impact on the game unless you're really good so why not just play a damage supp and carry it yourself?\n\nJungle by the retarded amount of mini-reworks it's received over time. First with the smite buff removals, then with the plants, then with the clear times, then with the catchup exp, then with this new scuttle and exp shit. Every 6 months junglers have to relearn their role, and despite being probably the role with the largest variety rito seems insistent on rotating which 5 champs are actually viable. \n\nTops either have no impact on the match and are on a farm island, or are monsters that just shit all over the map with TP and a slight lead. Every single matchup is feast or famine now. As someone who mostly plays toplaners, I can say that all skill expression from this lane has been removed. If you have a bad matchup in top your best hope is to sit under tower and [ray your bot and mid don't also feed. Top used to be about skill and who could make more outplays 1v1. Now it's all stat checking. Case in point being Ornn and Nasus. Ornn was overloaded and his damage was too high. They remove the unstoppable instead of just nerfing his fucking W because yeah... thats the problem riot... not him chunking me every 5 seconds for 20% of my HP while he gets a huge shield so i cant retaliate.... And then nasus used to be a hyper scaler that would take over a game provided it goes long enough and hes good at managing waves. Now Nasus plays like this: \"did I get 6?\" if answer is yes, you win lane from now on. If answer is no, don't die and wait until 6. Nasus literally beats anyone in a 1v1 at 6 even without that many stacks. Including fiora. He's just so overwhelming. \n\nAnd finally... mids. Assassins are eternally in this limbo of being too potent against ADCs and enchanters and yet useless against everything else. Riot doesn't want them to do their job. Meanwhile they just gut the shit outta mages at every opportunity even though mages are only good to get enemies to waste gold buying MR so that the ADC can shred them. And occasionally pull off big AoE cc.","replies":[]}]}
