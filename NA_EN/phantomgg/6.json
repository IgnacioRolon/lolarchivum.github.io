Last year in EU we had Origen who completely crushed the Challenger scene, and than for a long period of time destroyed the EU scene. Than finnally we had Fnatic who cleanly swept the entire region in a 18 n 0 win streek and even took on the second best team and gave a very convincing win over them. The top 3 teams in EU could not be challenged by the lower 7, occasionally a upset would happen but fact was, top 3 in eu, were the unchallenged kings. \r\n\r\nMoving onto NA, we had teams like TSM, who won a international event, very strongly for that matter, we had CLG were itching to prove they could win to. And while cloud nine did fall off for a short period of time, they proved they were a team hungry for blood. We also had very impressive teams like team impulse untill the whole fiasco happened, and team liquid with the very impressive Piglet. \r\n\r\nGames this year were very clean, very dominate, and it was clear the top 3 teams in each region had a very clear read on the meta, and abused it. \r\n\r\nWhile TSM did fall apart towards the end of the year, and while Cloud 9 unfortunately could not come up with a back up strat for worlds. EU continued to impress and went all the way to semis, some even beliving that fnatic could of possibly beaten Koo tigers if they prepped better. \r\n\r\nHowever, something disappointing me with both NA and EU\r\n\r\nIn NA\r\n\r\nTSM in my opinion still not a top tier team yet, they still have a lot of bad problems they have to clean up, yet despite this they were able to beat our number one team Immortals. However...this leads to a secondary concern\r\n\r\nImortals had clear, and blatently obvious flaws this entire season, flaws that if they were to face korean teams, the koreans would of saw it, they would have eaten them, and spit them out like nothing. The immortals play style would of beem made fun of and highly picked on in korea and china. Yet NA was being Demolished by it as a whole region untill play offs.\r\n\r\nThat tells me, our legit best players, were being DESTROYED by legit bad strategies. They were incapable of studying it, they were incapable of fighting what should have not worked. The fact Immortals went so strong this split, tells me NA is a flat out joke right now. \r\n\r\nIn Eu\r\nWe do not have a single team excluding from G2 that can play a legit clean game. Fact is Origen made it to finals off the better teams suddenly deciding to under prep. Origen got into finals and they played terribly. The game ended off Xpeke making a quite laughable rookie mistake by using Zhonyas far to early. This wasn&#039;t even half the flaws origen made in this game by the way. \r\n\r\nthe TLDR\r\n\r\nLast year we had a huge list of teams that played good solid clean league of legends, they knew how to end, they played with an oppressive play style, and they knew how to get leads and work with them. This year, excluding CLG and G2, I feel no team can call themselves ready to play in suitable worlds performance levels. \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWest is gonna get bodied by China and Korea\r\n\r\nMaybe G2 will do decently.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2016-04-28T22:43:06.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Last year we saw some very dominate performances from a large group of teams in both NA and EU\n\n> ...\n\n> The top 3 teams in EU could not be challenged by the lower 7, occasionally a upset would happen but fact was, top 3 in eu, were the unchallenged kings. \n\nIt is clear you are a NA guy that doesn't followed much EU\n\nLast season UoL before Kikis left, Gambit before Forg1ven got banned and ROCCAT after they added Yamato as coach and Steve and MrRallez in lineup could challenge all teams except Fnatic in summer (too bad it happened that UoL and Gambit got hit super hard before playoffs by those two accidentsand thus UoL was not competitive with freaking H0R0 and Gambit was forced to relegations)\n\nAnd NA sucked super hard last season, the entire S5 and especially Spring was an absolute joke, there is no absolute way NA can be considered worse now, at most you can say they lagged too far behind after last season summer and they have not closed the gap yet, but please, just check who played for LCS teams in Spring and Summer split in S5, you have guys that right now wouldn't even play in NA CS that is notoriously bad","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-04-30T03:54:59.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean in spring last year NA won IEM.

Fnatic was shaky, UoL was a complete hit or miss depending on game (but when they hit, they hit so hard to barely lose to Fnatic that then at MSI took SKT to 5 games), H2K was a team good teamplay with limited ceiling thaks to loulex, SK was imploding, Gambit was pretty mediocre except for the good top-jungle connection and CW had good teamplay but super duper weak individual talent barring for Freeze","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2016-04-28T23:49:32.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"China isn't very good. As a region, they were boosted by EDG in S5, and even EDG sucked terribly at Worlds. To give some clarity, you know how you said that the IMT playstyle would be laughed at by China? Most Chinese teams rely on that playstyle to win any game, except the Chinese can't close the games as well. They are possibly the worst shot-calling region in the world, and that includes Wild Card regions. They are talented, but incredibly uncoordinated, since they are usually split into 3 Chinese-speaking Chinese players and 2 Korean-speaking Korean players.\n\nYes, Korea will probably dominate, but the battle for 2nd between EU and everyone else (EU is indisputably 2nd atm, they had both of the non-Korean semifinalists at Worlds and got 2nd at IEM Katowice) will be more competitive, or even more sided towards EU, than you seem to imply.","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2016-04-29T14:08:25.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TurquoiseYoshi,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=tpBk6tEG,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-04-28T23:49:32.691+0000)\n>\n> They are possibly the worst shot-calling region in the world, and that includes Wild Card regions. \n\nHey, China has bad shotcalling, but let's not go THAT far, eh :D","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2016-04-29T19:41:24.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might be too far.
