Typically when I play sona, I buy the sightstone because I know very well her base damage is enough. (hell I pick up Censor before picking up a lich bane) Granted poke supports have a very high chance of taking kills simply due to their high damage. But it's too overgeneralized that KSing puts the ADC that far behind. Considering I'm not even touching your minion farm, and making sure the enemy can't farm.

You may as well play literally any other support in the game with Lich Bane, every single other support utilizes it better than her.
