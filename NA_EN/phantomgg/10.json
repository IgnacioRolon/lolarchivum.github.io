Laners NEVER have the laning phase completely overhauled as a means of balancing the roles. They don't do things like adding in the capability for cannon minions to cause enemy minions it kills to randomly explode, or make is so that the brush in the lanes will sometimes spawn a healing shrine, or create a golden snitch minion that moves with 600% move speed around the map but both sides can kill it to get bonus XP and a free ward - nothing of that nature gets added into laning. \n\nThe worst thing laners have had to deal with recently has been the minion gold and shutdown gold changes, and whether or not to buy this shiny new item. Meanwhile, junglers got randomly spawning drakes, scuttle crabs, plants, buffs that changed depending on the camp you smited, alternate versions of smite itself, and now a complete readjustment of XP gains with a focus on killing the scuttle crabs in the river in the early game. It's no fucking wonder why junglers get upset so constantly when their role is the only role with the absolute least stability and consistency from season to season, and even within seasons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DracosKasu","date":"2018-05-24T16:23:18.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"probally because jungle was having a lot of diverse champ in the jungle and turn into the Duelist only phase which probally many doesnt enjoy to use play.

Still top is camp and die a lot but now it is way harder to counter a gank because you can fall easy behind the other jungle by 2 lvl.\n\nExactly. Thier changes make no sense. Early and frequent ganks still happen if someone takes a champion that combines healthy clears with strong level 2 dueling. It actually is WORSE for the enemy if your jungler wins the scuttle war at level 2 and takes a lead over the enemy jungler, because there is no way to recover now. The exp changes mean the enemy jungler will be useless several levels behind, while you are even with the enemy lanes or even a little bit ahead because of your camp stealing, scuttles, and ganks.\n\nAll they have accomplished is to narrow the viable jungler pool and force every jungler to adopt the same playstyle. \n\nThey are compounding problem upon problem with bad changes because the only reason we had excessive early ganks was because again thier jungle changes made power farming and counter jungling not viable. They forced players to play gank playstyles. \nThen they get they decide success was a bad thing, so instead of giving us other optional playstyles to counter it they make the stupid decision of only re-enforcing early gank junglers.

BC/Lethality ADC builds were shot, PTA was nerfed, Tempo was always garbage, ambient goldgen was upped making crit builds better, and most early game ADCs got nerfs in the past (lucian being the big example).\n\nThe fix was slightly shifting back crit items, and adding more power to early game ADC itemization, the buffs being the bigger player as to what will actually fix the ADC issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-05-25T04:19:02.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda agree with you.

Every time I logged on and called \"jg\"I felt right at home. \n\nWhen I heard about the scuttle changes and saw all the negative reactions regarding it, I honestly didn't think it was going to have that much of an impact. \"The community is just overreacting\" I said to myself. Oh boy how wrong I was! The scuttle changes didn't just affect the jungle, it literally impacted every single lane and every game since has been a hussle over who can get the scuttle first; and then proceed to fight over the next scuttle spawns for the next 10 to 20 mins. I'm not going to mention all of the other issues this change has caused, as I'm sure everyone on this thread has covered those parts.\n\nIt's ruined the only role I genuinely enjoy, and I know Rito aren't going to revert the changes until next season (if they revert it at all). And I am not waiting that long for them to fix it.\n\nI have sunk over $200 into this game and I now regret supporting a company that honestly couldn't give a rats arse about its community. You used to care Riot, but now the fat cat on top of the pyramid is fatter than ever and it's hunger for money will never be sated.\n\nYou have driven me to quit League, Riot. This is the straw that broke the camel's back, and you will be your own undoing when this game eventually dies.\n\nIt's time that I move on.

I&#x27;m not going to mention all of the other issues this change has caused, as I&#x27;m sure everyone on this thread has covered those parts.\n\nThey didn't realize that there are consequences for one jungler getting behind another jungler so early without a way to catch up. - consequences that impact every lane during the lane phase, and thus the whole game.\n\nThat's why everyone is in a mad dash to help their jungler secure the scuttle, if they are high enough elo to realize they need to, out of a sense of self preservation - they don't want to have to get constantly ganked all lane phase, uncontested by their own jungler, just because their jungler didn't get the scuttle crabs.\n\nThis is not what they could have intended to happen. Now it's the laners job to babysit the jungler, instead of the other way around.\n\nIn past jungles, you could get behind, but that was because the jungler made some plays to get you behind. Because the jungles were always even by design. If they invaded your jungle in one spot you could counter potentially by invading another spot in theirs (even if you were behind, you could hit parts of their jungle that they weren't near without having to fight them). \nBut with the new changes, you automatically get put behind just by virtue of not picking from a narrow pool of champions who cannot contest scuttle. Because the design is not even. But the scuttle makes the entire scenario asymetrical and forces one side to get an advantage because you can't respond tit for tat. You take my buff, I take yours on the other side of the jungle. Doesn't work anymore. You take scuttle, I get nothing, because there's only one.One side is guaranteed to get an advantage, by design. And then they can press that advantage to widen it, never losing it.\n\nThere is nothing comparable to this in laning. It would be like having a neutral minion pop up in the lane at random times, then whoever landed the last hit on it first got a big amount of exp and gold. That would totally trash laning dynamics. \n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-05-24T18:42:46.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot, as a company, is extremely proud.

It's not a very intelligent business plan, IMO, but it's worked for them so far...\n\nAt least we know League won't die due to this change alone, as similar ones have happened in the past.","replies":[]}]}
