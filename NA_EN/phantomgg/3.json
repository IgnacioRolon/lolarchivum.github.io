Well some champions Riot has grown to hate with a furious passion for they can&#039;t be balanced or solved, but they can&#039;t delete for the LoL community has had to much time to bond with them, and thus would create a uproar if they were deleted. {{champion:106}} , {{champion:8}}  and {{champion:107}}  would be on that list that rioters have openly stated they hated. \r\n\r\nHowever Ornn is a different case, he needs to be deleted frankly because well, his kit is bad, it&#039;s horribly designed, it&#039;s nothing more than a fusion of champions that allready exist.\r\n\r\nQ={{champion:48}} pillar  with a delay\r\nW={{champion:68}}  flame spitter with mana\r\nE={{champion:78}} IS EVEN ON THE SAME BUTTON but a knock up instead of stun (which are border line the exact same thing when you think about it)\r\nR={{champion:119}}ultimate  with a knock up and less damage\r\n\r\nNothing about his toolkit screams to me &quot;This is a black smith&quot; nothing about his toolkit tells me &quot;this is a man who was once seen as a God&quot;  so even his toolkit misses the mark for me. As for the item upgrades? It is a slipperly slope that can create something horribly op if not balanced right. However he has a toolkit that can easily become over powered if over buffed with how his W works. \r\n\r\nComplaints about his toolkit? Nothing about it feels like a combo, his R feels random as hell, it feels like the only time you shuold actually use it, is as a flank engage tool or a mid fight tool for disruption. His E horribly limits where he can and can&#039;t fight, and his Q is awkward and honestly completely unfun to use, their is no sanctification in this ability.  The only fun thing about him would be his W and his R, but Q and E just feel horrible. \r\n\r\nRiot please just get rid of him and start fresh if you want to have him back in the game, this champion. He has a 35 percent win rate in all roles and this isn&#039;t because he is &quot;under tuned&quot; it&#039;s because he quite frankly has a horribly designed kit that does nothing to synergize together.  \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s look at the four champions he stole abilities from\r\n\r\n{{champion:48}} = Trap people with E pillar, activate R ult, W for movement speed, get ontop of the target for the target is trapped, press Q to bite them  and just starting beating on them. Nice fluent simple combo\r\n\r\n{{champion:68}} = A harras champion, harrass people with flame spitter, when they run away blast them with E while activating w Simultaniously to allow you to chase harder. R to either finish them off, or to use as a engage/flank tool to help u jump into team fights.\r\n\r\n{{champion:78}} = very simple combo, Instantly go into E/W/Q/R, E to stun them, W to prevent them from running, Q to hurt them, R to keep them from running\r\n\r\n{{champion:119}} = very simple dude, he harrasses you with Q while using his W and E to help him chase his opponents, if his opponents some how get to far away from him, you press R to finish them off. \r\n\r\n{{champion:516}} has none of that. \r\n\r\nI feel riot designed him with the intention to go Q/E/W but with the delay on Q it&#039;s a absolute mess to pull off. Riot designed him to be a Vanguage like {{champion:89}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:32}}  Here is the thing that makes Vanguards great though. They have hard cc, near no escapes, but what they do is near instant the moment they are ontop of you. Once leona is ontop of you she instantly preses Q and ult, it&#039;s fast and near instant, same can be said for poppies E/R, or amumus Q/R. They have fast, fluid and brutal cc combos. Riot made a champion whom i feel they wanted to have a Rumble Vibe with the kit of a vanguard which is just...so out of wack.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Coffee","date":"2017-09-10T07:30:15.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love ornn. no idea what you are talking about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bionic Jellyfish","date":"2017-09-10T06:33:28.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ornn is gonna get changed soon, i feel. he has no combos that are actually effective, everything has a delay that telegraphs what you are gonna do. make his q instant, still a skillshot tho, make so he can charge during w, make w apply brittle through the whole duration, and make so he can change direction of w by turning. then if too string, tune his numbers down","replies":[{"poster":"SuperCosmicHobo","date":"2017-09-10T06:43:58.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot was a fail, wasn't too good...","replies":[{"poster":"Bionic Jellyfish","date":"2017-09-10T06:54:50.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Suitaro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5IgyGcPp,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-09-10T06:43:58.557+0000)\n>\n> Urgot was a fail, wasn&#x27;t too good...\n\ne range needs to be longer, i think, and q needs to be instant not delay","replies":[]}]}]}]}
