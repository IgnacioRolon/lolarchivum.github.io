However regardless of who is right and wrong, riot has already confirmed to us ages ago, that the rework will happen. So how about we stop arguing on how &quot;deep&quot; she is, and just get down to business and discuss what she needs. So here is my rework discussion topic on Akali The Fist of The Shadows.\n\nSo first, let&#039;s talk about lore and visuals. \n\nBecause she is so old, she suffers what many of the older champions suffer from. Super out dated visuals, very lazy bare minimum quotes/lines, and almost no lore written about her at all. Hell even her design, calling you out riot, is nothing more than a rip off from jade from mortal kombat, how you guys never got sued for ripping off jade by nether realm studios is beyond me, my only guess is you paid them to let you or they still to this day some how never noticed.  \n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n                                                                                        **                  THE LORE**\n\n_&quot;The Fist of Shadow strikes from the cover of death itself. Do not impede the balance.&quot; - Akali \nThere exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated to the preservation of balance. Order, chaos, light, darkness - all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world. Akali is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Pruning the Tree - eliminating those who threaten the equilibrium of Valoran. A prodigal martial artist, Akali began training with her mother as soon as she could make a fist. Her mother&#039;s discipline was relentless and unforgiving, but predicated on the fundamental principle: &quot;We do that which must be done.&quot; When the Kinkou inducted her into the order at the age of fourteen, she could slice a dangling chain with a chop of her hand. There was no question - she would succeed her mother as the Fist of Shadow. She has had to do much in this role which others might find morally questionable, but to her it is in service of her mother&#039;s inviolable doctrine. She now works with her fellows Shen Shen and Kennen Kennen to enforce the balance of Valoran.\n_\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Who do I feel Akali is? **\n\nAkali to me, and I feel to many others, is a strong woman, who grew up with, a brutally abusive mother who never allowed her to be a child, a die hard woman committed to the cause of balance even if it meant making her daughter absolutely miserable. A woman who had to endure that abuse, and was eventually brainwashed into believing it. However in her hardships she made friends, she founded someone she could trust within the order who made everything worth it. Then out of nowhere, it was all taken from her. Her one source of happiness gone, and thus whatever remained of Akalis inner child was fully given to the Kinkou order. Somewhere along the way she met Zed, perhaps Zed was her special someone who made her happy, and it was his betrayal to the order that pulled her heart into confliction, or perhaps it was Zed who ruined her only source of happiness, so now she dedicates her life for a chance to kill Zed. That is who Akali is to me, that is who I feel Akali is to many others. A poor and innocent girl who was forced into a world of harsh 24 7 border line or most likely abusive training by her mother. A girl who was pushed to her limits, forced to dull her emotions and give herself to the Kinkou order. Now with her order gone, all her friends dead, the only thing that keeps her human is her thirst to kill Zed. \n\nQuote from Wiki\n_Despite (or perhaps in some way due to) all of this, Akali is apparently the least willing of the Kinkou triumvirate to forgive Zed in any way. She believes only death is deserving of him, in contrast to Kennen Kennen believing redemption is still possible and Shen Shen being undecided in lieu of his duty towards exercising emotionless, unbiased judgement._\n\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**The direction they should take her lore**\n\nMy thoughts, this is a fine, base idea for a character, but if this the &quot;final draft&quot;, I will have to call it your stereotypical edge lord ninja girl. Nothing special, nothing unique. However Riot does allow the fans to pretty much write the lore on our own, which is somewhat part of the fun in league of legends. They give us a story, give us some hints, and they let us theory craft the rest. For Akali I hope Riot sticks with what they hinted, and what the fans created off of that. What is the fan theories with Akali? And for those who want proof Zed and Akali are most likely connected..http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2770235&amp;page=9\n\nAkali is either Zeds daughter, or zeds past besty/lover. People from riot, specifically Devan Runaan hints that Zed basically taught Akali some of her moves. It is also said that Akali hates Zed the most out of her colleges. So why is this? \n\nRiot should end the mystery and give us a confirmation on what the true relationship is when her lore is reworked. Akali is also one of the few surviving members of the Kinkou order, so clearly she has been through a lot, losing her home, friends, family. So much can be written about this character. I believe the best place is to begin with her whole &quot;twin disciples&quot; concept. Darkness, and light, chaos and order. When you look at the three Kinkou ninjas.\n\nKennen-The Chaotic wild one\nShen- The balanced calm one\n\nI always felt Akali was suppose to be the champion that meets them in the middle. Tell us more on her age compared to Shen and Zed, tell us more on what Shen and Zed mean to her. You don&#039;t have to answer us everything, you can easily leave many mysteries for us to solve. But the character is being held back through a writer perspective by saying &quot;oh she was trained by her mom to be the best and now she is the best&quot; and putting all the lore hints in her abilities. \n\nHowever I also mentioned in &quot;who akali is to me&quot; that Riot was so insistent when writing her lore, on how much a influence her mother was in her life. when you are a normal kid you are like &quot;COOL&quot; but when you are older and you read the line. &quot;trained the moment she could forma fist&quot;. That can be as early as three years old. Even if she was six when she started, starting at six to be the perfect assassin for the kinkou order? uhm i&#039;m sorry, our modern government likes to call that CHILD ABUSE. Riot needs to go deep with this, and talk about how hard and sad this training was and was it that kept her sane in the process.  \n\nTLDR\n-Tell us more about her powers and how they work/why they work\n-Tell us the relationship between her and Zed or give us some hints at leaste\n-Tell us what Shen means to her and why she chose to stay with him, or once again give us some hints\n-Make her personality more developed, make her feel like an actual person\n-Go deep and i mean TEARS FEELS DEEP on how brutal the training with her mother was\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Her Design**\n\nPersonally I believe the whole Jade rip off costume needs to go. You can keep the theme, but the costume and some of the coloring can use some minor changes. You did it for Shen (you guys literally made fun of yourselves with the frozen shen skin, admitting it). So now it&#039;s time you do it for Akali. Give the damn woman some personality for christ sake, her lore is literally &quot;she was trained to be the best since she was a kid by her mom and now she is&quot; nothing more, nothing less, and even her costume is a rip off from Jade. Sometimes I have to ask myself why I love Akali so much. Maybe it&#039;s because I enjoy what the fan base turned her into, and I hope that&#039;s what riot makes her into. \n\nHere is some fan art that I feel really embodies Akali\nhttp://forums.eune.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=65416\nhttp://pre14.deviantart.net/6381/th/pre/f/2016/030/4/1/412081c7e322ba34b9badcc39499f854-d9pv688.jpg\n\nAkali is a woman who has gone through hardships, a woman who had to endure, a woman who was robbed of her child hood wrongfully by her mother. &quot;for the greater good&quot; and her looks should reflect that and give her dignity. She should be more than a jade rip. She deserves her own unqiue color pallet, her own individual costume. I&#039;m pretty sure me and many others wish her blood moon skin was her classic, for it truley does embody her spirit far better. I was reviewing Akalis concept art today and I must say what you guys drew was far better then what you gave us. Was it not implimented because you didn&#039;t have the skill or tools at the time to make it a reality? Or did you guys just legitimately enjoyed the final draft more that came into the game? I want to say please review your orignal concept art ideas for her, with her leg paddings and her no shoes concept was pretty cool, Especially the one in the middle and left Honestly they were all supperior. The belt on the far left is awsome. The no shoes concept was cool, the metal like plates on her legs in all thre, the pants in picture 1. Why were these all ditched? Even the costume was more dignifying and I feel if you went with this, people would of never compared her with Jade. \n\nFor everyone else to see: http://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champion/akali/?mv=image-gallery\n\nAkali is a strong character, make her embody that. \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Akalis voice**\n\nFor her voice, gonna keep this short and simple, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE re hire the original voice actress if she&#039;s still available or at least someone who sounds like her\n\nAkali is a calm, disciplined, soft spoken woman, however it&#039;s hinted from the wiki that she is the one who is quick and prone to violence. Kill first ask questions later. Are you on her hit list? Well sucks to be you. \n\nHer voice actress should have the spirit of someone who is calm, but will raise hell the moment she is given the chance. As the saying goes from one of our USA presidents.\n\n&quot;speak softly, but with a very big stick&quot; I feel Akali nails this ideal, and her voice should show that. but in her case\n\n&quot;speak softly but with two very big sickles&quot;\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**THE SKILLS\nWhat we have now? **\n\nNow onto the harder part, nailing a character in lore and design is one thing, but can you do it in game play? My answer, I think will please people. But first let&#039;s talk about what she has now. with simplified explanations\n\nPassive Twin Disciplines: Akalis sickles glow green and red, green for heals, red for damage. First auto will heal you, second auto does more burst damage. You typically want to go in for trades when you have your passive up, for you miss out on a lot of opportunity when you don&#039;t. (not go in in when you have it, but I mean when you chose to fight, you should wait for the passive to be up first. for the heal will give you back some health you lost, and the damage will help you burst thus helping you win the trade) \n\nDo I like this skill?: Honestly yes I do, do I like how it currently functions? No not really, I feel riot can come up with a more creative way to make this idea work better.\n\nQ Mark of the Assassin: Akali throws a sickle at you, and you the victim go boom when she hits you while your marked. It&#039;s also single target and can&#039;t be dodged. Or as I like to call it &quot;lock on ability&quot;\n\nDo I like this ability: I mean i use to, but now I don&#039;t I feel this skill is becoming her core problem as a champion in why she can&#039;t lane anymore. It&#039;s single target, it offers no wave clear, if you max it first, you won&#039;t be able to clear minions under turret or at all, for E helps you out greatly in that concept. The idea of using a sickle to fight is fine, throwing it is fine, but how it functions, needs to change greatly. So no, I currently don&#039;t like this ability, it&#039;s out dated.\n\nW Twilight Shroud: Akali does a small dash, and is now in stealth in a AOE circle field, while in it she is faster, while her opponents are in it, they are slower. Oh and it can hop small cracks in walls. \n\nDo I like this ability; I love the idea, I sorta like how it works, but it has room to grow. So much room.\n\nE Crescent Slash: JUST BEY BLADEEEEEEEE, JUST BEY BLADEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N74cnBa_Bmc\ni&#039;m so sorry i had a moment of weakness and I gave in..\nEh hehm..Akali spins in a aoe circle and does damage to people around her.. oh and it scales with both ad/ap\n\nR~~ lol where you going?~~ Shadow Dance: Akali locks and jumps onto her target doing damage, this has 3 charges, it&#039;s her prime and butter, and a large reason why she is so helpless pre six. It&#039;s 90 percent of her ability, it&#039;s what allows her to get onto long range champions and mark them with her abilitys, without it she is bullied, she has a hard time getting onto targets, pre 6 Akali is just misery. \n\nDo I like this ability: Yeah I do, but I would rather her p-e be given more tools to work with, I rather have a weaker ultimate if it allows me to lane better with my main skills. \n\n2 Gun blade: Yeah i&#039;m including this as her ability, for this item has unfortunately become almost core to her identity. It gives her that tiny bit of AD to help her AD scalings, and it gives tankyness with how strong the healing scales with her abilities.\n\nDo I like this: No I don&#039;t, a champion being so brutally reliant on a single item to the point your not even a champion till you get it, is just a terrible idea. I don&#039;t know if Riot knew this when they invented her, but they know it now. Riot needs to fix this.\n\nIf you wish to see accurate numbers and descriptions on her skills then here is a link to the wiki: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Akali/Abilities\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n**Changes I want to see in Akalis new abilities**\n\nFirst I want to say, youtuber Jermey Curious did a amazing job on his beilefs on Akali and I want to share that here for other people to see.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X84SpgPA0wM\n\nSecondly: What happens to Akali is 100 percent up to riot, guessing what they do to her in lore and designs, imo is easy to do. Guessing what will happen to her in a rework, well, that&#039;s nearly impossible to do. So while I post my own ideas, like them, hate them, I really want you guys to share your thoughts on what will happen with Akali. For like it or not, it&#039;s going to happen eventually. \n\nSo here are some bullet points \n\n-Better tools to lane\nA: basically a skill shot that allows her to either A clear minions, or B harrass the enemy laner\n- less toxic ultimate\nA: i&#039;m sorry, this play style of &quot;i&#039;m ontop of you, and even if you run away I can just do this two more times&quot; play style is just toxic, this is coming from the Akali lover\nB: BUT BUT AHRI AND DIANA. No shut up kid, Ahri&#039;s ultimate is on a 60+cooldown, and Diana only gets the refresh if she lands her Q and hits the target that was hit by Q. \n-Not so bloody item reliant\nA: self explanatory \n\nHer Auto attacks: Why am I mentioning this? For compare it to Zed, or fizz, akalis auto attacks vs other assasins, just feels clunky, it feels off, please make these smoother.\n\nFor her Passive: I like the idea, I said it, I really do, however like jermey said, I hope riot implements in some way mark of the assassin into her passive or with all of her abilities to interact with it in some way. I also hope riot restores her self healing identity so she isn&#039;t so reliant on gun blade to do it for her. \nI feel the idea of this passive can stay, but I hope riot improves how it functions. Currently with Akalis toolkit she feels clunky. This is a passive that feels like it should shine with champions who have very smoothe combo rotations. Prime example Zed and Riven. Akali does not feel as smoothe as they do, to properly abuse her passive.\n\nHer Q: Honestly I had this fun little idea, of what if, they turned Akalis sickles into twin chain sickles? To go further with this idea, what if she throws her q in a liner skillshot and it could go through and damage minions, and then hook onto a target, however make it like Shyvanas E, where it stops after hitting the first champion. That target can then be marked while being minorly slowed. This would help her out so much in farming, and in laning. This is going even further, but what if we made the mark last longer, so if she hits you a second time with Q, it can proc the mark? So basically first q implant the mark, second q ignite it. However keep the theme of her also being able to do so with a auto attack. \n\nW: How about we softly increase the range, but make it so enemy champions who are marked by her Q become slowed to a mediocre amount while in it, or they take damage while in it while being minorly slowed. When a ninja uses a smoke bomb in real life, you are suppose to be in deap shit while inside the smoke bomb, however akalis current W sorta feels silly. For you know where Akali is, AOE and skill shots still works on her while shes in it. The whole point of a smoke bomb is to hide your location while blinding the enemy. While I find the current W cool, the current W however doesn&#039;t live up to that fantasy, and their are easily ways we can balance/rework it to make it do so.\n\nTHE CRAZY IDEA: Switch out W and R while fusing R with E so that way we can completely open a new slot for either w or E for a new ability but like I said this is just a &quot;crazy idea&quot;\n\nE: Frankly I have no idea if this should, stay, go, or be fused with another ability. it&#039;s not a bad ability, but should it stay in favor of something else? Perhaps we can find a way to incorperate it with my belief Akali should be given chain sickles. perhaps she spins, and when she procs mark of the assassin, they are stunned for a very short time, because she wrapped you in chains. Or would this be copying rengar to much? Like I said i&#039;m very lost with this ability\n\nR: I have many ideas in what her ultimate could be, perhaps like I said early, they give her a mega smoke bomb, or perhaps they can give her something similar to fioras old ultimate. it is called &quot;shadow dance&quot; after all. Frankly the current ultimate is a fairly toxic play style, and change MUST happen, for it&#039;s also her greatest weakness, for she is so ultimate reliant.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHer abilities and her Lore should be linked together\n\nSo i&#039;m going to keep this part fairly short, Akali is a champion who meets the lines of shadows and light, she was trained as a child to be the perfect assassin, so she should reflect that deadly shadow assassin tone in the same way Zed does. However it&#039;s also clearly especially from the fact her ability is called twilight shroud, that Shen or someone in the Kinkou order taught her shen like abilities. So Akali should be this harmony between shadows and twilight. Regardless if my ideas are shit or not, what I think we all can agree on, is akalis abilities hint who she is, they hint how she came to be.\n\n&quot;Twin Disciples&quot;-Her two biggest teachers\n&quot;mark of the assassin&quot;-her mother\n&quot;twilight Shroud&quot;-Shen\n&quot;Shadow Dance&quot;-Zed\n&quot;Crescent strike&quot;-herself\n\nI want this theme to be kept, but this time, I want it clear, that she is a person with two polar opposite fighting styles that were fused together. \n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nConclusion\n\nHonestly this is all I have to say on Akali, I can go into more detail about her problems or her strengths, but the topic is long enough as is. I am Akali fan, she is one of my all time favorite champion concepts, and I wrote this topic with a lot of love and I hope it shows  through. I am PhantomGG and this is my topic on the Akali rework and my hopes for her future.

A champion has three identities.\n\n1-The lore\n2-The combo Q-E\n3-the ultimate\n\nSo because the ultimate is in it's whole catagory of it's own, the ultimate can really become just about anything riot wants' making it possibly the hardest to discuss.\n\nWe can discuss is it balanced? I believe the answer to that is easy, the current ultimate is a pretty freaken broken idea. a short cooldown 3 charged guarenteed dash lock that does damage, making it impossible for any adc to get away from you unless {{champion:201}} saves the day.\n\nPersonally I believe it should be completely removed and replaced with something much cooler in terms of animations. but then you would need to heavily update q-e to give her mobility. but I feel safe commenting what I want the toolkit to be here. if I was to have \"my personal\" dream Akali\n\nAuto Attacks: will be made more fluent and faster, sort of like Kayns. \n\nPassive-Restore the original spell vamp, while implementing mark of the assassin math idea\n\nQ-Mark of the assassin\nAkali throws her chained sickle in a linear skillshot, the skillshot will damage any minions or mosnter camps it hits, while locking onto any champion or major camp/monster, the champion or major camp monster (aka adult raptor, red buff, dragon, baron) will then be marked and softly slowed for 1 second. Akali may press Q again to lunge herself towards the marked target with her chain (you have only a 1 second window to do this so this forces you to think fast if you want that) \n\n(The embodiment of her mothers teachings)\n\n\nW-Shroud of Shadows\nAkali throws a Shadow shroud onto the floor in a aoe skill shot (this one will have much more range than the current one and the dash is removed) When Akali is within the smoke bomb she is stealthed, her movement speed is increased and her damage is slightly increased. marked targets within the smoke bomb are slowed moderately, un marked targets within the circle are only slightly slowed.\n\n (basicaly the goal vision is to create a field of darkness where Akali wants to stay in and fight in, where she can live her gorilla war fare ninja play style to have this skill embody zeds teachings)\n\nE- Crescent Twilight\nAkali spins in a aoe circles while lashing around her chains, targets who were marked are snared for half a second \n\nR- Dance of the assassin\nAkali casts a ring of shadows and twilight and dashes onto a target doing a burst of aoe, while in this state akali does increased damage and if she kills her target within 3 seconds of casting her ultimate she may launch herself onto another target. (this will keep refreshing as long as she gets a kill within 3 seconds but may only be done 3 times, the count begining at your first target)\n\nThis will embody her becoming her own self\n\nas for what she would look like in her animations. it would sort of be like a twilight ninja(shen) but she would look more like an assassin, with traces of shadows following her around, to show for some reason she fights like a shadow ninja.","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-07-19T14:43:50.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have some different ideas I can share later, but I don't really like your idea for q, as it's really just a more powerful thresh q. :-/\n\nIn general,  I hope that her assassin Mark becomes her passive, and that her twin discipline is expressed in some other way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monotachi","date":"2017-07-18T22:36:25.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Point click assassins WTF\n\nHaha, it just shows her age, that's all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-07-18T23:33:17.941+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really like your analysis!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nI think it would be cool if her ultimate gave her multiple smoke bombs to teleport / dash between instead of dashing to target enemies, might be too powerful that way though.\n\nSomething to involve more shadow dancing, y'know?","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomGG","date":"2017-07-18T23:36:27.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HalcyonDweller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kEPI3FJF,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-07-18T23:33:17.941+0000)\n>\n> Really like your analysis!\n> \n> {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n> \n> I think it would be cool if her ultimate gave her multiple smoke bombs to teleport / dash between instead of dashing to target enemies, might be too powerful that way though.\n> \n> Something to involve more shadow dancing, y&#x27;know?\n\nhad an idea like that myself but then I felt it put her to close to katarina.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-07-18T23:55:18.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh I see.

(talking about old akali)\n\nNew Akali the healing isn't even a factor anymore and honestly the healing is sorta laughable now, which is probably why they put more power into her W. As for why  Tank Akali exists? The answer is simple, it's the trend that started last year, tank items are generally better than damage items, so once you have gun blade, their is no reason in why you can't just go full tank after.

It&#x27;s gotten a lot weaker over the seasons, and I&#x27;m sorry if you disagree but it just wouldn&#x27;t feel like Akali without this ability staying exactly as it is. How much weaker do you want it to get??   \n> \n> Here&#x27;s a quote I ripped directly from Riot&#x27;s 7.2 patch notes, where they give context on why they were choosing to buff Akali&#x27;s R instead of something else: &quot;Shadow Dance represents a lot of what we like about Akali’s kill pattern - it’s telegraphed, has appropriate downtime between casts, and gives the opposing team time to react with their abilities to help peel her prey.&quot;\n> \n> Sorry for the long comment I just wanted to give you some feedback on what I thought as an Akali main and how Riot views Akali&#x27;s R because it&#x27;s not nearly as toxic as how it used to be or you say it is now.  Overall this post was 9/10 (sorry i had to dock off 1 point for those terrible q and r suggestions lol). I wouldn&#x27;t mind if riot saw this and did most everything you said! It&#x27;s a shame you&#x27;re not an Akali main tho, cause it would have been refreshing to see something this well thought out come from our community instead of the usual &quot;revert to 6.21 because I&#x27;m bad&quot; shit-posts.\n> \n> Well done!  :)\n\nI actually do play a lot of Akali, but I can say as a person who does play a lot of Akali, the moment I had my ultimate, if i felt like try harding that game, I see the game as over for my opponents. Which is why I call her ultimate toxic, it has that much power. \n\nAs for Q, I do enjoy the current q, all i want is for Akali to have some sort of form of range harrass or wave clear. Currently unless you are smurfing or in a super easy match up that you counter pick against, Mid Akali is unplayable. I will legit call it unplayable. and hopefully this post will show you why it is so unplayable\n\nMid lane has evolved into a game of dodgeball. A game of nuke minions and throw dodgeballs at the enemy mid laner. However here is the problem Akali has and why she has been relegated to the top lane and the jungle. Here I give you a list of just about every champion you will see in the mid lane, and only one champion here shares her weakness while having all the same problems she does.\n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:26}} \n\nAll the champions listed with the exclusion for a few can very easily harrass and push Akali under tower. Akali is playing a game of dodgeball but she has no ball to throw, so instead she just takes the hits and begs for help. Fizz is the only other champion on this list who shares her weakness, but he at least turn himself into a dodge ball. Akalis only option to allow herself to harrass and trade, is to use her W offensively. However with the horrid cooldown it currently has, this now leaves you vulnerable for about 20 seconds for either a gank, or the enemy mid laner to harrass you even further, so you have better made that window of opportunity worth it when you do W in. Akali is also heavily reliant on jungle assistance pre six to either give her wards or to fight against the mid laner. You want your jungler to ward for you, for with how often you are being pushed in you will rarely find the good chance to give yourself a good ward (i'm not talking about river wards). So now you are in a losing lane, while demanding the jungler gives you resources. A Akali player should always lose the pre 6 war, and be down in farm and health. The goal of Mid lane Akali isn't to win lane, it's to survive, if you can just last till level 6, you are given so much power and kill pressure onto your lane opponent if their lead isn't to large, and your roams become god tier. \n\nHowever to shut down a Akali is so very easy, she is a champion that is heavily item reliant, so if the mid laner just absolutely trashes the Akali, than even if the Akali reaches level six, she will very often be to far behind to do anything. Akali is a mid laner was who designed by riot on the time of her creation to have a weak lane phase with the trade, for a very strong level six power spike. She was given a toolkit that was fine for the times, but if you were to do some homework, the only assassin in this game who is older than she is, is Nidalee. Akali is quite literally the oldest assassin in this game, her toolkit was suitable for the times but is now to out dated to match up against modern mid laners. \n\nWill talented Akali players be able to get wins? yes they will, but the challenges they face are huge. At the current moment the orignal mid lane assassin queen is now a far better top laner and jungler, and as a mid lane main who also mains assassin champions, this saddens me. I am a fan of Akali, I love her, and I woulden't be writing this reply or have created this post if I wasn't. If riot ever reads this post I beg them to please restore Akali back to the mid laner. \n\nFun fact the only pro games you see on her ever is top lane Akali. \n\nThat being said, to conclude this reply.\n\nI understand why you are furious at me insulting her q, but if you truley love Akali as much as I do, you would be willing to let it go, in favor of something else, just so we can play mid lane Akali again, other wise, riot mine as well rework her into a top laner. \n\nI want mid lane akali back, and will be saddened if she is forever to be a top laner, That is why I want focuses in change to be on her q and e.","replies":[{"poster":"Shen is SO HOT","date":"2017-07-20T14:48:09.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I actually do play a lot of Akali\n\nDo you have any evidence at all to back this claim up? Your op.gg for this account shows a grand total of a whooping 5 ranked games on Akali since season 5.   I'm sorry, but if I can count the number of games you've played with Akali going 3 seasons back on one hand, then I don't think you can say \"I play her alot\".  I mean come on dude, picking her _**5**_ times over 3 seasons? You can't even say \"I play her little\" at this point lmao.\n\n> I can say as a person who does play a lot of Akali, the moment I had my ultimate, if i felt like try harding that game, I see the game as over for my opponents. Which is why I call her ultimate toxic, it has that much power.\n\nSo, because her ultimate pairs well with the rest of her kit and it feels satisfying to use, you're deeming it as \"toxic\"????? Why? How does that even make sense? What are you smoking? If it's as powerful as you say, why isn't she perma banned/picked in soloq? Did you read what I wrote at all about her ultimate in my comment above?? Patch 6.22 solved any and all problems her ultimate had counter-play wise.  I suspect the only reason she's received any buffs at all since her changes 6 months ago (and why she's continuing to get more) is because her ultimate was toned down significantly.     \n\n>all i want is for Akali to have some sort of form of range harrass or wave clear. Currently unless you are smurfing or in a super easy match up that you counter pick against, Mid Akali is unplayable.\n\nYou're honestly delusional if you think Akali can have all these things in her kit and still be even remotely balanced. If you want to play a champion with ranged harass maybe don't lock in Akali?? (oh wait you don't play her :P). Not every champion has to follow the same boring ass cookie cutter kit, which is the direction your proposed changes are pushing her into.  She's never had a form of ranged harass and it's something I'm heavily against adding to Akali.  If they gave her ranged harass she would be OP unless they heavily decreased the amount of mobility she has.  Which now it suddenly makes sense to me why you want to destroy her ultimate.  If i wanted to play a champion with harass instead of a hyper mobile ninja, I'd play kennen.\n\n\nAs someone who climbed to plat primarily playing Akali mid, I wouldn't say she's \"unplayable\". She sucks ass yes, but it's not unplayable lol. Is it harder than going top? Match-up wise I would say yes.  But she's still very usable mid lane once you adjust your mindset according to your opponent's play-style.  The only reason she's been struggling mid so much is because of the shroud changes in 6.22. None of us wanted that blink.  We all wanted to be able to place shroud where ever we wanted to.  But they didn't listen to our warnings so now shes the queen of bullying melee champions with that no counter-play, low interaction blink. Meanwhile her mid lane suffered deeply because the match-ups are mostly ranged and the blink is close to worthless in those situations.\n\nI want them to give Akali back her tools for laning vs ranged champions but without them destroying her unique kit/play-style (what your proposed changes to R will do) or making her even more oppressive in lane (what your proposed q changes will do).  That's why i want the majority of her game-play update to be more focused around her W or maybe even her passive. Changes to E are likely and even though I personally like her current E i welcome changes because it's not a spell that's particularly interesting or fundamental to Akali's kit. \n\nBtw I wasn't furious, just really confused and disgusted by the direction you want to take Akali's Q + R lol. Like I said earlier, it was a great post altogether.  Shocked that a non Akali main even made a post that wasn't \"nerf this champion into the ground cause idk how to play against it\". :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mk2Chieftain","date":"2017-07-19T02:19:28.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo great post!\nOdd idea for combining Akali Q and E that I thought of based on your Kusarigama idea:\n\nQ: Akali starts swinging her kusarigama around in a circle increasing in area and speed for up to 5 seconds dealing dmg to all enemies hit.\nAkali can reactivate to \"throw\" it out as a skill shot dealing dmg to the first enemy struck.
