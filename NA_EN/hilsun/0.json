You could even go the extra mile and replace Ball with an animated... thing, like SG's pets, but of course more like a plump version of SG Jinx's evil pet, thus making Fallen star Ori a legendary, and giving her a worthwhile skin for those that aren't into Valentine's day every day of the year.\n\nPardon for the wall of text, but those are my thoughts/ideas","replies":[{"poster":"Hilsun","date":"2016-09-22T16:39:27.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am definitely +1ing for not just falling back to \"dark star skins\" :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-09-20T18:02:56.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I wonder if Riot had to give money to sailor moon","replies":[{"poster":"FloRaider42","date":"2016-09-20T18:39:31.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering \"Magical Girls Shows\" is an entire genre (and therefore unaffected by Copyright) it's not likely.","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-09-20T19:00:00.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't know, I feel like if their not going to be original with skins they should at-least release alot at once.
