It would be so much easier.. Who would like to see this? Vote yes if you want to be able to edit which items are suggested that you buy WHILE YOU ARE IN THE GAME and vote no if you still want to edit your suggested items to buy BEFORE THE GAME STARTS ONLY. RDY go!","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-06T17:35:10.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really. The custom item builds work pretty fine and give me quick access to anything I might need to build on my mains.  I just don't see any need to be able to edit which items are suggested while I'm in a game.  Why wouldn't I just quickly search the item instead and start building it? The whole point of the item builds pregame is so you don't need to do it in game.","replies":[{"poster":"bdmanny","date":"2016-05-06T18:33:10.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with all of that for sure but I have individualized item sets for each champ and when a new patch comes out I usually have to change the whole thing. I get scattered in game and I don't want to think a whole lot about which item to search for. I'd rather have the best items for that meta and choose. There has recently been a huge overhaul with a lot of items especially AP so i figure my whole knowledge about what champ usually buys what is thrown off. I see your point though but I don't want to spend an hour each patch going through and re-working all of my champs item sets.","replies":[]}]}]}
