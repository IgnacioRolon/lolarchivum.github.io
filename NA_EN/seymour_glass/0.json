My guess is that since everything is, of course, coded as minions, Syndra&#039;s spheres count as dashing minions and Veigar&#039;s E stops any dashing unit. And that doesn&#039;t seem right, does it.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-04-08T03:43:54.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make this a feature and have his cage stop projectiles.\n\nYes I know, I hate Yasuo's Wind Wall too, but damnit, give our Tiny Master of Evil SOMETHING.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Curling Veigar","date":"2015-04-07T21:53:19.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty cool to be honest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seymour Glass","date":"2015-04-07T20:13:21.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added a video.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vaati006","date":"2015-04-07T19:25:35.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Assuming you're not crazy and it's actually happening as you describe... yeah, I'd believe thats a bug that should be addressed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-08T04:25:35.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I think that should stay.\n\nVeigar needs all the help he can get.","replies":[{"poster":"Seymour Glass","date":"2015-04-08T17:13:47.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that Veigar is in a not-so-great spot doesn't mean he has to have a single, completely unintuitive advantage in a very specific match up.
