Syndra has the kit to zone Ahri and 1 shot her, same with Katarina and LeBlanc. Anivia is a god. She shouldn't die laning phase to any of those 4 champions especially since her core makes her tanky ROA and Archangels Shield, with wave clear and passive. Just you need to practice is all. Maybe find a guide that explains how x champion deals with x champion. What runes they use for the match up. And maybe go into the opposite guide to see how x champion deals with x champion so you know what the enemy champion will be trying to do to either win the match up or make it out of landing phase to mid game. Find a YouTube video X champions vs X champion. Hope that helps","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-13T21:13:52.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you manage to loose to ahri while playing yasuo, i have news for you. You should not be playing yasuo.\n\nAll you can really do is respect their damage output and not all-in them, try to keep their hp low to stop them being able to do exactly that, and dont burn your cooldowns the second they get near wait for them to use their dashes.","replies":[{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2017-03-13T21:24:28.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not losing against Ahri.

If you think they can all in you it's worth it to lose that cannon minion. Never underestimate their damage. Watch around level 5 where they are positioning as a lot of assassins get a huge power spike at 6 usually going for an all in eg. Zed, Talon, Ahri, FIZZ\n\nMid game\nIf you did well and didn't get them snowballing their power should now be severely dampened as the team groups up they have a harder time finding targets that are left out on the sides. Make sure to stay by your front line as a squishy mage like anivia for example. When a fiht breaks out and you don't know where they are you should stick close to your adc as usually they will try to dive the back line and take out a damage target for their team but if you are close together they are usually more scared to go for that kill.\n\nLate game\nEven if they did start snowballing they fall off at this point. I have been 26/3 before as leblanc but my team has dragged their heels so hard at pushing objectives we lost the game when it hit late game. Now your squishy mage like Anivia ramps up their power and severely rolls out more damage then an assassin because their kits were designed to scale whereas assassins weren't.\n\nHope this helped","replies":[{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2017-03-13T22:05:56.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just have an issue doing well. I get that if I don't feed, I usually win in the scale battle, but it feels like I don't have enough gold to have an impact.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyahc","date":"2017-03-13T22:12:48.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good trick is freezing lane under your tower if you can practice that. Forces assassin to come forward and push it to stop the freeze leaving them vulnerable to ganks.\n\nTry to size up every cs in lane noting where the assassin is and if you're going to take too much damage for a cs to be worth it. Assassins are very opressive in lane and it sucks to lose a whole bunch of cs but just use mid game to farm some side lanes and try to make a come back. Number one priority is always making sure the assassin doesn't get his snowball even if it costs you your gold.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
