He locks me down for a solid 3 seconds and sets up ganks so easily with flash. Only counterplay is blowing my summoners too. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t kill him yet he can kill me. I feel like I always have to pick an AD champ just to have a somewhat solid chance against him. It&#039;s either that or I use my ban on him. \r\n\r\nI also don&#039;t understand why a tank has better waveclear than many mages. It&#039;s actually insane!","replies":[{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2019-01-01T06:16:44.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it’s because I’ve played Galio since the rework came out but I feel he telegraphs everything. \n\nWith that being said I’m sure they will nerf him.
