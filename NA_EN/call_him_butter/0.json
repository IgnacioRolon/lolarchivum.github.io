I found only a few posts and no solutions, or replys really. I was hoping someone can help me out with this. I recently restored my computer to factory settings and tried to download league of legends. But this issue came up. Some path issue or some way I cant download a certain file. Any help would be appreciated thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T21:30:16.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've rarely seen this issue, but almost every time, it's been on a PC running Windows XP or Vista.
