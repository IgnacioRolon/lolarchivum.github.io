Champselect was looking really bad. All the animations and other things to make it look clean and appealing were gone. I don't why they are gone, or if its a mistake on my part, so I would like to know if any of you know how to enable them again or if you have encountered the same as me. I have tried to initiate a full repair, but it didn't change anything. Not a major issue, I would just like the animations to come back.","replies":[{"poster":"Thebirkes","date":"2019-12-07T21:54:50.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My animations are back now, so I guess it was just a slip up from riot :)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot BlueMonday","date":"2019-12-07T23:18:11.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thebirkes,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=rGphor6i,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-12-07T21:54:50.914+0000)\n>\n> My animations are back now, so I guess it was just a slip up from riot :)\n\nThis sounds like it could have been related to issues with our settings server we were having earlier today? I think the settings that control this are stored there but I am not 100% on that unfortunately. Let us know if its still happening. If your settings got cleared you might need to set them again :X.","replies":[{"poster":"bab2683","date":"2020-01-11T11:13:27.038+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this problem since the new update 09/01/2020","replies":[]},{"poster":"God Cask Gragas","date":"2019-12-08T00:33:34.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"mine are still gone","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordRobsoon","date":"2020-01-19T01:18:27.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem...","replies":[]},{"poster":"DStreet3","date":"2020-01-18T00:14:25.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"my animations have been broken since December. sometimes when I log in they work, and other times they don't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ch4rLum","date":"2019-12-07T18:20:19.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here.
