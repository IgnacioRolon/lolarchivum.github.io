I'd suggest doing a quick [**clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7) to make sure nothing interferes with League while it's running.\n\nI also looked into your ticket, and it doesn't look like anythings been deleted. Even once tickets are solved, they remain in our system for reference. I do see your current ticket with our tech team, so if that clean boot doesn't help continue working with them and you'll have a smoother time connecting soon.","replies":[{"poster":"xaufi","date":"2017-07-09T01:50:34.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that has changed was the 7.13 patch.

Even though you haven't manually changed anything, it doesn't mean something could still be interfering with your connection. Essentially, we still need to go through the usual troubleshooting steps in order to rule out certain possibilities.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xaufi","date":"2017-07-09T01:36:05.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another 25 Minute Penalty... 5 minute Low Priority Queue for 5 matches.\n\nAwarded a punishment again.
