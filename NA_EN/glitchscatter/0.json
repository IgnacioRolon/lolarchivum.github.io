I've been having continual issues with connecting to the server and thus far it hadn't been much of an issue. My last game (Ranked) I was unable to load into game for over 14 minutes, thankfully my team was doing alright without me but I have never in my time playing league EVER had this happen. Between the 500 ping spikes, the lag, the connection issues and actually DC'ing MID RANKED GAME, I'm about to say to hell with it and not come back. This is beyond ridiculous!!!!!\nI'm irate at this point, and I'm sure I'll get it counted against me even though it wasn't my fault that I was \"AFK\" for most of that match but of course you guys would probably not see it that way. \nThis is unfair. :\\ \n\nI have been testing my internet to see if this was the issue but after about 3 hours of monitoring it comes up clean and without an issue. I can still stream, I can still watch movies/videos, and my internet is fine. Firewall has been disabled a few times, I have worked on all other possible issues but it seems as though its entirely on your end.\n\nPlease, for the love of whatever you believe in, fix it.\n\n*Edit* 2/5/2015\nSo I just scrolled through some of the newer posts and turns out riot just passes this post by, not sure what to think about this, can't really understand how 5 upvotes so far gets passed up for some random stuff, guess they don't wish to acknowledge the fact that they are having serious server issues or just don't wish to reply to the thousands of people on it. Thus far I have not seen any updates or a glimmer of hope that they're even working on it. I'm very disappointed in the Riot team at this point, it seems as though they just don't care.\n\nI really do enjoy this game, but I do not enjoy the fact that I can no longer play as I used to, the ability to make quick decisions is vital to this game but when I'm stuck with 500 ping or DC'ing mid game it makes it impossible to do anything but hope that I clicked enough to get to base or behind a turret. \n\nWill be testing to see if it's gotten better today but my hopes are low.{{champion:32}} ","replies":[{"poster":"lynxznet","date":"2015-02-05T06:04:58.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am unable to connect to a game now, period.

Giving it a rest for a while,  hopefully they fix it in a week or else I'll be moving on to a different game. :\\\nPing is starting to spike rapidly, staying around 500 for a few minutes at a time. Pointless to stick around if this stays a norm. Riot probably doesn't care about the mass of plebs having issues, as long as their high elo posterchildren don't have issues its all gravy~ lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StanleyBaratheon","date":"2015-02-07T18:06:47.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue, I just lost a 10 game win streak because of the sudden lag from hell. 3 people in my team including me got it and it cost us the match.
