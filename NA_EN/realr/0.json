So the Dynamic Queue announcement came out today. SoloQ isn&#039;t coming back! For a while I was very disappointed. I&#039;m a very low ELO player just trying to play ranked but I consistently run into premade teammates/enemies. I&#039;m not talking about 5-man premades, because tbh those are very rare, but playing with/against 3 or 4 definitely puts the steering wheel in their hands in terms of how the game will play out. \n\nFirstly it is disappointing with the whole &quot;I played with/against premade 3&#039;s and they just camped and ganked for each other&quot; or something like that. That&#039;s just a tradeoff/downside of taking out SoloQ, which is fine!\n\nMY biggest and most overbearing problem with Dynamic Queue isn&#039;t matchmaking in terms of skill but in terms of Communication Quality. If I&#039;m playing with 4 other solo players against a premade 3/4/5, unfairness only becomes difficult when the premade team has an ability (via Skype, TS, Discord, etc.) to communicate with each other that transcends my team just pinging.\n\nIf I play Kindred and am about to gank, I can ping &quot;On My Way&quot; and even type it to them, which is great, but it doesn&#039;t beat being able to say &quot;Hey bot lane I&#039;m coming for a gank after I take gromp and drop a river ward for mid, let them push the lane in until then&quot; \n\nDuring teamfights there&#039;s no time to type &quot;Kindred drop your ult to save Cait, Azir push Sion out of his ult,&quot; as pings can only do so much for us but can&#039;t express complex messages like that. During LCS games, when they show highlights of teamfights, in the background you hear teams vocally communicating quickly and constantly. And that&#039;s not an advantage solo players have. \n\nIt&#039;s ok to remove or heavily tinker with the idea of individual assessment in ranked (it&#039;s something they talked alot about in the Round-table video). But the problem arises when I consistently am pushed into games with/against people that can communicate better than I can. I think that&#039;s where alot of the low-ELO DQ complaints arise; not that it&#039;s bad that we can&#039;t climb by ourselves or premade teams are magically better than us, but that we&#039;re punished because of a potential for enemy teams to communicate at much better levels.","replies":[]}
