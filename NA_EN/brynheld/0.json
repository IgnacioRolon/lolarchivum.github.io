They just don't like those rules. However, not liking the rules doesn't make them go away, and the level of argument almost always used to criticize those rules (\"IVE SPENT NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS, IM GONA SEW RITO\") isn't useful or constructive.\n\n> There are a few stubborn/entitled people sure but they might have come from a game like Dota where their behavior isn&#x27;t problematic.

Then they get a bunch of people informing them that this feeling is misplaced, and it doesn't matter to them.

Thus I&#x27;m going to assume they had reddit&#x27;s voting procedure in mind: \n> \n> https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette\n> Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don&#x27;t personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you&#x27;re downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.**\n> \n> Hell it&#x27;s even on this forums &quot;Universal Rules&quot;:\n\nAgain, voting in general is to help people find content they might like and avoid content they won't like.","replies":[{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2019-01-19T17:46:13.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=q4W3wWE1,comment-id=00040000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-19T17:02:51.929+0000)\n>\n> Or perhaps it&#x27;s rare because a lot of the ideas people propose (prisoner&#x27;s island, more gradual punishments, etc.) have already been tried and rejected. An opinion like that, backed by insufficient research, doesn&#x27;t seem useful to me, so I downvote those in the hopes that better threads will become more visible.\n> \n> It matters because perhaps a flood of garbage posts is a bigger negative than a tiny handful of good posts, especially when the latter are so hard to find amid the former.\n> \n> Just look at OP&#x27;s screenshot. PB is absolutely buried in &quot;BS ban&quot; threads. &quot;banned for what?&quot; - &quot;for that behavior there&quot; - &quot;unban me&quot;...\n> \n> That is a possible outcome, yes, especially when the opinions are something like &quot;I love trash talking people, especially when it upsets them&quot; or &quot;my ban was inevitable because chat exists; delete the chat feature.&quot;\n> \n> So? The whole point of downvotes is to suppress garbage. If lots of people thinks something is garbage, down it goes. Insisting that maybe someone somewhere will occasionally find a &quot;bad&quot; thread useful or uplifting (&quot;I knew it! this guy was banned for a BS reason, too!&quot;) and that this justifies getting rid of the voting system leads a lot of people to waste a lot of time sifting through junk, and we&#x27;d like to avoid that.\n> \n> Again, voting in general is to help people find content they might like and avoid content they won&#x27;t like.\n\nWe'll just have to agree to disagree on this. \n\nTo me, downvoting just for disagreement is detrimental to a forum meant for discussion. Nobody deserves to have their thread/comment thrown into the abyss just because people disagree with their opinion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2019-01-19T09:43:51.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Does anything positive come from this sub-board? \n\nYes.\nWhat the subboard does is inform people about the systems that League uses, what they are, and how they work and it succeeds at that purpose.  There's going to be an amount of repetition because that is also how teaching people publicly works.\nOf course, there's going to be people who don't know what you are reiterating and there's going to be people who insist they were right to act in whatever way (probably why they did it in the first place).  But that's not a problem.  That is, in fact, the reason for the board, to reiterate these things so that more people are capable of being exposed to the information.\n\n---\n\n\\*note  \"Then people reiterate the same basic messages telling them why they were punished, and they counter back with the same basic excuses trying to condone their actions.\"\nThis is not a problem of the board itself but of the responders being awful at it.  Quoting a part of the OP text and writing \"Ugh, You're toxic. Punishment deserved\" because they are looking to judge posts is not helpful.  When instead of responding to what was written and trying to discuss the player behaviour systems you just throw out a one word accusation, **_of course_**  the other guy is going to defend himself from the accusation that you made.

That's why it's so \"popular\" and why a lot of people come here to talk about it (primarily their punishments). However, we're often met with rather hostile and negative threads which are looking for justifications, rather than explanations. This often leads to lofty downvotes, because people usually disagree with those kinds of \"discussions\" and don't want to partake in them.\n\nNot everyone is like that, of course, and those who are willing to listen to the community and own up to their mistakes are what makes it worth it.\n\n> It's been at this point for years really where you could make a player behavior bingo\n\n:D","replies":[]},{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2019-01-19T16:57:38.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The boards are decent enough.\n\nThe people using them are the problem.
