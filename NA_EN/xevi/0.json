The health regen it grants his turrets is near pointless as they will likely be one shot. \n{{champion:96}} - While it isn't entirely useless it doesn't make sense for a long range hypercarry to be killed only for his corpse to run at you into melee range. It just doesn't fit.\n{{champion:61}} - Again not a worthless passive just a bit odd. Increased damage on consecutive autos isn't something that makes to much sense thematically with Orianna. \n{{champion:35}} - Crits on backstabs however passive becomes worthless if you were to crit normally as the passive would tick however no bonus damage.\n{{champion:134}} - Passive is great once you max out a spell however you have no passive until level 9. \n{{champion:72}} -Great for jungling and epic monsters however in lanes you have no passive.
