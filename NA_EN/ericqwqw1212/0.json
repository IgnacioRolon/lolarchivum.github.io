Thanks for taking the time to write this up. To your questions:\n\n* In the future, we'll likely do more non-champ specific Eternals that are also skill-expressive. Things like \"Time Spent Godlike\" or \"Narrow Escapes\" or your Zhonya's idea are great examples of the direction we'd want to head in for those. \n* We've talked about ratios / averages Eternals a lot, and it's a tricky thing to navigate. The idea that the stat an Eternal is tracking can go down (e.g. - Hooks Hit % with Thresh) might be a bit gameplay-warping for players who are trying to keep the highest % rather than go for bold plays. A spin on that idea that is a bit better could be \"games where your Thresh hook hit % was above a certain threshold\". That stat doesn't go down, but it is trickier to milestone (would have to happen at the end of the game, for example).\n* We playtested the current milestone design a lot to find a balance between readability and gameplay clarity. I think we landed in a really good spot, and there's rules in place to make sure you're not distracted (milestones wait until you're out of combat with champions for several seconds, for example). That being said, if we see demand for a \"lite\" version after launch, we may investigate that!\n\nThanks for the suggestions!","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2020-01-20T14:51:58.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For more general options, would a medal system like Halo be something to look into? \n\nI'm sure you guys already track things like double kills and Pentas, but what about things like MVP or Killing Spree medals? There was even assist spree. \n\nPersonally I'd love to get the medal I loved getting the most in Halo, which is \"Perfection\" (Get 15 kills without dying and winning the game). \n\nThere were also other things that would be cool like, \"Revenge\" (Killing the champion that just killed you, first).
