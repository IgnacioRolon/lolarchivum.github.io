If you completely remove crit chance from the game there are quite the few problems the could be solved.\r\n\r\nJust quickly, if you did remove crit chance give people with crit in their kit or that&#039;s essential to them (Fiora, Yasuo etc) extra damage or some equivalent.\r\n\r\nProblem 1: ADCs dealing as much burst as assassins - Ever hate that moment as Talon where Kai&#039;sa kills you before you can kill her? The whole point of assassins is to kill someone but when assassins can&#039;t be assassins because the ADCs are all of a sudden the assassins, what does Rito do? Buff Assassins and now we all complain so they buff ADCs then we all complain again. If we remove crit from the picture, good ADCs will be able to survive and good assassins might actually be able to kill adcs. Which leads on to the next point.\r\nProblem 2: Teamfights over in an instant - Ever noticed how the teamfights these days are over in less than like 4-8 seconds? Yeah. If you remove crit, give burst to assassins and burst mages. Now fights become more sustained and they&#039;re longer. But, if my adc gets bursted by their burst mage, the fights over right? Well not anymore cause now that their ADC can&#039;t instakill your mid laner, your mid laner actually has some use in the game (assuming ur mid is a carry and top/jg is a tank) meaning that losing one member of your team means the fights gonna be harder, but it&#039;s not over. Long story short, the fights become longer cause not everyone on your team dies instantly. But what about the tanks?\r\nProblem 3: Tank Meta - Exactly. Notice today how tanks do so much damage? The whole idea of a tank is to make people target you not your allies. So to do that tanks need to be a damage threat that can chunk you but not completely kill you as to drag attention to them. However, when ADCs can fucking 4 shot tanks, what does Rito do? Buff tanks. Now we complain about tank meta. See the pattern? Crit creates a heavy imbalance and the community tells rito to do something and when something is done, now there is an even bigger imbalance to the other side. So if you remove crit you can lower the damage on tanks allowing fighters to come back into the meta. Allowing for greater diversity\r\n\r\nHowever, removing crit could put the game into an attack speed ADC meta. But that&#039;s what ADCs should be. ADCs are a teams source of *sustained damage* and mid should be your burst. \r\n\r\nAgain, long story short:\r\nIf you remove crit from the game:\r\n- Assassins become the only assassins\r\n- Teamfights last longer and aren&#039;t completely decided by one death\r\n- Tank meta resolves itself (kinda)\r\nLastly:\r\n- ADCs actually fulfil their real role\r\n\r\nIdeal Team comp (this can be shifted eg tank Galio mid):\r\nTop: Health/Sustained dmg\r\nJg: Health/Burst\r\nMid: Burst\r\nAdc: Sustained dmg\r\nSupp: Support/Health","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-05-08T02:11:48.537+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Removing crit makes ADCs more like assassins, as they will be building the same flat AD that assassins and fighters will.

I think the current direction Riot seems to be taking shows promise though.\n\n\nHowever if you look at champs like Varus and Kalista who don't build terribly much crit and would prefer to go AS, all adcs just become like them: they build AS. They're weak early but strong late. They still do dmg and with supports who can back them up they won't die terribly easily. I mean I get your point by which assassins can kill them before they can kill assassins but thats whats wrong at this point I think. Because ADCs are the assassins not the assassins themselves. Also losing multiplicative stats yes I get that, but maybe there is some alternative that could be introduced potentially to fill the hole. Now I understand crit adds an element of random to teamfights with huge crits but removing crit puts more emphasis on positioning and skill because if an assassin jumps you, if your out of position and you can't outplay, you no longer still win cause you one shot with a huge crit. You die. Simple as that. Again, ADCs shouldn't have burst. ADCs should be a source of sustained damage whereas burst should be coming from mid lane and sometimes top lane (Camille, Irelia etc).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-05-08T02:45:49.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it wasn't mentioned yet: Simply removing crit as a mechanic from the game would as well require tons of reworks they would have to do at the same time.\n\nCrit nowadays is implemented in many kits of champions (mostly marksmen) or let's abilities scale.\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:157}} \n\nAll these champs would need tweaks or even heavy reworks.","replies":[{"poster":"Gnar Is A Cat","date":"2018-05-08T03:22:25.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As I mentioned though at the start if you read it I did mention adding in a substitute for all the champs you have listed as way to compromise for the loss of crit and others","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-05-08T03:29:38.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your solution sounds easy, but is It?\nJhin for example.
