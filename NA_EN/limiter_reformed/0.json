I remember that it gave me an automated response that an e-mail was sent to my mail informing me in detail about my ban\r\nso i just checked my e-mail and i still have nothing after a full month and i was wondering why this is. I received a 2 week suspension somewhere back in August of this year aswell which also didn't provide me with said e-mail. Does anyone know if it is a bug or not? On another note i feel like this ban has helped me a lot and i would like to thank Riot in a way for banning me even though i lost a lot of money and time on that account it helped me realise a lot of important things. I also want to thank Riot for letting me start a new account up from scratch and play on there so i can prove i am reformed. Which i can gladly say i am after seeing my new account grow up in Elo aswell as honor level. For anyone who wants to ask me some interesting questions surrounding this ban go for it. (ask me anything really xD). Also here is a link to my new account in case anyone wants to see my progress (or just become friends with me)? {{summoner:4}} Limiter V2 OUT!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T01:50:26.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe we send out those punishment e-mails any longer, but you should be able to see your reform card by logging into the client. Other than that, you're always welcome to hit up our player behavior team in a ticket to ask them about exactly why you ended up banned. \n\nGood Luck from here on out ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Limiter Reformed","date":"2017-11-07T16:02:10.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply Broporo and thanks for the encouraging words.\nAlso i already contacted the player behaviour team in a ticket and only got robotic responses explaining that i'm in the top 0,006% of all players that are toxic but never got told why i was there so i decided to bring it up here now.\nas for my ban i probably had it coming seeing as i was in fact flaming that game (depends on the context since i was actually bantering and meme'ing my premade in a really profane way) by now i'm already reformed and just reached gold 3 this season after only a month of playing which made me happy and also helped me realise a lot of mistakes i actually was making but didn't see before\nanyways thanks for the reply :) greatly appreciate it","replies":[]}]}]}
