I made it to honor 3 but after 1 or 2 weeks later i made it to honor 4 without doing anything?\r\nMy teammates usually never honor me anymore because i feed. So im super confused? Is this a bug or something? When i look on my profile it does say honor 4 and show it too. I'm 100% sure i'm not suppose to be honor 4. The past week the most honors i've gotten is one and most of the time it's from my friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T04:42:56.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange....I went ahead and pulled up your account and it looks like this one is currently only at Honor Rank 2. Let me know if you were talking about a different account and I can check up on that one too. With that being said, you still receive honor from playing matches normally even without being honored.","replies":[{"poster":"IcecreamCity","date":"2017-08-12T05:24:05.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Cookiemaker252.

That account is in fact Honor Rank 4, no bugs involved. Looks like you've been playing enough games without any penalties that you ended up getting enough base honor xp without even getting honored too much!","replies":[{"poster":"IcecreamCity","date":"2017-08-15T01:14:38.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much! <3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
