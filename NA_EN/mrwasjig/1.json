When your team is the one stomping the enemy team...its really not very fun, its actually really boring cuz its too easy. And when your team is the one being stomped its insanely frustrating cuz you cant do anything about it at all, so you get pissed. And with the way league is right now...80% of games being stomps one way or the other, that only leaves 20% of the time when the game is a challenge and is actually fun to play. Make sense? You spend most of your time playing games where your either bored or pissed/frustrated. Very few games actually bring a challenge where its even between both teams...thats when its fun! I can honestly see Riot fixing a lot of the issues....but if they dont give us waaaaaaaay more control over vision then i wont be playing much league in the future.

How many people would even be willing to do that in the very game we're playing atm (I should gank? No, you should ward! - Terrible Jungler number 15XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)? They've already admitted they missed the mark with the Cass rework. They admitted they missed the mark with the Sona rework (and Repetoir stated recently that this was due to budget concerns). They've been backpedaling with Morde for ages now, and they made a huge write-up apology/explanation for Fiora's rework. In a game with 127 different champions, not everything is gonna go right, but this doesn't mean that the player-base is all of a sudden better at game development and balancing than the damn dudes paid to do it, nor does it mean we can keep everything in stasis forever because one change is gonna piss someone somewhere off or cause imbalance for a bit.

IT'S MONEY. I even put it in caps.\n\nGame development is expensive. I know for a fact that a single fighting game character can cost up to 1 million bucks to fully complete, animations and everything. LoL characters probably don't cost *that* much, but if they do a rework that they're working on, even if there might be red flags showing up, they can't just scrap all the work they did. They *paid* to develop it. We don't know how long it was being worked on behind the scenes either.\n\nThe better answer, instead of whining for reverts, is to look for ways to make the changes work for the better, but no one seems to think farther ahead than the next 30 minutes on these boards so now Morde's a complete mess between what Riot wanted him to do and players kicking and screaming against it.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-01-11T19:48:24.659+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry mate, but I disagree fully with what you've said.\n\nalso this part:\n\n> The better answer, instead of whining for reverts, is to look for ways to make the changes work for the better \n\nTbh i want to slap you between eyes really bad right now.\nDo you have any, **ANY** idea how many posts have been made on how to fix Cassiopeia?
