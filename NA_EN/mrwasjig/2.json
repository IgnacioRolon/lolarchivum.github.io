Wasn't expecting that. At least keep discussion civil whilst you're here. Thanks)**\n\nWe all remember what happened when Cinderhulk was released, it became the &quot;Must-Buy&quot; item for tank junglers which resulted in tank junglers (and tanks in general) to become really strong. \n\nSo this of course resulted in some nerfs, the biggest of which was to Sejuani as we all know, but then later on Riot nerfed Cinderhulk and left Sejuani in a....not a dumpstered position but a significantly weaker one compared to pre-CH.\n\nAnd now Riot are nerfing Swain and Brand because they synergize too well with Deathfire Touch. Anyone else see history repeating itself here?\n\nInstead of taking care of the root of the problem Riot are instead nerfing those that benefit really well from it. What is it with Riot&#039;s &quot;Shoot first ask questions later&quot; nerfing strategy? \n\n&quot;Boss, Cindferhulk is really strong&quot;\n&quot;Nerf the benefactors!&quot;\n&quot;But shouldn&#039;t we nerf Cinderh-&quot;\n&quot;NO! Cinderhulk is fine!&quot;\n\n[One nerf hammer later]\n\n&quot;Hey boss, Cinderhulk is still strong&quot;\n&quot;Nerf Cinderhulk!&quot;\n&quot;Okay, should we undo previous nerfs to the benefactors?&quot;\n&quot;Sorry I can&#039;t hear over the sound of my MONEY!&quot;\n\nBecause pre-CH, while Sej was underplayed she was in a pretty good position and the only reason she needed nerfing was because CINDERHULK was too good. Not Sejuani. \n\nBut\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/familyguy/images/c/c5/Grinds-my-gears1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100119021134\n\nIs the fact that they didn&#039;t employ this &quot;Shoot first ask questions later&quot; strategy when it came to Tryndamere, Yasuo and Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust. \n&quot;Hey Riot, Trynd and Yas are really strong with Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust&quot;\n&quot;Okay we&#039;ll nerf it to only proc on champions, but won&#039;t go anywhere near Tryndamere or Yasuo, they good!&quot;\nWhy? Because Season 6 is the Season of Crit and god-forbid any Crit based champion sees unviability in the slightest!\n\nThe bias is so thick I could take a freaking chainsaw to it!\nPlease tell me I'm not the only one who's seeing the bias here.

Confirmation bias does not have to be subconscious. Confirmation bias is defined as the tendency of one to seek/interpret data/information that confirms ones hypothesis, preconceptions or ideals.\n\nEven when presented with data that opposes ones hypothesis, confirmation bias can still exist. This is because often people experiencing confirmation bias have the tendency to ignore, discredit or undervalue opposing arguments. What you are talking about is more along the lines of \"expecting to be right\". \n\nExample, I was developing a PID controller for a ball and plate system for our senior design project about a year ago. My theory was that I could look at a much easier example (ball and beam) and modify it to account for the additional 4 degrees of motion. Although one of my friends who was working on it said that it wouldn't be that simple. So I actively looked for evidence and models that would support my argument. When I found evidence showing otherwise, I took it into consideration but still thought my idea was correct but just didn't account for slippage.
