But if they also allow the opposition to get four dragons they will also face significant and permanent difficulty with further stalling.   Considering a fourth dragon is not only (normally) fairly late into the game but also presents four opportunities to be contested / stolen / taken this is fair.   Stronger stalling and comeback opportunities, but a balance to ensure other teams aren't just completely walled off from any possible victory.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-02-10T20:58:31.829+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":7,"body":"They've been trying for some time now.\n\nBegan with \"_You guys aren't canon, because that hinders our writing posibilities_\" then after 2 years they did absolutely nothing that'd warrant the retcon.\nHalf of people that cared for lore were buttfucked dry.\n\nThen they started pulling those garbage of reworks.\nCassio, Mordekaiser, Shen, etc. mains were buttfucked dry.\n\nThen they made favourism even more prominent, by buffing champions like Lux or Xin for the sake of it, while leaving those stuck at 45% winrate, losing every matchup rot for months.\n\nNow this.\n\nIt makes me think if they all aren't sharing one brain or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-02-10T19:35:23.278+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":47,"body":"Keep complaining about Zed","replies":[{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2016-02-10T20:49:23.388+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"If we build it, they will come. \nAnd by they, I mean Zed mains. \nAnd by Zed mains, clearly that's you.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-02-10T21:33:38.519+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":17,"body":"I don't main Zed lol.

I will not. Instead let me point something else out. \nThe majority of the time, if you are a midlaner (mage or not) you're goal in a team-fight is to kill their ADC. Since ADC's try to position themselves near the back line, you often have to over extend yourself in order to accomplish this, most mages don't have a strong form of escape/ gapcloser. Zed has both. \nHe can very quickly use his W to gapclose into their backline, and then press R to ult their ADC, becoming untargetable and leaving a shadow behind. When he reappears a quick press of Q and E will almost insure that the ADC will die, or be so low that they have to back right now, and Zed just has to press R again to blink back to where he ulted from. \nIt's kinda ludicrous how easy it is to play him","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2016-02-11T20:53:59.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you are talking about, and I hope I don't sound cocky, but this is a low elo problem.

Low elos have WAY more players in it then the higher ones and I think it is unfair to say that just because we aren't high enough rank that we don't deserve any recognition or respect when it comes to matters like balance. \nZed's are feared in low elo I think mostly because of the knowledge base that each player has. For the most part, players know how to play their champions...and that's about it. When it comes to countering other champions they are left a little blank. Do you know how much damage a single Zed can wreck in a game where no one knows how to counter him? It's insane.

There are tutorials and guides that outline how you defeat Zed. There are champions and items that help you counter Zed. If you want to get out of low elo (which is what every bronze/silver/Gold 3-5 player wants), then you have to put in time to learn how to counter the champ or just ban him. It's easier now since everyone except from the first 2 pick get a ban. \n\nNote that I'm not saying low elo should be disregarded, I'm just saying that nerfing Zed because people don't want to put in time to learn about him is wrong.
