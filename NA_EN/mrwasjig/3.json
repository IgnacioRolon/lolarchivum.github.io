Before it was Hourglass&#039;s cost, now it&#039;s the really high cooldown. This change hasn&#039;t actually done anything regarding the Stasis active. \n\nNot to mention the armour is also lower thanks to previous nerfs.

My comment about Regen was to highlight that LC/new Morello are **better** than old Morello in early game (even if they are worse in late, but I'm not convinced about that). So if you were buying Morello first before 6.9, you should still like it a lot now, and you are not forced into Tear-builds.\n\nAthene has been changed into a supportive item, but that doesn't mean you cannot build it on Oriana or Lulu Mid depending on the rest of your Team comp.\n\nFor Artillery mages that bought Athene before, yes, you should probably go for Tear now, but even without Tear, if you build something like RoA/Morello/GLP007, you should have plenty of mana, even in late game (and those are 3 good items even if you don't take the mana into account).\n\nNow, if you do accept to take Battle Mages into account, or even champs like Annie and Lissandra, or if you take an off-meta pick and go top with a Mage against a Melee champ, you also have a whole category of Mages that will like the new Catalyst a lot, either into RoA for the pile of stats or into GLP for the defense/utility, depending on your playstyle.\n\nSo we were not really talking about Cho'Gath. I mentioned Cho as an example of the many cases above. If you disagree about Cho, well... There are still a LOT of other cases where you can build something else than Tear. Yeah, you won't have any Regen anymore. But on the other side, Tear isn't the only good Flat Mana item anymore, and **that's the \"somehting big\" you've been missing**.

Sure, there're mages that want to roam all over the place and get stuff done, but before they're more powerful than supports the supports don't really have mana regen anyway, and once they are more powerful gating their power by forcing them to go back or keep blue buff on themselves can keep them from becoming excessive.
