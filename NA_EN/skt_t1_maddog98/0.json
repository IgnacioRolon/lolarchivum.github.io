Or when my gragas from that game gets outganked by a deverouer udyr 7ganks to gragas 2 ganks. Or the cassiopeia starts out 0-6 and allows the mid quin to roam. I cant control every aspect of the game simultaneously. or my worst game so far. 4-2-5 was my kda. my jg lee started out 1-7 and tried to towerdive the enemy shen at lvl 3. My top malph ran exhaust and never grouped for teammfights till we were 40 minutes in. my vayne decided to play like an idiot and repeatedly go in on a draven/alistar bot lane in the early lane phase.\n\nSure they weren't true trolls. But they refused to cooperate when I told them what to do. Its hard micromanaging everyone on your team because you know that if you don't they will end up feeding. That has been every single game I've lost. This game is hard because of the reliance on your teammates. And I'm not ever over occupying myself with what they do. There are some games that aren't winnable, and those 2 unwinnable games just happend to be when I played Ahri support . \n\nIf you said that there was nothing wrong about playing nonmeta champs, then why say anything in the first place?\nRefusing to acknowledge that there are shitty players out there that you may get stuck with is just a challenger players attempt to belittle your skill at the game, and indirectly insult you for not doing enough if you lose. \n\nLeague is a team game. 80% of it is getting the 4 other players to cooperate with you, and the other 20% is you doing your absolute best to solidify a lead and win the game. You can be 20-0 midlane and still lose because you have a terrible frontline, or the enemy builds against you and your penn items cant melt them fast enough before they melt the rest of your team. \n\nNow I don't know if you know what gold 2 - plat 4 is like, but you almost need a degree in child pshycology to get past it. It is the dregs of the league community, and home to some of the most uncooperative and egotistical players in the entirety of the league community. Almost every other rank in the game is a representation of skill, however this range of ranks is just a dice roll. I've been from silver 4 to plat 1 and I can tell you, gold 2-plat 4 is just the absolute worst. Games here are especially toxic. It almost feels like you are playing in a bad bronze game. \n\nThen again, this whole situation can be summed up to gold 2- plat 4 being absolute cancer and a nightmare to play in.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneakyy XD","date":"2016-03-25T12:32:10.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the fix, mate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CreamPi3","date":"2016-03-25T07:02:53.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support just less stressful imo...I go top lane and if enemy top teleports bot and gets a double i get flamed..
