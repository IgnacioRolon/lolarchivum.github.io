Then came Hippalus later in the day letting people know individual icons were added for sale.   This is just my guess but this decision was probably due to low bundle sales that didn&#039;t meet their sales expectation on one of the world&#039;s most popular region and teams.\r\n\r\nHere is the problem:\r\n\r\nThere are people like me who decided to buy the bundle knowing and thinking it was the only means to capture icons of their favorite LCK teams.   Had there been some sort of a notice letting people know individual icons would be available in the later time, surely, I would have waited for them.\r\n\r\nWhile I fully understand Riot&#039;s in-game store policy not allowing refunds for summoner&#039;s icons and bundle purchases, this wasn&#039;t your typical RP purchase.\r\n\r\nSo grudgingly, I sent a request for a full refund on the bundle purchase explaining just about everything I posted above.   A day later, their response was basically telling me to go read their refund policy as they have bundles available to help people save RP on their purchase.   This would make sense if I had planned to buy 8 of their 10 icons and they had individual icons for sale available at the time of my purchase or even a notice that individual icons would become available later.\r\n\r\nThis response ticked me off the wrong way as they were putting full responsibility on me for purchasing the bundle when I had no other options.   First, I wouldn&#039;t have bought the bundle if individual icons were available for sale or if there was a note that individual icons would become available at later time.   Second, I wouldn&#039;t have requested for a refund had they not added individual icons for sale after my purchase.\r\n\r\nSo I just about wrote an essay explaining how their summoner&#039;s icon and bundle sales policy didn&#039;t exactly fit this situation and requested another full refund on the bundle purchase.   This was after I had gifted 9 individual LCK icons to friends.\r\n\r\nI had spent roughly $500+ on RPs and never once made a refund on my purchases.   I currently hold another $400+ worth RPs for future purchases.   This isn&#039;t about me trying to save 1,500 RPs or whatever but it&#039;s my complaint about their sales strategy that screwed players like myself.\r\n\r\nTheir response to my essay of second request came in short, it&#039;s their policy and they can&#039;t do anything about it.\r\n\r\nReally?\r\n\r\nIf you think this situation corresponds with your policy, how about an explanation?   If not, how about a sincere apology?   Hell, how about you acknowledge how your sales strategy have screwed me and others?\r\n\r\nWhat this whole process made me think is how Riot doesn&#039;t give a rat&#039;s ass about players&#039; sales experience.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, now I&#039;m skeptical if said percentage of their profit even goes to support these teams.   How about live updates on sales and when the sales are finally over on the 1st of September, you provide us with proof that funds have been delivered.\r\n\r\nI am done purchasing RP and buying collectibles on their merchandise shop until they either refund my bundle purchase or sincerely apologize acknowledging their questionable sales strategy and attempts to put full responsibility on me for their scam.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s laughable how Riot tells you players&#039; experience is the most important agenda for their company and how they want to lead the e-sports to another level.   Here&#039;s a clue Riot, the way you treat your loyal customers, you won&#039;t go any further with your goals.   If that is even their goal and not just another BS PR.","replies":[]}
