Not that I&#039;m ripping on the current ones, they are just all kind of light-hearted humor type skins. Maybe a serious one?\r\n\r\nNamazu is the name of a catfish in Japanese myth that&#039;s so big that they blame him for giant earthquakes.\r\n\r\nTahm Kench IS kind of a fatty.\r\n\r\nMaybe a neat conceptual idea that would click with a lot of the game&#039;s users? Give it a Japanese art twist or something. Dono. Figured if I could ask for something I should also have some input. Ultimately I don&#039;t care as long as it isn&#039;t silly.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;d be nice.
