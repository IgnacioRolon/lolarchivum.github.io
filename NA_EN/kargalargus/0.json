As it turns out, that information is incorrect, as the game you were in crashed entirely on the server. The reason you couldn't reconnect is that the game wasn't there to connect to. You haven't been hit with any penalties due to this match, and you should be able to re-queue as usual!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bentron","date":"2017-07-30T20:23:30.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same happened to me yesterday.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wikloo","date":"2017-07-30T11:58:59.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing actually just happened to me, my game is still going and i can't do anything, still waiting to see if it count as a lose or not.","replies":[]}]}
