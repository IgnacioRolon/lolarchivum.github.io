I *could* have been Challenger but honestly I'm nowhere near as good as I was back in seasons 5-6. But, thank you for the compliment though. I'm not that great.\n\nThat aside, I don't play the most broken of the broken. I play Katarina, Rengar and Vayne as my main champs and they've been my main champs ever since season 3 (season 2 for Kat). Even when they were garbage I still played them. So, they might be really good now (in the case of Vayne, absurdly broken) but do know that I've been playing them for years now. \nAs for the Illaoi, Kha, Wukong games....I was showing my friends how busted they were. Especially Kha'zix with Predator.\n\nYou are right I don't have consistent scores on Zoe. That's because I've only played 10 games of her, at which point I got bored of her. \nNow, I'm not saying that her oneshot is broken beyond belief. All her Q needs is like a 0.1-0.2 AP ratio nerf+a possible look at the base damage and that's all. \nHowever, her E does need to be looked at. Most notably the trap afterwards should just be removed since the ability is powerful enough as is. Additionally the bonus true damage from her E could be changed to bonus magic damage, which would hurt her ability to chunk tanks, but it would make her just as good vs squishies.\n\nOn a side note, I do not enjoy playing vs noobs for fun, I just play with friends. You are correct in saying I play ranked to maintain elo, at least for season 7 anyway. That's because they reworked Kat and Rengar and they're not as fun as they used to be. \nWell that, and the fact that my life has been busy.\n\nFinally, as much as I would like to say I want to play Zoe vs people of my skill level....I honestly couldn't be bothered since she's a perma-ban. In that sense I'm not the only one that finds her to be a hilariously broken champion.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nOne other thing to note is that I don't think she's a problem to the meta at all. She's just incredibly frustrating to play against, and that's that. Zoe doesn't even need any huge nerfs to change this, all she needs are some slight damage nerfs and for her E to be looked at; as the ability does far too much in terms of purpose.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2018-01-14T15:12:31.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports can even self-crucible","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-01-14T21:47:16.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.
