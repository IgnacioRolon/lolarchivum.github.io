You can tell which one you got, and why, by checking your \"Completed Missions\" log. Just open up your Mission Log and click the \"View Completed\" link at the bottom of the list. You should have a quest named \"Defender of the League\", \"Champion of the League\", or \"Conqueror of the League\".\n\nFor more information on how those rewards were earned, check out the [Preseason Update FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908) page.\n\n>**Q**: Are there any other rewards for veterans coming this preseason?\n\n>**A**: We're planning to give out exclusive emotes based on how many hours you've put in since the beginning of League. Playing approximately 500 hours gets you the Defender of the League emote, at around 1,500 hours gets you the Champion of the League emote, and 2,500 hours gets you the ultra-rare Conqueror of the League emote. The cutoff for game hours is August 31, 2017.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
