I'll give you multiple examples of this.\n\n\nOne example-\n\nMy ex's brother, we'll call him john. John was autistic. This was medically documented. When we would tell him he was wrong or his behavior was socially unacceptable in certain situations he would KEEP GOING on and on and get very frustrated with this. He was not able to comprehend (simply put) the \"vibes\" given off by everyone around him that his behavior was enough. If we told him the \"food had this in it\" and then showed him he was wrong, he would continue to argue. \"this has pepper in it\" etc. He had a bad social understanding of situations like this. He just \"didn't get it\"\n\n\n Another example of this-\n\nWe were in the store, we explained we couldn't get john a certain item because we didn't really need it and he was the only one who liked it. He kept going on and on after being told NO saying \"this and that\" which didn't matter, because the answer was NO.\n\n\nThe situation in league of legends that happened-\n\nA child in one of my games said to ban nasus. i asked him \"why? you're going wukong. wukong beats him early-mid if you can prevent him from stacking.\"  (to be fair, if you play well you CAN beat him early as wukong...)  \n(Also to be fair, i was WRONG. wukong does NOT counter nasus)\n\nI told him i wasn't going to ban him and that wu counters him. He started showing me all the counter websites after i said that. Meanwhile, the whole time (AFTER I TOLD HIM) i just banned nasus. Like he asked. No biggie.\n\nHis lack of social understanding and basic social skills blinded him so much he didn't even realize i gave him what he asked for. Which would also be common among AUTISTICS.","replies":[]}
