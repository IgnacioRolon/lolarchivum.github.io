Like i have bigass dudes with beards that make them look like zeus themself and i&#039;m not even scared anymore when they talk smack or try to be a smartass. It literally doesn&#039;t fade me. I just think about how stupid they are, and stabbing them in the side. Repeatedly.\r\n\r\nLike people say things that blow my mind. They&#039;re so stupid that i don&#039;t think they can actually be said. \r\n\r\nExample-\r\n\r\n(i&#039;m at cigarette counter)\r\n\r\n(Big guy comes threw my line, this dude is huge and looks brutal and tough as hell. balls the size of meteors)\r\n\r\nHim- can i get a pack of newport box  100&#039;s.\r\n\r\nMe- Sure! (grabs them) (tells him total)\r\n\r\nHim- (pays)\r\n\r\nMe- (gets him his change and receipt) have a good one (hands both to him with receipt)\r\n\r\nHim- I don&#039;t need the receipt, dude. I can&#039;t return these.\r\n\r\n\r\nMe (what i ACTUALLY said) - have a good one (smile) (he walks away, says nothing)\r\n\r\n\r\nMe (what i&#039;m GOING to be saying from now on) - Yeah, i&#039;m a cashier so it&#039;s my job to give the receipt back in general. I think there&#039;s this thing called.. uhh wow! A garbage can! It&#039;s a new invention and i believe it&#039;s a receptical for trash. Have a good one!","replies":[]}
