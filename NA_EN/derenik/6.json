Like, I’m sorry that that’s her biggest problem, and it’s the only reason she’s not viable in her originally intended main role. Don’t get me wrong... I love Morgana dearly, but her W is such a big problem.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rian","date":"2019-02-20T11:23:55.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was quite nervous about this rework for quite a while now and I´m not 100% sure what to think yet. It looks .. good .. the animations are cool and her look represents the lore aspect very well and yet I´m missing something about her former visual identity\n\nThe new dress looks nice and I know a lot of people dislike the \"tent\" nonetheless I like this shape more and hope there is at least one skin with the old variant just with better physics and more details. \n\nWings... I love the Seraphim look from Kayle. Morgana´s wings look awesome too and fit lore wise but can we have a toggle option (like Aatrox) for all 6 wings? Please? Or maybe a dark Seraphim skin that would be awesome. \n\n~~On another note I didn´t think about it at first but after seeing the new Dark Binding animation I think it´s a bit of a nerf. Don´t get me wrong it looks very nice however now it´s far easier to distinguish her autoattacks from her binding which makes it difficult to bait things like mobility spells. ~~\n\nAlso since I´m mainly playing Morgana mid the Tormented Soil changes affect me directly. They seem to be ok but I need to test them myself to get a better idea how they perform. From my calculations pushing early is a bit more difficult with the posted values but the overall damage against squishy targets should be higher. Not sure about tanks though since you need to lower there hp below the breakpoint of ~70% if you want to deal more damage with Tormented Soil.\n\nI´m a bit disapointed about a missed opportunity with changes to her passive and autoattacks since a lot of people complain she is not very interactive. This would be a way to encurage a more active playstyle. However I think it´s a good decision to keep the current playstyle intact rather than forcing a unsatisfactorily alternative.\n\nStill can´t wait to play her and see how things turn out especially for my beloved Exiled skin :D\n\nEdit: after seeing some gameplay footage I noticed the spinning animations seems to be part of her autoattack animation as well thanks for this one :D\n\nIn addition I´d like to mention a small detail I have noticed recently. The Tormented Soil slow (if you have {{item:3116}} equiped) is delayed sometimes because of it´s link to the .5 second tick rate of the damage. This is especially noticable with the increased minion movement speed since they can cross almost halve the area before the slow does affect them.\n\nCorrect me if I´m wrong but I think that´s more of a technical compromise than an intended ability limitation and increasing tick rate or individual timer for each target might be a little bit much for such a small detail so I´d suggest to add an initial 1 truedamage if someone enters the area.","replies":[]}]}
