The looks to me is just a plus in my book. It has no relevance, as long as they embody the champion's personality and feel in the splash art. But most people just focus on the looks, the rest are irrelevant to them.\n\nHonestly don't know why you have a problem for example with Riven's Lunar revel skin. It's a badass splash art where she is slaying soldiers in the heat of battle. Her face embodies her emotion in that splash. I don't know, maybe you prefer her giving a duck face like she's taking a selfie...\n\nLike I said, look at the splash art as a whole and not just her face then ignore the rest.

What we all are attracted to is a product of our biology as homo sapien *animals* plus the influences of the culture we live in. Cultural differences are becoming even more minimal with the global, internet-connected world we have today. Persnal taste is like a dash of salt in comparison. \n\nYouth, symmetry, averageness, sexual dimorphism, indicators of health, fitness and strong genes, cleanliness - being attracted to these features are all inbedded in us period. After all these are taken into account then you can add the tiny personal preferences. Bob may prefer Jessica's Alba's tan while Joe likes Scarlet Johansson's blue eyes. In the grand scheme of things though? They're minor differences.\n\nWith all of that said- I will admit there probably is someone somewhere who prefers angular faces and masculine features in women (who works at Riot ahem). There are also people who prefer children, the elderly, and/or the disabled too. Beauty is certainly in the eye of the beholder in these cases. The other 99.999...% of cases are more...typical.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ligerzz","date":"2015-02-13T06:31:16.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People have opinions.
