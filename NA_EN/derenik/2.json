Enemy team was BMing and bullying us/me for it. Tried to shake it off and play another game. Look and behold, the premade that won and were toxic was on my team this time. All through champ select they were bullying me on how they beat us good, gloating, saying no hard feelings, kept being toxic trying to tilt me for some reason even though I was on their team this time. \n\nI didn&#039;t respond in chat, but thought to myself: &quot;I will get banned for this, but screw it, I&#039;ll take the 2 week break.&quot; I locked my champ in, went into the game, waited for the 3 minute mark and then said: &quot;enjoy the loss, no hard feelings. :)&quot; I left the game.\n\nThey lost, one was in their provisional, got silver 5 rank.\n\nI got banned few hours later, so the system works. Lol. But it was worth it. I&#039;ll have my break (going on a vacation anyway for a few weeks) while knowing they were really pissed and got bad start ranking, they got punished for being bullies and toxic. (maybe even Riot punished them for it too).\n\nMoral of the story: Don&#039;t be a douchebag, some of us don&#039;t care about getting punished, as long as you got the bad start ranking and lost the game that you wanted to win so badly. :)\n\nOff to my vacation!\n\nCheers!\n\nP.S. None of the teammates that lost were innocent as they were joining in on the bullying. Even if they were, I got the ban, I was punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-02-23T14:04:10.069+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem in this game is so many people put trolling teammates above winning.\n\nPartially because the punishments are too light for both the offender and the offended who ends up toxic in the name of personal justice.\n\nIf punishments were harsher, the OP wouldn't feel the need to punish the bullies himself and he would be more wary of breaking the rules","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-02-22T22:40:10.927+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wow, good job man, you ruined the game for 2 completely random people because of what some other toxic players did!\nCan you explain how what you did to the innocent bystanders is better than what these other toxic players did to you?","replies":[{"poster":"ChÃ¸nklord","date":"2017-02-22T23:09:12.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> P.S.

This isn't AFKing. This is a deliberate disconnect after three minutes, with chat log backing up that he wanted them to lose.\n\nLeaver buster is different and has a different system. Deliberate game throwing is absolutely 'one or two strikes and you're out'.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-02-23T14:16:20.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Congratulations on being 9, I guess?","replies":[]}]}
