We don't have visibility on third party sites so we can't say for sure how accurate or in-sync it is.  I'd like to help resolve whatever is causing this freeze though.

Either everyone were kicked out of the game, or I never get the loss for it but my teammates did. I played Morgana and the last game on my match history is Lux.\n\nAll that happened was I got an \"attempting to reconnect\" sign while playing. Waited a while, nothing happened. So decided to exit the game and reconnect, but the client froze, just a big \"L\" logo. I closed it through ctrl alt delete. Opened the client again, logged in, and was sent to the homepage and never got to reconnect to game.","replies":[]}]}]}
