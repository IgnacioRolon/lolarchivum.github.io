If he is able to kill somebody effortlessly with his EAAWQ then he is a problem. Landing his ult, although not particularly difficult, should be a key part to playing Kass. His Q/E should probably be a relatively low amount of his damage since they are ranged. He should be forced into melee if you guys insist on keeping his burst patterns, and a buff to anything other than his ult won't help with that.\r\n\r\nAs for buffing the damage of his ult, that won't really help because he won't have to range to get to it.\r\n\r\nIf you guys are REALLY intent on giving him some more power but keeping him nerfed, I propose giving him back his ult range and then nerfing his Q or E damage.\r\n\r\nIf he needs compensation, buff his W/R, because they are the healthiest parts of his kit for applying damage even if they have the most power budget of his kit.\r\n\r\nI think the final solution is to make him into a DPS champion, probably through his W/R (think of his ult as being used to move into range for his W and then using the stacking effect to slowly ramp up his DPS) and then his Q should definitely be changed into something else while his E can probably stay the same. The combination of Q/E being a large part of his burst makes him a bit faceroll though.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-03T06:20:45.588+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"We're currently testing buffs to his R involving increasing its range and, at ranks 1 and 2,  giving it a lower CD (so while it's not going as far as pre 5.4 still he's able to use it more often ).

Not guaranteed that'll be the path we take, that's current thinking though.\n\nCan we have some context of what part of the game is gonna be buffed/nerfed?\n\n**Early game (pre lvl6) **\nConsidering he is a late game champion the early game is fine, there are some bully champions that will force you at turret but latest rework fixed this.\n\n**Mid Game (>lvl6 up until fully stacked ROA/ArchStaff + another item)**\nThis is where only a snowballing Kass keep up. The issue is that without snowball the damage is not very high and with 450 range ult bully champions will continue to keep you unfarmed so delaying your late game even more.\n\n**Late Game (in the current state)**\nUlt cd is far too low, slow % is far too high even with 1s duration, damage is high even from range, but in any teamfight which isn't already won there is no chance to go over the frontline and there are too many opportunities to be kited without getting in range for anything but Q.\n\nSo lowering the CD in the mid game isn't going to do any good, in fact it is the biggest issue. The CD at low ranks is fine, it was fine even before rework. It's the 2s cd in the late game that is a problem (jump in QW zhonya, jump out since cd is up again) and the mana cost of the 4rth stack if you couldn't land a W (which is fine since it opens up counterplays). But with current range there is no way you can jump the front line, nor get back.\n\nI think the biggest issues that forced you to nerf riftwalk into oblivion is because you reduced the CD too much. With late game damage you are able to jump in, oneshot with 3 skills, zhonya to avoid any cc/damage and then jump out. I definetly preferred having to jump onto somebody to get back mana, this would simply remove the problem of being an aoe snare initiator that can avoid every damage with a zhonya.\n\nMy ideas are raise Riftwalk CD  to 5-6s at all levels, cdr will lower it a bit in the late game, 600 range at least, 100 mana cost x rank x 3 with a refund when landing on a champion. \nReduce the slow to 70% 1.5s duration and raise it's base damage reducing the scaling (so it will be better mid game and less bursty late game).\n\nI'm not sure why you think that reducing the cd AND increasing the range at early ranks is going to fix anything.

Casting Q expends the the shield as extra damage, making him vulnerable to counter attack. Or you could play it safe & keep your shield up, but have to forego the poke.\n\nAs a mobile champ, he's also got generically high base MS. He should have garbage MS (he can hardly breathe after all) and have nearly all of his mobility on his ult. Not giving him the back up plan of just running away if his ult is down would give some more counterplay & keep him from outpacing other champs if they REALLY want to chase. After 4 ults, he may be far away, but he'll have 12 sec of downtime for enemies to catch up to him.\n\nAnother change I read that sounds cool is to have his R reduce by ~50 units per stack to tax spamming, which would give even more room to punish bad positioning.

Frankly I don't think that Kassadin players would mind a 10/7/4 cooldown if it meant each riftwalk felt more impactful and not an expensive Ezreal E. \nPersonally I'd like to know what the problem is with its old 700 range is from your perspective. Here's a controversial idea. Make his R a flat cost plus a percentage of his total mana. He won't be pidgeonholed into the mandatory RoA and/or tear rush and can prioritize his assassin life instead of bulky anti-mage assassin life. Of course if you do this I'd recommend a net decrease of mana used per stack since there's no way to build around it. Encouraging him to rush a Deathcap over a RoA will make him burstier but also much more open to being burst right back. He'd basically operate like a Leblanc that doesn't have as broken of a \"get out of a bad decision free\" button (reactivated Distortion).\n\nAs far as reworking his kit goes, I had a few ideas.\n\nHave you guys considered reworking his passive so that he's less anti-mage (so that way he won't be either OP or underwhelming depending on what's popular with the meta) and making him more typical assassin? Say you remove his free 15% damage reduction from magic damage and give him something fair as a passive instead, change his shield from magic damage to all damage but lower the shield amount, but make it proc the shield when it lands and not when Q is cast. Lower the projectile speed too for all I care. This would encourage getting close to your opponent when you trade since the travel speed and shield timing would be way less relevant. You could even make his shield bigger depending on how close he is to his target. Really, my point is that a Brand player shouldn't feel hopeless against him, but Kassadin shouldn't feel hopeless against a good Zed or Talon. The idea of an anti-mage is more toxic than the mobility in my opinion, especially when it is coming from another mage. \n\nIt just seems that you guys have no idea what you really want him to *be*. Should he be a bulky anti-mage? Assassin? Mobile monstrosity? He can't be all of that. \n\nBasically, I bought and played Kassadin back in 2012 because I saw some youtube videos of him being a jumpy asshole and that appealed to me way more than anything else. I don't care if he's not bulky, I just wanna be able to traverse Summoner's Rift in a straight line.

What if instead of dealing extra damage with each stack and staying the same range it it got weaker?\n\nMy idea is this:\n\nAt all ranks of his ultimate, the initial range is the original 700 and does the most damage. But with each time he uses it, Riftwalk *not only* decreases in range, but *also* in damage? This way, players are forced into the decision:\n\nDo I keep it \"fresh\" for max range and damage? Or do I use to it to clear this wave or simply roam/ jump around faster?\n\nOf course the mana cost would also increase and the numbers would have to tuned, but I think this forces more interesting decisions in using Riftwalk. It would reward the Kassadins that hold onto rift walk for the right moment/ kill, rather than just willy nilly flitting around the edge of a team right or wave clear.\n\nP.S.: This is related to {{champion:110}} as an aside, but what do you think of the idea of Qs cool down resetting upon champion kill?

Just think of it like in those movies where the archer character (orlando bloom i guess) is just firing arrows rapid fire and killing targets, \"headshot\" style. I don't think it would push him over the edge, it would just better fit his position as a carry that kills things (making his passive more useful).

Should he be using his ult to stack up damage and land on a target for huge damage or should he be using it for mobility? How about escapes?\n\nI don't think it's deniable that he shouldn't be using it as an escape, at least without some hefty cost. *Only* because it's easy and on a low CD. If it had a huge CD, sure, the cost can be light because the cost comes in the form of a CD.\n\nShould he also have massive map roam ability? How strong can this be?\n\nI think the CD should remain the same and the first cast of his Ult should be hefty, with it going down in price instead of up, and landing on champions refunds half the cost.\n\nNow early on this would be atrocious, because early there is no mana pool. This is simple to deal with though, especially since Kass was given scaling damage with mana. Simply, make his ult cost a percent of mana and the mana built up (or a portion of it) is converted in to damage when landing on a target. This also means a second ult on to the same target does significantly less damage since the mana pool was expended on the first hit. However, both times will refund half the mana cost (including the pooled amount).\n\nThis allows him to roam and make it so using his ult as an escape actually has a serious cost while also reinforcing his assassin identity. The level 6 base damage should be kinda hefty but the base won't scale well, due to the mana scaling.\n\nI honestly propose a 600 range ult with this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Compensate","date":"2015-03-03T20:50:07.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of nerfing the travel distance, but it was a hair too much.
