Caitlyn does have an escape on a relatively short cooldown, she does have a range advantage, but despite all of this, her safety is only slightly better than Jinx. Jinx has a strong slow and hard CC, which keeps her a relatively safe laner. The difference between the two lies in the scaling. Caitlyn scales really well into mid game, but falls off late game due to her lack of AD or AS steroids. Meanwhile, Jinx has just as strong of a mid-game as Caitlyn, but also scales super well into the late game, making her into a hyper carry. Jinx scales too well for as strong of an early/mid game that she has. I would prefer for Riot to smooth over her scaling, rather like they did with Tristana and fix the fucking hitbox on her R.. That hitbox is absurdly large for the amount of damage it does.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2015-04-17T05:09:50.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree. the point i was trying to make about Jinx wasn't that she was better, but that she was safer due to her harder CC and the greater flexibility of it.\n\nCait can use the 90 cal. net to get to saftey and slow an enemy, but cant cant use it to catch someone without firing it behind her and losing her slow.

Jinx is the best ADC in the game against tanks, second to Vayne (who can't excel due to an epic garbage early and mid game).  All she has to do is not feed and auto-wins late game as a secondary win condition due to her passive.  She also has the highest combination of CC+damage compared to other ADCs.  You'd have to remove features from her kit to hurt her win-rate, which honestly isn't really necessary, as she isn't overpowered.   \n\nWhat needs to happen is the other ADCs need buffs, specifically Ashe, MF, Varus, and Twitch.

We can't really look at Win Rate for accuracy when it comes to if a champion is OP or not. Pick rate usually says a lot though. When pick rate changes dramatically while Win Rate stays consistent, that means either there's LESS players playing her and simply just having mains use her, or in this case, it means the META is shifting to her favor. She's been considered good since release and has had a very consistent win rate since then, never going below about 51% To change from 52% at release and only go to about 51% minimum while maxing at 54% shows incredible consistency. Considering nothing has really change in or against her favor other than the META shifting, it's simply just her time to shine to right now.\n\nHonestly, if win rate and pick rate really mattered though, we should be screaming to have Sivir nerfed. She's one of the top win rates, sitting only .1% lower than Jinx and having gone from a 5% pick rate to about 13ish%. She's had just less of a change in pick rate without any buffs or nerfs really done to her in that time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarksideEric","date":"2015-04-16T01:00:29.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kaellrus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9HmOELvZ,comment-id=00250000,timestamp=2015-04-15T23:46:25.542+0000)\n>\n> She has had this winrate for months.
