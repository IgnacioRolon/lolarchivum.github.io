I feel like shes strong atm but not reliable so maybe some changes i have to suggest might be useful?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZeroFlex","date":"2016-01-28T23:26:35.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your priority based on groups that interact with eachother more intimately? As far as - tanks are in the most reliable spot, and Marksman are most easily balanced around tanks - thus you balanced the marksman first. Then that would lead you to logically move to mages, who also are easily balanced around tanks after marksman are in a good spot. Assassins seem to be the ones who would logically be balanced last, as they have the most impact on the other \"more easily\" balanced roles.
