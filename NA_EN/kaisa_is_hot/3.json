I feel she is very underwhelming atm especially in the current meta of Ashe/Caitlyn/Ezreal bot lane, especially Ashe. I mean I know winrates and stats don&#039;t say everything but Kalista is literally sitting around 43% winrate. That&#039;s pretty terrible especially for an ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2016-07-04T00:44:39.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, Kalista needs a rework before any buffs. She's just too toxic.

She needs a reworked W, R and Black spear.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that you request buffs on her Q but this skill has the craziest scaling in all game I believe, it goes from 10 to 70 base dmg at lvl 2 and it's 100% TOTAL AD, that's nuts!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gator Nuggets","date":"2016-07-04T23:59:47.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think any champ with a <45% win rate should be buffed. Kalista's kit may be \"toxic\" whatever that means, but she doesn't need to be made unviable because of it. They should at least give her her normal aa scaling back","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-07-04T00:47:52.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but she is the only champion which I can safely say that should have never ever been released in her current state. \n\nHer kit is too toxic, she needs to remain trash until she can be reworked.","replies":[]}]}
