So when ranked came out they all hopped on it and played all their matches together. After some time their best player was rank 76 (or 75 can't remember) which corresponded o the top of our challenger. The other team members where close behind with the lowest being 72 I think it was. Except for their support. He was at 65 corresponding to mid gold, maybe low plat if you are generous.\nIt mainly happened because supports in overwatch does not deal a lot of damage and only really shine in difficult matches since that is the opportunity they get to heal a lot. So every time they lost he lost less rank but every time they won he also got less to some matches where he hardly got anything since his team just stomped the enemy.\n\nYou could argue that our supports are not as dedicated healers but we still got soraka who will likely suffer the same fate. To a lesser extend the same could be applied to all supports meaning that even less players will want to play that role. Furthermore the grading system riot has already makes people do weird things like farming a lane instead of grouping and winning and this is just going to amplify it even more, especially if the player think the game is lost.","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2016-11-30T08:04:48.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh, thanks for the explaination! ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaisa is Hot","date":"2016-11-29T11:40:19.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stephenizgod,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=roQHEBA2,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-11-28T20:45:51.018+0000)\n>\n> Players already do this though, they don&#x27;t want to ruin their KDA or they just want to boost their CS before the game is over so they can say &quot;hey I did good but my teammates are trash&quot; or perhaps they just need to get that last S/S+ and don&#x27;t really care if they win or lose.  \n> \n> I agree that its not a good idea to give players more LP (or reduce the amount they lose) based on their Mastery Score, because that seems to only judge the stats, not your actual contribution to the team.

It's also nonsense because games are won or lost at certain inflection points. You can CS like a pro and play perfectly for 35 minutes but if you use Ezreal's E to jump into 3 hoping to snipe a kill and lose a late game fight, it's all for naught. Grades are mostly about your average performance and don't reflect decision making very well.
