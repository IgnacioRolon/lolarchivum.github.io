Better as in, *lower latency* in League, or faster download speeds? A lot of that can be used to determine what service is a better choice for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Virgin Ray","date":"2016-10-14T04:57:32.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically something that'll give me 90 to 20 fps, or lower of course.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-16T21:13:31.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As *Wolfess* mentioned, you're likely meaning 20-90ms of latency.

More frames per second = smoother image since it will display any changes faster","replies":[]}]}]}]}
