I'd be perfectly happy for them to gate ranked by mastery rank considering riot halved the exp to get to 30 and made the basic tier 3 runes cheap as chips.\n\nIf riot said at the end of this season 'From next season only champions you own with  rank 2 mastery or above will be eligible for ranked.' This gives the whole preseason for people to get rank 2 (if you played before CM was introduced).\n\nAs to new champions. If you had pbe access then getting wins for a fast rank 2 shouldn't be  a problem.

This is also better than fully disabling a new champ from being pickable in ranked, Plus it'll increase the trust between teammates since you can't just buy and play a champ but get to know the champ before jumping into ranked.\n\nAnd mastery rank 2 is nothing hard to get I have several mastery 5 champs and mastery 2 is nothing if it was mastery 3+ then it'd be tedious but mastery 2 is just a few games.\n\nSo there are no issues of someone getting banned out due to the amount of champions needed in the first place. No issue of new comers not being able to transition since 16 mastery 2 champs isn't hard to do. A great plus of more trust since you'll feel that your teammates did play the champ before entering the ranked game.
