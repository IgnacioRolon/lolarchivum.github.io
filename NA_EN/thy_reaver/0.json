I thought maybe I didn&#039;t have it selected right before the game started so I tried again, and the same thing happened. I made sure to constantly keep selecting the skin until the game started and still started me with default colors. Anyone else having this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-20T17:12:43.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Thy Reaver,\n\nThanks for the report! \n\nWe're aware of an issue where Team Builder isn't accepting chromas sometimes, and we're currently investigating. \n\nWas this right after you purchased the chroma pack? Did you log back out and log back in before using the chroma pack? Any additional information you can provide would be great. Thank you! ^-^","replies":[]}]}
