In game My ping and fps stay the same but out of no where and for no reason it seems, my sound stops working and the game essentially freezes, i can walk around and use abilities but i cant see the abilties activate and monster/s creeps and what not will run out of hp and the bar will disappear but the monster stays and keeps fighting and creep keep swinging. Then after a few second (between 2 and 10) everything that has happened in that gap will happen on screen in lightspeed. So what happens most times is right when i get to a spot and move around then the freeze happens and when it snaps back the enemy team is killing/killed me. I really dont know what this is but i need help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T17:59:03.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble maintaining a connection, causing communication with the server to throttle and delay.
