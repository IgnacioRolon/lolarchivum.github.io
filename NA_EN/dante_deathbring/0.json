Please check the logs for more information.\" Please help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been trying to fix my League client on and off again for 3 weeks, i don't know much about it so i looked up several different fixes for this. I've reinstalled league, completely removed it from my computer then reinstalled it, I've completely removed it, turned off my computer, then reinstalled it. I have installed the Hextech Repair tool and used it to force re-patch, then reinstall, then both, twice. \r\n\r\nI've been having my desire to play league unsatisfied and its rather annoying. I've even deleted specific folders in the RADS projects folder. Every time the update gets to 33%-99%. (Any number in between, often its around 70%-78%, but occasionally goes to 99% before showing the error) I don't know really anything about the logs i'm supposed to check for information. \r\n\r\nWhen i look at the Patcher logs it says \"|   OKAY| \" beside a bunch of things which i assume means its working fine. but then it gets near the bottom and says \"|  ERROR|\" beside a bunch near the bottom, Ill paste all the \"|  ERROR|\" messages in here in case it could help. \r\n\r\n006170.059|  ERROR| Riot::RADS::FileSystem::CRT::fopen_s: Input/output error\r\n\r\n006170.059|  ERROR|

I dont think i mentioned when this problem started though, the computer was updating to the latest patch but the visuals messed up and it was mostly a black small rectangle so i Alt+F4'd cause i was going to play a different game with a friend anyway and he said to just Alt+F4 it and come back to it later.
