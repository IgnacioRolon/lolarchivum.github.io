Even if you return, it's a negative experience for players to be down a player during the period you're not present.  The system treats all leaves equally regardless of intent because of the negative experiences they cause.  \n\nIf you are having any issues please let me know in detail and I'll be happy to help!  Continuing to have interruptions will escalate your lower priority queue, so it's important that we get whatever's disconnecting you sorted out.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"evoimede","date":"2016-07-24T14:38:14.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i know,but i got bann coz something not my personal mistake,its ia,punishing me for its mistake,network,proof is i try to reconect,so its something like a code u know,mow i dealing my banns playin against bots,not funny at all","replies":[]},{"poster":"EUW Banter","date":"2016-07-24T04:38:52.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not OP but I could really use some help on my position here. My account was permanently suspended for third party programs. I used custom skins and from what I have heard, the only legitimate program that can get you suspended was MKJogo. I have used it before, but not after the warnings that were sent out beforehand. Anyways, to go into more detail, I have made 3 forum posts over the past few months with lots of comments, views and upvotes without a Riot response. I feel like my ban was really unwarranted and it really hit me with depression knowing that I have basically loss all my progress and money I had put into that account. So I am here on the forums because this is really the best way to communicate with riot and I have seen many receive help here from similar situations like mine. Could you help a fellow gamer out here? Thank you in advance <3","replies":[]}]}]}
