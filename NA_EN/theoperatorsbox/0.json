I would like to be able to spectate scrimmage matches of my teams and put it onto a projector, but the 3 min delay seems way too awkward to have, and isn't the most accurate in terms of feedback. Is there any sort of way we can run a sort of LAN network, similar to the LCS (might be wrong on this, sorry if I am) to shorten this spectate delay, or is there a service we could use? \r\n\r\nBroken Blade told me to post it on the boards, sorry if this isn't the right place.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T23:44:28.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, I wanted to mention that I **am not** part of the eSports team, so the following is purely my thoughts on the subject.\n\nRunning it similarly to the LCS will be pretty tough since the tournament client isn't something that's publicly available. The best format I could think of would be to have the players in a separate room from the audience and livestream with the delay. Just throw some content in there to hold the audience over until the stream catches up. Maybe you could do a raffle or a trivia game, or maybe you could take a vote from the audience on who they think will win the matchup.\n\nI hope this helps! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheOperatorsBox","date":"2017-01-25T04:12:22.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is an idea, will bring it up with the rest. If you come across a member of the eSports team, please get back to me on what they have to say. For now, I think we need to reconsider our streaming setup.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOperatorsBox","date":"2017-01-22T21:42:45.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very much would like assistance.","replies":[]}]}
