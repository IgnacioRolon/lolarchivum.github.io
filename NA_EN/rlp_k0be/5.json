How do you guys feel about the idea of postponing the skin so it can be made into a legendary? Or other suggestions such as the /toggle mask? \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-27T21:44:39.724+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiya! ^-^ \n\nFor some context - while in development, we always start with blue sky ideas - literally anything goes - and then prune the ideas into what we need, and what odds and ends we can add to a skin to really make it feel cohesive in terms of the thematic, i.e., should it be legendary, should it be 975? \n\nNow, picture that, but we're also doing this with ~10 skins at a time, and needing to allocate resources (animators, audio engineers, etc.) appropriately!  We plan pretty far in advance, so we know what's coming down the pipeline, so we can inform other teams (like publishing, or merch!)\n\nWe're always open to suggestions and feedback, but there are limitations. \n\nTaking a lower tier skin and turning it into a legendary isn't an overnight process. It involves several disciplines, and several weeks worth of work, which weren't originally planned for. We'd be looking at several weeks for animation alone, in order to provide what legendary tiers should offer. Legendary skins also have new VO - this also means hiring said voice actress (and really, hoping they aren't booked!), recording, cutting and editing, implementing, etc. \n\n**TL;DR**: It isn't in realm of scope for what was planned out. *I hate being the bearer of bad news, really.*\n\nThat said, there are things that *can* be within scope for a skin like this - particle changes, small model changes, texture updates, a new sound added. We do hear out feedback, and ultimately, the team working on the skin makes the call on what suggestions they feel enhance the skin as a whole. I know that the color change for Diana's outfit was something that was heard for feedback, and had a pretty quick turnaround on the PBE! \n\nAh, and then there's the toggle! Yes, we have done toggles in the past (Neon Strike Vi and Night Hunter Rengar, and somewhat with DJ Sona, but that's hooked up a bit differently). We may veer away from toggles because they aren't always the right choice for a skin, and we could do more noticeable (read: cooler) things with other aspects, whether it's animation, particles, etc. \n\nIt was decided while in concept that Blood Moon Diana wasn't going to have a toggle, but that we would show the mask removal in the recall animation, which is why, in the splash, you can see her taking the mask off. That's where the two make a connection. \n\nNew animations aren't something that are added once a skin hits PBE, especially when it was planned that it wouldn't be included in a skin. Why not? Animations can take a week or more (plus testing!), and in the case of a toggle, hooking up tech that a regular skin wouldn't have.\n\nSo, about postponing? As I'd mentioned before, we plan ahead so other teams - a big one is publishing - can come up with a release plan. Now, that can be anything from a simple announcement page, to a micro site and video, and even more. Removing a key piece of the publishing pieces could be a nightmare for publishing, who, at this point, has most of their project complete and ready to roll. \n\nA good example here would be if we took last years Star Guardian patch and removed Lulu. This would deeply affect the promo pieces, especially the video and the survey that determined which Star Guardian you were. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I totally see where you guys are coming from - Blood Moon Diana is a killer skin, and there's a lot of hype around her! It's awesome to see so much passion for a skin, honestly. Sure, I wish we could make every skin a legendary 'cause let's face it, legendary skins are an awesome opportunity to push an alternate fantasy.  But, this time around, it isn't in the cards for Diana. That said, it means she still has the opportunity for a legendary skin in the future!  *Suggestions always welcome!*\n\nI hope this doesn't come off as a 'hey, here's a bunch of excuses'. but rather a bit of insight into the skins process and planning. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-01-30T18:37:16.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=2gpTwumq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-27T21:44:39.724+0000)\n>\n> But, this time around, it isn&#x27;t in the cards for Diana.

I just wanted to say without sounding like a dick that it does feel like a bit of a cop out to hear that it's not in the cards to make this a legendary skin when the story about how Dark Star Thresh came into being was that they were given half the time off the bat to make it with and that turned out amazing. I don't mean about getting it changed to a legendary, I think it's ridiculous that it wasn't in the first place. And it feels like they only would have had more time to at least spitball ideas since this is something everyone has wanted for a long time. Also to the same point, it feels super bad tbh. I mean, I think the skin is amazing, but the fact that it isn't a legendary is kinda silly when everyone knows the fans have wanted this skin for a ling time, myself included. 3-4 years at this point? :P The only reason I didn't complain about the fact that it didn't come out and stuff like blood moon Zilean did was because I 100% believed that it was gonna be a legendary because why wouldn't they? It's so obvious that it's what everyone wants that it's driving me crazy xD Rant over, I know it's like not your fault either so my bad for going ham at you there, just feel like I needed to vent :P My real question though!

I don't think it's fair to compare one skin to another because we plan each skin differently, and don't use a cookie cutter format. \n\nI agree that Blood Moon Diana was a huge player win because it was something that was highly suggested, and in a lot of ways a no-brainer for Diana. However, I personally don't think a skin should be legendary because it's a popular idea. I can see some of the suggestions working for Diana as a legendary skin, but for me, the part that would make it hard for her to be a legendary skin is her VO and potentially some of her animations, since they're pretty quick and not something that would be highly noticeable if we changed them. I speak from experience here with animations, as many players felt that Star Guardian Jinx's animations (run, AA, etc.) were the same as the base, and I worry it's something Diana would also fall into. As for VO, I'm not sure there is enough to pull for a full roster of VO lines for the Blood Moon thematic. *Yes, I'm sure VO could be written, but would it be impactful enough?*\n\nI'd personally rather see a legendary for her in a skin line - potentially the first of it - where she can really break out of her normality and be completely flipped on her head into something totally different.

I mean Blood Moon Diana has an intricate mask, brighter colors, a more revealing outfit, and tattoos but the Developers in charge of the Winter Wonder skin couldn't be bothered to match the splash art with the in-game model. This is what I do not understand when it comes to any content, work, or conversation about or on Karma . . . . it is always ignored, half-worked on, lazily worked on, or there is an excuse. The time of excuses, zero communication about Karma, and band-aid work done on her needs to stop. The Developers at Riot Games are coming off as not caring and ignoring Karma and her many dedicated fans. For a Development team to give her the type of rework she received in 2013 that removed all of her identity, unique appearance, interesting kit, gameplay, and much more . . . . and continue that lazy work by continuing to remove even more from her . . . . is showing the entire Karma community that Riot prefers for her to be this bland, unoriginal champion that sits in the back and builds shield enhancing items to be relevant in the game. When Karma receives a skin worth 1350 and the skin team and art team cannot be bothered to give exactly what they are supposed to on paper, but do it for another champion entirely . . . . really makes us question you even more.\n\nKarma and her fanbase seem to be a disease at this point. The stone work in the middle of Summoners Rift has received more work done on it and communication about it than Karma ever has int he past four years.\n\nPlease show this to your fellow Development team members and really look at all of the work and comments Riot themselves have made about this champion around the time of her rework . . . . and the VERY limited work that continued to ruin her even more afterward. I do not think any Department at Riot Games even realizes or cares at this point of how much they took away and continue to take away from this champion. If the skin Department cannot be bothered to rectify mistakes and give Winter Wonder Karma the intricate diamond design on her tights, the tattoos on her shoulders, gloveless, and shield animations that are bland compared to any other champion in the skin line with a shield, then what is the point in having this champion in the game at all anymore? When it comes to ANYTHING involving this champion no Department at Riot Games cares.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/UjzIverq-meddler-reav3-the-karma-injustice-of-2013-and-continued-injustice-of-2017","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lithillya","date":"2017-01-31T07:56:07.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=2gpTwumq,comment-id=000000030000,timestamp=2017-01-30T17:56:38.405+0000)\n>\n> Not a dumb question at all! \n> \n> It&#x27;s pretty rare that we would update an existing skin once released, unless in the case of champion updates, as you&#x27;ve said, or if there&#x27;s a gameplay concern (which is usually due to visual effects being difficult to read).\n\nMakes sense.

Going somewhat offtopic, is there a chance that you're considering making a Blood Moon skin for Zyra? Remember seeing a suggestion thread for a skin like that a while back, and it was part of what even made me pick up the champion, since it was so very well made. \n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/8c6ab9c406428c1fe9ff31d454b671ae/tumblr_o3qufgMNoV1qk32lpo6_r1_1280.png\n\nT'was the art that went with the thread, and while I know champions with 'pets' takes far more effort to make skins for, it'd be awesome for her to get one. Especially when it's one that'd seem as fitting as this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2017-01-30T22:28:38.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is more of a general comment on some skin lines more than Diana specifically, but I get turned off from buying a skin sometimes if too many champs in that line get hard to distinguish from one another. Examples would be the marauder skins, skins with bloodmoon masks, and maybe even the two dark star skins. Ideally there would be a little more to differentiate them from each other imo. That's why I personally thought the mask toggle would be nice because the in game view I don't even recognize who some of these champs are sometimes. I couldn't even tell who everybody was in the teaser for the bloodmoon skins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RlP K0BE","date":"2017-01-27T22:26:27.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=2gpTwumq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-27T21:44:39.724+0000)\n>\n> Hiya! ^-^ \n> \n> For some context - while in development, we always start with blue sky ideas - literally anything goes - and then prune the ideas into what we need, and what odds and ends we can add to a skin to really make it feel cohesive in terms of the thematic, i.e., should it be legendary, should it be 975? \n> \n> Now, picture that, but we&#x27;re also doing this with ~10 skins at a time, and needing to allocate resources (animators, audio engineers, etc.) appropriately!  We plan pretty far in advance, so we know what&#x27;s coming down the pipeline, so we can inform other teams (like publishing, or merch!)\n> \n> We&#x27;re always open to suggestions and feedback, but there are limitations. \n> \n> Taking a lower tier skin and turning it into a legendary isn&#x27;t an overnight process. It involves several disciplines, and several weeks worth of work, which weren&#x27;t originally planned for. We&#x27;d be looking at several weeks for animation alone, in order to provide what legendary tiers should offer. Legendary skins also have new VO - this also means hiring said voice actress (and really, hoping they aren&#x27;t booked!), recording, cutting and editing, implementing, etc. \n> \n> **TL;DR**: It isn&#x27;t in realm of scope for what was planned out. *I hate being the bearer of bad news, really.*\n> \n> That said, there are things that *can* be within scope for a skin like this - particle changes, small model changes, texture updates, a new sound added. We do hear out feedback, and ultimately, the team working on the skin makes the call on what suggestions they feel enhance the skin as a whole. I know that the color change for Diana&#x27;s outfit was something that was heard for feedback, and had a pretty quick turnaround on the PBE! \n> \n> Ah, and then there&#x27;s the toggle! Yes, we have done toggles in the past (Neon Strike Vi and Night Hunter Rengar, and somewhat with DJ Sona, but that&#x27;s hooked up a bit differently). We may veer away from toggles because they aren&#x27;t always the right choice for a skin, and we could do more noticeable (read: cooler) things with other aspects, whether it&#x27;s animation, particles, etc. \n> \n> It was decided while in concept that Blood Moon Diana wasn&#x27;t going to have a toggle, but that we would show the mask removal in the recall animation, which is why, in the splash, you can see her taking the mask off. That&#x27;s where the two make a connection. \n> \n> New animations aren&#x27;t something that are added once a skin hits PBE, especially when it was planned that it wouldn&#x27;t be included in a skin. Why not? Animations can take a week or more (plus testing!), and in the case of a toggle, hooking up tech that a regular skin wouldn&#x27;t have.\n> \n> So, about postponing? As I&#x27;d mentioned before, we plan ahead so other teams - a big one is publishing - can come up with a release plan. Now, that can be anything from a simple announcement page, to a micro site and video, and even more. Removing a key piece of the publishing pieces could be a nightmare for publishing, who, at this point, has most of their project complete and ready to roll. \n> \n> A good example here would be if we took last years Star Guardian patch and removed Lulu. This would deeply affect the promo pieces, especially the video and the survey that determined which Star Guardian you were. \n> \n> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I totally see where you guys are coming from - Blood Moon Diana is a killer skin, and there&#x27;s a lot of hype around her! It&#x27;s awesome to see so much passion for a skin, honestly. Sure, I wish we could make every skin a legendary &#x27;cause let&#x27;s face it, legendary skins are an awesome opportunity to push an alternate fantasy.  But, this time around, it isn&#x27;t in the cards for Diana. That said, it means she still has the opportunity for a legendary skin in the future!  *Suggestions always welcome!*\n> \n> I hope this doesn&#x27;t come off as a &#x27;hey, here&#x27;s a bunch of excuses&#x27;. but rather a bit of insight into the skins process and planning. :)\n\nAh ok thank you very much. I had a feeling that turning it into a legendary skin would have a slim possibility. Too bad about the /toggle though, oh well the splash art is amazing and I am looking forward to this skins release to add it to my collection.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-01-27T22:14:46.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think after the land round of changes it's pretty solid gj :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-02-02T11:21:06.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You did ask what price bracket the community wanted the skin to be in before taking the planning too far to revert, right?\n\nBlood Moon Talon, Jhin and whatever else is in there are just skins.
