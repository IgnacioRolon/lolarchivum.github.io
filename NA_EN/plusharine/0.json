Are there any repercussions?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DISCLAIMER: DO NOT REPLY ABOUT NAMING AND SHAMING. THAT IS NOT THE POINT OF THIS THREAD. DO NOT reply about \"Just report the person with a support ticket\" I have already replied many times on this particular subject. I am not trying to out ONE person. I am talking the GROUP of people who do this particular thing and how there is NO way of punishing that GROUP.\n\nPlease only serious replies. I have had this happen a few times and only remembered to take pictures in the most recent case. Many people will get into champion select and say &quot;F*ck this. I&#039;m not playing -insert role here-&quot; because they were autofilled. Then the entire champion selection duration, they will fight for whatever role they had set as preferred. Autolock. Proceed to be stubborn about it and then say the famous line &quot;I don&#039;t care if you guys report me, this is my alt account&quot;. Is there any type of punishment for these players other than the 5 minute wait time they have, when they eventually dodge at the last second? (I am also aware of the longer wait times 15 min, 30 min etc. However if one is stubborn enough they can just do something else for that time, or they can just go onto an alternative account. It&#039;s not really crippling in any way.) When it&#039;s ranked they lose 3 lp but that amount is tiny in lower elo (where I am) From what I&#039;ve seen that would only hurt them in diamond and up (where I hear this happens very rarely). When it&#039;s normals they don&#039;t lose anything and just waste everyone else&#039;s time.\n\nCasual discussion of this is fine as well. I don&#039;t really believe an option will turn up just because I said something. I&#039;m sure many people have asked this same question or something similar. Thanks for reading.\n\nHere are some screenshots for reference (most of the time it&#039;s more or less the same just different wording): Edit: It was brought to my attention that I should have edited the names out. It was not my intention to Name and Shame (as everyone is accusing me of) and that is why I reposted it again with my shoddy attempt at editing out the names. Stop nagging me about it. It's harassment.\n\nTHIS IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE. This particular person isn't the ONLY one who does this. This is to show people, generally, what I'm talking about. If all I wanted was to report this one person I wouldn't bother posting about it.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Y8quUjO.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ueKrRzZ.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Un4gnKY.png","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-02T01:02:37.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Open a support ticket, alt/smurf accounts can be linked directly to a main account.

You edited out the names, that's exactly what you're supposed to do.  The issue is that a lot of players come here and post names when talking about players having bad behavior, even if they're not attempting to Name & Shame.  Ultimately, intent doesn't matter, content does.  Keep the names out, like in the screenshots above, and your posts get to stay.\n\nAs for the original question, no, there is currently no punishment for dodging other than the wait time.  If you want to report them, you can take screenshots like these and submit a ticket to Player Support, but you will most likely get an automated reply.  That doesn't mean they won't do anything, it just means they don't discuss punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Plusharine","date":"2017-02-02T04:29:36.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the original was deleted already haha~ I had to edit it after I saw that it was gone, because it didn't occur to me that unedited screenshots were an issue.

There is no way to punish people for prelobby. \n\nI am a huge troll in champ select.  I love it.  I claim to feed, lock nonsense champs etc.\n\n99% of the time someone dodges other than me and then I repeat. \n\nI have a huge .txt document of people calling me a troll, screaming, etc.   I copy paste this into the lobby (usually causing an instant dodge). \n\nI ONLY queue support, this allows me to get into a lobby with 0 wait time and 0 downtime between lobbies (using riots system against itself again). \n\nThe math is where it gets fun.  I can usually ruin a lobby in about 1-2mins, then 0-30seconds for requeue.  My best is causing 5 dodges in 8mins. \n\nI did this hundreds of times until i got bored. \n\nNow I use it as a tool. If i think the game looks unwinnable, or I dont like my team I just force a dodge by trolling. \n\nIf it was really an alt account (like mine) they wont dodge, because they dont care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-02T03:04:26.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the community doesn't see this as a report worthy behavior to take roughly 3 mins to open a ticket to say XYZ is dodging games/harassing others in pregame lobby, then the system will never begin to account for it.\n\nAgain, it is people are already being punished for dodging at increasing rates, Im sure riot can show patterns of log on dodge log off 1 day\nlog in dodge logg off\nday\nlog in dodge logg off\n\nIt will matter, just trust riot to continue to make their system better and better.","replies":[{"poster":"Plusharine","date":"2017-02-02T04:18:38.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically.
