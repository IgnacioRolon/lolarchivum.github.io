Technical magic of sorts or someone forgot to switch something on or off. Seems like the problem was out of my hands afterall. See you in the rift!\n\nProblems are; \n\n**1.** Login is luck based, usually takes 10 minutes. (_It gets stuck on logging in_) or ( _Can't connect and then closes the client_)\n\n**2.** When inside the client, no chat connect, that takes another five minutes of spam clicking. (_The red text at the bottom of the screen_)\n\n**3.** If it works up to this point; Pick a game mode, champ selection, pick champion, start game, Do not see the screen with all the champions because I get a black screen instead, Windows loading coursor appears then turns into the regular windows cursour then I press esc, loops me back to the client where it says that I should reconnect to the game, reconnects, says connection problem, reconnects again, 50/50 chance of crash,  **REPEAT**\n\nAfter ~30 minutes I can get into a game or two and it starts again. However today I've tried for an hour and without results. **Gave up**.\n\nMy router is in DMZ; Other games works like charms. \n\nOther games are these sorts; \n\nPvP/Moba games (_dota 2, BF4 and so on_)\nMmos (_Black desert and so on_)\nCoop (_Killing floor 2 and so on_)\n\nUse; Steam, Ubisoft, Origin, battle.net\n\nBefore I used DMZ I did: Bridged my router, No firewall, google dns server, restarted computer, restarted router, reinstalled League of Legends.\n\n(_Everytime I made adjustments I restarted my computer so the new settings are 100% operational_)\n\nStarted 3 days ago, otherwise League of Legends have been loyal for years, never had this problem before. No new connection, router is fine, system is fine. Updated and stable.\n\n\n**UPDATE 1**\n\nSeems like my ISP Telia might be part of the problem since the new patch was rolled out. Whatever problems it might be I have a feeling its out of my \"league\".\n\nhttp://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/uOs5EIZ2-euw-telia-sweden-connectivity-issues\n\nI have Telia and play on euw. Maybe there are other isps that cause the same problems? Maybe in other countries aswell?\nMight be good clues to what seems to be the problem. \n\nThank you Dartagnan for your eyes and wisdom eventhough the problems persist after I've done those connection guides (which are very well made). I will follow this problem until its fixed, much like a support follows an adc.\n\nI will update whenever something new comes up.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T21:53:26.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm...really appreciate the amount of detail regarding your issue!  It definitely helps.  As I was reviewing the different issues you are having, every single one points to some sort of weird connection issue:\n\n1.  Logging in -- Your computer needs to connect to our Login Servers/PvP.net Servers.  If something blocks it, then you get the errors you described.\n2.  Chat -- Once connected to PvP.net, you also need to connect to our Chat Servers.  If it can't establish a connection, it will endlessly retry or error out\n3.  Champ Select -- You need to be able to connect to a service called Maestro, which allows you to see what the other 9 players are doing.  If you can't connect to this service, you are met with a black screen\n4.  Loading Screen -- After Champ Select, you need to connect to the Individual Game Server.  If you can't establish a connection to it, then the Loading Screen will either never appear or you might get an error.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't specifically pinpoint what the root cause might be.
