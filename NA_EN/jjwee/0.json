After updating my client, I entered queue for ranked and when the client started trying to load into the game it crashed. I then had to run the repair tool and by the time it finished, I assume the game finished as well. I was put on LeaverBuster's 20 minute lower priority queue for 5 games even though I sent the report showing that the client bugged. I tried reaching out to Riot support last time the update caused my client to crash but NO ONE contacted me back which just shows that Riot does not care about the players that play the game. Why am I being punished for something out of my control? You can obviously tell by my history that I am not a player that goes AFK or leaves the game ever. This is ridiculous. I am on the verge of uninstalling this game and switching to something that will help its player base.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-13T16:36:35.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnecting from a match will negatively impact everyone in the match, even if it wasn't an intentional disconnection. This is one of the reasons why [the Leaverbuster System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats all disconnections equally, and penalties cannot be modified in any way. Furthermore, the system doesn't penalize an account on this first instance of disconnection, and it takes multiple instances of disconnection before reaching the 20min LPQ's.\n\nI looked into your ticket and you've received a reply from an agent, so I recommend continuing to work with them in order to get this resolved. I'd like to mention that our support team handles a lot of tickets, so it's important to be patient while someone gets back to you.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-07-13T02:36:09.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uninstall and re-install client","replies":[]}]}
