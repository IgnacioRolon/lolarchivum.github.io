I have a pretty old laptop, and the problem is that I always get quite a lot of lag during teamfights, and it has cost me quite a lot when I play mid or adc. I have good internet, so im not sure what part of the laptop is causing the lag. 8000MB of Ram and NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M, and windows 10. I kinda want to play lol lag free. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-26T23:27:17.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you define \"lag\" a bit more? Unfortunately, the term is often used to describe many issues, so breaking down the issue into specific details will help me understand exactly what's happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp1Rltz","date":"2017-02-26T23:50:34.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The motion of my champion and everyone else's get slower, the screen doesn't react the way you see in youtube streams (The opposite way). Some of the scenes are cut, and I can't land my skill shot's because the screen isn't \"flowing\" but kinda cuts out some parts. I'm not sure what gamers or youtubers use for their computer.","replies":[{"poster":"Supz","date":"2017-02-27T00:25:08.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sp1Rltz","date":"2017-02-27T03:02:51.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got like 20 ping and my fps was over a 100 but sometimes it falls to like 20.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-27T21:24:37.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you notice your FPS dropping or ping changing when the symptoms happen? Also, do you see your champion running in place at all? Any motions stopping, then catching up? I'm curious what you mean by \"some of the scenes are cut\". Can you describe that a bit more?","replies":[{"poster":"Sp1Rltz","date":"2017-03-04T02:03:29.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My ping stays at 20 (which people say is really good) and i do see my champion running. But It's not smooth, and kinda like a groggy feeling. When i use my abilities the animations aren't smooth . I don't have this motion stopping and then catching up, it's just that it's laggy and it's kinda why  i tend to avoid teamfights because I just can't control my champ and the abilities well with the lag. My FPS at the beginning of the game is like 100 which is fine, and i like to 1 v 1 because i get no lag, but then it's the teamfight that causes the problems. ( I also do get the same lag sometimes even when I'm not in teamfights. no idea why)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-05T22:10:49.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're seeing a change in your FPS during these symptoms, I recommend working through our [**Framerate Troubleshooting Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to address the most common solutions for this.\n\nPlease let me know if this caused any noticeable changes to your symptoms.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FlyingRoboticCow","date":"2017-02-27T04:48:34.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had similar issues make sure your in game settings are at the bare minimum and switch to an wired connection if possible those two together fixed all my problems hopefully they'll help you","replies":[]}]}
