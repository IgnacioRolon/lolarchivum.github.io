This implies that something from the original work will be incorporated into the new design. \n\n\"This is VGU\" Yes. Visual. Gameplay. Update.

Ok. \n\nNow ask yourselves, what is this rework founded on?\n\nUs Galio mains expected changes, big chances. We're not new to league; we've been through Sion/Poppy/Warwick updates. However, you must understand our frustration when we look at this update and struggle to find some semblance of what we loved. \n\nOf course I'm still holding out to see everything in-game, and of course I'm still gonna play him and probably enjoy the new Galio. But it won't feel like a VGU. It most likely will be like playing a whole other champion. None of the elements I liked about the old guy is apparent at the moment.\n\nEdit: Gatekeeper doing Galio's old dance did make me smile tho.
