I was not around when you did it, but I heard it use to be a thing and to make this game good again this is the only way.\r\n\r\n{{champion:30}}  An Ai can not see these issues, nor will they be able to properly see whose wrong and whose right in flame wars.\r\n\r\n{{champion:56}}  You can&#039;t just slap a Ai program in and think its ok, no your killing us.\r\n\r\n{{champion:60}}  I&#039;m so disappointed from my last game, because I know that person won&#039;t be punished... I know you guys won&#039;t read this and I know nothing will ever be done...\r\n\r\n{{champion:57}}  So whatever, enjoy ruining a game I once enjoyed...","replies":[{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-11-03T12:39:03.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pl3dQfSB4ok/UwAKhzT8bMI/AAAAAAAAXAs/_0UJO2eRSFY/s1600/calcy.png","replies":[{"poster":"AtrusGray","date":"2016-11-03T17:56:32.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-03T13:06:02.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The old system was slower to punish people and less successful in detecting false positives. Everyone just clicked punish as soon as they could without reading it.\n\nIt is difficult for an automated system to decipher between a real player that just sucks and a bot a lot of the time, so they are usually caught when the account is sold and then, because a new player is on it, their behavior changes.\n\nThe old system was worse or equal at detecting this though.","replies":[{"poster":"AtrusGray","date":"2016-11-07T07:10:25.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well this one is not helping either, can't they just hire people to do the reports?\n\nIdk like Blizzard and every other big game? xD","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-11-07T18:35:56.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idk if they still do it, but I remember my friend complaining because WoW banned people based purely off of quantity of reports.
