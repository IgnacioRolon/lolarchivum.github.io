Nidalee Spears leads to an unfun element of gameplay and needs to be seriously looked at.  I am fine with moving her more to an assassin roll with cougar form, what I am not fine with is dodging twelve spears only to get hit by one after two minutes and now I&#039;m just out of the game, or worse if she flashes on me dead.  This feeling sucks so much.  Why should I be punished so incredibly hard for getting randomly hit by this skillshot?  It&#039;s 3/4 of an adc health pool from one spear.  Not to mention you have to commit so hard to catch her out of position.  Her entire kit screams deal with this champion, oh wait you can&#039;t.  Movespeed, dashes, long range nukes.  This just creates a very imbalanced and unfun game environment.  I can&#039;t count the number of games I have lost because nid managed to hit a single spear on someone and took them out of a fight to make it 4v5, when they were pushing for the win.  You just can&#039;t do anything about it.\r\n\r\nThe mana cost is low enough you can just spam it, and cougar costs nothing so there is no fear of being oom and useless in a fight.  Her only counterplay is dodge spears.  That&#039;s not really good enough if she lands one and done on you.  I just feel there is too much damage to such a long range ability.  Nothing like pushing for the win and going welp, now I have 10% hp from ONE nidalee spear, guess I should just leave.\r\n\r\nAnd before we get anyone in here flaming me...\r\nTanks still take lots of damage from her.\r\nBuilding MR on an ADC isn&#039;t good itemization and you basically ruin your item build.\r\nBanshee&#039;s only stops one spear and can be popped by anyone on her team.\r\nIt doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s a skillshot that moves slowly or not, it&#039;s all reward and no risk since you can just constantly toss them out.\r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\nNidalee spears create a poor game environment and over rewards nidalee for hitting one, making her too safe as an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-09-13T00:02:39.600+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you kidding me....? i wish people would stop crying for nidalee nerfs.

Just because an ability is hard to land doesn't mean that it needs to be.  My problem isn't with the nerfing her, I have a serious issue with the ability itself.  It is UNFUN.  It's not fun to be a 9/1/12 ADC pushing turrets and dodging 12 spears, suddenly one finally connects (because the idea of a skillshot it to actually hit targets) and you are COMPLETELY out of the fight.  And you had no way to stop her from spamming them.  THAT'S the issue, there is a huge line between abilities that are well balanced and fun.\n\nReduce the damage and make the spears easier to hit and things would work out, maybe even the mana cost.  My issue is that she can take a carry out of the fight from one spear, how is that fun?

I mean drastically, they do 60% damage from what they used to. thats a 40% reduction, plus the hit box nerfs which can sail a spear between two minions connected at the hip, PLUS the casting time nerf. Her spears rarely just take someone out unless she's fed, stacked AP, and against someone with absolutely no MR. She's been nerfed and she's in a very weird spot now. I mean damn. Her entire kit used to be her spears, now theyre about 30% of her kit, and IF she lands just one, she's completely vulnerable by having to jump in melee range to complete a kill.\n\n\nEdit: not to mention, nidalee is crazy mana-hungry now. she can farm no mana in cougar form, but when you're in combat she uses quite a bit. Nidalee has to get the ranger's enchantment, plus grail, ROA, or seraphs. Preferably one of the two latters because she's so mana hungry. she's been nerfed enough.

You can't siege against her and as an adc she literally fucks your positioning so you can't stay within range to fight.  I don't give a rats ass how she performs at the highest levels of play, because that's the highest levels of play.  80% of the League community is not at that level, and ALL opinions matter for the game.

The last change to her spear took the minimal damage from 50/75/100/125/150 to 50/70/90/110/130, max range being 150/225/300/375/450 > 150/210/270/330/390.

Her spears do 60%.\nSixty.\nPercent.\nof the damage the used to when she used to stay backline and just chuck spears at you. Now not only are her spears harder to hit, they do _way less damage now_ a squishy who has no MR can get maybe 1/4 health chunked off late game. That's about it. As i stated previously, if you stick around long enough to dodge 12, then get hit by one with 1/4 health, thats _your. fault._ yours. \n\nApparently you can't understand why I keep talking about nerfs, because her spears used to be terrifying, and you could never catch her. They literally are not there for damage anymore, they're there for initiation because THEY DON'T DO HARDLY ANY DAMAGE. That's not what they're there for anymore. I'm bringing her nerfs up because you're complaining about a champ with a drastically lowered win rate because of how much they've nerfed her over the last year and some change. \n\nNot to mention, her win rate drops even _lower_ the longer the game goes on because nidalee _can't team fight_ she can sit back and kinda throw some spears where majority miss or hit the front line (unless you're one of those squishies who stays completely out of position then wants to bitch at everything that kills them) She can catch you out, and she can split push. but her relevance in teamfights is so weak because 9/10 she can't land spears to get the proc on her combo due to 1) nerfs 2) minions 3) people _easily_ dodging them now 4) them just hitting front line tanks to where no visible damage even comes off. \n\nIt _very easy_ to seige nidalee because her only form of wave clear is her cougar form which makes her extremely vulnerable, ESPECIALLY against cc. If she can't wave clear she can't chuck her spears, this is why she makes a better jungle than a laner now. And considering all the changes, there's a lot better junglers than her now. She's _extremely_ mana hungry because half of her kit absolutely has to be performed in human form, and her mana costs are not cheap. Take it from someone getting level 5 nid by jungling, I've been playing her since she was a spear-chucking pain in the ass.\n\nFrom where I'm standing you're just complaining over literally not knowing how to play against one, and doing badly when you do. This isn't a nidalee problem, this is a you problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stellafreyja","date":"2015-09-15T03:20:15.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you seriously asking for Nidalee nerfs when her spears were just nerfed and she's currently sitting at around a 45% win rate?","replies":[{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2015-09-16T18:46:16.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ace of Eden,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6i6EFUzP,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-09-15T03:20:15.310+0000)\n>\n> Are you seriously asking for Nidalee nerfs when her spears were just nerfed and she's currently sitting at around a 45% win rate?\n\nIt's a 48% win ratio, not asking for nerfs, win rate does NOT change the fact that her kit is shitty and not fun from a game standpoint, and she was at 54% before 5.15, and is only falling out because of the resurgence of juggernauts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-09-16T19:50:09.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Why is it fair that Nid can miss ten spears and then hit one and she kills me?\" is such a horrible question. It's fair because spending two minutes trying to get a kill but failing repeatedly is something that justifies a high reward for when you eventually succeed. In the time Nidalee throws ten spears any number of mages/assassins will have killed you seeeeeeeeeeeveral times.\n\nYou don't want it to be more reliable but weaker if you have any sense at all. It'd be a huge buff to her. You'll get hit by multiple spears in the same time that she would have hit 0-1 in the past, and you'll have to go back because multiple weak-ish spears will do just as much damage as one strong one anyway. Nidalee is much easier to beat, is riskier and has greater skill requirements when her spear is the single most difficult skillshot in the game to hit.
