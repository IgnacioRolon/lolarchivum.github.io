When it finally starts letting me connect it takes forever to go to 100% I spent about 5 min once just waiting to go from 0 to 1%. Its not my ping I have a solid 63 ping every game but I don't know why its happening and I keep losing lp in ranked and getting leaver busters because of it. Anyone know how to fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Rimas56","date":"2017-11-15T15:54:38.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"league of legends crashing and frezzing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-11T17:57:22.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if your internet works fine using other services, you can still have issues reaching specific servers like the game server.
