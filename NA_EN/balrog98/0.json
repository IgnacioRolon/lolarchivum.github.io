You don't even need to load the entire folder into the RAM disk. Besides, my OS is using 1.6 GB of RAM.

It is completely dependent on how much you want to load into the RAM disk.

Because a powerful gaming pc is an  unnecessary, expensive thing. You don't really Need to have one, but having one is a luxury, not a necessity. And some people can't afford to drop 700 to 1500 dollars on even a budget gaming computer.\n\nBut let me ask you what constitutes \n, in your mind, something unnecessary and expensive?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-03-24T16:54:57.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwKsjzyur1jARz2/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-03-24T04:50:03.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure, just pay for it.\nmy pc is doing fine but hey if you pay for a few more upgrades why not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teémò","date":"2018-03-24T02:38:14.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your complaining about a bad connection then.
