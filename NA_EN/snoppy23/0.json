I wish this to be resolved ASAP\r\n\r\nThank You.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-20T21:31:06.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that sounds a bit strange that your email may have changed and you not know about it. Sounds like there might be a chance that someone hacked your account, in which case you should reach out to our account team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) asap. When you do, make sure to pick \"I need help recovering my account\" and you'll be able to submit that ticket without logging in.","replies":[]}]}
