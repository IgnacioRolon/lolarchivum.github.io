Now however every time a fight occurs the ping goes all the way up to over 2000. Hate to say it but it makes it super unplayable. I am looking help with this issue, and would appreciate some insight into this!

If you only ever see spikes when fights break out it's likely your connection is taking a dip due to everything that's happening, and you probably just need to update a few settings to get a more stable connection. I'd first try an ethernet connection if possible, and if not update your wireless settings using the steps in the [**connection FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a guide.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ramen Î¦","date":"2017-11-25T23:52:53.171+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes it's been happeneing all over the place since last patch RANDOMLY\ni hope riot gives this issue the attention it deserves cause all they do is link a troubleshooting guide","replies":[{"poster":"Pxrking","date":"2017-11-26T02:05:08.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am glad that I am not the only one. On the same internet I can play rocket league at 16 ping. Not really sure where the issue is.

For a few months now I've had to reconnect to most of my games, which wasn't that bad cuz I could still get back in around the 40 second mark, but just as you guys said, I haven't been able to reconnect constantly until the game's as good as over, massive ping spikes, lag and heavy packet loss. Glad it's not just me and hope this gets more visibility so rito can save us.

High ping spikes during fights, or constantly during game. I've also received a 5 game leavebuster for not being able to even connect to a game. punished as (leaver) for a remake. So now I get to sit in forums for 10 mins for 5 games straight after i've spent over $1000 on this game lol. I kinda feel like a got the shaft.\n\nEdit: also i've read through the leavebuster faq and riot is not responsible for my leavebuster haha.
