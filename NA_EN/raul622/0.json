The bug is pretty self-explanatory. I&#039;m not 100% certain, but I think he can&#039;t do any other one of his animations after he&#039;s been frozen.","replies":[{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2016-09-12T23:13:28.475+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's actually on purpose\nhe freezes after a few seconds of not moving\nit's part of his passive, . . .being a scarecrow and all\n\nthey have to make the wait longer though, no one can see any of his animations properly as is","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2016-09-12T23:39:27.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not a bug, its his passive where after a few moments of standing still, he literally freezes then gets a movement speed bonus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-13T16:19:10.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others have mentioned here, this is working as intended. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Disulfiram","date":"2016-09-13T16:31:25.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would it be possible to give the passive its own pose (maybe the classical scarecrow one, or would it be easily mistaken for him charging his ult?) and to give his animations a better interaction with his passive?\nMaybe even just make his emotes and dance count as movement, if him not freezing in place during his passive wouldn't be acceptable... we'd have to delay getting the passive if we want to use an emote, but at least we would once again be able to see them like we can for any other champion.","replies":[]}]}]}
