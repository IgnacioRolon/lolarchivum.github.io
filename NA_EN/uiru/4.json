Do you mean that his AP ratios are mostly pointless and make him weaker? \n\nAll of Shen's counterparts are Assassins though - he is the only true Tank. As far as Akali having higher defensive base stats, you don't see people building Tank Akali as a result. While I agree they should give Shen Scaling MR (because a lot of tanks deserve it), keep in mind that Akali's damage is not increased by building tanky - Shen's damage increases by building HP. Riot has to keep this aspect in mind when designing Tanks vs. Assassins. While Akali's defensive base stats scale, she typically won't build any or enough defensive items to make her unkillable defensively - her strength comes from spellvamp and resets from kills. Meanwhile, Shen builds straight tank to perform an entirely different function on his team and his damage increases as well. \n\nFrankly, comparing the two is not that great simply because they pan out differently throughout the game, perform different functions for their teams and build differently.","replies":[{"poster":"Yosuke Apperu","date":"2015-05-23T03:14:32.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you did build akali as a tank, she'd end up tankier which makes no sense... as for the bold..
