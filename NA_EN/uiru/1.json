Fuck strategy, Thresh is more fun to watch than Janna, so down she goes while Thresh remains untouched. The ult healing nerf is just the sort of \"fuck you\" dingleberry on the neverending shit sundae that I&#039;ve come to expect from Riot&#039;s balance team. \n\nCompensation buffs indeed. Max range is now 1741, down from 1760. Just like when the maximum knockup was increased along with a nerf to the instant cast duration, this is a straight nerf with a pie in the sky buff/compensation that will almost never actually matter. \n\n Good at everything. Oh my God. Somebody wrote that. Janna is now good at damage! Janna can now reasonably expect to win a fight without simply running away from it! Janna can now function without an ally nearby! If the \"good at everything\" champs are all in line for nerfs in 5.18 you can find me at the hat buffet. Right after that I&#039;ll be handing out flying pigs and selling all kinds of bridges!\n\nedit: I would additionally like to thank Riot for the absolutely scumbag move of sneaking this into patch notes with absolutely no warning or PBE time. All we had was the per second bonus increase, which, while sounding silly on paper (2255 range at full charge?) would NEVER BE RELEVANT ANYWAY.

However, if someone is doing inordinately well in the same or different role, that doesn't mean they should be able to skate by under the radar just because Skarner needs a nerf more than they do. \n\nIt's less a priority system, and more of an ever-evolving system.
