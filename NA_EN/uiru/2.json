If you dodge 90% of all spears thrown at you, that's still one spear every minute on average.

Sej is strong right now, but only really at one thing, which is engaging and engaging hard.

There is a third list (mostly supports) that are just punching bags. If they need to fill a nerf quota they just hit Janna or Sona again and call it a day.\n\n That Riot's \"balance\" team is adhering to these lists is an enormous problem. Riot is literally telling us which champs to play (Lee Sin, Zed, Thresh, perhaps a few others) and which champs not to play (Sona, Janna, several others). If you happen to have a main on the good list you are a-okay. If you play mostly immobile mages and traditional supports like I do, the sky is a much different color. \n\n I'm probably going to c&p this a few times, so unless you smell toast you don't need to contact a doctor.\n ~Uiru","replies":[{"poster":"JJ H0G","date":"2015-03-17T22:09:21.611+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lets see a bronze Lee stomp the shit out of people every game and get that 60% win rate and high pick rate across all ranks.\n\nThe Lee Sin QQ is just annoying at this point.
