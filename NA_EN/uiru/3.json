What the hell has the LCS even got to do with his character? Him being made more competitive has everything to do with his abilities and nothing to do with his character or his lore unless you think they have some rule that he's \"too piratey\" to be allowed to be good.\n\nGangplank is getting more to his personality than just the fact that he's a pirate because to the general playerbase of the game he is a laughing stock. I don't care how jaded you are about the existence of the LCS, there is literally nothing in his voiceover that isn't just a random joke based on the fact that he's a pirate and that's incredibly boring. The fact that you're even calling out the Sion, Xerath and Nidalee reworks as failures is ridiculous - people LIKE those reworks. Sion has an actual fanbase now, Nidalee is generally accepted as being less atrocious to play against than she was (even if she's still quite bad) and Xerath is a bit more contentious, yes, but he is not a champion who was reworked and then abandoned. He's popular.\n\nIf you seriously think people like Gangplank and ESPECIALLY Sion were better off left alone then you are so jaded by this game that I don't believe you should still be playing it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZenBudS","date":"2015-06-20T06:09:55.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"who cares. if it dont make money dont make sense riiiiighhht","replies":[]},{"poster":"JimmyNtheKudos","date":"2015-06-21T17:34:49.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His is the exact type of post they sadly ignore :/ Though, they even ignore the well written ones so what the f*ck do I know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-06-20T01:04:51.733+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, my friend had to lose like 2-3 times to get demoted at 0 LP.
