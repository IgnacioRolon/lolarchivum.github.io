We just need to change a few interactions.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":47,"down_votes":10,"body":"1. A champion's dash is now considered to be at 100% effectiveness when their current movement speed matches their default movement speed. When their current movement speed is diminished, their dash range is diminished by an equal amount. \r\n\r\n What this means: Slows will actually slow champs, since nearly everybody can just dash over a slow field now. For point and click abilities, a champ with a (say) 500 range leap will, with a 25% slow, have a 375 range leap for the duration of the slow effect. This affects non-targeted blinks and Flash as well.\r\n\r\n Does not affect champions whose current ms is higher (though that would be an interesting ability for an item or a support).\r\n\r\n If Zed does not currently have a range limit to his shadow hopping, he should, and then this can affect him too. Slowing him to keep him from popping away is counterplay, and he could use some.\r\n\r\n2. Roots (snares, immobilizes, etc) will prevent champions from using movement abilities already. What they should do is stop them dead upon application as well.\r\n\r\n What this means: Roots will stop a champion from just jumping onto you anyway and killing you while they're \"immobilized\" next to you. Jumping animations (Tristana, Jax) will drop to the ground immediately at a sensible point along their flight path (where they would be if it was just a dash towards their destination). \r\n\r\n Bullshit like Fizz's dash doing damage when he launches and not when he hits you will also be fixed. When a champion stops, if they are not within autoattack range they do not deal damage.\r\n\r\n Ultimates that specifically prevent this (Vi) will be unaffected.\r\n\r\n For the reply:\r\n\r\n When you howl into the night sky that your OP as fuck main will be ruined forever by these changes, consider a list of champions who will be \"ruined\" in this way, and then consider the health of a game with that list of champions getting nerfs they sorely need. I think you will get over it. This is a better solution to the very real problem of mobility creep than reworking every champ who abuses their mobility (which is nearly all of them). A few of them will still need additional work, of course.

This seems like a great way to affect mobility creep without causing a massive rework of the system. Champs still dash their full distance (and thus don't have a problem reaching enemies/going over walls), but still makes the slow relevant against champions with lots of dashes. Even Lee (and anybody else with a targeted dash) gets a clear effect placed on him. It's not game-breaking or crippling to high mobility champs.\n\nThe only thing I can think against this is that a big slow would lock someone in their dash, essentially turning their dash into a sort of channeled ability.

Again this would not hurt clarity, since why the hell would something that's on ground level hurt you when you are in the air? \n\nAs for the no dashy-dashy item (Shadow Shackles), i'd say it's a good idea, but make it so that the aura has a half second or so windup time, and a clear way of showing where it will be (so you CAN flash/dash the hell away). The reason for this is simple, the sole reason why soraka is really annoying is the instant silence field.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-01-08T00:34:23.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roots stopping dashes? Well there really isn't any height in lol and the only way you could make that work is if you have abilities specifically interact with leaps or if you make champions untargetable while leaping \n\nSo Jarvan can't E + Q while rooted anymore?","replies":[{"poster":"skippersd","date":"2015-01-08T17:01:00.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The leap or dash argument was just a random idea, it's just looks plain dumb that you jump over a caitlyn trap, and still get rooted.\n\nAs for j4, yes the proposed change would make any movement ability (except blinks, and some ults like malph and vi) stop if the champ is hit by a root. Sadly for jarvan, unlike others with one dash ability, that cannot be casted while you are rooted, both his Q and E can make sense to use even if you can't move (such as last hitting two 10HP champs.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Toru Itai","date":"2015-01-08T15:51:50.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"instead of changing the dash range, make them dash more slowly wile slowed. that way it dosn't interfear with consistency(only sometimes wall jumping ect), but the jump takes more time therefor it's less effective and they don't move as far away from you/close to you if you're chasing/running.\n\n\n\n\n(if this was already offered i'm sorry. i didn't read past the first page.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2015-01-08T12:47:50.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then {{item:3022}}  on ranged champs would be OP. Bad idea\nIt's just a design problem. Mobility has to be present at a certain cost/giving a certain weaknesses.
