My ban was well deserved one of my teammates was being toxic and I had assumed he was just joking cause I was doing fairly well that game and we were winning hard, so I joined in and said some offensive stuff ASSUMING we were just joking around and again it was a well deserved ban I'm fine with waiting it out. However I'm curious will I still get my seasonal rewards for hitting gold like my border and victorious skin? First season hitting gold and I'd be pretty disappointed if I didn't get my rewards off of a game I was joking around in.. Anyways thank you in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T03:12:42.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically, anyone who is given a ban lasting 7 or more days (taking place within 3 months of the season's end) will be ineligible for the season rewards.
