If you don't think that's the case, you should [submit a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can further look into this issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Elftits","date":"2015-01-27T02:39:09.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for that, i will check into it because I definitely remember getting that icon, I still don't hear the end of it from my friends, I will see if I can find any screenshots and send them in. Thanks for your time","replies":[]}]}]}
