Use the /mute all command.\nSeriously, this helped me climb from d5 hardstuck into d2 with ease, just mute someone who is being an a-hole and play the game, don't speak to toxic players in chat.\n2.Change your mindset.\nThis might be the trickiest part. I firmly believe that you can't win every game, the matchmaking will get you one day. If you're on a 5+ win streak, your teammates will be a lot worse than those you played with while you were on that win streak. So don't get too hyped about win streaks because that causes you to tilt harder when the said ends.\n3. Accept defeats which weren't caused by you and move on without flaming.\nI'm not saying you should blame your teammates for every defeat, but the opposite is not true either, you sometimes do your best and don't make much mistakes but still lose.\nSometimes you will get someone with an ebay acc/inter/troll and in my experience, riot won't do anything about them as long as they don't use the chat. So just accept those defeats and take a pause for the cause if you get tilted too much.\n\n\nHope this will help you, please share your thoughts in the comments","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2017-08-02T19:36:41.711+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"Or you could Just AFK instead of flaming lol, its not like afk's or inters ever get punished.

Assume everyone is an NPC. Why have a lengthy argument with an NPC when you can  farm, ward, or group? Are you surprised that the NPC suicided? No, it's a scripted or rng event to fuck with you. Kinda liked when psycho mantis toys with you in MGS, or a Crimsom Qurupeco calls a Deviljho and gets eaten in MH3. Your NPC talks too much? Turn off his dialogue (/mute). You want to get ~~booty~~lp, then start playing Civ5-simulator by making alliances (compliment the NPC for good things) and gift them shit (wards, ganks, freelo, etc). I like this POV because I feel less emotional if someone fails. People's failures are not insurmountable setback but part of the game.

Use the /mute all command.\n> Seriously, this helped me climb from d5 hardstuck into d2 with ease, just mute someone who is being an a-hole and play the game, don&amp;#039;t speak to toxic players in chat.\n> 2.Change your mindset.\n> This might be the trickiest part. I firmly believe that you can&amp;#039;t win every game, the matchmaking will get you one day. If you&amp;#039;re on a 5+ win streak, your teammates will be a lot worse than those you played with while you were on that win streak. So don&amp;#039;t get too hyped about win streaks because that causes you to tilt harder when the said ends.\n> 3. Accept defeats which weren&amp;#039;t caused by you and move on without flaming.\n> I&amp;#039;m not saying you should blame your teammates for every defeat, but the opposite is not true either, you sometimes do your best and don&#x27;t make much mistakes but still lose.\n> Sometimes you will get someone with an ebay acc/inter/troll and in my experience, riot won&amp;#039;t do anything about them as long as they don&amp;#039;t use the chat. So just accept those defeats and take a pause for the cause if you get tilted too much.\n> \n> \n> Hope this will help you, please share your thoughts in the comments\n\nMute all moment game start.Why?To prevent you from seeing people being toxic,which is going to lead to your respond,and that to their respond and there you go...\n\nMute all and have a good game.","replies":[{"poster":"JhinSpatula","date":"2017-08-03T18:52:55.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Werdx,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3sWB5tMa,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2017-08-03T16:55:17.418+0000)\n>\n> Mute all moment game start.Why?To prevent you from seeing people being toxic,which is going to lead to your respond,and that to their respond and there you go...\n> \n> Mute all and have a good game.\n\nOr mute just the ones who start being toxic, there are people who aren't dumb twats, but that's a rarity","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beast Hvnter","date":"2017-08-03T04:28:31.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a toxic player at all.\nIm also pretty sure a riot employee of sort does read this stuff from time to time, so here we go.\nIm not a bad player, yet i dont know everything about the game. I stay in gold 3 and lower most of them time, and have been playing since 2012.\nIve had over 10 accounts, 3 of which are banned, not due to toxicity, but due to the fact i just died a little too much, unintentionally, and someone on my team brings up all chat and encourages everyone to flameand report me. they report and shortly after im recieving suspensions, then again, months later, got banned on my first account. This has happened 3 times.\n\nIm not one to type on chat, even team chat. I have anxiety out the ass as it is, and i find it hard to find things to say most of the time. So i NEVER flame my team, for anything, and i mute when i feel like its needed, because i know doing it at game start is an option, but at the same time some useful info is typed in chat, and i wouldnt be able to see it.\n\nAll in all riot, you encourage good sportsmanship and non toxicity in your community, but you condone the banning of players who are learning and arnt AS good as most, that die a little too much, and dont deserve it at all. We need to look into the FEEDING report, and examine what is reportable and what isnt when it comes to league deaths.\n\nNot complaining, yet i am, because i can see this being a bad problem to others that arnt as good. I dont care to be great, i only play for fun, yet riot takes matchmaking of all sorts too seriously, and ive seen tons of players leave to other games because of it. Ontop of all of that, no matter what you have done, or who you are (tyler1), or how reformed you get, they wont lift your ban.\n\nGG on tribunal riot, and GG on kinda screwing lower tier players as myself.","replies":[{"poster":"RealČernochHours","date":"2017-08-03T18:45:05.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tribunal was a rigged shithole and everybody knows it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"h5LYF41Lam","date":"2017-08-03T12:11:02.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Instead of flaming if a game is lost afk or leave the game or run it down mid or stay in the jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"JhinSpatula","date":"2017-08-03T13:18:45.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Trick2G69,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3sWB5tMa,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2017-08-03T12:11:02.337+0000)\n>\n> Instead of flaming if a game is lost afk or leave the game or run it down mid or stay in the jungle.\n\nYeah, those people don't get caught as long as they don't use the chat.
