This game is likely at an all-time high for the worst balance it has ever had. Many games are long 1 way snowballs where you are forced to play for 40 minutes knowing the entire game that you&#039;ve already lost, and other games are straight stomps where you are forced to feed for 15-20 minutes unable to do anything. In the past there were different styles of champions, many with point and click spells (Fiora&#039;s ultimate for example), who could easily turn the tides of the game 1v5 without any assistance. These days, we have champions who can&#039;t even use their spells and kits without another ally (Kalista, Galio, etc). Unless the enemy team starts running it down mid and giving you free gold.. many games there&#039;s simply no hope in.\n\nIt&#039;s not healthy to force someone to sit around for 40 minutes having to accept that everytime he leaves base he&#039;s dead. Having to accept that he&#039;s part of the reason his team lost while some of the team are potentially upset at him / her. This is not even to mention the massive waste of time occurring if the rest of the team refuses to forfeit. More often than not, I find in almost all of the games I play people tend to not forfeit just to be assholes and not because they actually think the team can win. People vote no just to see if they can get someone punished for AFK&#039;ing and to further tilt the rest of their team. Don&#039;t even attempt to convince me otherwise, because it&#039;s something I see in almost every single game that I play where my team is losing (happens extremely frequently). No one should have to deal with it. Not the stress, shame, or the time being wasted. \n\nGranted, I&#039;m not here to defend all AFK&#039;s as sometimes it&#039;s not for a good reason (someone rage quitting, int&#039;ing, etc). What I am trying to say is, if a team is behind by over a certain amount (6 Towers &amp; 25 Kills for example) and the surrender vote fails, the player(s) who voted no should have a right to leave that match without any ramifications and AI should play for them instead. They&#039;re essentially being held hostage by other players and to me, that is something that shouldn&#039;t be acceptable.\n\ntl;dr --&gt; When losing very heavily, players should have a right to leave if the team won&#039;t surrender.\n\n--\n\nPart 2:\n**// Things Happen //**\n----\nLet&#039;s look at some realistic things that happen in life and the &quot;unrealistic&quot; answers required by this community and Riot Games.\n\n**_Situation 1:_** Someone comes over and you live alone.\n\n&quot;Ding dong&quot;, the doorbell rings.\n&quot;Hello? Is someone going to answer the door?!&quot;\n\n&quot;Sorry, I can&#039;t come talk to you because I&#039;m in the middle of playing League of Legends&quot;.\n\nIs this actually going to play out like this? Of course not. A video game is never more important than taking care of things in life. What&#039;s the fix? An AI that can play for you, of course. Why does that work? It farms while you answer the door.. it takes care of business until you can come back, life is good.\n--\n\n**_Situation 2:_** An Emergency, such as your child cutting their finger, choking on their food, or lighting something in the house on fire.\n\n&quot;I&#039;m sorry, you&#039;re just going to have to bleed for a while until I finish this LoL match&quot;.\n\n&quot;I&#039;ll put that stove on fire out after my game is over&quot;.\n\nThings like this definitely do not happen every single day, nor am I trying to say they do. The problem is, there are millions of players on League of Legends and likely a large amount of them play a lot of games every single day. It&#039;s bound to happen to someone out there and there&#039;s no system in place to help their teammates when they absolutely cannot afford to keep playing the match.\n\n**_Situation 3:_** Your Computer dies, the power goes out, or  your internet stops working.\n\nAll of these are things players have zero control over. It&#039;s not something that should be punishable. Once again, a simple AI will help the problem.\n\nPlain and Simple, League of Legends needs an AI system. It doesn&#039;t even have to be a &quot;good AI&quot;, just something that doesn&#039;t run it down mid and feed the enemy 100 kills. Players should still get punishment for behavioral AFK&#039;ing but generally other reasons should be more tolerated than they are currently. Leaver buster does do a good job, but perhaps also a bit *too good* of a job. The system is so strict that sometimes even innocent players who come back and are a major force in helping their team win games, where they had to leave for 5 minutes, get picked up and punished by the system. Punishments such as that aren&#039;t really logical and it&#039;s simply the result of players blaming each other instead of pointing to the real cause of the problem -- the developer **Riot Games**. Instead of the developers creating a better solution to Away From Keyboards, Riot instead chooses to just punish accounts even for slight inactivity which is inhumane and actually a bit lazy on their end.\n\ntl;dr --&gt; Players are real life people, and life happens. People shouldn&#039;t be punished for being human beings, instead Riot Games should make an AI to remedy the problem as opposed to simply punishing accounts.\n--\n\nPart 3: \n**// Killing The Nexus Shouldn&#039;t Be The Only Way To Win //**\n\nSo, you&#039;re Riot Games and you do not want to put in the effort of making a decent AI. You also don&#039;t want players AFK&#039;ing to be acceptable, but want to make the game more ethical? It&#039;s simple. Add more than one way to win League of Legends. Riot Games, you&#039;ve already changed the genre of your game from a &quot;slow paced Strategy MOBA&quot; to a &quot;Fast paced button masher MOBA&quot;. Just make killing the enemy another way to win the match. A condition such as &quot;after acquiring X amount of kills, acing the enemy team ends the match&quot;. This would help in games where one team is getting absolutely destroyed by the enemies with no hope of winning, when a few players refuse to /ff the match.\n\nSaves time, saves player stress &amp; frustration, and even adds another dimension to playing League of Legends... Pretty smart right?\n\ntl;dr --&gt; Make killing the enemy opponents another way players can win League of Legends matches.\n--\n\nAnyways, I&#039;m tired of typing so I&#039;m going leave it at this:\n\nThe game needs changed. League of Legends is not the same game it used to be, it&#039;s fast, often frustrating, and it&#039;s not ethical to expect players to sit around for extended periods of time in demoralizing matches they have little to zero chance of winning. A new win condition should be implemented, or else players should start being excused for leaving unwinnable matches. Sometimes players have valid reasons for needing to leave, and the game needs an AI system to step in when players step away.","replies":[{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-04-22T19:14:42.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add the same bots you see in low-level ARAM games.

Someone fighting an Intermediate Bot in his lane is better than a laner sitting around camping another lane all game. They might have to make the AI better so the bots don't overextend, but generally Intermediate Bots do not have terrible mechanics. Maybe you haven't tried 1v5'ing some Intermediate Bots lately, but it's much more difficult than it used to be. They might not be \"Diamond Level\" but when you have no one at all to reset waves against split pushers it's still useful.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-04-22T20:22:06.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Ekko NA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IvpWbEk7,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-22T19:29:24.904+0000)\n>\n> I actually don&#x27;t agree.

This gets worst and worst the higher you go in the ladder. You cannot tell a bot what wave to push or to group or play safely or nothing. They just do whatever they want and barely even touch turrets even when they are free to do so","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"XOmega WarriorX","date":"2018-04-22T18:28:03.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with everthing,excepth the ace ends the game after X kills,im 100% for shortening games,but,that dosnt sound to good of an idea","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-04-22T18:31:59.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XOmega WarriorX,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IvpWbEk7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-22T18:28:03.936+0000)\n>\n> i agree with everthing,excepth the ace ends the game after X kills,im 100% for shortening games,but,that dosnt sound to good of an idea\n\nHmm maybe that would be a bit too much, but I'm certain they can come up with a better win condition for killing the enemy.\n\nPerhaps something more, like \"When each player reaches X amount of kills\" would also give more incentive for aggressive choices in Bot lane as opposed to the traditional supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-04-22T18:40:14.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that also will just more than likely force an early game meta and remove certain champs from even being allowed to exist in the game\n\n\nPeople complain harder when the matches are 20 minutes as opposed to them being 40 minutes","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-04-22T18:45:17.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Too Unlucky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IvpWbEk7,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2018-04-22T18:40:14.726+0000)\n>\n> But that also will just more than likely force an early game meta and remove certain champs from even being allowed to exist in the game\n\nNot necessarily. If you set the amount of kills high (like 50 let's say), most teams do not make it that far in a game before one team wins or loses. When you set it high, it allows \"objective\" focused teams to still be able to win games while also opening doors for team comps who just want to kill the other team without caring about winning through base objectives.\n\nGranted, it might create more people going for those early game comps but that would only be because PvP and brawling are what people like, so naturally more players will focus on killing others than trying to win the game by killing the enemy's nexus.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-04-22T18:47:23.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mmm.... make it like 80 tbh.\n\nThere's plenty of games where that one person will go 20/something because he got fed and will spread it across the map","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-04-22T18:54:08.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Too Unlucky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IvpWbEk7,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-04-22T18:47:23.840+0000)\n>\n> mmm.... make it like 80 tbh.\n> \n> There&#x27;s plenty of games where that one person will go 20/something because he got fed and will spread it across the map\n\n80 might actually be more reasonable, but I think maybe a bit too hard to reach. That's roughly 16 kills on each player. There's almost never any matches where every player on a team has 16 kills, but you probably have the right idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-04-22T19:08:52.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would assume you were talking about total team kills, which in terms of soloq, mainly lower elos, they happen commonly tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-04-22T19:12:48.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Too Unlucky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IvpWbEk7,comment-id=0000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-22T19:08:52.086+0000)\n>\n> i would assume you were talking about total team kills, which in terms of soloq, mainly lower elos, they happen commonly tbh\n\nRiot would have to check their data to see a good average I think, it would be hard to judge without a bigger picture of average kills for all regions and tiers.
