I DON'T CARE, GANK MY LANE. I hate Jungling, and I hate Junglers even more. Junglers never look my way until it's too late, and I can't stand it. When they've AFK farmed or they've ganked the other lanes and lost them.. then they finally decide maybe they should come to my lane? THERE'S 5 ENEMIES, QUICK RUN OVER TO HIS LANE..  HE'S DEAD, THE LAST OUTER IS GOING TO DIE, RUN RUN RUN GO...\r\n\r\nYou really want to know what turns me into an asshole? THIS. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT TILTS ME AND TURNS ME INTO AN ASSHOLE.\r\n\r\nI understand it's not mandatory for a Jungler to babysit any lane. I don't expect a Jungler to babysit my lane. Do you know what I expect? I expect the Jungler to acquire vision, to track the enemy Jungle. To be ready when the enemy Jungler and Support randomly appears in my lane to gank me. I EXPECT MY JUNGLE TO BE USEFUL AND TO DO HIS JOB. If my Jungler feels he can get the even trade in another lane at my expense, that's completely fine. I'll look at that and think \"it's even\". I'm not an irrational person. If they think for one second that I'm going to keep my sanity while getting completely fucked over again and again, and it's something that could have been prevented, they have another thing coming.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jungler dies 10+ times in other lanes, that's 10 deaths the Jungler created that can't be made up for anywhere else. That's 10 deaths, that no matter how much farming a solo laner does, he or she can't acquire the gold from in an even lane. To me, personally, I believe if a Jungler dies more than maybe 6-7 times it's unacceptable. Junglers are around enemies less than any other player in the game, therefore it shouldn't even be possible that they are dying more than their laners in an average length game.\r\n\r\nI've been Jungling a lot lately, because I felt like the issue is always the Jungler. I'm not someone who likes to be like that, but the past several months I've been losing my mind in this game playing Top lane. Junglers don't ever come Top, it's an isolated island.. but as soon as I begin winning lane, all the enemies are in my lane and no one from my team is there to help me. My laners are facing no one, but they aren't getting towers or objectives. When I look around about mid game, there's 3-5 enemies constantly in my lane and the rest of my team is farming like there's nothing going on. It's horrid, and I can't even begin to understand why it's happening. I'm not particularly strong, and I'm definitely not fed enough to fight many enemies alone probably 90% of the time.\r\n\r\nWhen I play Jungle, it's a completely different story. After switching from Top to Jungle, I had a 68% win rate in roughly 60 games. Junglers have FAR too much impact on games right now. It's not even fair. I can win game after game after game as a Jungler, yet the instant I switch to Top lane, I struggle to win even half of my games. I'm a FAR superior Top laner to Jungle... I never Jungle and I do not like Jungling. I lose my lane maybe once out of 10 games as a Top laner. For some reason however, I do not win as a Top laner. The Junglers in my games are useless and it impacts the game so much that it becomes nearly impossible to turn games around.\r\n\r\nI'll likely go back to Jungling, as I really hate losing for no reason. I would like to understand more WHY this is happening however. Why is it that Junglers don't gank top? Is Jungle not a popular role, are these players auto filled? Also, as a side note, I have politely asked Junglers to gank for me. The problem is, almost everytime they'll say something like \"OK\" and then they'll never come. I'm pretty damn good at wave management, I buy pink wards and use the plants to clear out the enemies wards. Nothing helps. Is the other side of the map literally that important? I really would love to keep playing mostly Top, but I can't find any reason at all to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Winters Dawn","date":"2017-09-05T02:52:38.123+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the reason.

I think you just have no concept of how to play when you have a lead in top lane.  Being ahead doesn't mean you go ham and ignore everything else that is happening.  If the enemy sends 3 top, you should have known about it before hand and backed off to your tower.

As a jungler, you can influence and reset the losing lane if it is still in its early stages. If one of your lanes died once and you see an opportunity to gank successfully (net a kill or cause enemies to burn resources), I would personally go for it just to balance things out again (especially if it was bot lane). \n\nFor another thing, it notifies the enemy lane to acknowledge that they have an enemy jungler keeping an eye on that lane, resulting in the enemy lane to be less likely to continue to aggressively force another fight, giving you the opportunity to gank the winning lanes. Call it a mind-trick of sorts and it have a tendency to work.\n\nAs a jungler, I will do my best to show up. Even if it means scaring off the enemy just a little bit when they get pushy. The only reason I would never gank is if my team is pushing too hard and doesn't give me enough security to successfully dive without giving out a death as well. \n\nThe worst thing you can do as a jungler is to not show your presence to the enemy team. As a laner, the thing that bugs me the most is that our jungler doesn't even bother to show up to our lane despite us asking for a gank, especially after 1 death. They don't show up until it is to the point where we are losing the lane badly, despite playing safe...all because the enemy team knows our jungler is blind to our lane and able to keep pushing and pushing and pushing to keep gaining an advantage without fear of being retaliated. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"EPIKON","date":"2017-09-06T08:56:44.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZapMyHeart,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LtYJXehA,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-09-06T08:46:05.678+0000)\n>\n> Depends on how bad the lane is losing.

If it's early enough to reset it, you should if there is an opportunity. Not all games are going to give you the chance to gank the other two lanes on a regular basis either. Being a jungler is never simple and each game plays out differently. \n\nIt is stupid to continue to gank a losing lane repeatedly. However, it's also equally stupid to not give your losing lane a chance to come back if they are only behind a little bit and you see an opening to make a difference.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Danny DeVito","date":"2017-09-05T02:40:52.129+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think a better question is why do players with Riven in their names always act like this","replies":[{"poster":"not brna","date":"2017-09-05T02:44:05.766+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gríff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LtYJXehA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-05T02:40:52.129+0000)\n>\n> I think a better question is why do players with Riven in their names always act like this\n\nHi, I'm back.
