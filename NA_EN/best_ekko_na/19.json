Riven is a melee champion who's numbers are worse than a ton of ranged champions... Now you tell me, what kind of sense does that make?\r\n\r\nOh and in case you didn't know, Garen's rank 1 Q deals more damage than all 3 of Riven's rank 1 Q's combined. That's right. A JUGGERNAUT, who's primary objective is to soak damage, deals more damage with their ability than a champion who is a full on melee damage dealer.\r\n\r\nI get it, ~buh Riven haters, we don't like Riven haters~, let me tell you.. FUCK Riven haters. Why do Riven mains have to be better than everyone else mechanically in order to do well? There are so many champions who deal tons of damage with lucky skill shots and point of click abilities ( AKA {{champion:142}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:31}} ).\r\n\r\n\r\nOh and RANT:\r\n\r\nHate, down vote, do whatever the you guys want. It's fine. Riven has been my primary champion since the beginning. I've seen some times where she was busted and done well, and I've had a lot of games where I did not do well. Regardless, I'm tired of looking at her numbers and seeing how trash they are compared to the majority of champions. I'm not here to talk about win rate either, I'm talking about the champion and her kit.\r\n\r\nAll players shouldn't be punished just because there are some very talented individuals out there. Not all of us are Boxbox, and it's simply not fair how the entire player base is treated like they are just because players like him are able to play well with the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Garen","date":"2018-11-19T15:45:51.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Oh and in case you didn't know, Garen's rank 1 Q deals more damage than all 3 of Riven's rank 1 Q's combined.\"\n\nWell, in case you didn't know, riven has an ability that completely nullifies garen's Q damage while also being a dash.\n\nPlus, they already gave her a flat 100 damage buff to her ult a while ago.\n\nIdk why you're complaining, riven's level 1 is one of the most brutal things in this game. Being able to weave in empowered autos while also dashing/dealing damage that ends in a knockup is ridiculous. \n\nSo not only do you completely disregard that, you want to make it so she can deal upwards of 100 damage with just the dash, not counting the fact that it's basically a triple auto reset that empowers those 3 autos.\n\n\n\"All players shouldn't be punished just because there are some very talented individuals out there.

There is a very short ceiling for me, not because I'm bad, but because Garen's kit doesn't allow me to get past that.\n\nSome champs take little skill to master, some take a lot. You'll probably never see Garen in pro play, while champs like {{champion:136}}  are very common. It's not really riot's fault that you picked a champ with a skill ceiling that you struggle to hit. It's not their fault that I picked a champ that has a ceiling that is way too low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-11-18T23:28:53.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">That's right.

You could argue that her skill ceiling is to high, but I think that is what her mains love about her. \n\nno idea if she's balanced or not, haven't seen a Riven in forever. \n\nRiots considering bringing {{item:3161}}  to summoner rift next season, which is perfect for her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-18T07:17:13.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\\>+20 base damage q level 1\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJPz4qVUIAEhFMc.png","replies":[{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2018-11-19T02:21:39.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UvZkWF5a,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-18T07:17:13.669+0000)\n>\n> \\&gt;+20 base damage q level 1\n> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DJPz4qVUIAEhFMc.png\n\nMathematically it's about 2 more damage at level 1 comparing with a Long Sword. Four extra damage if you're going off pure base champion damage. Most people are too lazy to calculate it out (or can't). It's not much, but it's enough to help Riven early into laning phase.\n\n64 base AD at level 1, if you'd like to understand these numbers (between what I'm suggesting and what's there), it looks more like this..\n\nCurrent Ability:\n----\n64 (base AD level 1) * .45 = 28.8 (Scaling AD)\n15 + 28.8 = 43.8 damage (each hit)\n\nSuggested Ability:\n----\n64 (base AD level 1) * .2 = 12.8 (Scaling AD)\n35 + 12.8 = 47.8 damage (each hit)\n\nMost people on these boards do not understand Riven's problems, so I'll explain in a bit more detail.\n\nRiven is a champion who has low base damages. In Season 3, her base damages were actually similar to what I'm suggesting right now. \nIt used to be this: 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130(+70 bonus AD) all the way until patch 4.1 in season 4 of 2014.\n\nYou'd probably wonder, what am I trying to accomplish by changing it to this: 35 / 60 / 95 / 120 / 150 (+ 20 / 25 / 30 / 45 / 50% AD).\n\nRiven is extremely powerful in the late game. That's where Riven's win percentage spikes the most. If you check Champion.gg you can see this clearly, where at 20 minutes her win rate is at 46%.. but in a 35-40 minute match, she jumps to close to 52% win rate.\n\nIf you play Riven you'll actually think she sucks because her abilities simply deal no damage early into the game unless you have a significant lead. When you go even against your laner, it's extremely difficult to win out 1v1 due to Riven's low base damage. Riven requires items to make her abilities deal damage, and early into the game it's just not possible to get the type of AD you need even when farming perfectly.\n\nThere is also the problem with Riven that when you begin losing lane, you cannot recover most of the time. Without items, Riven's abilities simply don't do much of anything and she's melee eating tons of damage to accomplish even the smallest trade.\n\nThat's where my suggestion comes in. Give Riven her base damage back, but cut her scaling. This will mean that Riven will have an easier time recovering from a mistake or two and also help give some early power if she does manage to outplay or win some trades against the enemy team. Riven will lose a considerable amount of late game power, but she's already a bit too strong during the late game anyway.\n\nHopefully this makes a bit more sense.","replies":[]}]}]}
