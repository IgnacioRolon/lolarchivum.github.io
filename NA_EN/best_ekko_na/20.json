They shouldn't have the right to lose the game for someone else. \n\nALL FIVE PLAYERS LOSE LP WHEN THEY SURRENDER.\n\nPlease don't give me this majority rules bullshit. If majority rules, split my LP loss among the other 4 players because I still thought the game was winnable and they deserve to lose extra LP for giving up. I don't deserve to lose LP when I don't think the game is over and it ends prematurely because some sore losers on my team want to give up before the other team has won.\n\nI'm beyond tired of this, so fucking tired of it. So many times I'm fed and doing well but my whole team is feeding. The game is far from over, but they aren't  carrying so they don't want to play anymore. That's not how shit works and it's not fair that someone else is affected because of it.\n\nPlease, change the after 20 minute surrender to match the before 20 minute surrender. All 5 players lose LP when a team surrenders, not just 4 players. No player's LP should be at another player's mercy, all player's opinion should matter before a surrender is issued. If one player thinks the game can be won, then none should be allowed to lose that game for them by surrendering.\n\nAlso, yes I understand that some games can't be won.. that's not what I am talking about here. Literally every single time this happens to me, the game is entirely winnable. My teammates are unsportsmanlike and don't respect the fact that someone else is carrying the game. This is one of the most tilting things in the world, having a game you're doing extremely well in ended because 4 of your teammates are feeding and gave up.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-02-23T19:10:04.269+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then one troll can hold a game hostage","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-02-23T20:03:43.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akali is SO HOT,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EVy660uh,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-02-23T19:10:04.269+0000)\n>\n> Then one troll can hold a game hostage\n\n^\n\nthe only time it should REQUIRE five votes to surrender is in bots...

If 5 players lose LP when forfeiting a game, 5 players \"approval\" should be required before the game can be forfeited. If someone's opinion isn't important, they shouldn't lose LP when the game is forfeited. They didn't even have a say in it.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-02-23T19:06:45.294+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem here is the players disagreeing with one another as to what is important.\n\nSome people care only about the game currently being played.

Sometimes mentally a game is very taxing for people amd instead of enduring 50 pliant minutes of tilting and possibly losing still they decide to move on. Sometimes games really can be won and you just need people to hang in a few more minutes to scale up. And this is coming from someone who specializes in not giving up and come backs. That tilt can bleed from game to game if not patched up and sometimes patching it io means stepping away from the issue earlier than pride would allow.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2018-02-23T19:34:02.495+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No thanks, I don't want to be held hostage by a player who fed his ass off and then refuses to surrender.","replies":[{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2018-02-23T19:44:10.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Captain Tea,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EVy660uh,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-02-23T19:34:02.495+0000)\n>\n> No thanks, I don&#x27;t want to be hold hostage by a player who fed his ass off and then refuses to surrender.\n\nThis brings up another problem with 5s.

It lets players who are already going to lose the game end the game early instead of having to wait for 50+ minutes of passive gold income to catch up and maybe win, or wait for the enemy team to get bored and just end it. The 4-vote requirement is there to prevent a troll on the surrendering team from holding the other four hostage.\n\nNowadays, people tend to use it to give up on games early. Part of this is because games legitimately snowball very hard nowadays and \"unwinnable scenarios\" do occur frequently by the 15- or 20-minute mark. Part of this is because player perception is skewed to the point of your average bronzie believing \"they got first blood game is thrown\", even though the snowballing is not quite that bad (yet).\n\nThe issue is that different players view the game state differently. Some people are laser-focused on \"this all evens out at 55 minutes\" and will never surrender no matter how bad the early game goes. Other players are laser-focused on \"I have 90 minutes to play League today and want to cram as many games in as possible, win or lose\" and want their games to end as quickly as possible so they can play more games and level up faster. Still others are bad and overplaced and want to FF because they know their deaths threw the game and they want to get out of the game, whereas others are good and climbing and don't want to FF because they won lane and are in a good spot for teamfights.\n\nWho's right? Whose opinion matters the most?\n\nAccording to Riot, one player desiring to play the game out matters from 15 minutes to 20 minutes. After that, more than one player must desire to play the game out for the game to keep going. In the event that you win lane and everyone else feeds really hard, yes it kind of sucks that you play well and lose anyway, but you have to keep in mind that if you did solo carry the game, not only would you be tilting most of the other team (who all also won lane and managed to lose the game regardless), you'd also be giving a win to four players who don't deserve that win.\n\nLike, half the reason League is such a toxic game is because it's a team game. You win or lose as a team and **everyone on your team has the right to lose the game for you, just as you have the right to lose the game for them.** The other half of the reason League is such a toxic game is because you're stuck with your team for the whole game, no matter how long that game is. Baddies don't want to be stuck in a game after dying 3 times in 5 minutes and decent players who didn't feed don't want to be stuck in that game either, but they're both stuck dealing with an overpowered enemy until 15 minutes at the very least.\n\nI think OP should find a game where individual performance matters more instead of complaining that his team surrendered an obviously lost game. Why should his desire to play out a loss supersede the desire of four other players to move on with their lives?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-02-23T19:33:04.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
