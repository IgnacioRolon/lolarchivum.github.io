Every game feels like I have absolutely no team at all. My teammates are unwilling to contribute, they don&#039;t pay attention, they don&#039;t do anything. I&#039;m so fed up and tired of it. I try desperately to help my team, but they don&#039;t even help themselves. Why am I playing this game?\n\nGetting invaded by the enemy team? You can bet my team won&#039;t be there.\n\nGoing anywhere to gank a lane? You can bet my team isn&#039;t going to engage, they aren&#039;t even going to move.\n\nTrying to get my team to help obtain a neutral objective? Maybe next game, next year, next life. Sure doesn&#039;t happen in my games.\n\nEvery single thing that pisses me off in this game is related to how team oriented it is. Without my team, I am helpless. The enemy team shits on me in my Jungle and there is nothing I can do about it. It&#039;s impossible to snowball my own laners, because they either don&#039;t want me to gank, or aren&#039;t paying attention when I do come to their lane. Something happens, I know we can get that objective, my team doesn&#039;t want to help. This game is horrible. Either I get really fed and I solo carry a bunch of people who don&#039;t deserve it, or the enemy team goon squads my Jungle and prevents me from being able to do anything. \n\nIt&#039;s getting to the point where it&#039;s predictable, and not even fun anymore. I can tell by 5 minutes into the game if I&#039;ve won or lost, then if the game is not looking well, I&#039;m forced to sit around in a long ass 20-30 minute miserable game. Such a massive waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-03-05T12:54:45.788+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":48,"body":"It has been said numerous times, but what is the common situation with \"every single game\" you're in ?

This doesn't work for Vi most of the times as you suddenly drop off the face of the damage map if the game goes for longer, due to how everyone else scales and as a Bruiser and a Diver, you need to also be tanky to be able to survive the damage.\n\nI've tried Vi with a lot of different builds and runes and there's just nothing better than the regular Bruiser build. It's expensive as shit (and one of the reasons why bruisers feel so bad to play currently) but it is what it is. Vi has no options to back down once she's in the fight and you need to make sure you're either engaging a priority target to which your team can follow up on or you can take out the target/make the enemy focus you while your team cleans house.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2018-03-05T15:31:45.927+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"This is stupid.

I&#x27;m just sick of seeing shitposts hit HOT.\n\nNo where did I say my teammates are bad. In fact, I get carried by my teammates on a regular basis in the games where the enemies are squading up in my Jungle to keep me from becoming a problem. This post has nothing to do with winning or losing, it has absolutely nothing to do with mechanics, champions, or the things that are being built. My complaint is *teamwork is nearly non-existent.*\n\nEveryone wants to believe that they're the big shot who is going to carry the game, thus they don't give a single fuck about their teammates and what is occurring within the game.  It's almost an every game thing. My teammates are concerned about \"Did _**I**_ win lane? Did _**I**_ get the first tower? What did _**I**_ achieve? \n\nOften times the enemy team's solo laners are running around getting fed, ensuring that I am shut down and useless in the Jungle. Do you know why my teammates don't help? They refuse to help because all they care about is that they're 3-0 and got the first tower. They sit around farming in their lane thinking the game revolves around them and their lane. It's not always solo laners, it could be any lane, but for sake of example that's what I'm using. \n\nSometimes those people get big, they carry the game, but the vast majority of the time they do not. The game requires a team, and even though they won lane things go down hill quickly because they simply cannot 1v5 when the rest of their team got their asses handed to them. Literally all of it could be prevented if they'd simply play with their teammates and actively contribute to the game.\n\nTo me, working together as a team, having teammates who pay attention and are responsive to events around the map, having teammates who work to keep everything together when misplays are made, that is more important than risking everything on one player who actually thinks they can super man the team on their back and hard carry the entire game.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-03-06T02:02:27.445+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">No where did I say my teammates are bad.\n\nlol\n>why is it that I am constantly matched with unresponsive teammates? \n\n---\n>Getting invaded by the enemy team?

I am so dependent on my teammates it's not even funny. Why is it that when the enemies are disabled, they still win as a team because they just put their power together, but when a single teammate on my team is disabled it determines the outcome of the game? This is bullshit and i can't climb! I am playing Jungle and no matter how well i do, the people here just manage to shift the blame on me every time because i'm actually trying to win and they use me, the \"activist\" as a scapegoat.\n\nIt's propably the meta that's been ruined from strategic thinking to casual pew-pew-boom-fests so hard that forces me to never be able to close out games by myself because a single opponent can 100 - 0 me in less than 3 seconds almost all the time due to the massive amounts of damage existing.

If my personal skill in relation to my team is a 5.5, and I raise it to a 7.5, 8, or even 9, I will win more games on average. However, and this is the problem - your team isn't always a 5 on average. Sometimes they're a 4. Sometimes they're a 3. Sometimes they're a 2. So you can win the games where you are a 7, and your team is a 4, and their team is a 4.5 on average (23 > 22.5). Okay. Gotta carry to climb. What if your team is a 3? Now you don't win. 19 > 22.5. \n\nThe issue is this *feels* bad, and just like with champs, what *feels* bad is often more important than the statistical reality. When you get 3-4 games in a row where your team is a 2, 3, 4, and your skill level is a 5.5 or 6 or 6.5, then it feels like shit, and it doesn't matter that the stats will regress to the mean and you'll climb over the long haul, we're humans, not machines, and not everyone can deal with that cycle of frustration and helplessness, especially when you put a lot of time and effort into getting better, and getting better doesn't generate an immediate, dopamine-pumping reward (like say, the enemy nexus blowing up, or you dunking on the enemy team), or only generates one over the super long haul. Now, does this negate the fact that you'll win games if your skill level is 7.5 that you won't at 6.5? No. Obviously you can get better (though realistically, not everyone has the time or dedication to get to say, mid Diamond in skill level, which would be an 7-8 compared to the 5 that is Silver-Gold).

In bronze, there needs to be a restriction on which champs you can play in ranked based on previous plays. People can bitch and moan all they want about \"ok so now I can't play my main on my smurf account?\" Yeah. You can't. Becuase that's a minor concern, and its for the greater good. \n\nI see so many players in bronze literally hit shuffle on which champ their going to play and riot refuses to do a damn thing when the ONLY advice people give you about climbing is to stick to three champs. And just to break it down for the simpletons out there: If you climb by sticking to 3 champs, playing 20 champs over 30 games is the opposite of climbing. And in ranked, thats the same as trolling. \n\n2. Blocking a player should mean we don't queue with them. \n\nThis is the most basic and obvious solution that there has to be a financial reason riot has decided not to do it. If every time some player showed up and fucked around, and we all blocked him, they'd have a longer queue time. And it balances because if YOU went around blocking everyone you'd have a longer queue time. \n\nThis is so obvious and helpful I actually blame Riot for causing problems in Bronze. Like the U.S. in the Middle East. They make things worse.\n\n3. There needs to be \"ranked bans\" based on sucking constantly at zero LP. This would act like \"falling out of the bracket\" without having to create a new, lower bracket.","replies":[]}]}
