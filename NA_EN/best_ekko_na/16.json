When someone is put in Jail or Prison, they&amp;#039;re even more likely to end up back there after that point.\n\nYou're skipping over a huge amount of relevant information when you make these claims. There are a lot of very significant reasons why criminals in the US have high recidivism rates, most of which do not correlate to Riots Player Behavior systems. it's not a useful or relevant comparison to make.\n\n> When looking at League, I&amp;#039;d say it&amp;#039;s highly likely the same principle applies. League of Legends only uses punishment to correct player behaviors, the same method proven to be the least effective at solving the problem.\n\nThis is incorrect, the honor system is a means of using rewards for positive behavior in order to shape behavior. If bans and chat restrictions are the stick, the honor system is absolutely the carrot.\n\n> That is a huge part of why I personally feel that from the beginning of time, all of the &amp;quot;Reform&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Player Behavior&amp;quot; research that has been done for League of Legends is vastly inaccurate.

Or perhaps did it feel more a matter of grinding out a lot of games -- with the same behavior they&amp;#039;ve always had while playing League?\n\nI definitely agree here, the honor system doesn't bounce back from 0 fast enough and it doesn't do enough to encourage people while they are working their way back up with honor.\n\n> There are just not enough visible signs which help a player understand when they&amp;#039;re on the right track, and not any incentives to keep them going.

Some countermeasures would need to be put in place. Perhaps two votes from premades count as 1 vote when going to a fellow premade, so that a player has to actively try to be honorable towards _all_ of their teammates and not just their premades in order to get points.

I think that unlocking special shops perhaps with special skins or special sales available only in those shops would be a good solution, I don't think additional EXP or Blue Essence is a viable solution, players like myself who have been playing the game for ages have all of the BE we could ever need, so it wouldn't be incentive enough to make them(us) change behavior.\n\n> At any rate, for now I&amp;#039;m hungry, tired, and can&amp;#039;t keep my thoughts in one place so I&amp;#039;m going to cut this off here. \n> \n> The systems in place do not feel impactful (to me), and I&amp;#039;m not so sure that they even accomplish anything.

They *help*, but you still climb even if you&#x27;re never honored.\n\nOkay well, here's another thought -- Have a daily check-in table, which unlocks at honor level 2. Instead of making it so that \"occasionally\" you get rewards, all that you have to do is login or maybe even give a quest to play 1 match, to acquire the rewards for that day. At honor 3, 4, and 5 your table or quest rewards upgrade (each time).\n\nThis removes the illusion of not getting much and gives a clear understanding to the player what they are getting out of having good behavior. For example, instead of giving a key every 3 hours.. They obtain a quest daily (when at the honor level for said quest), and after completing it acquire all of the keys for that day (eight keys).\n\nAlso, I still (despite what you said about keys and skins) really believe the reward system is underwhelming. The threat of getting banned really is not an incentive for good behavior. How comfortable can someone feel knowing that ultimately the company doesn't give the slightest care in the world about them? That's like going into a store and they tell you that they don't care about your business and tell you to screw off. How would you feel about shopping there afterwards? I'm sure you'd be having some second thoughts.\n\nThe current loot system is nice, especially considering there was never anything like it before, but personally I can't recall ever getting anything I believed to be exciting or useful from it. The loot system is way too random. It's not like I can just save up B.E. and buy what I want. First I have to win the lottery, and then assuming I get lucky I can buy it, if I have enough material saved. The odds of actually getting what you want is rather low... And that's the type of reward we are talking about?\n\nSure it might be argued that something is indeed better than nothing, but if you don't want it or never use it.. what does it matter? Is that even a reward at that point? This is a big part of where I think the black and white comes into play. If someone is genuinely going to feel rewarded, they need to know what they're getting out of it. Getting some keys to open a chest, which might not ever net you anything useful is not exactly knowing what you are getting.\n\nThis is where I think having some type of honor store (with custom honor only skins, wards, emotes, etc) would really help.\n\nMaybe give players a daily one time login reward of \"Honor Points\", like I mentioned above (instead of keys), with scaling amounts based on which honor level that player was. Then depending on your honor level, those can be used to obtain different things from an Honor Shop. Maybe level 3, you unlock 1 purchase a month and it can be a Summoner Icon or Emote. At level 4 you can buy 2 things and you unlock Ward Skins, At level 5, 3 things and you unlock Champion skins. \n\nSomething like that is a whole lot cleaner and straight forward than just giving keys occasionally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-05-11T18:28:54.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, i feel like riot should really make a big public posting more accurately describing the current honor/capsule/chest/key system, as its been changed a good bit in a relatively short time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CubanThund3r","date":"2018-05-13T06:12:07.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"isn't that the point of being honorable.. if being a good player was all it took all challengers would instantly have 5 honors. sure you probably meant an honorable person. but so what if you're convincing people to honor you as long as you're not asking for honors?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-05-13T23:23:34.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Ekko NA,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KEE3J2xR,comment-id=0002000000010000,timestamp=2018-05-11T17:16:12.593+0000)\n>\n> I just believe it should be more black and white honestly.

I think I want to add: this suggests that something external--some early lesson, some positive attitude, something *other than the program*--is essential to the addict's success/failure.\n\nI don't mean to remove personal responsibility from the equation. But on the other hand, whenever we discuss the *statistics of a behavior*, we're already doing that implicitly. We're talking about the effects of a system on itself, not of individuals on themselves.\n\n**Edit**: I think one of the phrases in one of those programs is \"help me change the things I can, and accept the things I can't.\" That's pretty much all I mean to say here: addicts can change what they can, but that's constrained, to an extent, by the fact of being an addict.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-05-11T16:39:37.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Very poor comparison considering AA, rehab, and hospitals don't reward you for getting better.

You do get rewarded already if you don't flame, troll etc. But people started doing after the honor system came out, so they were already at fault on their own.\n3. players are given multiple chances to look at them selves, do a self evaluation and TRY to understand the problem, barely any of them try to.
