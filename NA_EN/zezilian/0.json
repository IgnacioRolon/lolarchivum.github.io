He has the tools to pressure waves and to poke, but these come at a hefty cooldown cost and remove his only mobility and cc for 24 seconds.\n\nAfter early laning phase is over and both champions have backed, Zed will return with a Dirk, and the enemy with a Seeker's.\n\nThis is where it gets worse. Seeker's is a crazily gold efficient item. Although buying it means the enemy mid laner is delaying their other core items like Lost Chapter, it essentially completely denies any threat of Zed's all in. After that point, all a Zed can do is try to hit all his abilities during short trades, while hoping he can dodge all of the enemy's. He has a small opportunity to roam before the enemy buys a Lost Chapter on their 2nd back, but if this opportunity is missed then the champion is relegated to afk farming sidelanes, hoping the enemy top laner is behind enough for him to win a duel to get back into the game.\n\nZed can be very oppressive when ahead, but it's extremely difficult for him to actually get ahead without the enemy disrespecting him or making constant, major mistakes.\n\nI can't say for sure whether Zed being viable is a healthy thing for the game, but considering Zoe and Yasuo are both even better, I can't imagine Riot has much problem with Zed anymore.\n\nFortunately the changes actually nerf him just slightly in low elo, where he's doing fine, and are a sizable buff in higher elos, where he was struggling.

Also, you are going to kill someone with ult before the game ends. 6/15/30 is a game without a nice person to reap AD. Ult used to give 5 + (5/10/15% of opponents AD.)","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-02-22T02:06:54.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"lol, your math is extremely flawed. Like i said, \"chance\" to get alot of AD IF he is 6+, AND IF he ult kills an ADC AND that ADC has alot of AD. That's alot of \"ifs\" and \"ands\" in order to have access to that AD.\n\nhe has to KILL with his ult, he has to have his ult, and he has to get a descent amount of AD, yea sure its nice when he is ahead snowballing, is killing people with his ult, but at that point he is already ahead, so the extra AD is pointless. Now even if he is behind he does MORE damage than before and no longer needs to kill with his ult to deal practically the same amount of damage. THAT is what you are not thinking about/including.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"iiRebs","date":"2019-02-22T04:40:05.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is a flaw in that math? It is all pre mitigation/pen and runes. He does not need to kill a champion with a lot of AD at level 11. It does not even matter if it is an ADC. A mage will have ~80 AD at level 11, killing them alone will give him 5+8=13 AD. Anyone who actually plays Zed, knows 15 AD is an extremely common reap past level 11. Your argument of if he/his team can kill someone while they are marked is also awful. He will kill someone with ult during the game. There is no if he can or not, a good Zed will use his ult to kill someone atleast 1 time in your game.\n\nP.S. Adding a bunch of bullshit extra if and and statements to make it sound like he needs a lot of conditions to be met is terrible arguementation. The only if statement you need is simple. If Zed can kill anyone with his ult, then he will get bonus ad.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spooky Skeleton","date":"2019-02-21T15:58:10.651+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Shhh dont say anything about assassins, you might anger assassin mains and you dont want them typing angrily at you while waving their walmart katana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-02-21T12:14:04.175+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"Because he lost his “free” AD finally once and for all.\n\nCompensation buffing his Shurikens makes him more skillshot reliant and the recast range of his W is more flexbility without improving his engage range.\n\nReally a net nerf tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-02-21T10:31:46.476+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":6,"body":"Because against people who actually know how to play around him he was a bad champion.","replies":[]}]}
