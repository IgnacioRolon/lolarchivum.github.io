That was the first thing i wanted to say, the second being i don't talk in my games, i do not go into the games with an attitude or go in LOOKING for problems. The games where i do alot of typing is if i am questioning something i am witnessing during match that doesn't sit well with my eyes. I was currently playing gold elo, you know these matches get heated so why is the punishment so severe for this shit? the curses, the remarks, this language surrounds people 247 were ever people co exist. You can never eliminate toxicity and you also cannot try to tell me switch my behavior if i go into these matches with a clean fresh slate to begin with. Something simply happens that i would be believe to be bs or unfair not just me dying but that actual ludicrousness behind the events that LEADS to my death for an example. Otherwise i shut my yap and i commuinutcate thru pings if im gold , that should let you know as a PLAYER im just trying to win and get into higher elo to get BETTER i do not look for problems. \n\nI bought skins on this account, i have elemental lux on this account.\nIt takes very loooong time to get to lvl 30 \nAnd if banned players are simply allowed to make new accounts, what lesson are you trying to teach here? it leads unto a never ending pattern.

If you can't interact with others without forcing them to mute you then you're doing something wrong. Besides, choosing to type and press Enter/Send is still technically an ACTION you're choosing to take. You don't have to type out or even send your insulting and hate filled messages, but if you do then remember you chose to do so.\n\nYes we're not face to face but we're still interacting with real people, and anonymity is no reason or excuse to ignore all common sense and basic human decency. If you don't like being held accountable for your behavior online too bad, you can either suck it up and deal with it or just stick to single-player games/content.\n\nP.S.

Its all the same to me. Comparing someone to waste is just as bad as calling them a slur. Youre technically calling them inhuman, garbage. How could it be worse? \n\nHumans react to insults, thats why humans use insults in the first place. Unfortunately, some people actually quit the game due to these insults. Its happened so often, that riot made rrules against it to deter people from doing it. So now we have this system. Its not a moral lesson.
