It leaves your jungler open to take dragon or safely gank other lanes. It also relieves pressure on the other lanes when the enemy jg is focusing on you. The best think you can do is adapt, ward, and try not to die so that you can just waste his time and get more value of the situation.\n\nTry to ward river around the 3 minute mark. The deeper, the better. Also, getting an early pink is definitely worth the investment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"18 NAKED COWB0YS","date":"2016-10-16T05:57:43.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats p much top lane for you\n\nwelcome to my lane :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2016-10-16T05:58:46.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You sound like the people who remind me constantly to mute all of my allies.
