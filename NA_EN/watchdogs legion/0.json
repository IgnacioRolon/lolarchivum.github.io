Avoid making others feel that same way and report the ones who do.\n\n**People do have bad games, but is it really fair for someone to encounter 7 shit player who happen to just have to have their bad game with you? Not to say 7 time? I can't go 20 - 0  game straight and lose em all if my shit team doesn't know wtf to do right?**\n---------------\nPlay as a team, win as a team! -\nA coordinated team is extremely difficult to take down. No matter how hard you feel like you’re carrying individually, blaming others and refusing to co-operate with teammates gives your opponent an advantage.\n\n**Yeah you tell that to that {{champion:157}} and that {{champion:27}} who are 0 - 10 but refusing to listen, yet can't stop inting.\nWhat a Team Game this is, when everyone does their own shit, even the trashes player on the team** \n------------------\nMake allies on the Rift. -\nYou win some, you lose some. Meanwhile, why not send a friend invite to anybody you particularly enjoyed having on your team? Taking allies into battle will help you win more games and make even the losses more enjoyable.\n\n**Ok let's be honest here. How many of you have added people thru playing the game? No one? Yeah exactly. \nAin't nobody is going to friend someone else in their game. I mean ofc these feeder that just added me would want to friend me but on the other side I ain't going to add shitters. **\n-------------------\nNever feed intentionally and don’t give up the fight! - \nSeeking revenge on your own team by intentionally feeding and helping the opposing team does not promote fair play. Keep a cool head if you fall behind, don’t give up and always do your best.\n\n**Riot can't even distinguish the different between inting and just dying in bad fights. Otherwise there wouldn't be so much Yasuo players on the rift.**\n---------------------\nLead the way for newbies, be helpful. -\nNever forget the excitement you felt when you first set foot on the Rift. Don’t mock newbies who are still learning the ropes or urge them to give up on League. Instead offer a hand when they stumble.\n\n**Yes let's try to help these Noobs by putting them in elo they don't fucking belong in. Thanks Riot, putting a trash Silver in my Diamond elo just cus yo dumbass love queing players off MMR than actual Ranked.**\n----------------------\nKeep your account information private. -\nSharing your account information with a friend can cause your account to be stolen for good or draw a ban for negative behaviour you didn’t commit. Logging into third-party sites with your League account information also exposes you to risk of account theft.\n\n**No people aren't worry about their account getting stolen, they're just worry RiotGames will catch them getting boosted by booster**","replies":[]}
