Riot is only treating your online interactions as if they were done in person. If you speak negatively to lots of people, you will face negative social consequences. You will basically surround yourself with people who think like you and behave like you and people who don't think like you and don't behave like you will be in another group.\n\nThis is how the punishments work. They give you a chance to reform but in the end if you cannot be like minded with the majority of the community, you will be permabanned and so you will no longer be in the group that doesn't behave and talk like you.\n\n> This clearly makes no sense what so ever to any rational person who understands simple fairness. It is hypocritical to fill the game with &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; content and then punish players for &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; behavior.  \n> \n\nWhat toxic content is Riot introducing to players?\n\n> You need to punish people for what they do, rather than what they say: \n> \n> Verbal abuse has an easy solution - the mute button. But refusing to help your allies in a team game results in that game being destroyed - that has no solution. \n> \n\nThe purpose of the mute button is to shield someone from further verbal abuse. It's not meant as a justification for someone to verbally abuse another person.\n\nRefusing to help allies in a team game gets people permabanned too. It's called being permabanned for trolling or AFKing or inting.... Player behavior does look at this and does punish it.\n\n> Therefore it is those type of game destroying actions that should be punished, not what is typed in the chat box. There is no mute button that can force an ally to stop farming minions during a team fight. \n> \n\nAgain, just because you can prevent further abuse does not justify it happening. \n\n> The current punishment is basically going after the symptom, rather than the cause. If you remove the cause, most of the symptom would disappear on their own. By punishing people for destroying games, you would remove the feeling of helplessness players feel when their allies refuse to help, and therefore those players would not feel desperate enough to say mean things in chat.\n\nI disagree because if they only wanted to go after the symptom, they would only leave the mute button and never punish for verbal abuse. \n\nIf they punish people for verbal abuse, they're telling that person to not verbally abuse people anymore. \n\nIf you're frustrated that people seem to be punished more frequently for verbal abuse than for trolling, you should understand that trolling has evolved quite a bit. It used to be super easy to detect. Run down a lane, die, go afk, stand still in the middle of enemies, etc...\n\nWhen Riot watched replays and saw those tell tale signs, they would get punished quickly. So the trolls have decided to make it harder to detect by buying items and moving so that leave buster doesn't hit them. They changed to auto attack enemies but didn't use abilities. When Riot started giving plays a harder look, they once again upped their stealth trolling.\n\nThey went to now using abilities but putting themselves in a guaranteed bad situation to die. They went to farming the jungle and not ganking. They went to using skills late or intentional bad skill shots or bad positioning.\n\nTrolling is getting harder to detect because people are putting more effort into concealing it.\n\nI've played league for a long time and I understand your frustration. I hate trolls so much because they ruin any fun that could be had in a game. But, I have to say that there are fewer games with trolls now than when I first started playing. \n\nI know this is anecdotal evidence, but from my experience, I feel like they're doing something right, albeit slowly...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2018-03-27T18:57:05.797+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your point about the game rating is completely irrelevant. there is a difference between the game having sexual suggestions and people being assholes in chat.\n\nI'm pretty sure the rest of the post is a complaint towards split pushing..and either way, no one is going to be the perfect player and do everything right all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2018-03-27T19:22:18.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rating doesn't allow you to be a dick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-03-27T18:53:22.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, there are right plays and bad plays.

There aren't that many trolls in game, but there are tonnes of people with different skill levels and different perspective on how the game should be played.\n\nYou can punish the true trolls that are out there to ruin games, but you can't punish people for having a different opinion on how the game should be played.\n\nIf one raging at the \"false trolls\", then that player is the source of the toxicity, and Riot aren't punishing the symptoms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-27T20:09:46.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it seems perfect for teens and young adults, especially males.\n\nAll incredibly full of themselves and too young to realize that uncontrolled, irresponsible or disrespectful behavior has consequences.\n\nI think a two-week ban from league is better than a two weak ban from real life, best for them to figure it out the easy way.\n\nEspecially when permbans get involved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2018-03-27T19:36:27.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your name doesn't do you justice bro.
