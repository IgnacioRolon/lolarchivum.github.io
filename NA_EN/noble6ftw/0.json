When we try to queue we wait the five minutes and when the queue finally pops we both accept. But then someone doesn't accept and the queue pops a second time right after the first queue. For some special reason the updated client decides to keep me from seeing the second pop, disabling me from accepting, and then after so many tries of waiting and popping the queue, Leaver Buster tells me I've denied too many queues and gave me a timer as well. Who can tell me this is okay, but more importantly who will tell me this will be fixed ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T05:32:33.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen while you're using the *Legacy Client* as well?
