I always considered playing league for years, but only just recently did I decide to actually jump in to give it a try. What I was met with was an ocean of smurfs, as a result of their countless bans on other accounts, completely ruining the experience of literally every single new player they encounter. \n\nAfter playing a decent amount of AI games, and getting the hang of the general mechanics on a couple of champions, I started playing pvp. With my prior experience with other mobas, I was able to do quite well for myself in the first few games just from pure mechanical skill without having any game knowledge whatsoever, but I knew that wouldn&#039;t last and I wanted to improve my awareness on the map and learn various things like how to jungle properly, when to kill dragon/baron, etc. Occasionally someone would make calls, and while I still didn&#039;t know a lot of the terms they were using, I&#039;d try to adapt and help out where I could, when I could. I was checking out a lot of the different champions and their abilities, watching some videos here and there, and even admiring some of the skins that I might possibly buy soon for the champs I was enjoying the most. All in all, I was having a pretty good time.\n\nBut suddenly I hit a wall. All at once it seemed like I was being bombarded every single game with smurf accounts on both teams who were completely roflstomping by themselves, and/or flaming other new players for their lack of ability/knowledge. Keep in mind this is around level 2-10, and these people are expecting god level game sense and ability, from BRAND new players, with zero comments on what they could do better, just a wave of things like: &quot;ARE YOU FKING RETARDED?&quot;  &quot;REPORT ______ FOR ______&quot;  &quot;YOU FUCKING SUCK (insert racial/homophobic/etc slur here)&quot;  Some of them weren&#039;t even very good, but still continued to flame and rage at the friendly and enemy team constantly, rage quitting games, afking, intentionally dying, spamming pings and racial slurs, etc.\n\nAll the while, I was just trying to learn the game the best I could so that I could improve, and I kept telling myself: &quot;Maybe if I just keep adapting and getting better I can eventually get away from these people and start having fun again&quot; and kept trying to improve. But it just continued to get worse. I have absolutely no problem losing, especially when I&#039;m still trying to learn, but when I&#039;m getting completely blown out and flamed CONSTANTLY, it starts to get a little frustrating. Even the games where my team is winning by a considerable margin, they still find things to talk shit about everyone else on the team. A lot of the time there&#039;s literally just two different smurfs on a team who are actually ignoring the rest of the team, but nothing but screaming at each other the entire game. At some point a line has to be drawn. I have enough stress in my daily life as it is, and I don&#039;t need to add more to it because a bunch of man-children get their accounts banned and have to start over again repeatedly with zero consequences.\n\nSo as it stands, there is absolutely nothing about this game that is compelling enough to convince me to continue spending my time on it while this continues. Every single game is just as bad, if not worse, than the last. There are consistently 3 or more people MINIMUM completely ruining EVERY game for everyone else who is actually trying to improve or just play the game. It&#039;s clear to me that this isn&#039;t going to stop any time soon, and I don&#039;t have the patience or the desire to continue playing because of it.\n\nI&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the first person to make a topic like this, nor will I be the last. But hopefully Riot will eventually pay attention to topics like this and realize that the influx of new players is going to continue to decline, and possibly even stop, if they don&#039;t do something about this. The report system works great, and consistently penalizes offenders, but the fact that literally every account can just be thrown away to make another one in seconds, even using the SAME email that a previously banned account was made under, is completely ridiculous, and needs to stop.\n\n/end wall of text\n","replies":[]}
