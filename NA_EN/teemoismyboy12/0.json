Im not here to complain and ask that I get unbanned, because I get that int feeding in ranked gets you whacked right there. whatever. I just want to know why its ok for people to antagonize and purposely try to get a rise out of someone and then go completely unpunished because its one report vs nine.\r\n\r\nStarting in the champ select, I hover aatrox top which is my normal pick. I tab out to go do other things and when I come back to lock in I see my team bans it on purpose and then tells me to &quot;deal with it&quot;. That is literally just as toxic as what I have done yet im the only person who gets hit with anything out of it. Completely ridiculous how nobody gets any sort of suspension for behavior like that, but me getting worked up and antagonized gets me banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Graveh","date":"2017-03-02T05:01:15.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I struggle every day with ADHD and PTSD.  After the two week ban I just started muting chat in games.  In the game cited for my permanent ban, I had picked Garen in champ select (for top) and the MIss Fortune and her duo queue bot on my team didn't like that.  She started spamming kill yourself in the pregame chat and when the game started continued telling me to kill myself repeatedly.  I tried muting her and she was just endlessly spamming pings on me.  So yes I fully admit I unmuted her and started flaming her back - I got triggered and reacted poorly.  But there should be context and understanding in these situations.  It was the first time I'd had any problems since my two week ban was lifted.  What is the point in trying to improve when others are allowed to get away with such things?  Ultimately whether I file the chargeback or not I highly doubt I will be returning to League.  The environment is far too inconsiderate and toxic for someone like myself.  I want to kill myself every day as it is without the constant harassment by others, and when you ask them to stop or lash out back at them you're the one that ends up punished at not them.  I don't intend to continue to support a company that allows this to occur one way or the other.  Then you consider they will unban streamers or other high ELO/profile cases like the support nunu.  It's all very toxic and discriminatory and it starts with the company first.\n\nUltimately I probably will not pursue this nor will I continue to play League.  It's unfortunate because League has been my solace and I've looked to it as such since closed beta, and 99% of the time I have managed with no problems at all.  I'm just hurt and angry, as much with myself as with Riot.  Anyway- sorry to those I've wronged and good luck to the rest of you.  I'll probably get rid of my computer altogether and use this opportunity to learn something new in life.  Thanks for those that discussed things with me today!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-02T05:05:19.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One report does exactly the same thing as nine.
