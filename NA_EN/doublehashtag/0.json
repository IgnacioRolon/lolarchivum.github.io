It happened to me back in 2005 some random dude i'd just played with sent me a link for free \"steam gift card\" or something, and I clicked it thinking \"lets see what this scam is\" since I had the same idea as you back then that links to webpages can't steal account info. I got booted out of my account, and locked out in 3 minutes. Fortunately, Steam support is good about those kinds of problems, and I had my account back in a day.\n\nI still don't know what exactly that link did, but it opened a blank page in my browser, so I initially shrugged it off as spam. Never trusted links from anyone who isn't a long standing friend since.\n\nThat said, I don't really believe this guy,","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-06T21:01:26.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, correction, it can happen - but only if you turn off every form of security in your computer and already have some serious vulnerabilities in your browser, from malware or bad addons.\nIt never _should_ happen.

Just because you've never on a whim clicked a link you knew was a scam for the lolz, like every add about miracle cures etc bs adds on the sides of webpages.\n\nOnly difference was this was a tiny url hiding malicious code, and not an actual dumb ad that leads you to a million surveys for a ps4.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-09T05:04:41.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"URLs cannot contain executable code of any kind.
