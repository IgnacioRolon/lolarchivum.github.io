Click Settings to review them.\"**_\r\n\r\nI clicked OK, and when I entered a game I noticed that all my in-game settings were back to their default. While this is easily fixable, the main issue I noticed was that my set item page wasn't available anymore. Turns out ALL my set items pages have been deleted. \r\n\r\nI checked my second account and received the same message. A friend of mine logged onto my account on his computer, to check if my computer was the issue, and he yet again received the error message. I did not mess with any settings or League folders prior to this, and I was able to play on my account last night without any issues. \r\n\r\nI put a lot of time and effort into my set item pages, so is there any way to retrieve them? Have others experienced this issue, or is this connected to my account specifically? What can I do to avoid this problem in the future?\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T22:55:21.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was done intentionally while our techs look into certain issues!

I haven't touched my league since about 2 weeks (-/+ some days), since I was on vacation. I have left open the client, when I came back I had to restart it due to a client update, so did I and it patched league after the client update. When I logged in I recieved this message and it reset my stuff on my main and on my smurf, multiple times, it is extremely tilting imo. Glad I am not the only one who has to go through this pain, I hope it will get fixed asap. What I have noticed though is, since I took some screenshots before I went on vacation, of my settings (cause I am weird kappa), that some options were not available now, like 'show slows in  Loss of Control UI' or the whole emote things were not there, while they were there before the client update and the patch/es.\n\nBest regards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vRequiem","date":"2017-10-16T19:27:44.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahhhh so much time put into making these item sets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Midori","date":"2017-10-16T19:20:35.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"getting this as well, frustrating. glad im not the only one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swedish","date":"2017-10-16T19:17:57.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me, cost me a game because I had all custom settings and had to fix them on the fly.
