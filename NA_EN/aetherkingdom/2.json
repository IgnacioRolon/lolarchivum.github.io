The damage of his E does not exist. I'll prefer  make a completly new E like the previously showed, It's very fustrating see that ridiculous damage, is like \"nothing\"..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vore Monster","date":"2014-11-24T20:32:55.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Skarner is fine how he is now.
