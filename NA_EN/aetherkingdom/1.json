You told someone to hang themselves and you throw around the Autisim word like its an insult.\n\nYou know what you said is not right and I know that you know that you have displayed toxic behaviour in the chat log alone. And i also know that you very well know that it takes more then a single game of displaying this toxic behaviour to get you banned.\n\nMoving forward you need to learn from this. Autisim is not something you should be throwing around as an insult. Its very rude and its not acceptable in this community which you are a part of. Even worse is telling people to commit suicide as that usually results in a quick ban as you have just discovered.\n\nReform begins with understanding that your attitude towards others is unacceptable.

And yes, I do use autism like an insult, because I consider autistic people ( or any form of mental retardation) or with birth defects to be second class. \n> You know what you said is not right and I know that you know that you have displayed toxic behaviour in the chat log alone.

People love to get to low plat and think they know how to play this game. \n\n> Moving forward you need to learn from this. Autisim is not something you should be throwing around as an insult.
