Simple as that.  I'm not sure where you're coming up with these inane and absurd counter-arguments, because honestly they're extremely weak.  You have yet to counter anything I've pointed out.

YOU think they are ruining it for YOU because you're not doing good in that one game.  So there's still nothing wrong with saying \"it's just a game\" because it's a Video Game.
