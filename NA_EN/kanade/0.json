And a few more but those are just the first few to come to mind. I believe all of this was mentioned in the initial post about the upcoming HUD update but I could be wrong.\n\nWe're used to the current HUD. That doesn't mean there isn't a lot wrong with it though. It can be hard to tell what's wrong because it's not a matter of things not working as intended ('broken'). It's a matter of things being a lot lower quality than they could be ('suboptimal'). I know that makes changing it a lot harder to justify to those who like the old way because it's a matter of degree rather than a yes/no situation, but I feel that in this case it is worth it.\n\nIn situations like this the transition period is the hardest because the initial difficulty of change happens and often you have to deal with having both systems at once which makes adjusting even harder, such as anyone on the PBE is going through right now. I have faith that Riot will make it at least better than the current live HUD by enough that I'll be satisfied after I get used to the new one and I urge you to have that same faith.

It's feedback we can use against other contradictory feedback (such as \"My bot lane partner and I love that the top HUD leaves plenty of space to watch for jungle activity!\")\n\nIn that case, I'll be as specific as I can. I generally like my information being spaced out in different areas of the screen, as the more I look around the screen the more likely I am to actually take note of my surroundings in game. Having everything in the middle/bottom is not only too cluttered to read easily, but it doesn't give me incentive to pay attention to the entire game. As a mid player, I've actually noticed ganks coming in from the sides by accident as I glanced at my score when they come into lane. Without anything being up there, it doesn't provide any extra incentive to be attentive. Additionally, it just makes the screen feel empty.\n\nAnother huge problem is the new stats menu. It feels out of place and too small compared to the old one. Leaving the entire bottom left open instead of gaps along the bottom is basically giving us useless space to play with. Putting it in the corner ensures that it isn't in the way of anything important, but the placement closer to the center blocks a place that I feel is much more commonly needed. I generally use that for checking stats at a glance, and the full menu for less important things in lane such as CDR and penetration. With it being too small for that, I have to focus more on it instead of getting the information I need without giving up my awareness of what's going on. Having the numbers turn green for altered stats is very important for this too.\n\nAs for the minimap, it is already the most important source of information in the game.  Placing score, icons,  and ping directly on it is basically only a distraction when I go to look down there. With the placement of all the information in one portion of the screen, it becomes an information overload. If I go to check the map, then I look at the score and ping, then the champion icons, I'll have spent way more time looking there than I intended to and may even miss out on what's happening around me. Having everything more spread out but in specific groups makes it much easier to find the exact information that I'm looking for while also keeping watch for everything going on. Additionally, the left side of the screen is now barren due to the lack of icons there. That space is nearly worthless in game, and having a portion of the hud there actually made it worth glancing there every now and then. With the update, there is no extra incentive to check that area of the screen.\n\nWith the change, I also noticed that the ability icons act differently. I'm consistently confused as to whether my ability is on cooldown or if I'm out of mana. It may have to do with the  cooldown change looking exactly like abilities that you don't have enough mana for on the live hud. For example, when trying the new gangplank while just farming minions with q in a game on my own, I  would instinctively use  mana potions and flask charges after using an ability due to thinking that I ran out of mana rather than just put the ability on cooldown. In laning, that is a very big problem to have.\n\nItems being on the right is something that I will admit isn't incredibly hard to get used to. It still feels very odd having the shop button in the middle of the screen, though. As the shop window is not generally something you want to open in lane, having it so close to all the other important information seems a little odd. There shouldn't be any reason to have that in a place where a bad misclick would leave you unable to see what is going on around you. Admittedly, the current hud is susceptible to that while rearranging items as well, but it is in a more out of the way location.\n\nI will say that the new scoreboard is great. It's the change that everybody wanted, and works pretty well. The only complaint I could have about it is that it follows the new visual theme, which seems to be a worse match for the map than the live hud. Of course, that's just a personal opinion and doesn't really matter much. Hopefully this is usable feedback for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orisi","date":"2015-07-12T21:53:42.099+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Specific feedback? As someone who's more than a little obsessive about certain things, the alignment of the centre console bothers me constantly, in every picture of it I see, and I can imagine it being the same in-game. The fact that the abilities console is designed with items and stats specifically looking like off-shoots (i.e. not a single contiguous panel but three) and yet the abilities panel hasn't been centred on the screen just feels off-balance to me, and has done since I first saw it. It looks uneven, and has done from the start, and that really puts me off my stride.\n\nTo clarify: I have no problem with the movement of the key elements of the HUD; I was against moving the items at first but I can see the reasoning behind it and support it. But when everything is being placed into bottom-right, top-left or centre-bottom, it just feels imbalanced to have the centre justified incorrectly in comparison to the design. As someone who could previously click abilities without looking at clutch moments (especially for upgrading abilities as a current issue with logitech peripherals is preventing me from binding modifier keys to allow keyboard skill-ups) I feel like with this, a lot of the time I'm going to be clicking wrong, because Im going to keep moving left or right of centre onto the HUD without considering the alignment until its too late.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Synx7","date":"2015-07-13T07:00:02.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryedan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zhI5bE5N,comment-id=0011,timestamp=2015-07-12T21:29:43.797+0000)\n>\n> [I'm a visual designer, not working on the HUD though]\n> \n> Usually, the default response is \"Give it time, you'll get used to it,\" but I think that's a little curt.

It's feedback we can use against other contradictory feedback (such as \"My bot lane partner and I love that the top HUD leaves plenty of space to watch for jungle activity!\")\n\nAlright here is some specific feedback. There wasn't a problem with the HUD blocking vision, that isn't a thing. It's layout had flow to it, you could easily see whatever information you wanted with NO EFFORT whatsoever. This HUD indirectly blinds you from the entire screen. How? If I want to check some information, it is beside a ton of other things that attract my eyes because I am looking for something. I actually HAVE TO SEARCH for something. Even though I have the layout memorized, everything is located by a bunch of other unrelated things.\n\nThe new HUD creates the non-existant problem you were trying to solve. It makes 0 sense. This is why people wanted all their buffs moved to the center of the screen. Here is some examples, comparing the two and the thought process\n\nOLD\n\n-\"Whats the status on my allied champions\" \"I'll just look to the left side of the screen\" \"His health is at half and his ult is up, he has no mana because he is Garen\"\n\n-\"Time for my routine map check\" \"I'll just look to the bottom right corner\" \"Alright, jungler is top, our bot is pushing, I can go dragon\"\n\n-\"What are my stats?\" \"I'll just look to the bottom left\" \"Ahh those are my stats, and there are the items that give me those, right there beside it\"\n\n-\"Who is dead right now\" \"I'll just hit tab\" \"Enemy Vi and Xerath are down, we can get some stuff done easily\"\n\nNEW\n\n-\"Whats the status on my allied champions\" \"I'll look to the right\" \"That's the score\" \"Map\" \"Ahh there they are\" \"Is that Sona on my team or their team? Its Grey\" \"I'll just hit tab\" \"What half of this HUD is my team on?\" \"I'm playing Udyr\" \"Oh, there I am\" \"That Sona is on the enemy team, shes up now though\"\n\n-\"Time for my routine map check\" \"I'll look to the bottom right corner\" \"There are those camera options\" \"That's the scoreboard\" \"Check out that pile of gray champion portraits, I wonder which ones are mine\" \"Everybody seems to be dead, I'll push lanes\"\n\n-\"What are my stats?\" \"Bottom of the screen\" \"Those are my buffs\" \"Thats my health and mana\" \"My exp bar\" \"Hey, thats the champion I'm playing as\" \"There is that little button down there\" \"Ah, the tab\" \"Now which one is my damage?\" \"Im just gonna mouse over to check\" \"Ohh there it is\" \"I'll just close that box up\" \"What items do I have for that damage?\" \"There's me again\" \"My exp bar is purple\" \"There's my health and mana\" \"Ahh there is my inventory\" \"Why is my recall spell over here?\"\n\n-\"Who is dead right now?\" \"I'll look to the right\" \"That's the score\" \"That's the map\" \"Ahh there are the champions\" \"Those 3 are dead\" \"Are any of those on my team\" \"I'll hit tab\" \"What side am I on\" \"I'll just look for Udyr\" \"I'm still not seeing him\" \"There I am\" \"One of my teammates is dead\"\n\nThis is supposed to be an improvement. I am completely missing it. \"My bot lane partner and I love that the top HUD leaves plenty of space to watch for jungle activity!\". This isn't an issue. It really isn't. Even if there are some people that get a little bothered by it, its WAY better than being completely blinded by the fact that you always have to focus at the bottom of the screen.\n\nJust give us the old one back.

Being able to immediately and easily see my allies' health/mana bars and ult indicator is imperative to my success. The goal of the new HUD was to aid in readability? It directly inhibits that, and NOT because it's new.\n\nI'm pro-change when change is positive. This, in my mind, has only hindered readability in many aspects, the aforementioned being the most critical in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kapkin","date":"2015-07-25T22:21:15.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll give it a try. \n1- Xp bar\nOk so first, the main thing i really don't like about the hud is the XP bar. Making it in round wasn't the best call in my opinion. Being a main support, it makes it difficult to know when to engage lvl2 or to knows when i,ll be lvl'ing up. I think the color also don't help. THe old yellow was really catchy to the eye, the XP bar is now purple over black two color that for me don't stand out as much as the old yellow gold vs dark.\n\n\n2- Shop\nI understand that we might not be use to click shop on the right instead of the left, but i agree, putting everything on the right seems kinda weird to me, i do feel like am constantly looking at the right side of the screen, and never on my left side.  Then once you clicked it and are actually in the shop, things goes worst.  I have no idea why the shop sound has been change. Sound in game are a very important thing, it make you more efficient in every game, (footstep in shooters for example) the old shop sound was clear and loud, we could click the number of pots we want and the sound would tell us if we bought the right amount. now the sound is so low (and weird, bard meeps {{champion:432}} ? ) that you actually have to buy then look at your item to confirm that you bought the right amount. (i understand that people might be like oh well just know how much time you clicked) but things arent that simple. sometimes you are in a rush to buy and have to press everything super quick, sound really helped. witch is not the case anymore. I could also make my shop shound highter. but shop sound is now merge with gankplanks {{champion:41}} commentators and gawd this guy talks alot in game... so this inst a viable option either.\n\n3- Cooldown\nI dont think items on cooldown should all have the same icoon. Its very hard to deal with asa support when your having like 4 activating items to knows witch item is witch and whats the cooldown timer on those. Same things with the trinket items. I really miss the grey. Now i really have to remember where i put witch item cause if i dont, i just have to wait for the cooldown to end to actually know what item it is. This affect the gameplay in many ways. For example, lets say we just losed a team fight, then we regroup and try to counter baron, there is no way for me to know quickly when my mikael {{item:3222}} will be up since my solaris {{item:3190}} is also on cooldown. The cooldown icoon should not hide your item icoon. Items activation and cooldown should be very easy to see cause you need to know in a matter of 1/2 second if you can or not use them and when . (and also it helps to know witch item is witch.. =_=)\n\nIn conclusion, i think what Riot should have done is actually kept the old Hud till they figure out a way to make us move the diffrent part of it as we want (kinda like the new tab systeme where you can switch information all around the place) with a costom hud i dont see why people would still be mad about the new hud. \n\nAlso , i though the majority of the player were mad about this new hud, i was surprise reading the comments saying that the majority was ok with it. All my friends feel like this hud is worst that the old one and actually makes us play the game worst.\n\nOn a side note, i love the new map design and how you can see death timer without clicking tab.\nIf you guys really need to make the hud smaller and compact why don't you remove the picture of the character ? \nI'm pretty sure no one forget witch character he's playing while ingame. I dont see any use for it, \n\nThx for reading, and hopefully this will help and things will change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Septimus","date":"2015-07-25T02:51:51.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for me it's hard for me to get used to the new hud because of how all the information is squished into the bottom right, i can't focus on lane while trying to search through each tiny box right beside each other looking for the information i need, like which item is on what key or the map or the skill cooldowns.\n\nI feel as if the skills and the item slots had switched spots it would be easier for me to differentiate between all the boxes. \n\ntldr: its just too much in all in one space, how read?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aniion","date":"2015-07-22T16:18:27.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing that I think definitely needs to at least be addressed by Riot, if not even changed, is that the FAQ is lying.
