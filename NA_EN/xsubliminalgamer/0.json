I'd recommend making a post on the [**Bug Tracker**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) so we can keep an eye on this. For now, I'd recommend hopping back into the Legacy Client to see if the chat filter functions properly for you there.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/215576628/Launch-Legacy-Client.jpg\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T23:58:01.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the second report on this, and my thinking is that it would be due to the updated client.
