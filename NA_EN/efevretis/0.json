I just played a game where I had 22 ping, and it kept going up and down from 22 to 26, to 31, back to 24, up to 25, down to 22, up to 26, and so on and so forth, and it felt like I was playing with so much packet loss, it felt like I was playing with 100 ping. \n\nIs there anything Riot can do about this particular server?\n\nI know for a fact it's hurting other players to, as I watch twitch streamers with the same issue, but it goes unnoticed, there ping does the exact same thing.\nThe covered black is where my IP is, no you can't have it\n\nI posted this on Reddit as well, I hope it gains some traction\n\nEdit: I have also found out that hop number 3 is an issue as well, as it to is causing lag, see pictures below\n\nhttps://imgur.com/xppNiKP\n\nhttps://imgur.com/hvZiqsc\n\nhttps://imgur.com/hT5L1mz\n\nEvery other hop, 1,2,4,6,8, are all constant, except for 3 and 5\n\nEdit 2: ..... now number 2 and number 4 are also causing spikes in latency, I AM NOW GOING TO STICK WITH ONLY HOPS 1, 6 AND 8 BEING CONSTANT, ALL THE REST ARE SHITTING THEMSELVES AT RANDOM TIMES\n\nhttps://imgur.com/likbrOg\n\nhttps://imgur.com/moTWtqi\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7xz9q1/one_of_the_servers_riot_uses_for_traffic_is/","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2018-02-16T18:53:49.495+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Efevretis,\n\nThanks for reaching out regarding this. When there are network jitters and stuff that might be on Riot Direct's network, I try to check it out with the Riot Direct Team to make sure something isn't happening under the radar. Looking at the tracerts you've provided though, I think it tells a different story. For instance hop 5 (68.87.189.153) is still within Comcast's realm of influence. In fact, it's not even until hop 8 that it reaches Riot Direct at 104.160.131.1.\n\nI'd definitely ping Comcast about it with the tracerts you have as there may be some disruptions going on. It could be a maintenance or disruptions and they had to reroute temporarily, something flying under their radar which they're unaware of, or just a hiccup within their network (depending on how long this has been affecting you and the Twitch streamers).\n\nIf you think that's not the case, feel free to hit up my colleagues through the Support Site so we can take a further look into your logs and stuff. We'll be happy to help as much as we can so you can enjoy the game without latency issues.","replies":[{"poster":"efevretis","date":"2018-02-17T01:04:47.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would I go about sending you things through the support site?
