Is it bugged? or it's just that i can't level up to honor level 1 anymore?\n\nedit*: haven't had any other penalties besides queue time dodges , if that counts not anything serious like 20 minutes queue , just 5 min queue , sometimes 15 in rare occasions","replies":[{"poster":"Sauvagess","date":"2017-10-24T01:08:53.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They refuse to tell you that.

It does look like even though you haven't gotten any punishments recently, certain rather negative chat logs are still being holding some weight.","replies":[{"poster":"Theudosius","date":"2017-10-18T14:58:00.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the reply , i have an additional question\n\nare you allowed to tell me if i'm close to leveling up in honor or not? if yes , could you please tell me if i'm close to leveling up , i'm midway trough , or not even close?","replies":[]}]}]}
