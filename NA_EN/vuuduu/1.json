There could be any number of reasons he choses not to buy skins.\n\nWhile we can say \"Faker isn't supporting LoL\", that's actually the most incorrect assumption one can make. LCS itself is a net loss for Riot, but it is used to advertise and draw in players. I'd say Faker draws in far more players than $2000 worth.","replies":[{"poster":"Vuuduu","date":"2015-11-15T12:54:18.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree with what you're saying I didn't say \"Faker isn't supporting LoL\": what I mean is that in some way he _could_ be setting a precedent, which is more of an ironic point of interest, rather than an absolute statement about whether or not Faker is a benefit to Riot. \n\nIt's just kind of funny, isn't it? :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JARmates","date":"2015-11-15T00:14:06.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeizalt,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=95OuE0al,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-14T23:38:37.861+0000)\n>\n> I find it ironic that LoL makes it&#039;s money from selling champion skins, but the game&#039;s most famous player (Faker) doesn&#039;t use them.

If he was a pro in Season 1, then I would have heard of him.  I only remember Elementz, Hotshotgg, and a few other but never heard of faker.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-15T00:28:46.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Faker is the main mid-laner for SKT (2-time winning team at worlds) and arguably the best League player out there.","replies":[{"poster":"CPU BIanc","date":"2015-11-15T00:46:45.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=95OuE0al,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-11-15T00:28:46.521+0000)\n>\n> Faker is the main mid-laner for SKT (2-time winning team at worlds) and arguably the best League player out there.\n\narguably","replies":[{"poster":"Vuuduu","date":"2015-11-15T03:09:28.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is better?
