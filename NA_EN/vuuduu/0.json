That means I should fight if I see another champion right? Yes. Yes yes yes.\r\n\r\nI'm in enemy jung with no vision and cant see any other enemy champions on the map except one in front of me. I will fight that champion. I will fight. I'm a champion after all, and champions are winners. I am THE champion.\r\n\r\nMe see. Me fight. Yes, me do fight. Me fight very good.\r\n\r\nBecause if our team is behind I need to try to get a shutdown 1v1 on a champion that is 3 levels ahead of me and $2500 gold up right? That's a good plan.\r\n\r\nMe see. Me fight. Me see--------------------- Me fight. Yes, me fight very good.\r\n\r\nWhat's a minion? I see champion, me fight that instead.\r\n\r\nWhat's a lane? I see champion, me fight.\r\n\r\nWhat's a ward? Don't need wards when me can see champions right in front of me. Me fight that champeeun.\r\n\r\nMe see. Me fight.\r\n\r\nWhen me see and me don't fight we lose game, so I may as well see and fight to increase chances. Yes, me in Gold. Me high elo. You no come to fight when me see and fight. You bad.\r\n\r\nWhy are you clearing waves when you could be seeing and fighting. You no come when I'm inting. When I int and you don't come, it's your fault. After all:\r\n\r\nMe see. Me fight.\r\n\r\nMe see. Me fight.\r\n\r\nMe see----------------------------- Me. Me fight.\r\n\r\nWhy are you managing waves. You see a champeeun, you fight that champeeun. \r\n\r\nThis is how we win games, by seeing and fighting.\r\n\r\nMay Nasus live forever and ride in peace. Amen.\r\n\r\nSee. Fight. See. Fight. See.

If no one else sees or fights, who is going to do the seeing and fighting?\r\n\r\nI. I will fight. I will see. And I will fight. With my champeeun powers. My champion has abilities. That means, I can fight. And when I see, well then. Then, I fight. I fight to win. I fight for my team. I fight because I care. I fight, because I know that fighting is the way to win. Always. Always. Always.\r\n\r\nAnd I told my team if they don't come when I fight, then we lose. So my seeing and fighting is the solution, and they don't see that.\r\n\r\nMe see. Me fight.\r\n\r\nHur. Dur. Hur dur hur. Hur hur dur hur hur hur. Hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\r\n\r\nSee.
