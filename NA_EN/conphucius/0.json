I'd check your volume options first, but after that let's go ahead and do a quick config reset to see if that helps. Follow these steps, and if that doesn't help we can dive a little further.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Conphucius","date":"2017-09-07T05:14:29.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have followed exactly this and the good news is sound is back\n\nhowever, now left mouse click is completely unresponsive ...\n\n(have tried deleting input.ini in the same way as above, and also to manually change the file (for some reason it is set to shift left mouse and every time i try to change this it defaults back to shift left) to no avail)\n\nedit: i think i have fixed it, required manually chaning persistedsetting.json (that seems to be where everything was shift-click bound) o.O\n\nedit 2: scrap that, now i have the keybinding sorted, the champion select quotes seem to be missing again, but only on the auto lock in on an aram game, they were there before the weekend, now whenever i enter an aram lobby all i hear is music and NOTHING else, where before as soon as i hit accept i would tab out, and listen to the quote to know who i was playing, now i cant seem to do that..... (in game sound seems to be  fine now)\n\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}
