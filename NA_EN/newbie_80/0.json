That is an opinion. Not a fact.\n\nRiot hasn't released a \"You must build this on Tryndamere\" list at any point in time so saying what Tryndamere does or doesn't need is all opinion.\n\n> Of course the stats are worse look at the old IE and then think what you are talking about.\n\nI don't think you're listening to what I said.\n\n1. It gives the same amount of AD so you don't lose out on anything.\n\n2. Old IE gave a flat 20% crit chance meaning you'd only go to 55%. New IE doubles crit chance meaning you'll go to 70%. That's way better.\n\n3. Yeah the true damage is kinda bad but it's better than nothing.\n\n> Since bruisers were revived when conqueror got released people finally quitted playing tanks they are played a lot less obviously the noone is an exaggeration.\n\nI'd still like to see some proof.\n\n> He trully was at 46% and he still is on OP.GG an actual legit site xD!!\n\nChampion.gg and OP.GG is made by the same people.\n\nBesides, you haven't actually provided a link to where it says his winrate so unless you can do that, I'm going to disregard it.\n\n(By the way, Tryndamere has actually climbed to a almost 51% winrate now.
