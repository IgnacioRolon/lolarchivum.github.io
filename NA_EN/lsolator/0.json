When I have picked up a quadra and have to choose between chasing an enemy for the 5th kill or ending the game, I&#039;d choose to end the game every time. However, some people need to chase that kill because it would be the end of the world if they weren&#039;t to get it. That frustrates the hell out of me. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I don&#039;t understand why so many people get upset when they lose a Penta. For instance, it gets stolen. They completely freak out and most of the time go afk and troll just because they didn&#039;t receive their super important Penta that will make them feel better about their low rank and skill. I mean, I never see any high elo players get upset about losing a Penta. It might be because they&#039;ve earned many already but also because they are HUMBLE, unlike many brats I&#039;ve been playing with.","replies":[]}
