Is your friend from a different region?  RP Cards are specific to their own region, so that could be a possibility.  In any case, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our Billing team can look into this with you to see what's going on and offer options. You may need to get some screenshots handy, in your ticket.   We'll see you there!","replies":[]}]}
