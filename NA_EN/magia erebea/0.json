The problem is that I only play Normals, thus my 350 or so wins in Draft places me up against players (often Diamonds, but usually Platinums with some Golds mixed in) with Draft wins in the thousands. I can compete against them as a support, but in other roles my experience and mechanics are almost on new player levels. I see that against these players, I will not be able to learn another role. I accept that I am wrong for wanting to branch out and try a new role, and for that Riot, I apologize.","replies":[{"poster":"F0XFIRE","date":"2016-12-16T08:58:29.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the suggestion here is perhaps in the future Riot can implement some kind of \"Role ranking\" system so that a Supp main who wants to try playing top doesn't get totally demolished by a Top main.\n\nBut that's just too much effort. Just be prepared to get flamed in normals. If people can't handle you being new to a role then that's their problem. Report them for poor sportsmanship. Honestly the best way to learn a new role is to play with some friends that can help walk you through the new role. Fewer flames involved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-12-16T07:58:26.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why the passive aggressiveness, what exactly do you expect Riot to do about it? Just practice on normals until you get good at those roles, it doesn't matter how often you lose there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-12-16T05:46:43.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"??
