This is just my stupid rant in response to a stupid situation. Nobody has to care about it I just want to get this off my chest. Game started up, our adc was disconnected, I thought we would just remake. Our jungler speaks up and says she was just having internet trouble and would load in, and convinces our teammates to deny the remake vote when it comes up. I still wanted to remake, and said what we were doing was a stupid leap of faith. But whatever I pressed on because I believed they were duo partners or something and she new her duo would be back on soon. The ADC doesn&#039;t come back for 23 minutes. We had a 4v5 till then, somehow we managed to do well in but we were still getting outclassed as it was a 4v5. Caitlyn comes back and we have the hopes of winning. Obviously that doesn&#039;t happen as our adc was level 12 in level 15-18  teamfights and I had to sell my support items to try and salvage the situation by building tanky. End of the game comes along and I tell shyvana that it is her fault for losing, and what she did was incredibly stupid. Why would you risk a game to save your Duo&#039;s Back? I thought it was kinda selfish. I became flabbergasted when I learned it wasn&#039;t her duo and the afk was just another rando. Shyvana had NO idea if she was coming back, but still insisted it would happen and that everything would be fine for no reason. I dropped an F-bomb and said now that was incredibly  braindead and stupid. Then I call her an idiot for trying this. I was abrasive but I thought I was being reasonable for being angry with her putting the entire ranked game on chance itself. What I said above was no the reason for this rant. What caused me to do this was that everyone on my team, and multiple enemy team members seemed to agree with her decision. I got flustered and angrier at this, asking how in god&#039;s name is it logical to risk a game just because you have faith the other person will eventually reconnect. Everyone get defending the Jungler and I got told by the jungle to look at her border. Apparently she was platinum last season, but somehow in bronze 3. I have no idea why. Maybe they got unlucky placements or something. Anyway she continues on to call me &quot;Emotionally unstable&quot; and told me &quot;This is why you&#039;ll be a bronzie forever.&quot; This has to have been the stupidest thing that has happened in my life.\n\nI don&#039;t expect anyone to care about this, its just a childish rant that will get buried by either time or downvotes. Honestly I&#039;m bronze 4 so why the hell should I care this much about ranked, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Probably got too angry at her over a video game as well, though the worst thing I said to her was &quot;you are a **** idiot.&quot;  I was just so flustered by the idea that nearly everyone in my game thought that this was an OK thing to do, to force a 4v5 on your teammates and make them believe that the afk was coming back soon.\n\nEdit: I checked their OP.gg and the person only has a 55% win rate in bronze 3. So I honestly have no idea what's going on if this person was platinum last season. I just now cannot even comprehend how this person felt they could lord their \"skill\" over me.","replies":[]}
