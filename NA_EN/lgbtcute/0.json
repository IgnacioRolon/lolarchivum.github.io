We need one, because I don't want to get banned!","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":6,"down_votes":8,"body":"I like to play Support Janna with Exhaust and Windspeaker&#039;s Blessing.\r\n\r\nIn a recent game, I had an ADC Vayne who got angry with me in the chat lobby for picking Janna because &quot;janna not meta&quot;. They proceeded to be angry with me the entire game, and they went 0/12/0 and we lost, no doubt due to my non-meta support. They told me they would be reporting me for choosing Janna.\r\n\r\nAt one point they were spamming &quot;kys&quot; in the chatroom, and I muted them so I could focus on the game. But this was probably not a good idea, as I was unable to communicate with the Vayne adequately, and I failed to adapt myself to their win-condition of securing blue buff and running into enemy fountain while the enemy team attacked our inhibitor.\r\n\r\nAs Riot has recently stated, certain offenses are bannable:\r\n\r\n1) Creating a frustrating gameplay experience for my teammates.\r\n\r\n2) Not communicating win conditions effectively with teammates.\r\n\r\n3) Not adapting yourself to teammates&#039; strategies.\r\n\r\n4) Choosing champions that create an atmosphere of disharmony to teammates.\r\n\r\n5) Playing non-meta support champions, even if those champions are classified as &quot;supports&quot;.\r\n\r\nI have clearly done all of these by choosing to play Support Janna. I enjoy this game, and I don&#039;t want to be banned for making the game frustrating to all the Vayne players out there.\r\n\r\nI had always thought the report system was to remove players who insult and harass their teammates, but I now realize the report system is there to make sure people only play meta approved champions.  I didn&#039;t know you could be banned for choosing the wrong champions!\r\n\r\nIs there some list Riot keeps of Riot-approved Champion choices? I don&#039;t want to be banned for making my teammates angry! Please help.  I don&#039;t want to lose my account for choosing the wrong champions to play.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-03-01T03:09:48.545+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's no non-meta champion that will get you banned just for playing it. However, if you decide you want to play a non-meta *role* and force it upon your team with no room for negotiation, then you'll get banned. So, don't do that, and you'll be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2017-03-01T03:38:26.681+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still feel like playing bard or having mobi boots and hard roaming is gonna be an issue for me on my other account. I like having smite/exhaust. It gives some sustain by smiting a nearby monster (no need to kill it), opens up surprised hook potential, and gives additional objective pressure. Nevertheless, red, blue and warding jg items are useful if you want a bit of utility outside normal items.\n\nMeanwhile, roaming in addition to the jungler creates a lot of gank potential and can easily take towers if not responded to.\n\nI feel like, the slowly increasing cases are because support is getting stale, games are ending or determined too early and the extra map pressure helps, and the meta  is getting boring.\n\nHell, i played veigar instead of an ADC and got fed 21/5. Lich bane fixes any \"tower destroying\" problems there can be. Then there's ziggs.\n\nEven if people consider these \"singed support\" and \"nunu support\" cases to be unfun, i find the current meta unfun myself. My most fun game ive had was doing an illaoi 2v1 bot lane while we had an amumu jungler and a Kindred Counter Jungler. We won that game and it was more fun. Im sure it was unfun for the opponents but top was a duo lane before release and preseason 1 had 3 solo lanes with a jungler and roaming support.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-03-01T04:29:59.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand where you're coming from and your concerns are legitimate, I don't mean to dismiss them. You should feel free to support your team how you see fit. But also keep in mind your teammates' expectations of what a \"support\" is. I understand you're unhappy with the current way the game is played (and within 5-man groups, you are free to dictate your strategy accordingly), but try to understand that a majority of players are fine with how things are. You can certainly innovate the role a little bit, with off-meta picks you should never be punished for, but the overarching strategy of support (i.e. being in lane with your ADC for the duration of laning phase) is something you shouldn't force your team to compromise on. If you're playing with random people, it's courteous to ask them first if they are OK with your strategy before deciding what you'll do this game. \n\nI've watched several of Take the Draw's games and sometimes his team was totally fine with it, and that's OK. But he never asked, he insisted on playing this strategy few have heard of and expected his team to go along with whatever he wanted to do like he's the only person that matters on the team. Like I said earlier, you shouldn't be concerned about getting banned for buying Mobi boots or roaming a little bit as Bard when your lane is pushed, these are totally legitimate strategies that people never get punished for. If you still have questions about what is or isn't punishable, please feel free to reply here or add me in game and we can discuss further. But for the time being, I hope I have cleared up any confusion you may have had about the issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-01T02:22:32.264+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just stop.
