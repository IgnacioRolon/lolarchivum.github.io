You lose games.  Pros lose games.  Even Faker lost a game.  Every single game, one team is going to lose.  There are always losers.  Sometimes, it is your turn.\r\n\r\nThe reason the report system \"doesn't work\" is that toxic players are the ones most eager to report their teammates.  If the report system actually banned every player who got reported, there would be nothing but toxic players in LoL for a while, then there would be no one left at all.\r\n\r\nStop treating the report system like it's your own personal griefing tool.  Learn to play better, or just learn that no matter how good you play, and how skilled or unskilled your teammates are, you WILL lose games anyway.\r\n\r\nOne of my friends worked as a dispatcher for 911 (emergency help line in the USA for you non-Americans).
