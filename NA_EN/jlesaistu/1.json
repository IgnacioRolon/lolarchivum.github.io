It'd be nice if they changed it into something more interesting, the spamming is nice for her speed buff passive... but I don't really feel like the slight damage is worth the harass I will take from being in range.\n\nMaybe if it was toggled, or there was a slow with her Q, then there would be like some sort of anti-stack, where the more consecutive times a target is hit with Q, the after hits will apply less slowing effects or slow for less seconds, until it's basically just like .25 seconds, and the stacks fall off 1-by-1 after 4 seconds or something, that way you can't just spam Q and be like \"haha you're slowed for hours now\" and you have to actually think of HOW you should approach the enemy. \nAlso, maybe have it be just a rectangle skillshot, kind of like the hit box for Braum's Ult and such, that way you can scout better, because there are multiple champs with some sort of invisibility who are really scary and can spook you, then kill you in one of their full combos without their ultimate.\nAlso, have those less-slow stacks make it so that Q's damage applies more base/%-AP/true damage to the target(s) hit with it, that way she can be a better duelist, since at this point I think she's more of an AP jungler than AD as oppose to Shaco or Nocturne.\nPlus I feel like her rework needs to give her more CC or more power, because she needs her 6 in order to actually make anything happen, because her 6 is the only AOE-CC ability, and it's a slow. And it isn't on a low enough cooldown to make it worthwhile. I mean, it's not Blitzcrank with his 30 second ultimate and an equally good passive ability that helps until you want to curb-stomp your prey.\nHer invisibility, I think, is the only thing that makes her unique, as well as the \"spam-Q\" gameplay that a few other champions possess at the moment, but she needs other things that would make her... More viable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2014-12-20T07:21:33.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly?

Forces her to be close and gives her the ability to actually get off her damage properly. Would be a buff to AD and AP since AD has issues sticking to the target if they have any form of an escape and AP is meant to kite.

Even a slow can end her gank with how slow her Q moves and if you use your W just to be able to get in range to Q. Overall, she has to be able to do it quickly like Skarner or it's just going to end up being useless. I could see stacking CDR to make her spike like mad, but then she'd have to have the mana to back it up, something that dual nomicons can't do.
