And while I never agree with that statement, if other champions can have that, why can't twitch? Build {{item:3140}} and you can remove it, done. Realistically though, late game, if you took enough stacks to get the full damage as a squishy, you're probably already dead. ADC's only tend to have about 2k health max.  6 autos surpasses that pretty quickly. \n\nBesides, you forget that Twitch has no other damage other than his Autos, there are no skill shots or procs aside from his E. It's just all autos, which means if the enemy builds a Thorn mail they're pretty much damaging you already. Even with life steal you're going to take some damage.\n\nTanks won't just be completely shredded by this anyways. 300 true damage isn't going to do a lot to a tank anyways, over 6 seconds. Not when there are health items like {{item:3709}} It pretty much gives you enough and more to negate that true damage. Besides, there's always {{item:3022}} and {{item:3083}} If you really want to negate that true damage :/\n\nSee, it's riddled with counter play, even for the ones it's intended to hurt.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2015-04-26T03:50:59.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His venom cask or whatever also applies stacks aoe, why are you forgetting this?\nTrue damage hurts tanks the most, and 300 damage is easily the difference between life and death on a tank. True damage is never negated, only dampened and building flat hp makes tanks vulnerable to botrk (which is on like every duelist) and liandrys and any % damage anyone has.","replies":[{"poster":"Shield Villain","date":"2015-04-26T08:51:00.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're assuming this is against a Tank who has 3.5-4+k Health already. At 6 full stacks, twitch will deal 486 True damage over 6 seconds. This being at level 18. That's only 1/10th of a Tanks full health if he was smart and now has 4k+ health. Which is easily attainable.\n\nNow, using the active on his E will only do (With Dragon buff and full build) 174 per stack, or 183 attack damage if your ult is active. That's 1098 on proc if the enemy has 0% armor.  Even calculating a Last Whisper and masteries (the Tank should have least 75% armor) they remain with 35% armor. Reducing the damage on the active to 713 Attack damage. That's inconsequential considering this can only be done once every 8 seconds.\n\nNow, is only if you built Damage on Twitch and got the first Dragon. {{item:3153}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3031}} For a total of 391 ATK and 1.88 ATK speed calculating scaling and Runes/Masteries typical for an Auto dependent ADC. This only spiking to 427 ATK when your Ult is active. So at best your autos are doing 277.55 or 192 if they built Ninja Tabi. Again, this is NOTHING for a tank.\n\nSo, let me clarify. A fully built Twitch will only deal  486 True damage, Over 6 seconds. 713 for a full proc on his E, which he can't do again for another 8 seconds. And a potential 4 Autos for 1108 or 768 damage. \n\nBest Scenario: 2307\nWorst: 1967\nEven so 486 of this would not be calculated in the burst, as it would be sustained damage. \n\nBut with all this, it's only speculating that the tank actually lets you get your full stacks on him, and then you can survive long enough to proc the active. You also have to remain still while you do this, in order to get this out as fast as possible. Meaning you're going ALL IN on the tank. \n\nMost of the time you won't. You'll only get 3-4 stacks in there, and 2 on everyone else. Which again, is nothing. And your Ult does reduced damage for every enemy it passes. \n\nWhen you compare this to someone who does the same thing, but can stack INFINITELY and do more damage per stack, while remaining mobile and dealing CC when activating, yes Twitch could use a buff.\n\nIf you want to calculate a full team battle. Then twitch will more than likely not get this full damage out. Why? Because he'll be focused on by the team being the carry. And thus will die in about 1-2 seconds from a huge burst, given he has no mobility or escape. Its only in the best conditions that he can do that full 2307 damage, and that's late game at full build with the dragon buff.\n\nReally, this is dwarfed by the burst of other ADC's with Health% Damage and greater Cast Damage. \n\nThe only thing Twitch has going for him are: Stealth and Atk range. His damage is really no issue unless the enemy just lets you attack them. But that's the case with virtually EVERY champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2015-04-26T19:38:45.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't take into account a single crit at all with two crit items.  You STILL did not take into account the cask either nor the fact that **twitch can auto multiple people at once, reduced damage or not**. His actual best case scenario would mean he deals over 8k damage if he hits 5 people. \n\nHow is 1/2 of a tank inconsequential? Who has infinitely stacking true damage? \n\nI would like to see your math about the auto damage, because i'm certain you didn't take into account botrk, and I don't get how tabi's can shave 75 damage off unless you have 750 on hit damage. If a tank has 35% armor and tabis, then 427 would deal 234.85, not 192.\n\nYou are downplaying the value of stealth (which gives a large as bonus too) and the highest of all ranges in game, higher than that of even turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"Shield Villain","date":"2015-04-26T20:38:21.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Landing a 5 man stack is near impossible in a group fight. I seriously doubt you've ever even touched Twitch if you don't know this. Only a group of idiots would group together enough for not only his W to hit them all, which applies only 2 stacks and a small slow, and no other damage, but to allow all of twitch's Autos to hit them all. They'd have to be standing in a straight line behind the tank. \n\nSo your point is invalidated. \n\nEven if you were to land a crit, it would do a total of 1067.5 before defenses. 35% Reduction and 10% Stacking Ninja Tabi for a total of 45% reduction on auto attack damage. That's a 586.625 Auto. But again, this is Inconsequential. \n\nCompared to other abilities that can not only Crit, but do more scaling damage than an Auto, yes this is nothing. But that's getting off topic. If you're going to \"QQ I'm a tank. A burst actually hurt me. I can't just stand there and take 0 damage\" then you're completely missing the point.\n\nTwitch is an ASSASSIN, so of course he has some level of damage. But this damage is only Single Target. Only 1 person is really every going to take your full brunt. Which means once it's done, it's done. Not only that, unlike other assassins, you don't juke around while bursting. You have to stay relatively still to land Autos and proc W and E. \n\nSo if your point is that it does a lot, and Twitch gets his Prime, no one is even trying to stop him. Yes he's going to hurt. But that's your fault for letting him get there. For not trying to even cc him, just standing there letting him hit you, and then allowing him to go those 2-3 seconds in which he's setting everything up, untouched. Which again, invalidates your point.\n\nANy number of champions can deal more damage than twitch in their burst, which takes less, if you just let them.\n\nAs a Talon main I can near kill a Tank with my full rotation if he's stupid enough to let me get it all out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2015-04-26T21:39:40.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"best case\" means everything is in line, realistic or not. He'll still tend to hit two or three so he'll ~~**_merely_**~~ deal 5k. \n\nI find it boggling how 1/8th a tank is inconsequential when it means you're like three shotting squishies. Tanks are actually supposed to survive more than 2 seconds you know. There are like 3-4 abilities that can crit and apply on hits, i can think of only 2 right now. AA modifiers don't really count.\n\nIf twitch is really assassin, why is his primary marksman and he's never played top or mid? Why is he always bot (or jungle sometimes) and plays like an adc? Calling twitch single target with piercing autos and an aoe spell is like calling lux single target.  Technically, lux will only deal full damage to one person and she has an aoe spell and a piercing ult, similar to twitch.\n\nYou realize you shouldn't really be proccing your expunge to hurt, but to get that kill when they get out of your 850 range? \n\n>So if your point is that it does a lot, and Twitch gets his Prime, no one is even trying to stop him.

You answered none of my questions posed either.\n\nAre you seriously saying that any champion will deal more damage than twitch (who deals sustained damage by the way, not burst, auto's are not burst damage)?

It's countering the entirety of what an ADC does. Unless it's Graves, but he's a special case.

And a bit silly.\n\nOh, and... As for Kog Maw, yes. He can proc it more often and will deal more %Health damage than Vayne. But his is an active ability with a CD, not to mention it costs mana. Vayne's is entirely passive, and she's got hard-cc as well. ... And you got the numbers wrong, by the time Vayne does 8%, Kog does 18%. Not trying to be rude or anything, I just want the numbers to be correct.\n\nOn the thread topic though, which I realize I haven't said anything about yet (sorry about that,) I agree twitch's poison might need a tiny buff. I just don't want it to be %Health, as that would be *very* toxic, and, ironically, no one wants that. Although, it *could* work to *indirectly* buff Twitch's poison by buffing his E...
