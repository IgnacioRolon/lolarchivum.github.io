Even for a dps mage like karthus is make sence.\n\n But the ADC is the LAST champion wou want to see die, ever. And i beleive his passive is just WAY out of kit.\n\n\nGive him somethings like:\n\n **\"kog&#039;maw attack and living artillerie deal, on hit, 1% of target missing HP as bonus damage&#039;&#039;\n**\n\nThere, seem fair and actually fit his tank killer idendity. \n\nhis current passive is jsut plain ackward.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-04-16T07:07:46.992+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive works like this \"even if you kill me, i'll hit you hard\"\nI've seen shitton of triple kills with Kogs passive kamikaze.\nAlso whenever kog dies enemy team is always like \"oh f*ck, gotta run\" which gave kogs team a chance for striking.\n\nIt's good passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2015-04-16T10:00:07.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:96}} passive was fine for me.  As an ADC or and APC, he has insane range and damage enough to kill people.  At ANY point in the game, if anyone can get up next to you, you are most likely dead.  That's where his passive comes in.  Its a final \"present\" for your loving opponents who worked so hard to dive past all your damage/defenses just to give you a \"hug\".\n\nAlso he was a really good counter to kills lanes way back, since most of the time killing him brought them low enough for his passive to kill them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrSlowDie","date":"2015-04-16T03:10:18.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive\n\nname : whatever\nWhen an enemy dies, start a chain of reaction in the enemy's body. can be controlled by pressing CTRL, detonate after 4 secs, deals some damages based on enemy's (the one who dead) max health.

He's meant to be a long ranged hyper carry who murders tanks, but his passive gives him incentive to die. It just seems silly for him to want to be in close range and want to die since he's supposed to want to stay way in the back and destroy people. \n\nI don't know what he would get though to replace it. He already has the AS, the range and health shred, poke, armor and MR shred, and even a slow. Best I could say is something thematic. He vomits everywhere and likes to eat things, so it could be something related to that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kcStranger","date":"2015-04-16T03:02:28.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree Kog'Maw's passive is kind of awkward, but I have to admit that just makes me love it even more.
