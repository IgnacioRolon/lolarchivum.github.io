Another 15-minute design experiment, this time with Aurelion Sol. All constructive feedback is appreciated!\n\nThe goal of this gameplay update:\n\n* Give Aurelion Sol himself more to do that simply boop people with stars (you should feel like a star-creating dragon more frequently).\n* Expand on the caster-like nature that a Star Dragon implies.\n* Make him more accessible to non-Aurelion Sol mains through some more caster-like mechanics, while preserving the things that make him unique (roaming, star mechanics).\n* Create new opportunities for new and existing players to feel good about.\n* Appeal both to people who prefer traditional casters *and* people who like the unique star-based gameplay.\n\nAdditionally, please remember that this is a 10-15 minute experiment *intentionally*. As a result major changes like complete gameplay pattern shifts are off the table, as the time allowed isn't really suitable for large-scope changes and gameplay balancing.\n\nWith that in mind, let's dive in.\n\n[](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/116/823/large/jean-go-aurelion-sol-wallpaper.jpg)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GtYayUJ.png\n\n#**_~~Center of the Universe [Passive]~~_**\n**Ability Description:** Aurelion Sol is constantly orbited by three Stars, each doing a full circumference in 5.25 seconds, and beyond them exists an Outer Limit affecting his damaging abilities. This outer limit is always visible to Aurelion Sol as a faint line.\n\n>**Design Notes:** No changes here, save that the outer limit is made visible to help newer players judge *Celestial Expansion* (and thus flatten the steep learning curve for Aurelion Sol by a this mandatory memory tax).\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GtYayUJ.png\n\n#**_~~Moment of Creation [Q]~~_**\n**Active:** Aurelion Sol creates a star at the target location after a short delay, dealing damage to enemies struck. The star then begins to orbit around him at the range it was at when created, completing three full rotations before fading (this rotation path is visible as a very faint circle around Aurelion Sol). Enemies struck take damage based on Aurelion Sol’s current star damage.\n\nStores up to 3 charges. 1 second static cooldown between casts.\n\n>**Design Notes:** One of Aurelion Sol's big issues is that he feels too passive for a self-absorbed, all-powerful Star Dragon, so letting you actively create stars to add to your universe is a way to hone in more on the creator fantasy, while also adding some cool ways to set up for teamfights, long-range poke, and general caster-style play. Letting you stock up on charges means that you can really become a terror in teamfights when you unleash your own little universe. And no, I didn't remove your baseline CC -- take a look at the new E.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GtYayUJ.png\n\n#**_~~Celestial Expansion [W]~~_**\n**Passive:** The damage of Aurelion Sol’s stars increases.\n\n**Active:** Aurelion Sol pushes his passive stars farther out, increasing their damage and speed. Stars created with Moment of Creation gain damage and speed, but are not moved.\n\n>**Design Notes:** This one sees almost no changes, because it's a strong ability that lets you manipulate the heavens, like any good Star Dragon should. To minimize confusion with moving stars, self-created stars don't adjust in their distance, but they do still empower themselves.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GtYayUJ.png\n\n#**_~~Voice of Light [E]~~_**\n**Active:** Active: Aurelion Sol breathes out a wave of pure celestial power, slowing and dealing magic damage to targets hit and knocking them backwards towards his outer limit if they’re within 600 units.\n\n>**Design Notes:** This is the replacement for your baseline CC, offering a little more safety and a little more uptime feeling like a celestial dragon. Reducing the area and damage means we can afford to make this a basic ability without too many balancing tweaks needed elsewhere, and since it serves as your slow *and* your safety tool there's some encouragement not to simply save it for safety every time.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GtYayUJ.png\n\n#**_~~Comet of Legend [R]~~_**\n**First Cast:** Aurelion Sol shields himself and begins to fly in the target direction, creating a brilliant star as he travels. The effect instantly stops if the shield is destroyed.\n\n**Second Cast:** Aurelion Sol stops and sends the star surging forward a short distance, dealing magic damage and stunning enemies struck based on the total distance traveled.\n\n>**Design Notes:** Aurelion Sol's star-following, nearly global roam is a standard of his kit, and needed to be preserved in some manner. Making it an ultimate felt like a good change since his core pattern is a bit better at sustaining itself now (and a bit more active), so we could still get that great feel of a grand celestial dragon crashing down on his puny mortal foes and unleasing the force of his majestic creation. The shield helps give you a bit of safety on arriving, but also serves as a way for attentive enemies to stop you from using this to escape.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GtYayUJ.png\n\n#Self Analysis\n\n>I think there are some major issues left to solve here. Chief among them that simply dropping your Q at your Outer Limit is probably the optimal way to play, which feels pretty shitty, and otherwise one lone orbiting star on a 5.25 second rotation feels useless a lot of the time. Unfortunately that probably means that the pattern I have here doesn't ultimately work, although I think there's some value in keeping a \"create your own star orbit\" mechanic in some way, and I think shifting the R to baseline and the Q/E combo to the ultimate could ultimately be a good move.\n>\n>It might honestly be worth removing the passive entirely in favor of a Q that lets you place a ring of stars at a set orbit, giving a bit more downtime to the stars but a bit more control over them. That would open up another ability slot, which could be interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2019-09-07T18:01:59.315+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like this addresses the problems that Riot had with the release Aurelion Sol kit, i play Sol alot and I'd play this, i think i might even enjoy it more","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-09-07T18:04:54.660+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FlameHalbrdOkido,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=caKkQ5x7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-07T18:01:59.315+0000)I feel like this addresses the problems that Riot had with the release Aurelion Sol kit, i play Sol alot and I'd play this, i think i might even enjoy it more\n\nThanks!\n\nI think there are some major issues left to solve here though.

The changes here weren't made only for theme, but also to help Aurelion Sol's personal patterns (pushing people away and into your stars more often)\n\nThe term \"a step backwards\" depends on how you look at things. \nYou said that:  \"The changes here weren't made only for theme, but also to help Aurelion Sol's personal patterns (pushing people away and into your stars more often)\". If we apply that and accompanied it with the suggested changes then yes \"as a step backwards\" makes no sense since the changes do everything to strengthen him in that diection.\n\nHowever that's assuming we're looking at things with that pattern and image in mind, sth that i don't really agree with.\nImo A-sol's pattern isn't pushing enemies to the outer limit as often and reliably as possible but keeping your distance and paying attention to your positioning throughout the game. Pushing people back should be a last resort in case they got too close.\n\nWith such an identity the pushback cc tied to his ult makes sense since it's a way a game changer and has risk behind it. \nIn a tough situation i could either use the ult to push the enemy away but loose on a big damage output or stun and make use of the situation to make use of the damage behind the ult for later in the fight.\n\nWith the new gameplay (the removal of his stun making his e the only cc available) his identity gameplay wise isn't strengthened as much as it has been altered so much so that it sounds completely different. This is on paper at least and \"feel\" can't be established until one actually tries the concept out.\n\nTo be fair you mentioned that one of the goals in mind is to give him more to do and make him feel more like a star forging dragon than a booper but if this is to go live i will miss making his q extend endlesslly ( which is unique in a sense that we don't have endlessly scaling cc's in the game, and the panic on the enemy players when being approached by a q 2 times the size of the lane is priceless xD)","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-09-07T19:39:43.222+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zee Zone,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=caKkQ5x7,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-07T19:30:25.701+0000)...but with the limited amount of info we've got atm having 2 cc options is simply better than only 1 \n\nWe have the same number -- the stun is moved to the ultimate (and could be recast instantly) and the knockback is moved to the E, vs the current stun on the Q and knockback on the ultimate.\n\n> Imo A-sol's pattern isn't pushing enemies to the outer limit as often and reliably as possible but keeping your distance and paying attention to your positioning throughout the game.

You'll find that hard to play champions that lack the numbers payoff of performing always become unpopular.\n\nThere was no need to rework him, just tune his numbers and particularly his starting HP and armor and AP scaling while making WW not cancelled by CC. He's supposed to be a somewhat tanky sustained DPS mage, a mix between malzahar's sustained DPS and Swain's zoning and survival.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2019-09-08T03:11:59.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mostly great.\n\nI don't really think it's necessary to make Comet do damage, though.

Why would macro-oriented players be punished to give something to someone else.  There are so many new champs and remakes that already made a lot of champs micro heavy to cater to those players, so why take away even more?  There is no good answer unless you have zero emotional or traditional intelligence.  If you kick someone out for every person you make happy, you are not making any progress and leaving a trail of tears in the process.  This is a game afterall, so if to make money you have to upset people, they should think of making a new game instead of reworking more champs.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-09-08T23:57:09.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">There is no good answer unless you have zero emotional or traditional intelligence.\n\nThis is the sort of comment that locks out discussion, because now any attempt to answer falls -- in your eyes -- into this category.

Additionally Riot has admitted that Sol himself is too passive in his gameplay. Its not that he needs to be changed a lot simply for the sake of changing but just adjusted for he feels more engaging.\n\nSure if we're talking about the loss of macro play you could make an argument for that, but if thats the case then why don't we try to have a discussion about that instead of...what ever that was. \n\nYou CAN balance the Ult's CD so its comparable to E's CURRENT CD, in fact E pretty much already has an ult lvl CD and its not any stretch to say that THIS version of R could have the same CD as current E. \nThen the macro play pretty much doesn't change, Sol is BETTER at doing what he does best with his stars AND he himself is more engaged in his theme of creating stars (thus reaching his thematic potential more) AND is visually more personally engaged in the gameplay and shares a more equal focus as his stars instead of the stars being 100% of the focus like they currently are.","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-09-09T05:48:03.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He and his stars are one.

His stars do all the work, he just moves them by moving, thats why its passive.\n\nI get that he and his stars are one based on lore, but from a gameplay perspective if u don't kno that he looks very passive and disconnected in his gameplay. In his visuals his main gamplay consists on just moving around so his stars hit you all the time...\nI wouldn't say that risky and engaging are synonymous here in Sol's case bc again its just showing HOW important the location of his stars are to him, bc if they could rotate closer to him that wouldn't be an issue. And lets not forget about the fact that  Star Dragon really shouldn't have to worry about too many beings getting close to him in the 1st place, nothing should really be a threat to him if we are talking about the lore, and that brings up another issue where as a battle mage Sol is very much lacking in terms of defense. He shouldn't be afraid to deal with targets if they get close but his lack of defensive abilities/passive hurts that fantasy. If changes were like Djinn is suggesting and the passive were moved to W's passive, Sol could get a defensive passive or ability to function better as a battle mage, and in that case thats a change that im sure many mains wouldn't have a problem with\n\nthese aren't changes for the sake of change or JUST so you can make Sol for everybody that's not the case, these changes are to help Sol be better at what he already does, and to make HE himself more engaged in his own gameplay instead of the existance of the Stars taking 90% of the spotlight. Would u not agree that this is better than Current Sol? and lets not forget this still maintains the main gameplay of Sol. Look i love Sol as much as the next main, but I can see the points Djinn is making. If u'd let go of the false thoughts that reworks were always designed to take away Champion niche's u'd see that too, that isn't ALWAYS the goal.","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-09-09T16:57:40.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The people that like Sol like him for the champ he is, and that is more important than any opinion on how you feel he could do it better.  No one grows to enjoy and main a champ based on how they might change in the future.  What you are leaving out of your thought process is emotional intelligence.  It is just as much about how your changes affects present mains as it is anything else.  So if your seemingly (to you) great changes has a negative emotional effect on a majority of the champ's present players than they are worthless changes.  \n\nI see this a lot in that people just go head first into tunnel vision about changes without taking into account their ramifications.  Please increase your horizon of thought to be able to measure not only your changes, but how people will feel about them.  Because the people and their happiness is very important, and taking away happiness should be treated as a very serious decision; and usually it is amongst people of high quality, which I assume you are.  All that being said, again, Sol has had a net positive effect on the game as a good addition that some people enjoy that has caused minimal to no problems within SR and the community.  To take something that has those characteristics and try to make it subjectively \"better\" at the price of mains very \"objective\" feelings is ignorant.  It is tiring having to keep explaining this, and that is why I can get short at times, because the more people that begin to become wiser and incorporate the customers' feelings along with their design ideas, the better everything will be.  Until then it will be a steady result of disappointment, negativity, polarization, and very temporary increase in skin sales. I hope you understand, design does not take place in a vacuum.

You have to be smart enough to know that.  There are individual comments that might have some good input, but they are few and far between.  Also you have to come to terms with you do not know the right decision to make:  People that do not play a given champ are a lot less actively frustrated by not being able to play it.  But people that do play a champ are often actively frustrated when it changes.  That is a consistent truth.  I am only trying to help, and am not trying to be rude, but results matter.  And the sum of the results is poor, we know this.  There is a really great thing we all know of that holds true in this situation, the first thing a smart person needs to know, is knowing what he/she doesn't know. ** I do not know the details on designing specific skills for a champ**, but i do understand people and their feeling, reactions, and behaviors given whatever stimuli, and also get how theoretically everything should fit together in the game (power budgets, game phases, pacing, general balance etc).  But like I stated, and what is even better, if you tell me of some changes I know how each type of player is going to feel about them.  That is why design by itself does not matter.  What matters is the design's effect on the players and game.  So even if the design is sharp and seemingly perfect, but in the end it causes friction, frustration, polarization, general negativeness, etc then the design is bad.  \n\nYou guys need to take a step back and brainstorm about the results of your actions, and what conversely would be happening if they never happened?  Like, what the game and playerbase be like if Eve and Panth were still running around in their old form?  Was the cost associated with the changes worth it given that the game would at least be in the same place?  No news, is often good news.  With design, business-wise your best bet is concentrate on casual/average-mechanical players (why do you think you got big in the first place, while dota lags, and the fgc stays very niche) having fun because the more functional teammates we have the better the game is for everyone.  Your streamers are loud but will play regardless, and often want to simply separate themselves with their \"skill\"more so than help anyone, including you and your game.  Watch pros and ask them specific questions along with their coaches to get good info with less bias.\n\nYou guys are great and I love the work you do.
