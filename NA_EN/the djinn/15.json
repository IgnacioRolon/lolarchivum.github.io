Trust me.","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":21,"down_votes":7,"body":"So...I don&#039;t normally post skin ideas since I don&#039;t actually have much artistic ability where sketch art is concerned, but I had an idea I absolutely wanted to share: **STAR GUARDIAN GAREN.**\n\nStar Guardian Garen begins the game as Lux, with an assembly animation similar to that of Super Galaxy Rumble. She undergoes a &quot;magical girl transformation sequence,&quot; ending up in a hulking robot suit of pink, white, and gold metal, with Lux&#039;s head still visible between the suit&#039;s massive shoulder guards.\n\nAgain, I don&#039;t have art, but here&#039;s a random google image search with a similar idea:\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ac/47/a6/ac47a66be9934080e1f707bd4f1db100.jpg\n\nThe ability effects would involve a glowing sword (possibly made of magical energy), lots of stars and hearts and rainbow colors, and **Demacian Justice** would drop a shining rainbow sword from the sky.\n\nYou&#039;d redo the voice lines with Lux&#039;s actress, which might mean this would need to be a Legendary or Ultimate skin -- which is fine, as I&#039;d love an excuse to turn ALL the music into the sort of cheesy recall music that Star Guardian Lux has.\n\nThoughts? Suggestions? Complaints? Personal insults?","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2015-12-15T18:59:18.367+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Sunglow","date":"2015-12-16T23:25:36.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Ao Shin","date":"2015-12-15T22:34:15.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":17,"body":"how about shutting the fuck up instead","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2015-12-15T22:47:33.265+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maximum Ao Shin,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EbtzelJ6,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-12-15T22:34:15.396+0000)\n>\n> how about shutting the fuck up instead\n\nThe first personal insult!
