Presented here for discussion are several of the options I&#039;ve explored up to this point, along with a positive/negative analysis of each and some of the gameplay ramifications I personally think might accompany each potential system.\n\nDiscussions and thoughts of your own are appreciated (these are presented without my opinions on which are good/bad specifically as a springboard for discussion around the topic and community suggestions), although I&#039;d appreciate it if we stayed within the statement of intent, which is discussing the mechanics of crit themselves, *not* the general balance or need to entirely remove it in favor of a different sort of multiplier (which, while very valid discussions, are best addressed in another topic).\n\n**TL:DR** This is a huge topic. I'm afraid I can't summarize it. :P\n\n-------------------------------\n#STATEMENT OF INTENT\nCritical hit mechanics are a tricky thing in *League*. Riot has stated several times ([here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/qgP5fbUQ-as-an-adc-main-crit-needs-to-be-removed?comment=0051) and [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/hbEj1jWi-can-we-finally-phase-crits-rngesus-out-of-the-game?comment=002f00000000), for a few examples) that critical hits are a bit of a recurring subject with positives and negatives on both sides, and that it&#039;s something the team looks at not infrequently. As such, love them or hate them, it&#039;s something worth discussing and analyzing.\n\nAn important thing about this post -- and I know this will frustrate some of you -- is that this analysis is *not* intended to be a deep dive into carry balance and/or large itemization shifts to support carry balance. This isn&#039;t a thread devoted to analyzing or attempting to solve anything other than a highly specific issue: the possibility of improving critical hit mechanics in terms of play patterns and player perception. If there&#039;s interest I&#039;d love to consider a big discussion thread on carry design/balance/playstyles in the future and how you could redesign crit to reposition its role as a damage multiplier that&rsquo;s efficient against all targets, but ***that is not the intent behind this analysis***.\n\nThe end goal is to identify methods of adjusting critical hits that keep a strong feedback loop while also reducing the perceived impact of randomization. Note that this is not necessarily equivalent to *eliminating* randomization entirely, although we&#039;ll explore some options for that as well.\n\n&gt;**Section TL:DR** -- Don&#039;t expect major balance suggestions, because this analysis is based on the play patterns and satisfaction/clarity output of the core mechanic of critical hits, rather than an analysis of carry balance in general. The goal is primarily to improve the critical hit *mechanics*, not shift the balance of marksmen.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n# CURRENT CRITICAL HITS\nFirst off, an important note: critical hits are *psuedo-random*, in that an attack that is not a critical hit increases your critical hit chance on the next attack, resetting when you land a critical hit. This helps prevent a drought of critical hits, while keeping your expected output at roughly the expected value (2 crits per 10 hits for 20% crit, for example).\n\nSecondly, a point of uncertainty that I&#039;d love to know if anyone knows it: does this psuedo-randomization tick different for champions vs. non-champions? I.e. is champion crit chance on a separate fail-safe tracker than minion crit chance?\n\n**Positive features of Critical Hits**\n\n* Provides a strong positive feedback loop: purchasing crit leads to big visible damage numbers, cool animations, and chunky bits of enemy healthbars vanishing as you attack. This feels *great* to a player in a way a constant 25% damage increase doesn&#039;t.\n* Provides some anti-snowball potential, as even champions who are ahead need to be wary of critical strikes. *Note: This may not be something the average player is considering. Does it offer enough value to highly skilled players to make it worth retaining? Uncertain. Maybe this can be emphasized?*\n* Creates &quot;crit-fishing&quot; gameplay, where a harassing champion can fire off a shot and follow it up with an immediate engage if the initial hit is a critical hit, or where a champion can attempt to predict the psuedo-random RNG to &quot;cook&quot; a crit for use against an enemy.\n* Creates varied and dynamic play through psuedo-randomized damage output variance and the need to react to the same either offensively or defensively.\n* Randomization at lower values creates interesting teamfight opportunities -- if you crit one target and are unlikely to have another crit up soon, do you switch to a priority target or focus down the victim of the initial hit?\n* A portion of the player base really likes it.\n* Creates high points and low points in gameplay (usually a positive thing for player experience).\n\n**Negative features of Critical Hits**\n\n* Randomized damage output, resulting in unpredictable gameplay.\n* Largely out of player control.\n* Can potentially swing the results of the laning phase or skirmishes.\n* Even low values can have a powerful effect if they land properly.\n* Variance leads to situations where crit is very strong (you get lucky crits on every attack against an enemy you&#039;re harassing) or very weak (you get unlucky and land no crits on attacks against an enemy you&#039;re harassing).\n* Can feel very bad to get hit with during a &quot;lucky streak.&quot;\n* Can make you feel like you lost due entirely to luck, rather than due to skill, even in situations where the other play may have also outplayed you due to skill. As such, can be disempowering to both players.\n* A portion of the player base has a *very* strong negative bias against it.\n* Creates lows in gameplay (a negative thing if it occurs too often).\n------------------------------------\n#SOME TAKEAWAYS FOR ANALYSIS\nSome takeaway questions from the above breakdown, that we can use to judge possible crit models:\n\n* Does it reduce the perception or impact of randomization, or create better gameplay around it?\n* Does it create a strong feedback loop?\n* Does it create highs and lows in gameplay? If so, does it create too many lows?\n* Does it retain interaction points or introduce new interaction points?\n\nSome other things to consider:\n\n* What are the ripple effects? Is it small-scale, does it impact other roles, does it require new itemization?\n* How does it impact the laning phase?\n* How does it impact objective control or teamfighting?\n* How might it affect the metagame?\n* How does it impact snowballing?\n------------------------------------\n\n#ANALYSIS\nI&#039;ll be making several posts in this thread that detail some of the solutions I&#039;ve explored, and permalinks to the individual comments will be added below. If I see posts with suggestions and breakdowns that I consider to be well-analyzed, I will likely include them in the below list.\n\n## These suggestions are explorations into possible models, and not all of them are things I consider particularly compelling directions. Most of them have benefits and downsides, which I have tried to detail.\n\n1.

For example: 50% critical strike chance (a 50% chance to get 100% bonus damage, for an average increase of 50%) changes to a flat 50% increase in damage across all attacks.\n------------------------------------\n**Positive Impacts**\n\n* DPS becomes entirely predictable.\n* Low crit values no longer result in lucky spikes.\n* No mechanics outside player control.\n* No bad feelings that you lost a fight due only to random luck.\n* Increases the consistency of harass and trading, as you know every hit will deal the same damage, no matter when or where you land it.\n\n**Negative Impacts**\n\n* Removes the entire feedback loop.\n* Feels no different than purchasing AD, save that you also do not get spell damage increases.\n* Removes all high moments and low moments.\n* Removes all anti-snowball potential.\n* Removes all interactive gameplay elements.\n* Removes all engage elements.\n\n------------------------\n#FURTHER ANALYSIS\n\n**Does it reduce the perception or impact of randomization?**\nYes. This model removes randomization entirely, although it may flatten the gameplay surrounding crit too much.\n\n**Does it create a strong feedback loop?**\nNo. Removal of all surrounding effects and gameplay feel results in the same feedback loop as a flat damage increase.\n\n**Does it create highs and lows in gameplay?**\nNo. It removes all highs and lows.\n\n**Does it retain interaction points or introduce new interaction points?**\nNo. It removes all interaction points in favor of standardized damage increases across the board.\n\n**Does it have major ripple effects?**\nQuite possibly. Infinity Edge likely becomes a desirable item for assassins, divers, and bruisers due to the large AD along with what is now a powerful boost to all auto-attack damage , and Phantom Dancer/Shiv may not give bruisers stronger dueling or wave-clearing power. Phantom Dancer and IE are the biggest concerns.\n\n**How does it impact the laning phase?**\nThe laning phase becomes entirely predictable in terms of damage output, making it relatively safer and more likely to retain a lead you keep.\n\n**How does it impact objective control or teamfighting?**\nDependent on crit values at that time. Fewer squishies will be bursted by lucky crits at low crit values, which definitely favors assassins and mages.\n\n**How does it affect the metagame?**\nUncertain. IE/Phantom Dancer purchasing giving much more damage to divers/bruisers, and spike damage flattening could push more ranged characters into lane against melee where their consistent harass can drive them out more. It's hard to judge the exact impact the change would have.\n\n**How does it impact snowballing?**\nRemoves the ability for a lucky come-back strike, but also removes the frequency with which a champion who is ahead gets a big nova strike. Pushes the lane slightly in favor of the person currently ahead, as the DPS increase is reliable and consistent, and you're not ever in a situation where you miss two critical hits and your opponent lands two.","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2018-02-18T21:45:07.626+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">Removes all anti-snowball potential.\n\nI don't understand that point.\n\nAlso I don't really understand all the negative points about missing interaction and similars.

Given how much the Marksman role relies on auto-attacks, I think there's a lot to be gained from ensuring that there is gameplay in that mechanic other than \"click target.\" It's totally something people may disagree on though.\n\n> The player who's ahead is most likely going to have more crit chance if both are opting into crit as their build (for equal comparison).

Being ahead does favor the person who is ahead in all circumstances, but crit does give occasional windows of opportunity in a few situations, especially with engage-heavy and burst-heavy supports/carries. It's a fairly minor thing that doesn't happen super often, but it's still there.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2018-02-19T04:18:57.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Given how much the Marksman role relies on auto-attacks, I think there's a lot to be gained from ensuring that there is gameplay in that mechanic other than \"click target.\"\n\nThat gameplay should be kit-based, instead of something very homogenous to all champions. Additionally, this is assuming that there is gameplay with random crits at all, and frankly, I think there's very little. You're almost never changing your choices based on crits, baring a rare reaction to an unexpected string or if you're playing a crit-fisher. It's almost always the right decision to play as if crit is going to give you the expected value.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Villainous","date":"2018-02-19T00:57:33.844+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InTheory,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-02-18T21:45:07.626+0000)\n> \n> The player who&#x27;s ahead is most likely going to have more crit chance if both are opting into crit as their build (for equal comparison).

If one person has a longsword and the other has a pickaxe, the person with the better items is going to 100% win every otherwise equal trade. Brawler’s glove v cloak, on the other hand, might even oit in the long run to the cloak guy winning most trades, but there’ll also be plenty, especially if it’s only like 2-3 autos per trade, where there are no crits on either side, or one crit for both, or sometimes even the glove player coming out on top. Crit items aren’t snowbally. Crit’s most powerful/unfair interactions are where two players are on even footing, both building crit, neither in a position to mitigate such things, where one rolls well and the other doesn’t.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-02-19T05:34:28.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Removes all high moments and low moments.\n\nWouldn't low moments being removed be a positive, thus making this neutral?\n\n> Removes all anti-snowball potential.\n\nAnd also removes snowball potential.

You don't see a competent player who is behind actively looking to take unfavorable trades and fights on the off chance that they get lucky and crit more often than expected and that the enemy crits less often. That just seems like more of a hypothetical benefit than a real, practical one. What happens far more often is that either the jungler comes to gank or the support of the ADC that's behind lands CC on the other ADC presenting a situation where the bot lane that's behind will have the advantage and a chance to stop their snowball or even swing it the other way. \n***\nThere's also the aggravation of unpredictable minion crits which can lose you CS and screw with minion prepping while farming under tower. While in a flat damage modifier there's no unpredictability and farming with or without crit feels the exact same. I'd say this is a situation where are no silver linings and it just feels awful all around since it can happen to a player of any skill level where they get punished not because of a mistake they made, but because of an arbitrary design choice within a game mechanic that is not optional if you want to stay competitive.\n***\nLastly I don't see why there's such a push to label lucky or excessive critting as a \"high\", as a player you're not always intently checking to see if every one of your autos crit or not (especially on ranged carries where you'll be focusing on kiting efficiently most of the time) so you may not actively think about or even notice how often you crit. And even if you do notice that you just crit way more than you should and it turned a fight in your favor I'd say most people would, at most, only feel a \"high\" in a momentary: \"sucks to be that guy\", schadenfreude-esque way rather than getting any meaningful satisfaction out of it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-02-19T00:52:21.686+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I very much agree that crit is a subject worth discussing. As a feature that's been present in the game for so long, it's one many people have gotten used to, but which has also nonetheless caused a significant amount of irritation due to its random nature.

Conversely, you generally want to make players feel good, but especially if they achieve a particularly difficult play, and as with low points, giving players high moments for a reason that does not correlate to their skill can come across as confusing in a game that heavily emphasizes skilful play.\n\nOn a more nit-picky level, the difference in phrasing between this:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-02-18T21:23:26.541+0000)\n> \n> * A portion of the player base really likes it.\n\nAnd this:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-02-18T21:23:26.541+0000)\n> \n> * A portion of the player base has a *very* strong negative bias against it.\n\nComes across as snide.

If the objective is to create unpredictable *opportunities*, by introducing new choices that could benefit either side equally, then perhaps that could happen (though even so, the random element would still need to justify its existence over an algorithm based purely on player decisions), but the problem with crit is that it expresses itself primarily through random *output*, i.e. by awarding success or failure to either side in a manner that does not intrinsically stem from skilful play. In a game that has taken great pains to aim for competitive integrity by basing the outcome of matches as much as possible on the actions of players, I therefore do not think any kind of system that preserves output randomness deserves to stay. As such, I do not think suggestions 3 through 6 would solve the problems with crit, as they preserve output randomness.\n\nThis post is getting a bit long already, so I'll make a separate comment for a crit model I had considered, which proposes crit as a three-strike/add-on model.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2018-02-19T13:21:41.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"____\nWell to \"fix\"/\"improve\" critchance we first need to understand why theres randomness in a competitive game in the first place.

However, while I do agree that a certain level of unpredictability is necessary to keep sports fresh and interesting, I'm not sure randomness is needed even in that kind of situation, since League has a sufficiently complex framework that, given enough balancing, it can have such a vast number of strategies and interactions that it would not be easy to predict a game's outcome.\n\nI very much agree with your stance on controlled chaos, and how it can benefit gameplay, which is why, even with my personal distaste for RNG, I do think there is room for some randomness, as long as it presents equal opportunities for both teams. This is why I don't really think the randomness to drakes is inherently bad (how those random drakes interact with swings in team momentum I think might be a problem, though), though it's also why I think stuff like crit or Zoe's W are terrible for good gameplay.\n\nI also am very much on board with you when you say that the basic playstyle of marksmen would be fairly boring without the inconsistency of crit, since many of them would just be very constant damage pumps. However, I think this is already the case, and crit here only acts as a smokescreen to distract from it. Crit I think innately has no real gameplay, so the end result is that the damage output of marksman also lacks interesting gameplay (though marksmen have a lot of potential for interactivity nonetheless). Because of this, I also agree that any replacement to crit should not simply convert the stat into a persistent damage modifier, but should legitimately add gameplay and emphasize components to the playstyle of marksmen that are more interactive (e.g. attacking for a prolonged amount of time, rather than just once or twice).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2018-02-20T00:14:19.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, I would love to further discuss this topic you with right now, but its getting pretty late over here in EU.

Can Crit chance be removed?**\n- **2. Crit Chance not as bad as it seems?**\n- **3. The critchance problem**\n- **4. The problem with most suggestions/ crit alternatives**\n- **5. Math, Math, Math**\n- **6. Super short PRD TL;DR:**\n- **7. My suggestion, a stricter PRD**\n\n___\n\n\n**1. Can Crit chance be removed?**\n\nFrom a technical standpoint: Yes, definitely! It _is_ possible to remove it. But it might not be that easy!\nAs you already mentioned, the game is already pretty complex. The \"boringness\" of AAs can mostly get removed by abilities, mechanics and the overall kit/theme of a champion. The removal of (controlled) randomness is also pretty good from a competativ standpoint, as it makes things absolutly fair.\nSo, given a good alternative, crit chance can be removed! \n\nBefore I go to the suggestions to replace critchance, I will quickly sum up some positves and its problem, for completions sake.\n____\n\n**2. Crit Chance not as bad as it seems?**\n\nLike stated before: crit chance is **not** pure random, this is very important!\nIt uses PRD (pseudo random distribution), which is a very big improvement in terms of \"fairness\". To sum it up it looks at your previous attacks and modifies your critchance, instead of beeing completely independent, to get an overall more equal and less spikey outcome.\nI will explain it later with \"some\" (a ton of) math later.\nSo to make it clear: Its not completely random, it already eliminats a big amount of bad cases, bad outliers.\n\nCrit chance does not only lower the \"boringness\"/\"predictableness\" of AAs by a bit, its made in a way that gives very rewarding visual feedback!\nThe big number with the crit symbol, the chunk of the enemy healthbar and a crit animation/projectial, they all _feel_ exciting and rewarding. Not that \"rewarding\" for the recieving end but it will still get some excitment, a \"holy shit, that dmg!\", out of you :D\n\n> (Low) Crit chance is a double-edged sword, for you and your enemy!\n\nLet's look a bit deeper: crit chance, while beeing random, is still \"fair\" overall. It can bite you, but it can also bite your enemy!\nIf you invest in crit chance, the first amount (<=30) is roughly wasted combat stats. Why? Because its still to unreliable! \nYou cannot count on getting the amount of crits you \"should\" get, in short trades. If you always bet on your luck, it will backfire someday.\nSo on the baseline you \"waste\" gold at the beginning, the risk is high. Obviously you can get lucky, but by the end of this comment you will look at low critchance and critstreaks with completely different eyes!\nTo summarize it, if you invest gold into crit chance you have the right to get power for your money, but with low crit chance its more a risk than anything. You cant make reliable decisions on low critchance.\n\n____\n**3. The critchance problem**\n\nWe now know that low critchance is rather bad, its very unreliable, thus its the \"worst\" part of the critchance randomness, right?\nYes and No. In terms of randomness, yes; it is the worst part. But in terms of \"impact\", no!\nIn the early laningphase 1 or 2 crits dont decide the hole game or the hole laningphase. The problem is if there are 2-3 lucky crits **in one trade!**\n\nIf someone buys crit chance its expected that he/she crits you sometimes. A crit is \"only\" another free AA. Thats something that you should be able to roughly calculate/expect. But 2 or 3 crits in a 5 AA trade with only 10% crit? Thats a bit much!\nSo its not the amount of crits that makes things nessecarily bad, its the amount of crits in a short time period that derail everything!\n\nAnd it goes the other way around with high amounts of crit chance too!\nEven with high critchance you can crit less than you would expect, and lategame every single crit can decide the game!\nThe difference between 300 or 750 raw dmg at the end is much more impactful than ~80-100 more in the laningphase.\n\n>The problem is not just the random amount/ocurence, its the frequency of crits that makes things bad. \n\nKeep this in mind, its important for later!\n\n____\n\n**4. The problem with most suggestions/ crit alternatives**\n\nA lot of people suggest to change crit chance into a flat modifier, or something like \"every x AA deals more dmg/bonus effect/becomes a crit\" etc., or working like fevor, or something along those lines. \n_The big problem, a very big problem with all of them, is **abusability!**_\n\n> Predictable, guaranteed \"crits\" are **extremely unheatly** for the game!!! Especially with low \"crit chance\".   \n\nI cant stress this enough: If something can be abused, it WILL BE abused!\nIts the same with balance suggestions, always treat the \"worst case\" as the default one!\nAnd if the worst case looks bad than you need to tweak your suggestion.\n\nSo any kind of \"stacking\" or x-hit thingy will not work. The can be abused to easly!\nBack then Trynda could \"scout\" if his next AA would crit by looking at his attack animation. If it was the start of his crit animation he cancels the AA and then goes in for a trade with a guaranteed crit!\nThis was very unheatly and was abused a lot. This was luckly fixed, so if you cancel your crit animation you next AA is no longer guaranteed to be a crit.\n\nTo make it short, we have 2 choices:\n\n- improve these suggestions, so they can no longer be abused\n- improve the current system, so these bad frequencies dont occure/ are limited\n\nI personally am ok with the current system, I do have a suggestion to make it even better, but if theres a good alternative I'm fine with that too!\n\n_____\n_____\n\n# The Math and my suggestion to improve the current situation\n____\n\n**5. Math, Math, Math** \n\nFirst off, congraz for making it here and still beeing awake! Not that many people here on boards would read such a massiv wall of text and I'm glad your not one of them! You have my respect.\n\nSince we are approching the limit of text that is endureable in one go, I'll skip the basics of PRD and just refere to an old post of mine.\nIt is still valid, just some minor number tweaks especially in the higher critchance region have changed.\nIt will explain how PRD works and will contain a length description and breakdown of my crit chance improvement suggestion.\n\nSo if you want to torture yourself a bit, I recommend you get yourself some snacks and try to enjoy it as much as possible :D\nHeres the link to my old post, go to point 3. \"More Math\": [SummonersLab, Part 2: Crit Algorithem Improvement](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/Oe9PQnbE-summonerslab-part-2-crit-algorithem-improvement)\nAnd heres the link to a PRD breakdown: [PRD Basics](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Pseudo-random_distribution) \n\n_____\n\n**6. Super short PRD TL;DR:**\n\nIf you have 50% crit chance, you actually only have a 25% chance to crit on your first AA!\n\nIf this AA **DIDNT** crit,_ your next AA gets an additional +25% on top!_\nSo your 2nd AA has a 50% chance to crit.\nIf your AA still did not crit, it gets another +25%, so it has a 75% chance to crit in total.\nIf it still did not crit, it gets +25% again, so we arrive at 100%, which means this AA will guaranteed crit!\n\nAfter a crit you will reset back to the initial 25% crit chance.\n\nSo this series of Crits:\n_C,C,C,C _\ndoesnt not have a **1/16 (~6%) chance** to occure _( 1/2x 1/2x 1/2x 1/2),_\nit only has a** 1/64 to 1/256 (~1.6 - 0.4%) chance** to happen  _(1/4x 1/4x 1/4x 1/4)_ !\n\nAs you can see getting alot of crits in a row is VERY unlikey! Even with decent crit chance.\nKeep this in mind the next time you see this, that person just got pretty lucky!\n____\n\n**7. My suggestion, a stricter PRD**\n\nEven with the PRD in place, which already makes the randomness a lot more fair, there are still some outliers present!\nIt is for example possible to get a lot of crit in a row even with super low crit chance(<20%)!\nIt is highly unlikely, but still possible.\nThe same but a bit stricter can happen with high crit chance, since you reset back to the lower crit chance after a crit means that you have in general a lower critchance than you should have, in short periods.\n\nAs a quick reminder: Over a longer period prd has the same outcome as normal crit chance, they are equal.\nBut in shorter periods things can get wonky! (PRD is still a million times better than normal randomness, even in these cases)\nAnd thats what I want to improve!\n\nIn short: We introduce caps to eliminate those outliers that can break \"fairness\" in shorter periods. We still wand to be random and also dont want to interfere with the normal PRD, we are only touching the troublesome outliers!\nThese caps force us to have NonCritical AAs or guaranteed Crits based on the actual crit chance.\nRemember the amount of crits **IN A SHORT PERIOD** was the big problem we identified. Thats what those caps to fix.\n\n>**The Cap:**\n>\n > - **<=20% CritChance** = _2 NonCrits forced after a Crit_\n > - **>20% - <40% CritChance** = _1 NonCrit forced after a Crit_\n > - **>=40% - <50% CritChance** = _max. 2 Crits in a row (3rd AA will not crit)_\n > - **>=50% - <60% CritChance** = _max 3 Crits in a row AND After 3 NonCritAAs in a row, your next 2 AAs are guarenteed Crits_\n > - **>=60% - <80% CritChance** = _max. 5 Crits in a row AND After 2 NonCritAAs in a row, your next 2 AAs are guarenteed Crits_\n > - **>=80% CritChance** = _After a NonCritAA, your next 3 AAs are guarenteed Crits_\n\nYes this is a tbit complicated, but basically these caps ensure that lucky AND unlucky outliers in high and low critchance get removed.\nIf you have questions or want a more indepth explaination of this, just ask :D\nReached letter limit again..","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-02-22T14:42:29.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congratulations on such an amazing post!

Sure, removing crit would require a rebalancing to many marksmen and some melee carries, but stats like attack speed and attack damage have much more room to be increased here. Even if those aren't what get targeted, champion kits are the perfect spot to add in more power, especially more conditional power unique to each champion.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=000e00000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-02-21T03:58:13.836+0000)\n> \n> Like stated before: crit chance is **not** pure random, this is very important!\n> It uses PRD (pseudo random distribution), which is a very big improvement in terms of &quot;fairness&quot;.

It definitely feels like an awesome burst of damage when it happens less than half the time (when it's at its most unstable), but past a certain point crits just end up being \"normal\" damage per attack for marksmen, causing crits to either become unimpressive, or become so overly prevalent that crit users end up outputting burst per second.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=000e00000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-02-21T03:58:13.836+0000)\n> \n> If you invest in crit chance, the first amount (&lt;=30) is roughly wasted combat stats.

The problem is if there are 2-3 lucky crits **in one trade!**\n\nI actually feel that even one crit in the laning phase really can determine its outcome in certain circumstances. This is why players used to run 1% crit in their old rune setups on the off-chance that they chunked their opponent in a trade. After the first few levels, it's not as bad, but it can really mess people up in the very first few minutes. I do, however, agree that a streak of luck on either side due to crit is guaranteed to frustrate at least one person, which is why random crit distibution needs to obey strict rules if it wants to appear fair at all times. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=000e00000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-02-21T03:58:13.836+0000)\n> \n> A lot of people suggest to change crit chance into a flat modifier, or something like &quot;every x AA deals more dmg/bonus effect/becomes a crit&quot; etc., or working like fevor, or something along those lines. \n> _The big problem, a very big problem with all of them, is **abusability!**_\n\nI too think that many proposed systems, including that energized crit system, do have a problem of abusability, though I don't think the ability to _maximize_ the potential of a mechanic is necessarily abusive. If I may shamelessly plug my own suggestion here, I proposed [an alternative crit model](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/voeyqoFA-a-deeper-dive-into-critical-hits-inputdiscussionalternatives-appreciated?comment=0010) that would basically function like the three-hit passives we see on champions like Vayne or Vi: for sure, the mechanic can be optimized through certain types of play, and would likely require caution/rebalancing towards champions who'd be especially good at applying it, but because the means of applying crits would be innately more interactive (the opponent could play around this model as well), I don't think it could really be qualified as abuse.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=000e00000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-02-21T03:58:13.836+0000)\n> \n> If you have 50% crit chance, you actually only have a 25% chance to crit on your first AA!\n> \n> If this AA **DIDNT** crit,_ your next AA gets an additional +25% on top!_\n> So your 2nd AA has a 50% chance to crit.\n> If your AA still did not crit, it gets another +25%, so it has a 75% chance to crit in total.\n> If it still did not crit, it gets +25% again, so we arrive at 100%, which means this AA will guaranteed crit!\n> \n> After a crit you will reset back to the initial 25% crit chance.\n> \n> In short: We introduce caps to eliminate those outliers that can break &quot;fairness&quot; in shorter periods.

Introducing hard caps to the current pseudorandom number generator, in a manner that wouldn't lend themselves to predictability, would allow the current crit model to feel more consistently fair, without requiring a total overhaul. While I still wouldn't really be a fan of the remaining randomness (the order in which you crit can be important in some fights), I still think this would be a tremendous step forward in establishing a crit system that is less harmful to the integrity of what is meant to be a competitive, skill-based game.

Bad in normal skill range and good in high skill range, or worst in normal and balanced in high.

Past a certain point, though, the stat may as well be a persistent damage amp, and as such it categorically offers no additional gameplay relative to other effects. I agree that the bursty output of crit is important to making marksmen feel more interesting to play, but because of the way that output is currently implemented, it's forced on this sliding scale of unfairness versus boringness: the less consistent crits are, the more exciting each one is, but the less fair it feels as well to get hit by one; the more consistent crits are, the less exciting each one becomes. Crits as a random damage amp I feel are therefore doomed to never truly enhance gameplay without introducing some severe tradeoffs. This is also, however, why I like your proposed improvements to the current crit PRNG, because your suggestions make the very inconsistency of crits more consistent, via enforced crit downtimes or uptimes, and therefore could make it feel a lot fairer.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=000e0000000000000000000100010000,timestamp=2018-02-24T19:45:25.884+0000)\n> \n> To adress the &quot;abuse&quot;/maximize part: If a champion is balanced around that, that is complettely fine.

Bad in normal skill range and good in high skill range, or worst in normal and balanced in high. Its easier to remove &quot;abuse&quot; chases than to balance everything around them.\n\nI agree with this 100%, and I think it is important for all champions to have a baseline amount of reliability, so that they don't become completely useless if things don't work their way, or becoming impossible to play against if they're in the hands of someone like Faker. However, I think one big problem with marksmen right now is that they're _too_ reliable, and lack interactivity to their damage output especially. In this respect, introducing gameplay to their crits that both they and their opponents could play around could alleviate those issues, and hopefully open more opportunities to make marksmen easier to pick up otherwise. I believe marksmen are a class that are heavily balanced around artificial difficulty, i.e. difficulty that isn't dependent upon interaction with other champions, and that they'd become significantly easier to play with some basic improvements to the move and attack-move commands. Doing so while also making marksman less reliable against their opponents could therefore keep their power level at around the same, but also make them feel both a lot smoother and much more interactive.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=000e0000000000000000000100010000,timestamp=2018-02-24T19:45:25.884+0000)\n>\n> For my suggestion:\n> It doenst work wonders, its only designed to remove the worst cases, you still can get pretty unlucky!\n> So it makes things better, but is still 100% (pseudo-) random, just so you dont get your hopes up to high :P\n> And like I said most would never even notice a change. You can still boost your chances but not even close to beeing &quot;abusable&quot;.\n\nI don't think it's really the job of any single mechanic to work miracles, particularly since I feel many of the problems with marksmen are due to their fundamental class design, and not just a single stat, but I do think your proposal could introduce some major improvements by completely eliminating certain outliers that should never happen. If nothing else, your proposal would guarantee that there would never be even a possibility for exceptionally lucky or unlucky streaks, so even if there would still be complaints about the randomness of crits, there wouldn't really be any question of their fairness, since marksmen would get almost exactly the number of crits that they paid for, at all times in every fight.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=000e0000000000000000000100010000,timestamp=2018-02-24T19:45:25.884+0000)\n> \n> Its pretty nice to actually have a discussion once in a while here on boards xD They are (sadly) pretty rare :/\n\nAgree completely.

This flat modifier does *not* critically strike.\n\n**Example**\nTristana has a current attack damage of 100, and a 20% critical strike chance. She has a 20% chance to strike for 50 bonus damage, and deals additional damage on auto-attacks equal to 10% of her base attack damage.\n\nThe expected output for this is equivalent to current critical strike: Over 5 attacks Tristana would deal 10 bonus damage per attack (for 50 bonus damage), and average one critical hit for 50 bonus damage. This equals the normal 100 bonus damage she's expect from the current crit system.\n\nNumbers in this system can be heavily tuned to favor crits or non-crits.\n\n------------------------------------\n**Positive Impacts**\n\n* DPS becomes more predictable.\n* Retains all the existing gameplay and positive features around crits.\n* Makes the impact of each individual crit swing fights 50% less.\n* Gives some consistent damage to back up crits and reduce reliance on them.\n\n**Negative Impacts**\n\n* While it retains all existing gameplay and positive features around crits, it reduces the actual mechanical impact by 50%, which could feel less exciting or make the gameplay matter less. Testing would be required.\n* Still retains randomization that some players strongly dislike.\n* Tones down the existing crit gameplay, which can be bad depending on the player's enjoyment of it.\n* Harder to explain than the current mechanic.\n\n------------------------\n#FURTHER ANALYSIS\n\n**Does it reduce the perception or impact of randomization?**\nYes. It reduces the impact of critical randomness by 50% in terms of actual DPS output.\n\n**Does it create a strong feedback loop?**\nMostly. It retains crit's current feedback loop, but exchanges chunky hits for more consistent damage.\n\n**Does it create highs and lows in gameplay?**\nYes. They are less impactful than current crit, but they are still present.\n\n**Does it retain interaction points or introduce new interaction points?**\nYes. All existing interaction points are preserved, just at reduced individual impact\n\n**Does it have major ripple effects?**\nUnlikely. For the most part the changes are largely gameplay and output neutral, and don't meaningfully change any play patterns.\n\n**How does it impact the laning phase?**\nHarass becomes more consistent but less bursty, which may slightly favor characters who can land it reliably, and crit-fishing is diminished in value. Exact effect are hard to judge on this one, as the change is fairly minor overall.\n\n**How does it impact objective control or teamfighting?**\nRemoves some of the \"do I pursue the target I hit or switch targets\" effect, but impact on the average player should be minimal.\n\n**How does it affect the metagame?**\nLikely no real change, save that crit is less frustrating and damage output is more predictable. Lack of incentive to alter builds and lack of real changes in poke/harass means this one should be fairly free of major impacts.\n\n**How does it impact snowballing?**\n*Slightly* pushes lanes in favor of the dominant role due to the reduced damage for lucky come-back strikes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2018-02-19T00:18:42.828+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, there is some other negative aspect off the RNG: It allows a class that is ment to be about sustained dps to have upfront burst.\nI also have issues with crit in it's funktion as aditional multiplyer for AAs, as it moves all power to non interactive righclicks and awqay from the actuall kits of a champ while forceing a lategame hyperscaleing powercurve, but let's focus on getting rid of RNG for now.\n\nAs for anti snowball, i allways found that to be a stupid argument, i don#t think crit ever influenced decisionmakeing alot and if RNG contributes to a comeback, it doesn't feel like a deserved comeback at all. For me, that's more a negative point, and definitly something that hardly anyone would ever notice if it's gone.\nI also experience the critfishing not as positive or exiting gameplay at all, so that one can argueably be put on negative as much as on positive, since crits don't create interesting scenarios you can react to, they just create a onesided numerical advantage and that's it.\n\nSo about the existing models:\n\n\n - **Precision**\nI feel like Precisiion would be the easist way to solve it, it basically wouldn't need any big balance or kit followup while solveing the RNG related issues.\nHowever, it would be certainly the most boring option, though since most adc reach 80-100% crit at fullbuilt, the 'boring' consistency doesn't seem to bother them...\n  \n- **Focus**\nA bit complicated which causes it to be hard to keept track of. In Theory, it's 100% predictable, but in practice most players will not be able to keep track of their opponents focus and thus crit spikes will still come supprising and create moments of frustration, just how few players actually can keep track id shive procs ans such. \nRanoness is not really and actuall thing, it's a precived thing, In theory, if you have all the data at hand, you can calculate the outcome of a dice role by applying physics. But in practice, we call it random because we simply do not have the needed data(and most also lack the needed equations) to actually calculate or atleast ppredict the outcome.\nA similar issue comes with focus, in theory you can calculate it, but in game you most likely can't and thus the procs are precived somewhat random.\n.\nIt also creats play patterns similar to caits headshot where you built up the crit and then zone your opponent, which means you can get really high value from even small crit numbers duering the laneing phase.\nIt also still creats upfront burst for a sustained dps class.\nWhile this is gameplay, i don't htink it's healthy gameplay.\n.\nP.S. seems like you just did copy-paste the positive ans negative points from Precision. You might want to fix that, cause focus for sure creates high moments, gameplay and feedback.\n\n\n - **Overcrit**\nIt retains RNG but smalers the impact. While i would prefer it to the current crit, i think if we were to adress crit and it's RNG, we should fully remove the RNG and not go for something half assed that retains all the issues just on a smaller scale.\n\n - **Hybrid Precision**\nSame as with overcrit, it doesn't fix the issues but lowers the impact. Not a fan.\n\n - **Scaleing Crits and hybrid scaleing crits**\nAgain not getting rid of RNG and while it's an improvment by lowering the impact of crits, it's not really solveing the issues.\n-------------------------------\n\nSo, what i purpose is something that goes into the direction of Focus and Scaleing Crits(maybe call it 'Critical Strike'\n\nEvery 4th hit against the same target  is a crit and applies special effects. Baseline it does the normal 100% damage with no further effects.\nItems could either simply increase the damage of that hit, or add a speciall effect to it similar to hiw energized works, IE could change it from every 4th to every 3ed hit\n\nThe positive aspects would be:\n\n- it's predictable both in theory and since it's a fixed number of hits also in game(unlike focus)\n- Since it's a fixed rate, one can be creative with on-crit effects which you can't do in a system where crits can proc on nearly every attack, allowing to evt add \n- some utitllity rather than just raw damage to the mechanic, allowing to adress the issues of crit as hyperscaleing multiplyer on point n click damage ontop of the RNG.\n- It creates gameplay and emphasises the singltarget dps focus of adc with the per target stacking while backloading the damage to avoid upfront burst and the 'caitlin situations'(holding onto the stacks for zoneing)\n- it Creates big moments with statisfying feedback that gets boosted by the 'finishing-move' character of the backloaded burst.\n\nThe negative aspects would be:\n\n**- can't be translated 1 to 1 from the old system, so it's alot of work to implement that requires major work on items and champions**\n- evt creates an overload on the crit, makeing it so that getting that 4th hit is all adc are about, meaning champ like lucian that can do so faster and more reliable would be dominant\n- 4hits on the same target might be a to harsh condition to it, so maybe it needs to either be reduced to every 3ed hit and with no items that change that, or to a not targetz bound stacking, but therefor with different stacks for heroes and minions/monsters to still avoid the caitlyn-zoneing and upfront burst.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-02-18T21:24:04.599+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"#SUGGESTION 2: FOCUS (i.e. Crit-Stacking Mechanic)\nAnother variation on a common suggestion, **Focus** is a critical strike replacement based in part on Caitlyn's passive ***Headshot***.\n\nThis model replaces critical strike chance with **focus rate**. Focus charges up to 100 at a rate of (focus rate) focus once per attack, to a maximum of 199. When a champion hits 100 Focus, their next auto-attack reduces his/her focus to **focus value + (old focus value - 100)** and triggers a critical hit, which deals 200% damage.\n\n**Example**\nTristana has a current attack damage of 100, and 20 focus rate. She gains 20 focus per attack, so after 5 attacks she has reached 100 focus, and will score a critical hit for 200 damage on her next attack. Once she has used that attack, his focus resets to 20.\n\n**Example 2**\nTristana has a current attack damage of 150, and 30 focus rate. She gains 30 focus per attack, so after 4 attacks she reaches 120 focus and will score a critical hit for 300 damage on her next attack. Once she has used that attack, his focus resets to 50 (30 base + 20 over).\n\nThis may look slightly complicated, but the base starting value is to ensure that the critical strike itself is counted towards your total attacks (so that 20 focus gets you a crit once every 5 attacks instead of once every 6), and the overflow buffer is so that you are not punished for values that don't evenly fit into 100.\n\n------------------------------------\n**Positive Impacts**\n\n* DPS becomes entirely predictable.\n* Low crit values no longer result in lucky spikes.\n* No mechanics outside player control.\n* No bad feelings that you lost a fight due only to random luck.\n* Increases the consistency of harass and trading, as you know every hit will deal the same damage, no matter when or where you land it.\n\n**Negative Impacts**\n\n* Removes the entire feedback loop.\n* Feels no different than purchasing AD, save that you also do not get spell damage increases.\n* Removes all high moments and low moments.\n* Removes all anti-snowball potential.\n* Removes all interactive gameplay elements.\n* Removes all engage elements.\n\n------------------------\n#FURTHER ANALYSIS\n\n**Does it reduce the perception or impact of randomization?**\nYes. Focus reduces randomization by putting critical hits on a predictable timer.\n\n**Does it create a strong feedback loop?**\nYes. Players get a new resource to manage, and still retain the big chunky hits, big numbers, and animations of current crit.\n\n**Does it create highs and lows in gameplay?**\nYes. You have predictable high points and predictable low points.\n\n**Does it retain interaction points or introduce new interaction points?**\nYes. There is now a new, visible mechanic that lets players know that they (or their opponents) have a critical hit ready to go.\n\n**Does it have major ripple effects?**\nLikely. IE (or any item like it) becomes a super powerful engage tool, specifically on assassins. This can lead to a big boost in the single-target damage coming from divers, AD assassins, and Marksman nova strikes, and likely forces IE as a first rush on any slightly burst damage-focused AD character trying to engage on an enemy.\n\n**How does it impact the laning phase?**\nHarass becomes *much* stronger, as you can routinely predict how to land the highest damage on your opponents. Carries with longer ranges or abilities that synergize well with this become extremely potent. Specific concerns exist for Caitlyn, who already has a similar mechanic and now can double down on it.\n\n**How does it impact objective control or teamfighting?**\nSquishy vulnerability increases, as carries can now precision-target them with critical damage.\n\n**How does it affect the metagame?**\nPotential for huge impact: increased harass damage can force a lot of carries out of the meta, and could also lead to carries finding significant success in other lanes where their currently less consistent early harass can lead to them struggling. Marksman rushing IE appearing mid or top for the reliable 250% damage nuke every 5th attack seems very possible, and potentially infuriating. Assassins or divers doing the same with low crit values and building them on monsters/minions prior to ganks or engages is also a major risk factor, especially with burst options like Dark Harvest, Duskblade, and Trinity Force existing.\n\n**How does it impact snowballing?**\nLikely enables it further, as characters who are ahead are given distinct windows of when they'll be at maximum power, and can use these windows to threaten off other players from farm, or simply to reliably whittle them down before murdering them outright.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-02-19T01:37:49.640+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Suggestion X: Jinxylord Crits/Add-On Crits\n\n* **The model:**\n * _For every champion_, every third strike on a target, i.e. basic attack or offensive ability, is counted as a critical strike, using the critical strike animation if the triggering effect is a basic attack, and a third basic attack animation is lacking.\n * Crit items no longer give a random chance for a crit, but instead _add on_ a bonus effect to each crit. For simplicity's sake, let's assume current crit items grant bonus physical damage on critical strikes equal to triple their critical strike chance.\n * Current three-strike effects are now crit modifiers, adding their own bonus effect onto the champion's critical strikes.\n * Critical strike modifiers need not only be damage, and may add utility or crowd control to every strike, depending on the modifier.\n* **Examples:**\n * Vayne gets Zeal.

Additionally, half of your Critical Strike damage is applied as bonus damage to your auto-attacks. Critical strikes begin at 0% damage, and thus would not trigger.\n\n**Example**\nTristana has a current attack damage of 100, and a 20% critical strike damage from Zeal. She has a 50% chance to deal 20 bonus damage, and deals a flat 10% bonus damage with her autoattacks. Over 10 attacks this equals 200 bonus damage on average (100 from crits and 100 from auto-attacks) -- the same output that the equivalent 20% critical strike chance would get from two crits for 100 bonus damage each.\n\n------------------------------------\n**Positive Impacts**\n\n* All characters that build any crit get a good chance to see critical strike animations.\n* Early game crits hit for significantly less than they do currently.\n* Crit occurrences are far more predictable.\n* Crit isn't hugely impactful in the laning phase as a randomization element, since it's so common.\n* Damage on crits is low enough that it does not impact the laning phase significantly.\n\n**Negative Impacts**\n\n* Critical strike animations might become too frequent.\n* Might be frequent enough that gameplay doesn't feel meaningfully different from a flat damage increase.\n* Removes much of the existing gameplay around critical hits.\n\n------------------------\n#FURTHER ANALYSIS\n\n**Does it reduce the perception or impact of randomization?**\nAlmost certainly. Value of a single crit drops significantly, although randomization is actually still greater post 50% crit.\n\n**Does it create a strong feedback loop?**\nLikely weakens it somewhat, as crits are frequent and far less impactful, especially early on.\n\n**Does it create highs and lows in gameplay?**\nNot especially. Highs and lows are flattened somewhat, and the frequency likely detracts from the impact.\n\n**Does it retain interaction points or introduce new interaction points?**\nNot really. Lowered value of crits means that interaction points only really arise when you start to hit higher values.\n\n**Does it have major ripple effects?**\nUnlikely. Crits, while frequent, aren't especially bursty, which discourages most off-roles from purchasing itemization.\n\n**How does it impact the laning phase?**\nCrits are *significantly* weakened at all levels, likely to the point of almost feeling like just an AD boost. This slightly favors the dominant laner.\n\n**How does it impact objective control or teamfighting?**\nNot a significant change, save that incoming damage becomes very easy to predict.\n\n**How does it affect the metagame?**\nUnlikely to have major changes to the metagame, save that frequency of incoming damage could allow Marksman to solo lane better.\n\n**How does it impact snowballing?**\nDoesn't affect lane snowballing hugely (slight favor to the dominant laner).","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2018-02-18T22:15:21.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No more comments to make here, just wanted to say that I read everything thus far.

Zeal, for example, becomes a 40% chance of 50% bonus damage rather than a 20% chance of 100% bonus damage.\n\nThe other core change is that critical change can stack up to 200%, and any percentage over 100% is a chance to deal an additional 50% bonus damage. At 120% critical hit chance, for example, you have a static 50% damage buff from your critical hit chance, and a 20% chance for an additional 50% damage.\n\n**Example**\nTristana has a current attack damage of 100, and a Zeal, which now gives 40% critical strike chance. She has a 40% chance to strike for 50 bonus damage.\n\n**Example 2**\nTristana has a current attack damage of 100, and 140% critical strike chance. She has a 100% chance to strike for 50 bonus damage, and a 50% chance to strike for an *additional* 50 bonus damage.\n\n------------------------------------\n**Positive Impacts**\n\n* DPS becomes more predictable.\n* Retains all the existing gameplay and positive features around crits (save at 100% critical strike chance, when it is identical to the Precision model).\n* Makes the impact of each individual crit swing fights 50% less.\n* More frequent crits make purchasing crit even more appreciable.\n\n**Negative Impacts**\n\n* Removes the feedback loop at 100% crit chance.\n* Has a weird moment where it \"resets\" the feedback loop, which can be good or bad pending the individual player's perception of how good it feels to buy power.\n* While it retains all existing gameplay and positive features around crits, it reduces the actual mechanical impact by 50%, which could feel less exciting or make the gameplay matter less. Testing would be required.\n* May be difficult for the enemy to \"relearn\" their opponent's crit chance.\n* Still retains randomization that some players strongly dislike.\n* Tones down the existing crit gameplay, which can be bad depending on the player's enjoyment of it.\n* Harder to explain than the current mechanic.\n\n------------------------\n#FURTHER ANALYSIS\n\n**Does it reduce the perception or impact of randomization?**\nYes. It reduces the impact of critical randomness by 50% in terms of actual DPS output, while also raising their frequency by 100% for any given crit value.\n\n**Does it create a strong feedback loop?**\nMostly. It retains crit's current feedback loop, but exchanges chunky hits for more frequent crits. Exact effect of this on the loop is uncertain at this time.\n\n**Does it create highs and lows in gameplay?**\nYes. They are more frequent and less impactful than current crit, but they are still present.\n\n**Does it retain interaction points or introduce new interaction points?**\nYes. All existing interaction points are preserved, just at increased frequency and reduced individual impact.\n\n**Does it have major ripple effects?**\nUnlikely. For the most part the changes are largely gameplay and output neutral, and don't meaningfully change any play patterns.\n\n**How does it impact the laning phase?**\nHarass becomes more consistent but less bursty, which may slightly favor characters who can land it reliably, and crit-fishing is diminished in value. Exact effect are hard to judge on this one, as the change is fairly minor overall.\n\n**How does it impact objective control or teamfighting?**\nSquishies are slightly safer against nova-strikes, and crits being more frequent removes some of the \"do I pursue the target I hit or switch targets\" effect, but impact on the average player should be minimal.\n\n**How does it affect the metagame?**\nLikely no real change, save that crit is less frustrating and more predictable. Lack of incentive to alter builds and lack of real changes in poke/harass means this one should be fairly free of major impacts.\n\n**How does it impact snowballing?**\n*Slightly* pushes lanes in favor of the dominant role due to the reduced chance for lucky come-back strikes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Disulfiram","date":"2018-02-20T23:50:29.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why shouldn't other options be considered besides damage?\nFor example: considering that \"critical hits\" are essentially the game's way of displaying lucky hits on exposed areas, why couldn't they for example:\n\n*  ignore a portion of enemy armor (as if you hit an exposed part, thus strengthening ADCs vs tanks at the cost of damage vs squishies)\n\nor\n\n*  cripple the enemy (a lucky hit to the eyes would blind anyone, one to the legs would slow, one to the hands would make it difficult to wield weapons, etc... one of these could be chosen as the default crippling effect of critting, and this would make the ADCs more self-reliant at the cost of some damage).","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-02-21T00:13:24.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Disulfiram,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=voeyqoFA,comment-id=001b,timestamp=2018-02-20T23:50:29.749+0000)\n>\n> Why shouldn&#x27;t other options be considered besides damage?\n\nI'm not saying they shouldn't be -- just that it was beyond the scope of this particular exercise, which was relative low-scope changes in the perception of the mechanic. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2018-02-19T01:06:28.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think crit is missing the anti-tank thing.

They'd now have to do the math upon buying crit in terms of crit chance + crit damage or alternatively crit chance + basic attack amplifier. Riot has always tried to keep things as simple as possible and that'd be something I consider to be too difficult. \n\nThe best point you made is that while marksmen are tied so heavily to basic attacking, they should have something to play around that makes the single thing they constantly do more attractive. Yet I think this is based on the class to be not the way I'd like them to be. I think these crit interactions should be tied more towards a champion's kit like caitlyn or ashe to make the interaction with crit a) more intersting overall, b) more unqiue for every champion and c) makes it easier for players to keep track of critical strike as a state because they are part of champions/marksmen's kits. \n\nI guess you're not gonna get too much attention on this post - it's too long and gameplay boards members don't like long posts, complicated themes and questions without populist answers.
