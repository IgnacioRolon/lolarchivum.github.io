This version of Miss Fortune is a leader solidifying her grip to power, disdainful of her enemies, prone to a bit of playful mockery, yet flirtatious (sometimes even playful) and not afraid to reach out to potential allies -- even if it means playing friends against each other.\n\nThis is by no means a complete concept, but I&#039;m curious to see if people think this direction captures both aspects of Miss Fortune well enough that it might be worth exploring further.\n\n**Illaoi (First Interaction)**\n*-- What did Gangplank do for you that I can&#039;t do better?*\n*-- You&#039;re right, Illaoi. There&#039;s a new queen in Bilgewater, and change* is *good*.\n*-- I hope you&#039;re over him, priestess. Bilgewater is.*\n*-- I warn you, priestess: I don&#039;t break easily.*\n\n**Twisted Fate (First Interaction)**\n*-- Twisted Fate, you sly dog. How much of Gangplank&rsquo;s booty did you get away with?*\n*-- You cut a dashing figure for a card shark. We should...play.*\n*-- Come on, Fate. I could use a right-hand man, and you know you can do better than Graves.*\n*-- You&rsquo;ve always sought Fortune, Fate. Here I am. Feeling lucky?*\n\n**Graves (First Interaction)**\n*-- Come on, Malcolm. I could use a right-hand man, and you know you can do better than Fate.*\n*-- Gangplank scorned you, but I know value when I see it.*\n*-- Cross me at your own risk, outlaw. I&rsquo;m faster on the trigger than you think.*\n*-- Don&rsquo;t run afoul of fortune in your quest for it, Graves.*\n\n**Gangplank (First Interaction)**\n*-- Not a soul mourned you, dog.*\n*-- I hear the sharks have had a taste of your flesh, captain. Shall we give them the rest?*\n*-- An iron fist, Gangplank? How tediously cliche. You never were one for subtlety.*\n*-- Well look what the wharf rats dragged in.*\n*-- I&#039;ll put a bullet in your skull next time, Gangplank.*\n*-- Not even death wanted you, I see.*\n\n**Firing *Double Up***\n*-- Bang*\n*-- Catch*\n*--* \\**kissing noise*\\*\n\n***Double Up*** **Champion Bounce**\n*These lines are mostly mocking, sardonic lines.

I don't personally see anger or need to reassure herself as much though. To me her anger seems heavily focused on Gangplank, and she seems confident enough and capable enough to orchestrate a rather complex rebellion and confident enough that, even in the knowledge that she might not survive, she goes through with it without a moment's hesitation.\n\nTo me that indicates confidence and, yes, a bit of arrogance. Not a lot, but enough to know that she's damn good at what she does, and that sometimes letting other people know that is better than having them try to challenge her.\n\nI'm definitely going to have to reread her stories though.
