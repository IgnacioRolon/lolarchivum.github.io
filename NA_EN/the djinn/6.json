Thanks to everyone who applied!\n\n-----------------------\n\nHello again, Boards!\n\nIt&rsquo;s time for another Volunteer Moderation Team recruitment thread!\n\nThis time we&rsquo;re doing things a little differently. If you think you&rsquo;re a good fit, hop onto our [Moderator Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification), verify your account, and then ping ***@Moderator*** in the ***#Moderation-Recruitment*** channel. A member of the volunteer team will pull you into a room to chat for a bit, and we&rsquo;ll get back to you on Discord if we think you&rsquo;re what we&rsquo;re looking for. Note that, as we *are* a volunteer team (and there is a major US holiday this weekend), you might not get an immediate response, but we will try to get to everyone as quickly and efficiently as we can. It&#039;s a bit of an experiment, so bear with us.\n--------\n#What We&rsquo;re Looking For\n\n* A good understanding of the Board Rules and the Summoner&rsquo;s Code, and a willingness to enforce both on the Boards.\n* A desire to help keep the boards ship-shape (well, board-shaped) through active moderation.\n* An interest in generally improving the Board Community.\n* The ability to work in a team environment.\n* The ability to make independent decisions and utilize moderator discretion, and a willingness to discuss your decisions later if the need arises.\n* An understanding that, as part of your moderation responsibilities, you may sometimes be asked to enforce rules or accept decisions that you may not personally fully agree with.\n* Good conflict resolution and de-escalation skills.\n* The ability to both give and accept constructive feedback.\n-------------\n#Nifty Bonuses\n\n* A good posting history, free of serious violations.\n* A strong, largely positive community presence.\n--------------\nLooking forward to chatting with you, and ask any questions you might have below!\n\n##--**_The Volunteer Team_**","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-29T22:08:22.735+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i1.wp.com/blog.treepeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Anchor-Games-I-VOLUNTEER.gif\n\nNot sure if I qualify but I have the motivation and most of the skills necessary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2018-03-29T21:56:54.298+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/833/140/a12.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Odysseus263","date":"2018-03-30T08:47:29.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Attysu The Poro,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=nYLjkZtx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-03-29T21:56:54.298+0000)\n>\n> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/833/140/a12.gif\n\nc-.. c-carry me senpai..\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-01T01:24:18.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Attysu The Poro,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=nYLjkZtx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-03-29T21:56:54.298+0000)\n>\n> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/833/140/a12.gif\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sex Crazed Eve","date":"2018-03-29T23:39:31.435+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"make me a mod so I can ban anyone who disagrees with me","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-30T17:53:36.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don’t make her a mod.\n\nYour move.","replies":[{"poster":"Sex Crazed Eve","date":"2018-03-30T19:12:41.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"w0w r00d","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-30T19:20:22.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kid. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BestJhinUniverse","date":"2018-03-31T02:14:16.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sèx Crazed Eve,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=nYLjkZtx,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-03-29T23:39:31.435+0000)\n>\n> make me a mod so I can ban anyone who disagrees with me\n\nSounds like you're a perfect fit for the slave labor. \n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Nunu","date":"2018-03-30T12:21:02.382+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:20}} : Here we go!\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/lapuoda6bee.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-03-31T00:52:09.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get the norm is wait for people to show interest, but have you all ever approached someone or dropped a hint to those you want to apply?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2018-03-31T04:29:18.537+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes, though that doesn't mean if we haven't approached you we think you're not a good fit or aren't interested, nor does it mean anyone we approach gets a foot in the door.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-03-31T10:15:06.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course ^-^ .

No appreciation and no way to revamp the boards in a way you think is better for boards as a discussion plattform.\n- I don't agree to the laissez-faire rules that are the reason why gameplay boards are such a huge mess and no matter how hard you dislike the toxicity there - a mod is not allowed to remove the most shit as long as they're not asking someone to die. \n- Even though I'm lurking here quite regularly, I don't like to put myself in a position where I'm required to be active at some point. I'm one of those guys that takes their duty very seriously IF they opt into one.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2018-03-31T18:19:42.375+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"You might be more interested in it than you think, then.\n\n- We are supported and we do have the ability to make changes to the boards, and our input on it is taken seriously. We are limited in what we can get, but we do more than just moderate.\n- Gameplay is a really hard place to take care of, but we do action on offensive and abusive behavior there the same as the other sub-boards, it really doesn't need to be threats before we take action. The negative and low-effort environment there is something that is near the top of our list for improving; if you're really passionate about changing this, we're interested in seeing what you've got to say.\n- We don't require a high amount of activity on the boards, or a quota for making mod actions. The position is a volunteer one and the Volunteers are only expected to give what they are able and willing to. When we are looking at posting history, we do prefer more activity but high activity isn't required, more just helps us get a better feel for if you're a good fit.","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2018-04-02T21:19:49.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't consider myself unbiased enough to do such a job.
