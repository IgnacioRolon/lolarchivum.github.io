There's simply always a more useful option.\r\n\r\nWhat if we really mixed things up though?\r\n\r\nBelow is a suggestion for a mid-game item called **Aether Blade**, which transitions into a NEW **Essence Reaver** for the late-game. It's designed to give AD-based spell-casters the mana and damage they need to thrive in the mid-game (at the expense of the raw damage or great sustain they might be able to get elsewhere), while offering a competitive end-game item for those who rely on spell-casts: while the raw damage might not rival that of **Infinity Edge** or **The Bloodthirster**, this version of **Essence Reaver** grants a few appealing things: the ability to easily hit 40% Cooldown Reduction with just masteries and **Boots of Lucidity**, a hefty chunk of armor penetration so your abilities hit harder, and a great form of mana sustain to make sure you can keep up your harass from now until Doomsday.\r\n\r\nThoughts and opinions are greatly appreciated: I've approximated the numbers, but I really need the community's input to decide if the stats are worth it (i.e. would you buy this on, say, **Urgot, Lucian, Pantheon, Talon, Corki,** etc.), or if the item is too aggressively costed (it's gold efficient without the passive or the armor penetration, mostly because it's an unusual item with niche appeal, and you have to give up reliable health sustain if you get it early).\r\n\r\nAnyway, here are the items:\r\n---\r\n**Aether Blade**\r\n***Build Path ***– Sapphire Crystal + Longsword + 490 gold (total cost: 1250 gold)\r\n\r\n\t+20 AD\r\n\t+200 Mana\r\n\t+10% Cooldown Reduction\r\n\r\n***Unique Passive ***– *Essence Thief*: You regain 4% of physical damage you deal as mana (half for AoE abilities).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Essence Reaver**\r\n***Build Path*** – Aether Blade + Brutalizer + 613 gold (total cost: 3200 gold)\r\n\r\n\t+60 AD\r\n\t+250 Mana\r\n\t+20% Cooldown Reduction\r\n\t+25 Armor Penetration\r\n\r\n***Unique Passive*** – *Essence Thief*: You regain 8% of physical damage you deal as mana (half for AoE abilities).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThoughts? Suggestions? Comments? Criticism?\r\n\r\nWould these items tempt you on a spell-heavy Marksman or AD Assassin? Why or why not? What could be improved?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n*-The Djinn*","replies":[{"poster":"TecToNiiC","date":"2014-10-03T16:49:27.499+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your new ER as well as the new halfway item.\n\nIMHO: aether blade has great stats and shouldnt overpower or push any other mid tier items out of viability as it has a good target champ base.  I am a bit concerned with the Reavers stats though.  The 20% cdr just seems too high. I understand you are going for the 20 + 15 + 5 but 20% cdr on an item that provides good sustain as well as solid damage and armor pen just seems to much.  I also feel that 25 flat armor pen is slightly too high as well.\n\nstill IMHO: 15% cdr and 20 armor pen.  Im assuming these would be unique as well.\n\nNot meaning to nitpick as I really like the concept.  I would definitely get this on someone like jayce","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-03T22:49:02.424+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He could easily solve both problems by giving Aetherblade 5% CDR and ER 15%. This way, Aetherblade gives you a round 10% CDR combined with masteries when you're still in early game, and rounds it up to 20% with masteries when you finish the whole item.

It's better to tweak what is now than to try to provide a completely different answer for AD's mana issues.\n\nYou new items would have a hard time fitting in. On Marksman you would be hard-pressed to fit it into their rigid builds, being forced to give up either LW or your defensive item. The number of AD casters just about extends from Jayce to the resident assassins Kha and Talon to Pantheon, and they all would appreciate an item similar to this, yet there could be complications with suddenly providing them another Armor Pen item that also makes spamming easier. You could also consider champs like Udyr, but he would better appreciate the original Lifesteal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-10-03T17:08:17.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"While it would probably work for ad-assasins, i feel like it lacks an place for ad-carrys.\neven on a caster-oriented adc, u want atleast a bit AS(usually trinity for me).
