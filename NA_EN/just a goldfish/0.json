(i think i remembered reading a few champions have increased ult cooldowns like syndra) but there's many other champions that prosper greatly off the small map/lane size and reduced player count. if riot doesn't want to try to actively balance those champs it's understandable but i think you should at least get to ban some of the cancer away","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2017-05-17T19:55:37.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd kill the queue times even more unfortunately. :/ They won't be able to do it unless TT got a lot more people playing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Just a Goldfish","date":"2017-05-18T19:09:50.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShadowParker,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HEpMwERh,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-05-17T19:55:37.863+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;d kill the queue times even more unfortunately. :/ They won&#x27;t be able to do it unless TT got a lot more people playing it.\n\nI feel that part of the queue problem with normal treeline is the fact that there are no bans. I mean I've played a lot of treeline lately, because sometimes you don't want to play a full SR but ARAM isn't appealing either.  I haven't run into any bots, just other players but they all play the same champs like galio, poppy, zac, maokai, yauso--to the point where if you want to queue up in treeline you basically have to assemble a team around the counters to  those champions, which is obnoxious when you just want a quick game to end the night or whatever. \n\nBut I can also see how the draft phase would further deter some people. Idk, I guess there's a lot riot would have to do if they actually wanted treeline to get more play. They don't seem to care much right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elkington VI","date":"2017-05-17T18:05:23.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sure you mean bruisers {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:420}} \n\nMobile damage dealers, that thrive on snowballing, are doing just as well on 3v3 as they are. Yasuo and Graves are two of the strongest DPS champs on the map. In contrast, most tanks aren't actually doing that well. Poppy, Sej, and Galio are doing well, while others have varying degrees of success. There are so many champs/comps that are potentially overbearing on TT that I don't feel like a draft mode would really help. \n\nPlaying against premades is the real problem imo, especially on NA. On a map with no vision, or space to work with, even the slightest advantage in communication makes a large difference. Often it just leads to one-sided stomps, with the losing side being tilted while having no clue what to do.
