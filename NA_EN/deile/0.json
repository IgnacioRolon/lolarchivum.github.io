Got a gtx 1080 and all other parts way above what league needs to run properly. Always had to lock my frames, because getting above 400 makes the game unplayable with teleporting champions. Not a problem tho, locked my fps at 144 and played without any complications whatsoever. Unfortunately, since 2-3 patches, my fps fluctuate from 140 to 142 while capped at 144, while still being above 400 when I unlock them. Not like it is a deal breaker, doesn't really affect the game much, but hell if it doesn't bother me anyways. Any ideas what might be causing it?\r\n\r\nDeile","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T04:31:02.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those teleporting champions are a pretty good sign that your network might be having troubles with packet loss.
