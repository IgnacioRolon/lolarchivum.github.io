As of now they are heavily layered lower and overshadowed by walking/attacking voicelines most of the time or 60% of the time don't trigger at all; it just sucks that you don't hear them more often. \n\nThe only instance where you can hear them consistently is the spectate mode. They kinda exist in the game but most people just miss out on them since they cannot be heard on a constant manner. Why make them then in the first place when I can't even hear them? \n\nMaking them interrupt any other voiceline to trigger themselves would alone add more flair to the game, I mean how hard it is to just make these interactions take priority over usual taunts/other common voicelines/make them louder/increase range at which they trigger/lessen surrounding sounds to hear them while they're playing? Not to mention being able for both parties to hear them well. This also could totally be optional and adjustable in settings too to not interfere with ranked situations where you need to hear specific sounds.\nAnyone agree?","replies":[{"poster":"Ampson","date":"2018-10-22T20:21:09.730+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, TrueMortal v2! Thanks for your thoughts! Just wanted to give you some context as to why the VO behaves the way it does. \n\nAs a general rule, if a Champion is in the middle of speaking/playing a VO line, then no other VO trigger will interrupt it. This is to avoid unnatural speaking patterns. If that wasn't the case, you'd have a ton of VO lines being interrupted and it ultimately disrupts the flow of dialogue, leading to situations where you may never hear certain VO lines while you are moving or attacking for example. The _only_ exceptions are vocal lines/efforts when you use your ultimate or when you die, because these are high priority gameplay notifications (your ultimate VO lets you and everyone else know that you are using your ultimate power and also when you die your Champion shouldn't be speaking anymore.)\n\nTo your point about hearing special VO triggers more often in Spectator Mode - this is because the majority of special VO triggers don't have to compete with attack and move lines, which only plays on a per client basis. So there's a much larger area of time that VO can play, since it's not interrupting other VO lines.\n\nWe _are definitely_ trying to automate more VO triggers so that you get more character flavor in new and unique ways though. For example, instead of taunts, we are putting more emphasis on \"first encounter\" VO lines that trigger automatically when you first see an enemy. No more awkward moments trying to stand close to an enemy and taunting them. :) \n\nWe are constantly trying to evolve our VO system, so definitely let us know more of what you like/dislike or any cool ideas!","replies":[{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-10-22T21:30:49.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ampson,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ZjcFWFUP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-22T20:21:09.730+0000)\n>\n> Hey, TrueMortal v2!

Thanks for taking your time to reply.\n\nSo by that quote as I understand it you mean: when special line of gialogue/interaction IS IN FACT triggered it is not interrupted by other common voicelines, as the general rule states. On the other hand, If I kill X champion while in the middle of lets say walking voiceover, and there SHOULD be a special voice after I kill said champion for my one, it WON'T trigger as well, again, just as the rule prescribes.\nSince common VO's are, well, used regularly and easily, and special interactions are rare/need specific circumstances(you not being in the middle of some other voice being played)/not triggered as often, for the most part in my opinion you are sacrificing noticability of those interactions for... better common voiceline consistency? Doesn't really help to be honest. Special dialogue is still left in the back trying to break through this common talk wall.\n\nI'm not a sound designer or anything, but maybe a possible solution to this problem could be something like this: if an event during which special dialogue might occur is ABOUT TO trigger or THE MOMENT IT triggers, no common voiceline should be heared for X amount of time and special ones should take priority so that the moment they can trigger, they will. Though, this might need adjustments to quite a large group of champions on individual level. \n\nEdit: another thought I'd like to share: common voicelines don't last long usually. I'm not sure whether the following is already in the game (again,it's hard to tell as of now), but what if in an instance where a special interaction occurs, but you're in the middle of common line, the special dialogue could trigger right after (around a second later maybe) that line is finished? You would only need to increase the time for it to let it trigger e.g. 5-6 secs after an interaction has occured so that any common lines inbetween could be finished and said dialogue could start. It doesn't cause weird interruptions nor disrupts the dialogue flow and REALLY helps the issue here. As of now I believe there is a timer inbetween any dialogue that a champion says, be it common or unique\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ampson","date":"2018-10-24T00:21:43.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great points! Let me dive a little deeper with you in how our VO system current works. Each Champion VO set has a \"global cooldown\" so that we can control how often you hear a champion speak. Within that, each VO trigger also has its own cooldown so that we can control how often you hear certain VO triggers, like Move lines, Attack, Kills, etc. On top of that, each VO trigger can \"ignore\" the global cooldown, so it will always plays even if it's in cooldown mode, like ultimate efforts or death efforts. \n\nIn the instance when you kill another champion, there are many things that happen. First is the Announcer VO plays, and she is the top in priority because she is the utmost importance in understanding the gameplay. All special champion VO (like kills and such) will effectively \"wait\" for her VO to stop playing before playing themselves. This could actually take several seconds because the Announcer may have a string of triggers to play, which then may make your Champion Kill VO line irrelevant. Also, those special interaction VO lines are all 3D (triggered within the map and tied to an object), so if you move yourself off camera, you actually won't hear them anymore. \n\nYou bring up so great points and I think we can investigate having special interaction VO ignore the global cooldown so that if no other VO line is playing and the current global cooldown for that champion is still on, it will always play and be heard. I think that may help the situations you are referring to! :)\n\nIt's a hard balancing act, because we want to make sure the VO reflects the champion's character but we don't want to make them feel \"chatty\" or that they start getting in the way of important gameplay. It's a fine line between \"I wish I heard more of these lines\" and \"Wow, can they shut up now? They're so annoying.\"","replies":[{"poster":"VG Crows","date":"2018-10-24T07:42:22.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply again, Ampson! \n\nAlright, well, if your revisit into the VO cooldowns/global cooldowns would help the issue,I'm totally content with that.
