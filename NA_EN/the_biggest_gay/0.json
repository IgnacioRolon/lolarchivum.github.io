Whenever I ulted and jumped onto any of them I couldn&#039;t kill them because of some reason. For example tryndamere would press r, talon would press r, and vayne would press r and tumble so i couldn&#039;t hit them. this wasn&#039;t a problem early game because i could buy pink wards to see them. However, come late game, you can&#039;t buy anymore pink wards because you&#039;re inventory is full, so I lost as 18/6 rengar because there is no way i could have seen them. What was I supposed to do?\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-06-25T21:32:21.659+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"the fucking rengar is complaining about getting vision on invisible champions\nTHE FUCKING RENGAR\ni hope this is ironic","replies":[{"poster":"DrugsForRobots","date":"2016-06-26T05:27:31.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:35}} It's beautiful how stealth counters stealth, isn't it? The thrill of the hunt, the excitement of hiding in plain sight. Why ruin the fun with Pink Wards and Oracle's? Surely, if Shaco could be heard laughing if he's near you, in addition the puff of smoke as he vanishes (which could be a bit larger and more vibrant), wouldn't that be enough?\n\nAnd if each instance of stealth had its own littler quirks and clues that sharp players (good players) _could_ pick up on, wouldn't that at least be a fighting chance?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-25T21:50:10.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar ult gives vision of invis champions, or at least it used to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrugsForRobots","date":"2016-06-26T05:56:28.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pink Wards shouldn't be the answer to stealth. It's not fun or fair, as a stealth player, to have a core function of the champ's kit negated by a 75g or FREE item. Imagine a 75g or FREE (on a 60s cooldown) item that was a consumable spell-shield / cleanse. Ridiculous, right? Tell me, what is the counterplay to an instant speed AoE True Sight consumable?\n\nThe problem might be stealth, but the answer isn't just more true sight. It's got to be softer counters. Maybe each instance of stealth could have it's own tell-tale signs that keen and astute players can pick up on, and maybe in some cases model collision and / or excessive damage will grant a temporary visibility. \n\nPersonally, I'd love to see Riot explore the possibilities, giving us more unique and diverse forms of sight, stealth, detection, and vision-denial. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it's the least explored design space in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Biggest Gay","date":"2016-06-25T22:08:30.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's after i leap on them... vision is gone.
