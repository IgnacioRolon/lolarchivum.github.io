I got a 2 week ban a few weeks ago and tried to be much nicer. Thought that I was acting at a decent level since this is how most players I see talk to each other. Basically I got angry because my jungler fed two kills the my laner within the first few minutes of the game, and then later started rapidly flaming me for &quot;losing lane on my own because I&#039;m bad&quot;. Their entire team agreed that my jungler and mid had screwed me over for the game due to never coming to break a 8 minute long freeze, feeding my lane, and just being overall useless to the team.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nFilthyLibtard: nice\r\nFilthyLibtard: 1 \t\r\nPyke\r\nSupport \t38.72% \t10.11%\r\nFilthyLibtard: who do u want as support\r\nFilthyLibtard: i got autofilled\r\nFilthyLibtard: so it doesnt really matter to me\r\nFilthyLibtard: kek\r\nFilthyLibtard: yes\r\nIn-Game\r\nFilthyLibtard: this is gonna be interesting\r\nFilthyLibtard: oh boy\r\nFilthyLibtard: like who\r\nFilthyLibtard: garen needs rework so bad\r\nFilthyLibtard: ff15\r\nFilthyLibtard: ff15 i dont know what the fuck u guys are doing\r\nFilthyLibtard: 2v3\r\nFilthyLibtard: lmao\r\nFilthyLibtard: open mid\r\nFilthyLibtard: worst jg ive seen in months\r\nFilthyLibtard: galio open mid\r\nFilthyLibtard: this game is 100% over\r\nFilthyLibtard: if we dont open ill probs just afk\r\nFilthyLibtard: not worth my time\r\nFilthyLibtard: playing with silver jgs\r\nFilthyLibtard: reporting will do literally nothing\r\nFilthyLibtard: learn to speak english first\r\nFilthyLibtard: then maybe they could understand u\r\nFilthyLibtard: U MISSED UR Q\r\nFilthyLibtard: HAHAHA\r\nFilthyLibtard: gj udyr\r\nFilthyLibtard: who asked for a lane?\r\nFilthyLibtard: and wow i lose after u manage to feed 2 kills and an assist into him?\r\nFilthyLibtard: wow\r\nFilthyLibtard: lUciAN cS BetTEr PlEaSE\r\nFilthyLibtard: i wouldnt have healed u either\r\nFilthyLibtard: after u int like that\r\nFilthyLibtard: 3 kill garen\r\nFilthyLibtard: none of which are mine\r\nFilthyLibtard: 0/3/0 mid &quot;i will save this game&quot;\r\nFilthyLibtard: 0/2/0 jg &quot;youre fault u lost&quot;\r\nFilthyLibtard: what this udyr needs to do is just go ahead and say &quot;sorry i literally fucked ur lane 3 times&quot;\r\nFilthyLibtard: LUL\r\nFilthyLibtard: lmao he says its my fault for losing\r\nFilthyLibtard: after he feeds him\r\nFilthyLibtard: that i cant lane vs garen rn\r\nFilthyLibtard: these teams are hilarious man\r\nFilthyLibtard: istg i see the same shit on my smurf\r\nFilthyLibtard: the enemy team\r\nFilthyLibtard: who is clearly better\r\nFilthyLibtard: than all of u?\r\nFilthyLibtard: lmao i was doing\r\nFilthyLibtard: perfectly fine against him\r\nFilthyLibtard: until u fed him 2 kills\r\nFilthyLibtard: now thats just mean\r\nFilthyLibtard: Galio - &quot;I will save this game&quot;\r\nFilthyLibtard: when u have no comeback to feeding so u just say ur team is toxic\r\nFilthyLibtard: cant wait to\r\nFilthyLibtard: report udyr pls and ty &lt;3","replies":[]}
