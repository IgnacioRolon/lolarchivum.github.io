(For example English text with Japanese/Korean voices is what I'd like specifically) And some people have already found a way to make that happen by accessing the files and transferring them and such as directed in this forum post: **http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2471764**\r\n\r\nBut to be honest, it's a real hassle to manage all of those files especially when (we'll use Japan for example) Japan may not be on the same patch as we are on in the USA, and like some champions don't have the changed voices which is all just a big mess. So I was wondering if there was anyway in maybe like a future patch Riot could add the option to change up your voices/text if you please to a different language whilst keeping your files untouched? And if the patches are off depending on the place you choose it could notify you of the differences and keep whatever it may be the same based on your region until the patch comes out over there? \r\n\r\nI'd really like to enhance my LoL experience and play with those sweet VO's in Japanese (or Korean if I must) whilst keeping the text English and my files untouched. I also didn't quite know which board to post this on so I hope I'm at the right place.\r\n\r\nThanks very much, Skream.","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2016-07-28T18:04:51.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something i would definitely like to see. I've been playing League for quite a while, and playing with the japanese VO would shake things up in a fun way :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T17:55:45.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Skream,\n\nThe correct section of the boards to post suggestions is on the [Miscellaneous](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) sub-boards.

It doesn't have to be some big standalone thing that is featured but it would be nice, cool, and convenient for players to have it and I think they'd appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}
