I looked at other boards talking about this and they say that your mmr has to be a certain number for you to be demoted.** But what is that number?** Mine is 1247. **Is there a certain amount of games you have to lose to be demoted?**","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T22:22:45.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, there's no way to know your true MMR. Third party sites use different algorithms to estimate your MMR, but they don't have access to that information through the Riot API like they do with match history or your Rank/League information. \n\nAdditionally, there's no set MMR number to be demoted, and typically the system will place you where it believes you should be, based on your performance in matches. Our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) covers any details I may have missed on.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
