Holding shift while left clicking fixes this.\r\n-Cannot left click the minimap to move my screen.  Holding shift fixes this as well.\r\n-Cannot ping using G or V, but Alt works for some reason. (G is the assigned ping key according to the hotkey menu)\r\n-With quickcast DISABLED, QWER are effectively disabled.  Everything works normally with quickcast on.\r\n\r\nThings I've tried:\r\n-Using \"Restore Defaults\" in game.\r\n-Deleting the entire \"Config\" folder\r\n-Logging onto her account from my computer.  No worky worky.\r\n-Logging onto my account from her computer.  Works fine.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the problem follows the account is confusing the hell out of me, because I can't find any account specific settings.\r\n\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T22:54:02.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should be able to be resolved after deleting the config folder while in a custom match. As a refresher, the config folder can be found in the directory below:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\nAfter you delete the folder, leave the custom match, then hop into another to confirm the changes went through.
