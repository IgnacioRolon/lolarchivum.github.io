Indeed, we can look into swapping summoner names!  Just make sure you have the currency to pay for a name change, and able to verify both accounts as yours.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and we'll help with that.  See you there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-05-25T09:26:22.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Phil,\n\nYes you can switch the names of two accounts! This article here https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752814-Summoner-Name-FAQ explains how (scroll down to the section I HAVE MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS - CAN I SWAP THEIR SUMMONER NAMES?). What you need to do (in case that article doesn't load) is have the required amount of RP/IP that you normally would (1300 Rp or 13,900 IP) and both accounts need to be on the same server. You also need to submit the request to player support with a title of Summoner Name Swap and send them this information below: \n\nACCOUNT ONE\n\nYour account name (What you log in to the game with)\nYour Summoner name (What other players see in game)\nWhich server you play on (NA, EU West, or EU Nordic & East)\nEmail used to register the account:\n\nACCOUNT TWO\n\nYour account name (What you log in to the game with)\nYour Summoner name (What other players see in game)\nWhich server you play on (NA, EU West, or EU Nordic & East)\nEmail used to register the account:\n\nTo answer you other question about how long until the names become free to use, see this other article about summoner name decay here --> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914 . Essentially, the article outlines some basic criteria for activity protection: \n\n(1) Each Summoner name will have 6 months of inactivity protection upon creation.\n(2) Each Summoner name will earn an additional month of inactivity protection for each Summoner level above 6.\n(3) Inactivity is defined to be a period in which no games of any kind have been played on the account.\n(4) When inactivity protection expires, your name will be available to be claimed through the Summoner name Change service in the store.\n\nI hope this information helps you!","replies":[]}]}
