Even if I am super fed, I feel I am useless in teamfights despite getting quite fed. Especially when ADC is positioned so well, there just seems no way for me to come close unless the adc is zoned or stunned already.\r\n\r\nThe problem that comes with me playing Sion is, I just feel I lack damage in general during teamfights. For example, I wont R Q in to the enemy because I know it will never land and the risk that involves me doing so is not worth at all. Go in R Q and the AOE damage it provides is never going to land already. So I mostly spam E Q from behind offering some peel and some front line durability(when there is plenty of damage).\r\n\r\nWhen there is plenty of squishies, I try to get a good E on them as they dodge me quite easily if I dont. If a melee or a bruiser, I wont be able to burst them 100-0, so I will once again peel for the team with E Q combo.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Playing Sion feels like 2nd support","replies":[]}
