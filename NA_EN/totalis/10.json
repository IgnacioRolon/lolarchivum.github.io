Now he can farm at range for free due to a earlier buff and trade very well in melee due to the most recent one as the ideal top lane meta tank.\n\nMay lack hard CC but his damage is very good against anything with % current hp and insane ad steroids. It's a mixed dmg setup.\n\nHis jungle clear is super fast. Having a lot of fun with the Mundo jungle myself honestly...\n\nGrevious wound item..? I just consider his ult as an emergency tool. IDC really. If enemy rushes it too early in lane early their stats are RUINED. I mean it's just Mundo's ult and not really intricate to his kit unlike Vlad.\n\nI'm playing Mundo I just do w/e the heck I want he's so strong and beefy, can duel like any jungler. Tough to kill. Can run away and kite with cleavers if actually in danger.\n\nPlus tanks in general not really became stronger but more _necessary_ since ADC changes","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2015-11-16T18:36:41.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should keep in mind that most people on gameplay doesnt even play the game and just circlejerk onto stuff instead of actually trying them out LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-11-16T17:13:32.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to note that currently the Jungle win rates are slightly messed up on champion.gg due to a mix-up in Jungle builds.
