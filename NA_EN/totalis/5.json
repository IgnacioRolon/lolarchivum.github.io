His mobility at least made sense in the context of a fighter, what with his entire kit looking like it was outright designed for high mobility and being in their face fairly often.\n\nThat said, before he was turned back into a burst assassin, he could have used his numbers toned down a little and I think most people would've been fine with him. Other than, y'know, people that just plain hate Fizz' existence in the first place.
