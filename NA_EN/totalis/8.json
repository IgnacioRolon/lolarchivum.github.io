I know for me, I voted for diana to get the new skin, but that&#039;s the only vote I put in. Ill watch the NA all star team play when they're up, but other than that I don&#039;t feel like watching anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-12-12T21:10:10.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want ice to win because then diana gets an ice themed skin right? Sounds better then a fire themed one.\n\nNot sure if my interest in the event fits into one of your categories but I would say I have moderate interest in the event. The 1v1s are cool because it is different from anything they usually do but a few of the other events are cool too like the all marksmen thing. The strait up 5v5s aren't that great though because the current patch isn't really balanced for it.","replies":[]}]}
