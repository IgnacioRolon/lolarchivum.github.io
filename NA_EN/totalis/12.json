If it's a loss for them either way WHY would they even bother to surrender? And in dynamic queue were premades are more common and can be larger than 2, it makes it even worse.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-04-26T23:18:01.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point is that if premades are not punished along with their AFK team member, they could abuse it by picking one of their members to go AFK. The way it's shaping up, the worse case is that the premade with the AFK simply refuses to remake the game, and it continues as it would without the remake system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zelgoth0002","date":"2016-04-26T23:13:34.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this did happen, I see another \"ZZ'Rot\" problem.

If you do not have time to sit down and play for 60 minutes, do not queue.  If you do not have a good internet connection, do not queue in ranked.","replies":[]}]}
