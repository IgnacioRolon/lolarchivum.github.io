So after my ban I play a game and it was so hard because it was at night and I had a storm near me which kept giving me freezes as soon as I joined. So early I died a couple of times which my team kept flaming me for. Below is my chat, ofcourse the enemy words arent there because this is from the ingame card. Ill give slight explanations and leave your judgment if I deserve an account I paid alot in and took seriously to be permanently banned because of this game, and if i truly was toxic or not...\r\n\r\n[All]Throbbing Cawk: OMG LAG\r\nThrobbing Cawk: wtf\r\nThrobbing Cawk: toxic kid  &lt;--------- (as soon as i died i got flamed then as you see down the other player joined in and kept flaming the shit out of me aswell and they were premade)\r\n[All]Throbbing Cawk: shyvana and darius premade toxic\r\n[All]Throbbing Cawk: shyvana toxic, then come mid and bait me, im waiting for him to insulkt\r\n[All]Throbbing Cawk: here we go &lt;------ ( he came mid baited me to fight, i went in then he stood spamming laugh and flamed me in chat and actually insulted me lol)\r\nThrobbing Cawk: why not help\r\nThrobbing Cawk: from beginning\r\nThrobbing Cawk: ffs\r\nThrobbing Cawk: you know what &lt;------ constant flame i was just fed up\r\nThrobbing Cawk: i mute all man\r\nThrobbing Cawk: gl\r\nThrobbing Cawk: we lose or win gl\r\nThrobbing Cawk: camp me &lt;---- (we started to gain traction and i started to get fed and i unmuted them which was a big freakin mistake)\r\nThrobbing Cawk: i dno why u took my lane early man but that fked u and me so hard &lt; ------- (early when i died my top laner who was premade with jungler went my lane mid and kept takign my farm, i didnt even flame him then i said ok ruin my lane abit then calm down and go his lane)\r\nThrobbing Cawk: keep insult bro\r\nThrobbing Cawk: why fight? &lt;------------------- by this point they kept inting and trolling and flaming me and blaming me\r\nThrobbing Cawk: ur feeding\r\nThrobbing Cawk: go farm\r\nThrobbing Cawk: my score is better than urs\r\nThrobbing Cawk: what the hell is ur problem man  &lt;----------- (were would honestly be doing good but they would troll and go in and die to ruin what me and bot were doing)\r\nThrobbing Cawk: i didntg lose u anything u lose it urself\r\nThrobbing Cawk: i went top to try kill swain and lagged\r\nThrobbing Cawk: he go mid i go my lane he flame and i die and u all hound me\r\nThrobbing Cawk: and i didnt die early, i helped bot we got a kill, then u died both of u with invade &lt;----------------- ( why i try to explain is to try to relax my team mates top and jg who kept constalty flaming me in all chat and trying to get me reported by everyone; i wanted them to focus on the game and honeslty i was scared of being reported and this shit happening which is what happened i got reported, but the funny thing if you go and check my last game on op.gg you will see i had the best score in my team and the rest was feeding....\r\nThrobbing Cawk: sure i cant follow jax\r\nThrobbing Cawk: dont blame me cuz u invade early\r\nThrobbing Cawk: and get rekt\r\nThrobbing Cawk: i mute u cya\r\n[All]Throbbing Cawk: toxic shyv thats all i say\r\n[All]Throbbing Cawk: 0/5 blame and flame all game?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI dont understand honestly what i did wrong, I wanted to clam down the toxicity and focus cuz i wanted to climb and i kept meting team mates like that along the way which kept a toxic atmosphere in my games. I agree maybe i should have muted them and kept them muted but I didnt insult them or inflame chat, since when is explaining to ur team mates because MAYBE they misunderstand me and think im trolling them and i wanted to make things clear for THEM, is toxic? I dont understand. I have paid a decent amount on my account. I like this company but this is too much stress guys, When I contacted support I kept asking them to talk to me about the chat in details they said:\r\n\r\nI'll give you a TLDR of it: Insulting another player, however minor, and engaging in arguments is minor toxic behavior. Because you had multiple punishments in the past, even the tiniest bit of toxicity was enough to now earn you the permanent suspension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I never insulted anyone in my team nor did I argue, and if anything i say a support member will come give me vague answers the apply to everything in game then what the hell are we doing nowadays cuz I thought that game has a big aspect of which is communication, and if my team is toxic towards me sometimes i can try to clear the air so we win right? or am i subject to hijack everytime i join a game with a toxic premade, and if i under perform i can just bend over and be ready for the ban AND the insults and flame? PLEASE be just idc what support said I just want to community to tell me whats up. Also keep in mind this shyvana insulted my mother, so did darius and they insulted the fk out of me besides ofcourse the lovely flame.\r\nPRetty sure they didnt get ban though ^.~","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-12T22:53:31.348+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"You got a 14-day suspension, decided to improve your behavior to avoid a perma, and this is the result? Calling your teammates \"toxic\" over and over again, announcing that you're going to mute all (you obviously didn't, but you really should've), arguing with your team nonstop, and once again saying you're going to mute someone? That's the improvement? Your behavior was still terrible, so you got a perma; sorry.\n\n\"nor did I argue\" ????????\n\n\"i didntg lose u anything u lose it urself\"\n\"sure i cant follow jax\"\n\"dont blame me cuz u invade early\"\n\"and get rekt\"\netc.\n\nAll you did was argue. This ban isn't about what your teammates said; it's about what you said, and what you said was unacceptable, especially given that you knew you had to be on your best behavior. If this is your best behavior, I can only imagine what you got up to before your 14-day.","replies":[{"poster":"Throbbing Cawk","date":"2019-02-12T23:20:34.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Lmao you guys honeslty think I should get perma'd for that?

ROfl I cant but think that most of you are support bots.\n\nYes, you should get a permaban after repeated attempts to get you to improve your behavior result in a chat log like this. Given that you still think you're an angel, we can deduce that if this was another temporary suspension you would've continued your bad behavior after being allowed to play again. A perma is correct in this case.\n\nI don't care what \"the guys were\" because this is a punishment for _your_ actions, which you should take responsibility for. You don't defend yourself in a video game chat by going on the offensive; you defend yourself by muting (which you said you would do but didn't follow through on).\n\nYou did indeed argue, just as you are doing right now.\n\nThe chat log doesn't show anyone else's behavior because you are only punished for your own behavior.\n\nIf I'm a support bot, you're a bad behavior bot. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-12T22:59:51.631+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"You called people “toxic” and “feeding”, but you claim you “never insulted anyone”. That’s a contradiction right there.\n\nYou were flaming in this game. I understand that you may disagree, but this is simply a clear cut case where your punishment was justified. You have gotten your answer as to Riot’s determination that this is inappropriate.\n\nI will point out that it does not matter if your team is toxic “first” - you don’t get a free pass just because other people started it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tuition Fee","date":"2019-02-12T23:39:20.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait....\nIs this your first time getting punished?\nI don't think this is ban worthy.\nDefinitely a chat restriction, but not perma ban, unless you've already gotten your 14 day suspension.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-02-12T23:44:58.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"We don't care for the explanation of why you said whatever.
