Replays are still in testing, so I suggest reporting this over to our client devs through the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards.  In the meantime, see if the steps in our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide could restore access.
