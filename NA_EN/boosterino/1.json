I told him he could probably get banned or get his season rewards taken away if he does, but he doesn&#039;t believe me. Can anyone confirm this for me?

It is the same as cheating. If he knows it is a bug, then he can be banned. It was over a Sion bug that I saw it before.","replies":[{"poster":"Boosterino","date":"2017-08-24T15:36:40.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-08-27T07:24:45.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back in the day, you could abuse bugs with 0 consequences, I mean pro players did it all the time and nothing happened, but now a days, it's prob bannable, but it's like the rule to cheating, It's not cheating unless you're caught red handed intentionally abusing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squidwards House","date":"2017-08-24T16:45:13.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"what bug? dont worry i wont abuse it im just curious.","replies":[{"poster":"Boosterino","date":"2017-08-25T04:00:08.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fixed.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/WGE5ERzY-the-reason-kled-was-disabled-answer-thread","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-08-24T16:52:03.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one got banned from using the Hecarim double dash bug by smiting a minion he is charging at to reset the cooldown.
