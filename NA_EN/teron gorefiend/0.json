I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME, but its just too damn boring now.","replies":[{"poster":"Soraka Actually","date":"2020-02-20T01:09:19.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they ruined ranked for the season, I'm not even bothering to finish promos after 2 afks. Urf made me actually want to spend money on and enjoy this game more then they said \"fuck ur wallet\" :( idk why. Aram is boring and blindpick/normals are slow. Urf was perfect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2020-02-19T21:45:35.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"or give us a better mode","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-19T21:41:56.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot is aware \"URF Withdrawal\" exists, and is part of why they are so careful about the mode.\n\nHopefully in future it will be able to return more regularly without needing so much maintenance.","replies":[]}]}
