I know that you guys have some pretty OP artists who can make incomparable art to anything I&#039;ve seen, so, do you use a pencil-paint computer program? (White page, and nothing but the tools on the side bars?) Or do you create what you want in a 3D program and render the image (Like Blender or 3DS studio). The art is fantastic and I really do enjoy it, so please tell me :D! \r\nSecrets kept are weapons wasted {{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-04-11T17:12:22.961+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo Red Frost! I'm just a concept artist on the skins team - no where near the talent level of our amazing Splash Artists, but I do work with them and I can tell you they mostly seem to use Adobe Photoshop (as do we all) and Sketchbook Pro. However I've been asking a lot of questions in order to improve my skills and I've learned that some of them do use rudimentary 3D geo and lighting to help get the perspective and atmosphere of the background just right. The thing is, while it can help, knowing how to paint over simple 3D geometry so that the end result is a cohesive piece of art is a whole other skill in of itself that is in my opinion some kind of mystical hidden technique.\n\nJust yesterday I was talking with some people in our department about how awesome it is to be working with so many creative and talented people who have no reservations about sharing their experience and techniques. One of the first questions I asked when I got hired was 'Why don't you do the timelapse videos of the paintings any more?' because the early videos had helped me when I was still learning the basics. Unfortunately there are some good reasons for it (huge time it takes to paint a splash, remembering to record every session, editing and archiving footage, low educational value when it would have to be sped up to x1000 to clock in at ~10 minutes) however I am always happy to talk about art when I have the time and I'm sure some of the Splash Artists would too if I poke them on Monday.\n\nI'm busy most of this weekend but I'll try to check this thread on Monday if you have any questions or want to talk shop >:D","replies":[{"poster":"Red Frost","date":"2015-04-11T21:59:33.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"WOW :D Regardless of the splash artists you must be talented yourself, and it would make sense for you and your team to use Adobe Photoshop, I took 2 courses in communications technology at my school and learned some of the basics of photoshop, as well as a few other programs such as 3D ones. Oh yea, definitely, I have seen many people (when they draw or paint something) that start out plotting/drawing shapes and by the end of it, it looks nothing like what it was. A splash art time lapse would be really cool, or maybe a documentary on how art is made for new skins/champs (like how riot made one for the music for league of legends). Also, I know this might be a bit of a personal question, but how did you end up where you are? (College/University? What program? How long? Details? ;D) I am currently deciding what program I should apply to for where I am going, and I have one more option open. Also, be sure to poke some Splash Artists for me to! >:D","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-04-13T19:07:01.147+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Replying here to Red Frost and KronosCifer)\n\nHey again!\n\nRight now I've just started this year on the Skins team as a concept artist. It's taken me more than 10 years to get to this point, and sometimes I feel like I've made it this far because I refused to give up as much as the hard work. \n\nI've always loved sci-fi and fantasy fiction as well as drawing so I knew doing something with those skills would be great, but I never knew that there was a job that would fit me so perfectly until much later in life. When I graduated from High School (back in Australia) I entered into a bachelor's degree in Biochemistry because I really didn't know what I wanted to do with my life (and my Indian father wanted me to be a doctor). That didn't last too long and I drifted about for a few years doing small jobs and not sure what to do with my life. I mention this because it happens so often! You're expected to know what you want to do with the rest of your life at the age of 17... but I didn't even know who I was let alone what I wanted to do.\n\nWhen I was about 23 and the games industry had begun to really explode I decided that I wanted to pursue a job in games. I decided that if I could make games as good as the ones I loved then I would be doing something that was important enough to me that I'd be satisfied. I don't work at Riot because I love creating art or for the prestige of working for a famous company, I work here because I have a passion for making games and a love for gamers. If someone somewhere has a great time playing a game I helped make then that's enough for me.\n\nI entered into a University course called \"Bachelor of Multimedia and Digital Art\", it was a very broad degree that introduced me to a lot of different programs and skills but didn't teach me enough for any particular job. It felt safe because there was enough graphic design and business education that I would always be able to find some work even if I didn't ever get the job I really wanted. One of the best things I got out of this course were a few great friendships. I became best friends with another artist in the course that also loved games and together we talked and studied and pushed each other - he now works for Blizzard (Mr--Jack). After graduating I got a job at an animation studio, which I was very lucky and appreciative to get because I knew that my skills still had a long long way to go before they would rival those of the professionals whose work I saw on the internet. I also knew that for an American company to hire me I wouldn't have to just be great, I would have to be even better than anyone they could hire locally. The thought kept me awake with fear many nights, it seemed like the impossible. I think any course you do will provide you with a qualification and some introduction but the real work will all be done in your own time and how fast you improve is entire up you.\n\nFor a number of years I worked for local animation companies in Melbourne. It wasn't work on games but at least I was drawing every day and making a lot of concept art and learning about production and how to work in a pipeline. When my friend got hired by Blizzard I would save up each year so I could fly over to LA to visit him - meet the other artists at his company, go to PAX, go to Blizzcon, go to Comic Con. I knew that while I slowly improved my art alone I could greatly improve by getting feedback and inspiration from professionals who knew the industry and that their guidance would help give me a full picture of what the jobs were really like. I think a lot of people don't really know what the job of a production artist entails but through talking with them I got a really clear understanding. Sometimes I wouldn't have any work and my awesome girlfriend would support me while I practiced. I would feel so bad missing friends birthdays and family events to push my training and network but I think they understood how passionate I was and that this was my life goal.\n\nI got to a point at which I felt like I had a chance at getting a junior position. I knew my skills weren't that great (even after 6-7 years of drawing every day) but that my creative ability was strong and my professional conduct and ability to work in a team were also great. Still I didn't apply because I felt like I was waiting and searching for a company that I could have the same passion for as my friend has for Blizzard. Finally I fell in love with League of Legends! I remember sitting on the floor of a new apartment in December of 2011, connecting up my computer and beginning work on a Maokai skin concept for the first Lunar Revel fan art competition. I think that is the moment when I began my real attempt to get a job at Riot - 4 years later here I am.\n\nI hope that story is in some way helpful. Let me know if you have more questions. I just wanted to share with you some of my experience and the realities of pursuing a job like this. I'm happy to tell you that you can do it, but it takes a lot of hard work, determination, confidence and support.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KronosCifer","date":"2015-04-11T19:56:49.888+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Red Frost and Kindlejack! \nI would love to join the conversation as I am very determined to become a concept artist myself! So... Even though you're _just_ a concept artist you're like the ultimate revelation to me. :]\n\nBoth drawing and creating characters / creatures or fantasy-ish worlds in general has always been a passion of mine and I'm planning on studying it once I graduate from high school next year. (Living in Germany) \n\nI would love to know your journey to becoming a concept artist yourself, as it does greatly interest me and I better get as much knowledge as possible in advance. ;]\nI'm pretty unsure about what to do next. I would love to study abroad (as I'm in love with the English language), but I don't know where and how, and I'm not really swimming in money either. :[\n\nSo... uhhh....Share with me as much knowledge as you can possibly spare, please! \n\nAnd, since I'm a pretty impatient individual I would ask you if you're so kind to take a look at some of my drawings, which are mostly still WIP since I have problems finishing them sometimes as I don't really know how to continue. I'm stuck! D:\nThere's no one I know who can give me any advice whatsoever and teaching myself to do stuff doesn't sound as easy as I hoped it would be.\n\nAbout the Splash Artists: I would love to know the process of figuring out how to position the Champions and deciding the Background/Lighting and how its personaliy/lore/abilities come into play. \n\nAlso checked your DeviantArt. I love the armor on Mortelle and I'm all for that Shurima map!!!
