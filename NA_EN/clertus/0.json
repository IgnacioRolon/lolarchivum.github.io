In your Windows settings, go to screen resolution (or display) then select your monitor number (assuming #2).  You should then see a checkbox to \"Make this my main display.\"  This will allow your borderless of full screen games to appear on that monitor from now on.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"GrayscaleBlue","date":"2017-12-28T22:05:06.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a way to make this configuration in iMac or Apple settings?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"juslintek","date":"2017-04-09T12:18:55.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This game is so broken, despite that it gained enormous popularity through e-sports. And it doesn't have function. You require, like many quality games have, which detect that you have multiple monitors and allow you to choose between different modes of display, not just the render view wrapper type.
