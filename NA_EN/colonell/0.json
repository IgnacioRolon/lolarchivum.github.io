At completely random times during at least once a game, the side buttons won't work. I won't be able to use my skills or anything. It seems to be caused more if I use the control button on the mouse (the one right to the right click) but that's not the only way to make the mouse lose function. It's in good condition and has never done this in any other game. When in game the only way to fix it is to unplug/replug it in and to press the Ctrl key on my keyboard several times then hope it works. It hasn't costed me a game yet luckily, but if it happened mid 5v5 at the end to decide the game I'd be totally screwed. Because of this I haven't been able to turn skill shots off even on champs that I've mastered because if the mouse breaks and I replug it in I need to be able to see if the buttons on my mouse work again when trying to use the skill without actually firing off a skill shot. Does that make sense? Seeing the skill indicators tell me that the mouse is functioning as it should be. Again, the causes aren't completely isolated when I spam the Ctrl button on the mouse, it can happen at the most random of times. \n\nI know the logical thing to do would to just use QWER but I physically don't have the ability to use those keys. I've been playing MMO's more and I'm so much more comfortable using the 12 buttons on the side of my mouse. Any idea of what this could be? Support ticket didn't provide much help.\n\nEdit addition: I use the control button on the mouse to level up skills. My skills are 1-4, to level up skills its Ctrl+1-4. I've also made sure that all up to date drives are installed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-27T22:33:06.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh, that's awful especially if you in the middle of a fight.  :(  I'm glad it hasn't cost you a game, though!   If you have a third party for the mouse, it could be getting in the way.  Do you have another mouse that you would be able to swap out to help rule out possibilities?  There could also be configuration settings that have become corrupted and no longer working properly.  A config reset might help in this case:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings.","replies":[]}]}
