I got the first one just fine. I click on the &quot;click here to earn bilgewater rewards&quot; but i can&#039;t click on the continu button. So i don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because i did something wrong or if it&#039;s just a bug. I would like if someone looked in to it. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2015-07-28T00:28:05.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xEvilPotato~ \n\nIs this issue still occurring for you?\n\nPlease let us know if it is!
