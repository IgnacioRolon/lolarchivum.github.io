I've tried custom, AI, Normal(blind and draft), etc. and nothing workings I keep getting the same error. I used the hextech repair tool, I re installed and played around with firewall settings to try and get it to work and still nothing. Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening ? \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T20:54:47.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplat issues like this can happen for a few reasons, and not just bad game files.  You may have outdated drivers or settings that's causing crashes like this as well.  The hextech repair was a good start, but I also suggesting going over each step in our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to get this resolved.  Also, if you have any third party programs running like play.tv, remove them as they've been known to cause issues.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
