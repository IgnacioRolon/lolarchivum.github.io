I'm using, the fix of the fix of the fix to open the client. And now it started to crash after the champ select. Way to go riot. Now none of the fixes are working anymore. My standart launcher doesnt even work (admin one aswell). I open the game from LoL Patcher. Will riot stop putting unnecessary nerfs and buffs to champs and actualy fix the client for a second? These bugs occur for around 3 years and every fix I look is around 3 years old. For 3 years they couldnt fix a single bug that makes a huge population extremely unhappy for days. And for real im sick of navigating in the League folder like It's my job. No its riots job to do fixes, I'm not supposed to get into folders every single patch to do a fix.
