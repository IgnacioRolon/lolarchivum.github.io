Im pinging the server now and I have 0 packet loss and 58ish ms apparently. Oh never mind the game ended. I really appreciate coming on after a week to not even get to play, and get a \"leave\" on my profile.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T23:04:30.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time, being unable to connect to a match after champ select is caused by an unstable connection to the server. I understand you pinged the server, but since pings generally only send 4 packets, it may not have provided enough data to determine the issue. I strongly recommend working through the steps outlined in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step to resolving this.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
