If you're getting a patch notification each time, then something could be preventing it from saving.  This can happen if you installed league outside of your primary internal drive, or a security setting.  My suggestion here would be to start off by going through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure League has proper permissions to read and update your game files.  Let me know if that does the trick!","replies":[{"poster":"nshera","date":"2017-06-06T05:58:45.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that worked :-)","replies":[]}]}]}
