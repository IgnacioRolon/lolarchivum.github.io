[Arc Light] Vel'Koz performed the death animations, rose up from the ground, and was in the process of \"reanimating\" from the bind when the game froze in a flurry of light!\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other Information that might prove useful:\r\nOur team [Red side] \r\nCrash occurred within the vicinity of our Blue camp\r\nBetween 1:15 - 1:30; right after, \"Minions have spawned\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:429}} {{champion:161}}\r\n Our love cannot be!\r\n\r\nThe only regret I have is not being able to witness the full Oathsworn animation.\r\n2/10 would crash again","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-01-29T18:08:43.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:429}} + {{champion:161}} ; a forbidden love for the ages ","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-29T18:01:38.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey WFCxTigerBacon! \n\nThanks so much for the report! \n\nNo worries about not having a screenshot, you've left a pretty solid description.
