Like, rank 1 of both her W and E are amazing now - 50% attack speed boost at rank 1 and 40% slow at rank 1, that&#039;s really really good. I&#039;ve been playing her all morning and afternoon on PBE and the changes are most definitely noticeable - along with her improved mobility with her passive. Again, BT rush is amazing on her - the shield legit keeps your passive up 80% of the time and it only drops your passive if the shield is broken/if you actually take damage. With a shield support, this can really help out MF in catching up or escaping - especially because of the new W mechanic that instantly activates Strut.\n\nDoes her losing the GW suck? Yeah, it's a bummer that its gone but for that they also added more stuff on to her that helps her out in the places where she needed more help in, like staying alive. She's already one of the best duelists with her auto reset and stacking damage, losing GW won't change that.

Please take several seats.\n\nI have a question, what's the scaling on her passive as she levels up? is it speed or delay reduction for activation?\n\nI know BT is now a priority on her if you plan to maintain your passive up because of the shield mechanic. I'm just worried that it's mandatory to have a shield support now until she hits that mark (further narrowing down her effectiveness), and her preferred supports are lockdown ones like Leona, Alistar or now Nautilus.\n\nI've always considered her a strong dueler but with equal items she loses to like half the adcs in the meta (item gap SHOULD happen since she's supposed to win lane phase). But it's bothersome that the kit tweaks didn't involve her getting more physical based damage than before. Her impure shots apply a whooping total of 48% of your bonus AD per AA with all 8 stacks......as magic damage, and in late game, even with high amounts of AD, armor penetration doesn't help that aditional damage boost. It's like they're suggesting you HAVE to either run hybrid pen runes or magic pen boots like Corki. Also, the impure shots mechanic means that she needs a good base of AS and a good amount of AD for her to be viable late game\n\nIf you compare her to other adcs, Draven gets a 85% of total ad boost for each axe, if he has two axes at hand, that's 170% of his AD if he gets off 2 AAs on you, and the extra AD counts in critical strike and lifesteal calculations. Same goes for Vayne and Tumble. TO achieve a similar damage boost as Vayne, she needs to get off 8 autoattacks while vayne needs to Tumble once. Vayne could at least get two tumbles before MF can apply her 8th stack of impure shots.\n\nShe's definitely in a weird spot right now, I don't think any other adc has that many downsides for such high rewards, because her damage potential is INSANE in \"perfect\" scenarios","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2015-07-09T03:28:14.824+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"It is a nerf though, in reality.\n\nAlthough her impure shots is definitely a lot better, I feel like the grievous wounds made her unique compared to the other adc's currently out there.

The problem is, Riot wishes to get rid of grievous wounds so that they can better balance spell vamp/life steal. However, the GW was a major unique skill/ability for MF. It was one of the only reasons to pick her vs other adcs. And remember, Riot doesn't want all mages to be the same. Or all adcs to be the same.
