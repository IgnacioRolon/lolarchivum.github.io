She was the ONLY ADC in the game that had her base AD NERFED instead of buffed.  She lost her niche of being a mixed-damage ADC.  Her AS got nerfed and her Grievous Wounds removed from her kit.\n\nThis should have been obvious when her only viable skill path was maxing E to abuse Thunderlord's, rather than her REAL harass tool: Q and her dueling/teamfighting tool: W.  It comes at no surprise to me that after E got nerfed, she's disappeared from the game entirely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2016-04-24T22:58:02.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MFW.

Ironically enough, ricklessabandon has worked on both. I didn't welcome the MF W changes at all. I typically start W first, and alternate Love Taps quickly to push the lane, try and deny the enemy bot lane and hit level 2 faster. Not only that, but activating W and dueling with minions present to try and Double Up, helps so much more.\n\nNow, you have quicker access to Love Tap, but less reliably. If the cd on hit goes down with cdr, Ezrea's Q and Lucian's E should too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-04-25T06:05:46.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"thank god i dont see mf as an ad carry anymore. thank jesus. 1-2 months of terror back in the preaseason. dominates lane with her superior bullying. wins late game with a single ult that does something like 6k damage. man. those were nightmares.","replies":[]}]}
