Not to mention she officially is the hottest female champ in-game now too. \n\nHope you&#039;re ready. 8)","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2015-07-09T18:55:13.832+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's because people here like to use low pick rates to say a champion is garbage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-07-09T18:53:23.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"as long as {{champion:119}} is here mf is shit because she is the worst version of draven","replies":[{"poster":"Finkypop","date":"2015-07-09T18:54:30.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Draveeeeeeeeeeen,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tqlXG536,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-09T18:53:23.518+0000)\n>\n> as long as {{champion:119}} is here mf is shit because she is the worst version of draven\n\nMF shits on Draven and out-damages him.\n\nHave a seat.","replies":[{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-07-09T18:55:25.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=finkypop,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tqlXG536,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-07-09T18:54:30.384+0000)\n>\n> MF shits on Draven and out-damages him.\n> \n> Have a seat.\n\nare you serious? mf out damage draven?","replies":[{"poster":"Finkypop","date":"2015-07-09T18:56:57.341+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Draveeeeeeeeeeen,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tqlXG536,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-09T18:55:25.307+0000)\n>\n> are you serious? mf out damage draven?\n\nYou better believe it, honey.","replies":[{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-07-09T18:57:12.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=finkypop,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tqlXG536,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-09T18:56:57.341+0000)\n>\n> You better believe it, honey.\n\nlol no","replies":[{"poster":"Hasztalan2","date":"2015-07-09T23:06:05.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Draveeeeeeeeeeen,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tqlXG536,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-09T18:57:12.025+0000)\n>\n> lol no\n\nMf outduels even Draven easily.

(Draven's axes and MF's impure shots+Q reset)\n\n1 AA from draven's axe at max rank=185% AD\n1 AA from MF with no stacks of impure shots=106% AD\non 1st AA from MF, she AA resets with Q to make another AA, so that's 85% AD+12%AD from 2nd stack impure shots+ 118% form the AA reset=321% total ad+Q's base of 80\n2nd AA from Draven=285% damage total\n3rd MF AA= 445% damage\non 3rd AA, a good draven should have caught his axe so= 470% total damage at minimum.\n4th MF AA= 575% damage\n4th Draven Axe (considering he can recast it at this time and not sooner)=655% damage\n5th MF AA=711% damage\n\nI guess if MF is smart and can AA reset with Q she'd win the duel with no items or if she's ahead. However, almost 100% of MF's total damage output doesn't add up to Critical or Lifesteal calculations while all of Draven's damage does.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RetroRage96","date":"2015-07-09T18:57:36.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her rack got nerfed hard though...","replies":[]},{"poster":"sheldonbunny","date":"2015-07-09T19:30:48.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love MF, just disappointed that GW was removed.
