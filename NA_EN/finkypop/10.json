What's your skill order?\n> \n> So many questions!\n\nYeah, this build basically puckers up and really makes use of what MF has that others don't - the built in stacking magic damage from autos to be a true hybrid threat. Kalista/Vayne don't care about Wit's End - MF loves it, you apply W stacks faster and your W stacks hurt so so so much more. Usually, MF loves extended trades or duels - but BORK makes it so that MF loves the fight from the beginning to the end because of its current % health damage (which is physical - literally, it's nearly impossible to itemize against this damage mix). With these two items, you have the edge. I always get BORK first and then Wit's End and then go straight into IE if I'm ADC, but you'll look and see one of the games where I didn't have IE at all and also had a cleaver (my team was all AD in one game for example, so I focused on strengthening my magic damage and armor shred with my ult instead of itemizing crit and it was a piece of cake). If you get ahead with this build, it is really REALLY hard for the enemy team to come back - but even if you fall behind your damage will still be relevant. \n\n- Yes, if you don't build any crit and you're your team's marksman, your team's late game DPS will drop off significantly because usually the enemy marksman would have built crit. If you're in solo lane though it's not as bad if you don't build crit. :')\n\n- This build just turns MF into an all around monster, not just a crazy duelist. You will melt tanks like butter, you will melt squishies like butter.\n\n- I build BORK first and then Wit's End afterwards, but sometimes if I go back and I have enough for BF I just buy that for the early damage spike (I had a Soraka once so I didn't really care for sustain so I was like why not I'll just go IE first and then do BORK-WE).\n\n- Usually as MF you wanna try to end the game sooner than later, so if its possible, yes. Most of the games I've won though have gone past mid game so it's not that crucial. \n\n- No, the ult only applies the W stack damage. The MR shred only applies from your autos. \n\n- I max R (duh!), then Q, then E, then W. E max is so so so much better second, the only thing W max gives you is 10% attack speed. E max gives more damage and a better slow, there's no reason not to max it second.\n\n If you have any more questions, you can totally ask or if you wanna see the build in action I have multiple replays that I can send you if you wanna watch it (???). This build gets so much mixed reaction its insane, I mute everyone in the game whenever I play this but I have so much fun and do so well with it, and 95% of the time I do the most damage to champions in the game. xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-09-28T20:12:55.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I wish I owned MF... \n\nI could use some freelo to get to silver.. ;-;  All I want to be is silver and that's it.. xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-09-28T23:46:13.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So MF has an on-hit on W dealing 6% of her AD as magic damage.
