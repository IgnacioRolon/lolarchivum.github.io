Yes in most cases you will have a double ban on the same champion but unless 4 champions on both teams are banned by both sides, we still end up with more than our original 6. So I don't know why people are always complaining that we don't always have 10 bans lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-06-12T11:16:01.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how it is a LOT faster to get through the banning phase, even with 4 additional bans (2 from each team more than previously).\nI also don't have to deal with Zac again untill his nerfs come through.","replies":[]}]}
