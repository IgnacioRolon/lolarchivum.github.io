All the Marksmen are in a viable position right now.  MF falls into the 'strong in lane, brutal mid game, falls off somewhat lategame' Marksmen pool due to the large amounts of magic damage in her kit that isn't affected by her armor penetration.  \n\nSo, I guess my answer to your question is she is neither OP nor just bad.
