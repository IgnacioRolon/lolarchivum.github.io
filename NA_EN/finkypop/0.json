She was unconscious for 2 of the 5 seconds that we even got to see her. This is especially disappointing considering I main MF and have been waiting for her to be in a high quality, officially released cinematic and taking into account how rare these are it sucks that this is most likely gonna be her last showing in a cinematic of this caliber with other champions. \n\nI hope she will get another showing soon with a more active/exciting role, this part was SO disappointing as she has been my favorite character forever and I know that she is capable of putting on a more exciting display of power. \n\nOther than that, I loved the film. Keep up the great work, Taliyah looked AMAZING! But you BETTER show MF again and do her justice.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-01-14T21:55:23.330+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"All of them are showcasing the champion trying to climb up to something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2018-01-15T01:37:00.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, with MF, they are showing the climb up the ladder in rank.\n\nMF happens to show the part where you're struggling through what appears to be a losing streak (she did seem to have lost a battle to a serpent), and as you try to fight you way out, there are things trying to hold you back.  Maybe it's your tilt? Maybe it's a very poor team members.  Your LP is sinking, and you're drowning in defeat.  At the very least, MF didn't give up hope.  She is still trying, and as it appears everything is about to bring her down and sink her for good...she grabbed the gun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2018-01-14T22:50:25.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You’re an MF main, so you’re one of the luckiest mains of the game. \n\nYou get like one 1350 skin every year. \nYou get an awesome comic.\nYou get a lore update. \nYou get 2 big story event where she’s featured heavily. \nYou get a slight model/animation update.\nAnd now, she gets featured in this amazing cinematic. Albeit not the way you wanted.  But she was featured nonetheless. She could’ve not been at all. Just say thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGreatRasputin","date":"2018-01-15T01:33:20.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, he has the advantage of not being a Morgana main. \nOnly got 2 skins last year, both Legacy, after a 3 year lull.\nHas no comics.\nLore only got touched with most of the other old champs.\nHasn't been featured in any story events.\nModel hasn't changed for 3 years.\nLast time she was in a cinematic, it was the first one way back when. I really hope her VGU is this year. She and Kayle need it as much as Malphite and Nunu.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NocturnalSheild","date":"2018-01-14T22:48:07.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean draven gets rofl pwned last cinematic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-01-15T19:50:08.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll never say no to more MF, but what she did get was appreciated","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2018-01-15T07:04:40.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making a female champion looking dirty in the sexy way is a good thing\n\nIllaoi was protecting Miss Fortune from the undead, it was reference to the Bilgewater harrowing event","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2018-01-14T21:53:17.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a yasuo main and I wasn't disappointed at all.\n\nRiot did a good job on making him badass.","replies":[]}]}
