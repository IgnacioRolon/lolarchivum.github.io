I&#039;m so sad that I hadn&#039;t figured it out much sooner, I could&#039;ve had a good one or two years of such fun with it as I did during those weeks before her change. \n\nI love the champion so much, but I really feel just absolutely bored when playing her now unless I play her as AP mid, which is pretty insane. Her win rate in high level play has plummeted, as has her popularity all around. I predicted that this would happen from the beginning, it&#039;s just so sad. Now I know what it feels like when one of your favorite champions is changed, it&#039;s just out of your control in the end really. :(","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2016-02-26T20:03:58.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Her play style is pretty much the same lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Finkypop","date":"2016-02-26T20:06:17.137+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CatSith,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OEO51EUF,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-02-26T20:03:58.568+0000)\n>\n> Her play style is pretty much the same lol.\n\nAbsolutely not, lol!","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2016-02-26T20:07:26.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is it not?","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2016-02-27T01:21:58.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The old Miss Fortune was kind of just a huge mix of everything. She never had a defined playstyle because of everything Riot threw into her kit, and while Riot agreed that Miss Fortune before her rework was completely viable, they disliked that she had no real identity. \n\nHer kit had mixed damage and she used her abilities a lot, but she wasn't a caster ADC. She had pretty strong auto attack steroids that did a ton of damage as the game progressed, but she wasn't anywhere near a late game hypercarry. The only thing that was well defined in the old Miss Fortune was her signature lane bullying capabilities. Though she wasn't just a lane bully like Caitlyn, because she could duel fairly well too.\n\nThe current Miss Fortune has a much, much, much more defined playstyle, but it's not like what the old Miss Fortune was. The current one is simply an ultimate bot. If Miss Fortune can't land good ultimates then she's just a burden on her team because her ultimates do by far the least damage in the game and any other Marksman could replace her for that. Which is kind of ironic for her being an ADC.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bots Whilst High","date":"2016-02-26T20:40:29.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AOE slow that procs thunderlords, last hitting execution mechanic, ult that does 1100 damage rank 1.

I'm not saying the current one isn't fun, but in comparison she's so boring to the old Miss Fortune.\n\nMiss Fortune right now just exists for her ultimate. Without her ultimate she's totally worthless as an ADC, as her base attack damage is so terribly low that she just wouldn't be viable without her ultimate doing an insane amount of damage. The thing is that her ultimate requires setting up and that's usually done by  1 - 3 other members of her team. Having a proper team comp is extremely difficult to do in solo queue, and without Miss Fortune being able to land powerful ultimates, she's just a burden on her team. She's a slow, squishy, ADC with the lowest damaging autos in the game. You could argue her passive gives her some burst, but one auto isn't going to cut it for an ADC.\n\nI think Miss Fortune is significantly more enjoyable in higher elo because people understand how to create team comps, and when Miss Fortune is able to have a proper team around her she simply wins in champion select because teamfighting is not an option for the enemy team as long as Miss Fortune's team is competent with something like Malphite, Janna, and Orianna to back Miss Fortune up.","replies":[{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2016-02-27T14:42:30.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly I disagree about the team comp thing. I rarely have a wombo comp when I pick MF, and I don't really need it. I max E first and usually it's enough for my ult.\n\nHer E is an extremely strong slow when maxed first, and her W is a fantastic attack speed steroid. Strut allows her to roam very well and rotate quickly, which is also a great advantage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bots Whilst High","date":"2016-02-26T20:01:42.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:99}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2016-02-26T22:24:23.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:74}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-02-27T15:03:00.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing about missfortune is that most her dmg is from her ult and that require the player to sit and do nothing while watching enemy die.\n\n\nthere is no interaction at all. compare it to something similar like a lucian ult, he actually need to kite and position himself to make sure more coling will hit, which isnt the case for mf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"y  o  y  o  s","date":"2016-02-26T18:21:56.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have you played her with rageblade? {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]}]}
