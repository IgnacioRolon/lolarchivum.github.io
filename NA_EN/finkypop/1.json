They then received one dimensional kits from their reworks, and were made incredulously broken... just for them to get nerfed and immediately put in the same mediocre state that they were to begin with. \n\nMF&#039;s popularity and win rate in high level play has plummeted after the nerfs and is nothing but an ult bot, unless she is able to stomp lane and wipe team fights via enemy positioning mistakes (much easier to do in lower elo). Cass was turned into a machine gun. All of her consistent damage, sustain, and even her mana durability relies in one spell and her supposed late game power literally relies on her boring passive that stacks overtime by itself or by landing poisons. \n\nSo much fun, really. My immobile carry goddesses that I loved to play when people underestimated them and won majority of my games with are now champions that I don&#039;t really like to play anymore. I&#039;m just so disgusted, I never knew how it felt to have your mains reworked into something you don&#039;t like very much until now... and its happened to me twice.

Positioned right in the right kind of fight, would completely tear the enemy apart. \n\nThat said, She's suppose to be an AoE ADC. Even if it makes her feel like an ult bot, that's probably fine for her identity. (Especially with the new ER, which would give her plenty of CDR.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-03-02T19:42:25.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you {{champion:45}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-03-02T18:25:29.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither are useless or trash.
