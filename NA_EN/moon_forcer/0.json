The game has indeed become a piece of shit.\n\nFrankly i dont understand how it devolved into its current state but i doubt it could have done so without Riot actually wanting to take it in this direction. A portion of the community likes it too, mostly the kids who like to play brain dead assassins if id have to guess, they are no doubt having a great time.\n\nAnd you're right i dont think they will fix it, they dont want to. They will change it just enough to stop a large amount of the complaints","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-10-11T19:04:16.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Started in S5","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cavesloth","date":"2018-10-09T23:25:02.948+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"The difference is, a game of Call of Duty can be fun...
