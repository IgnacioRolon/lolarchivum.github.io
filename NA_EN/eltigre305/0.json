As in, the government cannot censor you unless your speech is unlawful - the government can't censor your opinions.\n\nIt does _not_, however, equate to freedom from consequences - the government may not be able to silence your opinions, but you can certainly be thrown out of a restaurant or banned from an online game if your speech breaks those places' rules.\n\n> ...If I want to call someone loser and garbo, isn't it that my right to do so...\n\nAnd it's Riot's right to remove you since you agreed to not do that when you made your League of Legends account.\n\n> Riot does not refund that when banning your account.\n\nYou agreed on every transaction that it would be non-refundable, and the ToU straight-up says that Riot is not obligated to give refunds if your account, for whatever reason, is terminated.\n\n> What happen to my freedom of speech...\n\nYou still have that freedom, it's just that said freedom doesn't prevent Riot from banning you from their game. They're not the government, and they're not censoring your opinions, they're just banning you because you refused to follow the rules you agreed to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-07-08T20:30:51.924+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":">The United state constitution gave me freedom of speech\n\nYes, but not in a way that is applicable here:\n\n>***Congress*** shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\n***Congress*** isn't stopping you saying whatever you want on *League*.

If you do not agree with that policy then simply do not make purchases. If I go to a movie theater, buy tickets, and behave poorly enough that I am kicked out of the theater 5 minutes into the movie, I do not get a refund -- my own behavior causes me to lose the remainder of my purchase.\n\n> So someone feds and leave the game and troll and I get mad and call that person garbo and i get reported lol, this community is fuck up\n\nYou do not get an exception to the rules simply because another player *also* broke the rules.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-07-08T20:28:55.719+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Freedom of speech means that government can't do anything to you\nPrivate companies are still allowed to have their own rules\nI mean, you're free to say whatever you want, but be prepared for the consequences\n\nIt's freedom of speech, not free from conaequences","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-08T23:19:57.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/rant","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-08T21:05:15.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The United state constitution gave me freedom of speech\n\n_Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances._\n\nIf that is too dense, \"Freedom of speech\" means the government cannot silence you or prevent you from voicing disagreement. It has absolutely no impact on anything else, and is not \"freedom to do whatever the fuck you want anywhere\".\n\nLooks like your freedom of speech is perfectly safe, you can always complain to your representatives that you are being kicked out of a privately-owned business for bad behavior; no different from being ejected from a cafe for harassment, ect.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2019-07-08T20:42:54.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, you signed a contract stating that you would follow the rules, with the punishments for not abiding by the contract clearly laid out. Don't click \"I agree\" if you don't agree.\n\nSecond, you're misunderstanding the right to free speech. There are two parts. The first part is that the government cannot punish you for the messages that you convey. As you have not been arrested, charged with a crime, or found guilty of any crime; nothing has abridged this portion of your right to free speech.\n\nThe other part of free speech is that you and Riot both have the right to **not** convey any messages that you don't want to convey. Riot has decided that they don't want to transmit the messages you type. If you somehow had the ability to force Riot to transmit your messages at cost to them, there would be no protection from you being forced to convey any sort of message at cost to you. \n\nFor example, I could force you to create a video distribution website full of videos of you getting kicked in the nuts. It would be expensive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eltigre305","date":"2019-07-08T20:39:57.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2019-07-08T20:45:08.313+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is wire fraud, a 10 year felony.
