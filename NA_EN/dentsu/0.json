All this however - was all a lie. \r\n\r\n**Here&#039;s why I stopped playing League of Legends**:\r\n\r\n\r\n* _Riot&#039;s inability to appreciate that their champion base is flawed_\r\n\r\nIn a game like this where there are so many different types of champion and so many different types of player - it is tough to design and develop niches into the game - I understand that, but let&#039;s get something straight for a moment. When you play a champion like Caitlyn she has fundamental flaws and clear strengths. These types of champions are called &quot;balanced&quot;. Where there is an equal amount of good and bad about that champion. \r\n\r\nRiot have forgotten this, if we look at Malphite for just a moment, so Brutal Strikes and Ground Slam are both strong moves for Malphite, now lets take a look at the scaling for these abilities.\r\n\r\nGround Slam:\r\nBONUS PHYSICAL DAMAGE: 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 (+ 15% Armor) (+ 10% AP)\r\n\r\nBrutal Strikes\r\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+ 30% Armor) (+ 20% AP)\r\n\r\nNote please, the armour (that&#039;s right - its spelt &quot;Armour&quot;) scaling. Now this is very low scaling and doesn&#039;t by any means make Malphite OP, but I do just want to point out the principle of champions -- GAINING OFFENSIVE STATS BY BUILDING DEFENSIVE STATS. This is so fundamentally illogical that even I would vote for Trump if I was subjected to the same level of nonsensical bullshit.\r\n\r\nThis is just wrong, when you were a kid and you played a character in an older game - he/she was known for a specific strength, damage, durability, speed. Never - all of them at once. \r\n\r\nRiot, I know you dont give a fuck about this post, but you can&#039;t argue with this logic, your champion design is (and has been for a long time) fundamentally flawed. Its not as bad as it used to be though so props for that (Ezreal used to heal 1:1 on his W back in season 1). \r\n\r\nHere I have pointed out an example of something that Riot fail to do - Correctly balance champions. Its not hard, its not challenging - it&#039;s just a lot of people (I assume that work in champion design) - have degrees in Photography and claim they are intelligent. These people are not intelligent, they fail every year to design and implement correct champion structure. \r\n\r\nHiding behind the phrase &quot;We are moving our design strategies in line with the game&quot; - won&#039;t cut it for anybody that has an IQ over 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_* Riot&#039;s terrible prioritisation_\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to do, I get it. You&#039;re a big company with many-a-job to do. However, there are limits to how misaligned your priorities can be, and for them to not be questioned by people like myself. \r\n\r\nSkin design, champion design, icon design, merchandise promotion. These are all things that I can understand. However - at the expense of game structure and robustness?! I&#039;m going to describe my own personal account of this (owing to this &#039;misalignment of priorities&#039;) below:\r\n\r\nSo after finishing up a warmup ARAM game, I decide that i&#039;m clear-headed enough to go into a ranked game. When I get into the game I immediately notice that something is wrong - the game is unable to hold steady character movement before jittering elsewhere...\r\n\r\nI decide that before the game starts, I&#039;m going to disconnect from the game, reconnect and hope this resolves the issue. Big mistake. When I left the game, I got the usually LeaverBuster warning, now at this stage I hesitated slightly and think - what if I do get banned? The reason I continued was because I thought to myself &quot;Don&#039;t worry, Riot have a hoard of coders and millions of dollars to create algorithms that will check if i&#039;m leaving for a connection issue, or if i&#039;m otherwise leaving for an unjust reason&quot;...\r\n\r\nHow wrong was I? Very wrong! I was unable to get back into the game as the connection failed entirely, once the game was over I managed to get back into the client - only to find out i&#039;d been placed in a low priority queue for 20 games. I took screenshots from my router detailing that everything was fine my end and clearly that it was something out of my control. Riot support said this was not something they could fix (it was, but they didnt want to) and apologised for this. \r\n\r\nSo here we see an aspect of network error checking that should be resolved before a push on skins or merchandise is made. I understand they are all different teams, but all of Riot&#039;s money is going into the short term goal of making money, and not the long term goal of building a robust user platform. \r\n\r\nSo the only way I can really summarise this point is i&#039;ve been having is to say this to Riot - &lt;anger&gt; &quot;Sort your fucking shit out, because I could literally walk into your offices and do a better job than all your project management staff, all your design staff and all of your executive staff. I would be happy to detail a more efficient way of working that actually makes this sorry excuse for a game genuinely - BETTER. &lt;/anger&gt;\r\n\r\n_* The players_\r\n\r\nSo my last point is really just the icing on the cake really, the players - oh the good ol&#039; players. The twelve year olds, the unhappy fathers, the teenagers, the  uni guys .. they are all the same. They sign-in every day and play this game. \r\n\r\nSo why do I have such a problem with the players ? I used to rage a lot, hell - up until I just uninstalled this game, I was really pissed off. But there is something about these players and Riot&#039;s feeble attempt at playing &#039;parent&#039; that does make me chuckle every now and then. \r\n\r\nWhy do you Riot, choose to defend players in this game? People are only going to come back and do the same thing again. Do you genuinely believe that your insignificant attempts at forcing players to abide by the &quot;Summoner&#039;s Code&quot; are actually going to reroute the synaptic processes in their brains? Its laughable. \r\n\r\nYou just need to leave players alone, there is mute function for them already. People like myself that possess a far higher level of intelligence than 90% of players do genuinely want to tell people that they are stupid. Because - They are! If you ruin my game because you don&#039;t have the cognitive ability to process game variables in an efficient and meaningful way - and I lose because of this. I&#039;m going to let you know about it. \r\n\r\nThis goes for the rest of us 10%. Some of us are passive - sure. But, the majority of us aren&#039;t used to dealing with people that are so incompetent. In school I never hung around with the people that smoked weed and bunked off school. I hung around with the kids that went off to study Maths at Oxford. You see my point? \r\n\r\n- Don&#039;t force law upon an unorganised set of people. If you want to do that - then separate the groups through an alternative method other than game rank. You are fighting a losing battle on this one Riot. You cannot win, will not win and look stupid trying to do so. \r\n\r\n_* Conclusion_\r\n\r\nWell, this has been fun. I hope many other people can see truths in what I have written and I hope to see some opposing views too.\r\n\r\nSee ya Riot, enjoy wasting other people&#039;s lives - you have mine no longer. {{summoner:21}}","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-09-25T14:25:09.856+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">  i've relished the idea of getting that pentakill, of winning that game, of being a specialist at one role.

You complain about balance and then pick malphite as an example.  Literally one of the best designed champs in the game.  Has a niche, fills it nicely, but is always useful regarless of game.  His armor = dmg is gated by a decent cd, mana cost,and really low scalings.

YOU not riots servers.  YOU disconnected and only YOU can reconnect.  It is YOUR fault if your connection fails and you actually go afk for 20 min. Dude your team had to fight a 4v5 because of you.\n\n> Don't worry, Riot have a hoard of coders and millions of dollars to create algorithms that will check if i'm leaving for a connection issue, or if i'm otherwise leaving for an unjust reason\"...\n\nNo they don't,  How the hell do you check that?  How can you check when someone disconnects if they did it on purpose or because of a problem in their system or because the power went out?  All they see is the result, the disconnected player.   They have no way of knowing why you dced.\n\nAlso even if they could check,  then people would just game the system as soon as they learned what riot was doing and riot would be forced to stop doing it because people would then get away with afking like you are trying to do.\n\n> The players\n\nYeah clearly its toxic dipshits like you.  \nRiot can't control peoples actions anymore you can.\n\n>  People like myself that possess a far higher level of intelligence than 90% of players do\n\nHA HAHA AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  \n\nNo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kempachi Taichou","date":"2016-09-25T12:51:06.033+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:54}} \nGaining physical damage through armor, makes sense.\nHe's a rock that punches you, the hard the rock the harder the hit...\n\nThis, like every other part of your argument, is flawed.\nIn all sincerity, I personally and on behalf of the community thank you for uninstalling!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bhagswag","date":"2016-09-25T15:43:13.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone keep a track of his op.gg page.

You are right about congress though for the most part. They are supposed to be the ones in control and the presidents main power would be to Veto things he believes are wrong and not good for the country. This is however no longer true you should be worried about the next president because of the new thing they made up called executive orders. It basically lets them bypass congress to pass temporary laws or some such nonsense. I believe the first time it was used was for the Korean war... I could definitely be wrong about that though. But I really don't think that Executive Orders are constitutional in the slightest... ya I did say I wouldn't talk politics... guess I screwed that up lol.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T15:37:59.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is all im gonna say... the issue is special interest groups/lobbyist etc who back and support politicians and \"donate\" to them not one politician isnt bias in how they vote for what they vote for.... the country is ran by those special interest groups and lobbyist and typically big business","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2016-09-25T15:32:47.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you want a cookie? or do you expect anyone to care that you uninstalled LoL?","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T13:24:16.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just saying all the times i have DC from a game was either my computer or internet connection other then the few times the servers for riot went down... funny thing is YOU dc from the game....not all 5 and you blame riot for that ? how did you know its not an issue with YOUR ISP at that moment... you dont.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-09-25T15:33:16.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay... and you expect us to care about your whining.... because... why?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trashlord Kayden","date":"2016-09-25T12:31:38.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you talk about the \"12 year olds, unhappy fathers, teenagers\" etc. yet just in this post, you flame so hard, as many of the players do. yet you categorize yourself with the 10% that you say are \"passive.\" also, isn't making this post at all quite childish? you uninstalled the game yet it seems to still have a slight hold on you, if you feel the need to talk about it, even if you're talking it down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mustafa2881","date":"2016-09-25T11:45:54.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i smell something weird, did you take a poop before you uninstalled? if yes, a bye\nif not, its still a bye","replies":[]}]}
