Regarding the issue itself, when you find a match our server needs to group everyone together and place them in the same instance.  Something is preventing you from joining that group and leaving you behind.  \n\nEven though this is on the updated client, the issue is generally a result of a network problem.  To help rule out possibilities, my advice would be to go over the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is holding on tightly.  Hopefully, that will fix the issue up!","replies":[]}]}
