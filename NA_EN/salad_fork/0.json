The league websites won't load. In game, the main page won't load. My emotes won't load (error 1 and 5), and now I'm getting error 3's when I try to play league, which won't let me play. I'm on a wifi hotspot right now, and League website is working, but on my normal wifi, it doesn't. Any ideas?\r\nT3WB","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-21T23:16:51.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If those pages are working on the hotspot but not your home network wifi, there might be some kind of settings or firewall blocking that connection. Do me a favor and try updating your port forwarding and DNS settings really quickly and test those in a custom/practice game. If you aren't sure how to change those check out the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for some steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Salad fork","date":"2017-11-22T21:35:56.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird, I accidentally blocked league on my wifi.
