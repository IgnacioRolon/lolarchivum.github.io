Here's a few points to consider for future assassins:\n\n1. Hard cc doesn't belong anywhere on an assassin's kit. They should have to _work_ for the kill. I love playing Ekko but I can't get over how unfair Parallel Convergence feels on his kit, especially when paired with a well-timed Chronobreak.\n2. Methods to cleanse cc don't belong anywhere on an assassin's kit. If an assassin engages an at improper moment in time, that's _their_ fault. They shouldn't have a Get Out of Jail for Free button built into their kit(s).\n3. Assassins should be about skill expression. Their kits should include skillshots. They shouldn't be able to kill people by left clicking on them (i.e. LeBlanc, Katarina, Akali, etc.).\n4. Assassins should be mobile but not _too mobile_ (so that Kassadin's ult range doesn't have to get cut in half again). Their mobility should feel necessary and measured, not unfair and excessive (like Fizz's Playful/Trickster invulnerability frames). \n\nLastly, what did you do with the thirteen rangers that came before you?","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-06-13T00:42:40.810+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Hard cc doesn't belong anywhere on an assassin's kit. \n\nAn idea i actually came up with was giving Rengar's E a GROUNDED effect, rather than a snare.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-06-13T00:15:48.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i hope you can convince \"The Man\" to give the go on some changes for Rengar Testing :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-06-12T23:09:36.652+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for coming to tell us this.

Why shouldn't the players have more of a say? Isn't there a pretty big problem when Rengar, who was included in the assassin update and a Rioter gave a sarcastic reply that yes of course that means Rengar would stay an assassin, is suddenly listed as a diver by Riot when the class sub lists came out without any warning? Shouldn't getting existing player buy-in matter much more when it comes to major shifts in role like this? This feels very similar to Morde, who Riot hamfisted into Bot lane without any buy-in from players on such a major role change. And we all know how that turned out. It may be that Rengar is overall healthier for the game if he is a diver, but it should be on Riot to make that case to the players, not just drop things seemingly out of the blue.\n\nThe communication just doesn't feel like it is there when Riot makes major role changes like this.

People want the old kit instead of trying to find a compromise between his new kit and hit old kit.\n\nIn other words... if you want them to respond, you'll either have to give it time, or figure out a way to calm the community down a bit. It's like taking a lollipop from a baby, they'll cry for a while then calm down when they get tired.\n\nIf you want them to listen to a Rengar rework, then please, consider the following:\n\nHis Q, if possible, should not be an auto attack enhancer. This is too reliable on a champion with an ult that lets them leap on their target from further than a ranged basic attack can handle, as well as just being able to do this from bushes.\n\nHis old Q was too hard to balance. It gave too little room for his enemies to fight and too much for the Rengar. If possible, it should *not* be returned, because of these reasons. It probably tied down Rengar's power budget a little too much as a result.\n\nHis new Q, however, suffers from other problems. It solved the whole \"no counter for opponents\" thing because he had to already be next to his foes, but it feels... off, all around, from what I'm hearing. Clunky and just not fitting with Rengar himself.\n\nSo in other words, you need to think of a Q that is not only smooth and easy to use, but also something an enemy can play around besides \"stay X units away from Rengar or pain ensues.\"\n\nHis W... I don't know the direction it should go, whether proactive or reactive. Both seem to have their own issues, so that is probably for those more qualified than me to say.\n\nHis E is stated to be fine, so we can leave that. No need to fix something that doesn't need fixing.\n\nAnd finally, his Ult. His R. The infamous \"I'm going to kill you and there is almost nothing you can do to stop me\" ability. Time and time again, this ult has proved to be far too problematic. So what I suggest is simple; change it entirely.\n\nIt's clear that the ult, regardless of what it gives, will be a problem just because of the nature of how it works. If Rengar is ahead, you can't stop him unless you are a one main CC chaining master. If he's behind, it does nothing to help him. So why not make it more interesting instead of \"stealth and see everything\"? Make it so that Rengar has to interact with his surroundings. Like Rengar can leap from bush to bush around the map (not globally of course), or make it so that Rengar can track his foes. Simply revealing and giving an indicator doesn't seem to be cutting it balance wise.\n\nNo, I'm not a Rengar main. I have played him in all his forms, and quite frankly, it's beginning to become overly obvious that Riot wants to avoid certain designs for Rengar, and players simply want a revert because of *other reasons*. Find a middle ground and work from there. His old kit won't cut it, but that doesn't mean you have to scrap everything.","replies":[{"poster":"the boss baby","date":"2017-06-12T19:03:05.285+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"My entire post was a concept on how to reach a compromise between the two.

Not to mention that Riot may want to write a actual forum post / dev blog / nexus post about this and address the desire and uproar the Rengar player-base are making. Engaging with the people in a already riled up and aggressive post is bad news and I have seen Rioters struggle to get their points/plans/ideas across when the player base are super passionate and not willing to listen or understand; an example is when Riot Bioluminescence replied about maps and got bombarded with aggressive responses. They wouldn't listen to her or accept her responses, even calling her out of sentence structure and her manner of replying for no other reason that to be aggressive/rude and push for the answer they are looking for.\n\nSimilar to Rengar, Kog'maw was reworked in Preseason of Season 6 and wasn't reverted until near the end of the season in Patch 6.19. It took them that long to work out what they should do, but you being vocal can speed it up, just don't be douches about it and give them time to work it all out and make sure what they are going to do is gonna work for them, the game and for you.

The old Q alone was not bad, it wasn't oneshotting anyone. The problem was when you'd load/prepare it all before ulting, resulting in a massive burst.

Champions and their playerbases go ignored for years while others are specifically catered to and given significant open dialogue from Riot themselves. For example, let's look at Jhin who fell out of the top tier ADC category for the first time in a full year about two months ago. Reds comment on Jhin threads that they are looking for ways to bring Jhin back up and now buffs are headed out for him this Wednesday. If we look at another champion such as Tahm Kench, many threads discussing Tahm have been ignored despite him being in the lowest tier for supports over a year now. We even see threads asking simple questions like 'why can't Tahm Kench eat blue/red buff?' hit the front page quite often and go ignored. As a result, Tahm players feel very left out in comparison to Jhin players due to a lack of communication.\n\nThe same has been happening with the majority of champion reworks for a long time now. Players question reworks such as Malzahar's and Rengar's and what isn't working about the post-rework kit, but these discussions are never given any dialogue. They just go ignored, as Riot proceeds to nerf these champions patch after patch like they are all Azir and pretend like everything is alright when really a viable, fun champion has just been taking and thrown into the dumpster, along with the voices of the players who enjoyed that champion before any of this happened.","replies":[]}]}]}
