She is still very good, she just can't burst people as fast as she used to be able to.","replies":[{"poster":"gari19810","date":"2017-09-05T15:45:50.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats the problem she should be able to burst everything to fast","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-09-05T16:20:10.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the assassin rework they widened the burst window for all of the assassins to make counterplay possible. Now you have to use your abilities to both deal damage and avoid taking damage long enough to kill people.","replies":[{"poster":"CamilleSexAppeal","date":"2017-09-07T15:36:59.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"counterplay possible\".

If you let your teammates cc them or cc them yourself then you can probably take them out easily. They are both very squishy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"aj2493","date":"2017-09-07T16:13:51.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leblanc was changed she either gets fed and carries or she falls off and farm up and scales.If you want to burst and assassinate you need {{item:3041}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3100}}","replies":[]}]}
