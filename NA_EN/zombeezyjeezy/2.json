Basically the pimple&#039;s too big and blocking my hearing, it feels like I have a foreign object in my ear that I can&#039;t get out.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s nothing that frustrates me more than not being able to hear, because 1. it affects my ability to play games and 2. it affects my ability to listen to and play music.\r\n\r\nFor fucks sake I want to just pull a Van Gogh at this point.","replies":[]}
