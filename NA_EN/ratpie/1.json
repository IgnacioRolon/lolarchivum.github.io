If you want something specific, buying it directly from League's store is the most cost efficient way, rather than relying on RNG Lootboxes.\n\nAnd this is especially true for their monthly 50% off sales and My Shop discounts. If you already decided to buy a skin for a champion, buying it for at least 50% off is better than buying it at a full price. In my opinion, Riot doesn't have to offer discounts and yet, they do and they've kept doing it for years.\n\nRiot Games is a business, first and foremost.\nEven if they give away free things, they have to make sure that what they do doesn't ruin their sales.
