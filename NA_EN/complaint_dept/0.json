Everytime it is turned on it basically kills my wifi. I figured out that it was because it uses the same frequency (2.4g) as my wifi. Switching to 5g should solve the problem and it did for my brothers... **HOWEVER** my laptop does not support 5g, (being a 802.11b) So I have to trying to figure out a way to be able to connect to the 5g. A few sites I checked for information said to use a dongle, but I would like to know if they are able to enable 5g on devices that do not normally support it, like my laptop, before I spend money on one. Any help would be appreciated, thanks! \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}
