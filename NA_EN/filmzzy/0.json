[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isSxsJGK-uI) is the updated video SkinSpotlights had made for Dark Crystal Ryze. In addition to the spells being updated, the skill icons were also changed during his update. \n\nHope this clarifies things! ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-11-11T01:31:41.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well the icons were obviously changed due to the update,\n\nBut Dark Crystal Ryze used to have his own special effects. That champion spotlight only shows Dark Crystal Ryze with new Base Ryze effects.\n\nAre you saying with the Ryze update you didn't bother to update Dark Crytal's effects and just gave him the base ones?\n\nShouldn't that lower his price to 750?","replies":[{"poster":"Freyedlol","date":"2015-11-11T10:45:42.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"DC Ryze has always had the same particle effects as default (believe this is the case for every Ryze skin?).
