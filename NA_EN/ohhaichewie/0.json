I'm a high-mid plat player (plat 2 to be exact) and I am being matched with kids who are gold 5, silver 3, even a bronze 1 one game. I took photos for evidence in case anyone tried to tell me that it's not possible. How can this be allowed? How is this considered ok by Riot? I played a game with 4 diamonds on the opposing team and had 2 silvers on my team. I'd love an explanation by Riot for this totally botched system. I can't even comprehend how 4 diamonds versus 2 silvers is even remotely close to a \"fair game\". Please take some time to really fix your matchmaking. It couldn't possibly be worse.","replies":[{"poster":"crzymdscntst","date":"2016-11-12T08:20:00.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been placed in gold every season I've played, low gold last season mind you, but I've been paired with some of the worst players and a couple of good ones. 5:5 win:loss ratio is my current season, giving a 50% winrate which usually places around gold every other season. (47.06% last season looking it up.) Even so, someone said they were placed bronze 1 after a 7:3 win:loss. This year I got placed Silver 4. Not that I mind having to climb, it's just, something about the flex has created a really bad feel to anything ranked.\n\nIt's not healthy.\n\nNow, to paraphrase as I understood it:\n\"It's not the amount of games you win, but which games you win.\"\nThat implies that there's some games weighted heavier, especially in placements, which explains the disparity, but it doesn't explain why games won against a higher-end opponents don't raise you more. I've queue'd for Mid:Support every single game and gotten put support EVERY SINGLE GAME. Okay, I'll deal, but an S and A rank every game also don't factor into the rating even if you're playing support. Which means only the win or loss is counted toward your placement. According to some of my match history, some of my won games are against diamond and platinum teams and losses often had lower-end players on my team. As my role is support, I'm not usually able to switch builds and carry. Given the disparity of teams, is it not expected that you might not win with a bronze 5 and silver 3 on your team feeding against diamond and platinum players? Why would this game bring you down so much by comparison?\n\nWhere's the ranking leveling out here?\n\nMaybe my data is just wrong looking at other player's histories in ranked, but if I'm correct then Flex queue is definitely not going to be okay in any sense of the word.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NessaNyaa","date":"2016-11-12T07:34:40.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2wdvr81&s=9#.WCbC9PkrLIU\n\nthis is bronze flex elo??","replies":[]},{"poster":"asciK","date":"2016-11-10T20:07:37.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol the first day I had numerous people go \"wait this is ranked\" at the post game screen. {{champion:32}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CloutVladimzir","date":"2019-06-19T20:01:43.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flex is total garbage and i agree. the system is a freakin joke, the fact that the enemy team has Diamond players and you are there with 4 silvers and one plat on your team.\n\nThe system is absolutely disgusting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schnürüdeldüdel","date":"2016-11-13T01:51:06.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I really want to add here something.\n\nLeague of Legends is a game. People playing a game are supposed to have fun, and the elo system was supposed to challenge player, sure, but it`s also a system to put players together who have roughly the same skill lvl. Giving the players the feeling they can change the outcome of the game, by play good. This is not the Case here in minimum 70% of the games in the Flex Que. The game experience is completly ruined. Low players not having a chance of winning by themself, getting completly bashed or completly carried, and \"high\" elo players either being completly bored by obliterating not good players, or playing even but still lose cause a bronze mate of them got matched vs a master yasou in the mid lane (Not a story. happened twice in 6 games.)\n\nI think the complete MMR reset was the worst thing riot could have done for that Que. They should have made a cut somewhere, not just one cut but like 25 cuts. Which we call divisions. Oh wait........ well, you get it.
