When i downloaded my new client i saw a massive decline in frames when in full screen and my normal amount when in windowed, for a demonstration i normally get around 270-300 frames on uncapped but i cap my frame rate at 144 and i get all 144 on windowed (max settings) but when i switch to full screen i get around 30 on low-high graphics on uncapped frames. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled which made my League of Legends good for a whole game, but 4 hours later my frames were back to being utterly terrible. My specs are Nividia  970m with a i7-6700HQ 2.60 GHz so this low of frame rate is quite absurd. If anyone has a solution for my problem, please help as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T03:35:07.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've historically seen these symptoms caused by the Windows Game Bar and the *Game DVR* feature inside this bar.
