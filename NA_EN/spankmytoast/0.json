I got the legacy one to launch. At the gray \"Restart/Shutdown\" screen I right clicked the icon on my taskbar, and clicked close. It prompted the \"Are you sure you want to exit?\" screen. I clicked no, and was at the login screen. Legacy client blames me. \"Make sure your internet connection is enabled and your firewall isn't blocking it\" and I can log in from the new client, but it wont let me click play at the top.\nThe message it gives really doesn't sit well with me. It sounds like they blame my internet, when apparently a lot of people are having the same issue. Really wish it was worded different I guess.\n\nAnyone know what a \"RADS Error\" is?\nLike I said to get this screen just try to close the new client, and say \"No\" when it asks if you want to close it. It should bypass the grey screen. Then select legacy launcher.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Fk9Zw","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrShishy","date":"2016-12-01T21:22:35.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't know how relevant it is, but my IP count is still off what it should be. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MythicalGiraffe","date":"2016-12-01T21:20:58.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"If you're running into issues launching the updated client:\n\nGo to your League of Legends install folder.
