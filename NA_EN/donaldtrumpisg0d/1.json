This caused my team to lose our lead, and the game.. I opened a ticket FOUR DAYS AGO, and it still has not been addressed. Secondly, the client crashes in champion select at least once a day.. From that alone i have received a 20 minute leaver buster. Riot keeps removing my posts about the client bugs from the &quot;report a bug section&quot; for no reason, yet can&#039;t respond to the posts or tickets i have put in. Riot, your customer service is terrible, if you keep this up (along with a lot of stupid balance changes) you will not continue to be successful. As a CUSTOMER who has spent a lot of time and money on your game I expect to be treated well, and that isn&#039;t happening. Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if this post was removed too.","replies":[]}
