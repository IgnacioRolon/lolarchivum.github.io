The problem is we don't want to spend so many money on talent like NA/China does. So yeah Huni/Reignover left for money's (insert Qtpie donation song) and Yellowstar left cause he wants a new challenge after being in the same region for 5 years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaitri","date":"2015-12-12T02:37:04.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YCitizenSnipsY,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=ykdRkZOl,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-12-11T04:09:24.461+0000)\n>\n> Huni and ReignOver are Korean imports not EU players.
