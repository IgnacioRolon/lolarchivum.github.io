It&#039;s an awesome skin concept but the model just destroys it. :( \nFor example,Asylum Shaco\n(Asylum Shaco Splash Art has purplish shaggy hair that covers most of the upper face with 1 eye exposed and looks like an **_ACTUAL_** clown)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GFMvPLb.png\n(Asylum Shaco In-game Model has black-bluish hair and looks like a **_HUMAN BEING_** with two eyes exposed)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nre51Rh.png\nNow tell me how they look alike.\n(Masked Shaco has a more wilder blu-ish free hair with a bright orange mask)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pk8oWbg.png\n(Masked Shaco In-game Model has a very dark skin tone colored mask with a _**GREY**_ headband,in the splash art it&#039;s _**BLACK**_,and the hair looks like it&#039;s stuck together with tons of gel)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GOzwwaw.png\n\nAll I&#039;m asking is,can we get some sort of _**visual updates**_ for these skins that actually look like their splash arts?
