Can't you read?\n\nRiven only lost her ability to snipe someone whenever she wants. She has to have full edge to get old execute value.\nAnd her passive is the same except it generates Edge when she procs it with her auto attack.\nAnd when she has full edge, she deals 10% more damage across all abilities and auto attacks.\n\nAlso she loses Edge stacks when she hasn't attacked enemy champions for 10 seconds. I repeat, when she hasn't procced her passive on ENEMY CHAMPIONS. This buff simply expires.\n\nLearn to read notes, fool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2015-10-01T04:12:14.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[On the design direction of the experimental Riven changes](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/nP3Ln4d0-the-design-direction-of-the-experimental-riven-changes?comment=0001)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brahmsauce","date":"2015-10-01T03:58:54.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just seems a nerf to the Ult for the early game, I haven't seen the numbers, but it might do around the same damage at full edge stacks.
