Im a representative from riot.  Here at riot games we understand the concern for tanks not being able to deal as much damage as carries back in season 2.  So we decided to Make everyone do as much damage as carries by implementing **Percent health damage** In kits!  \r\nWe want every player to realize the more tanks you have that deal percent hp damage, the higher rank you will receive.  Also we have decided udyr is jesus, so on top of being completely unkillable he will have the best burst in the game AND be the fastest  \r\nDont forget, if you are not playing vayne bot lane, you are not playing the game right","replies":[{"poster":"blfUvZ8Ybu","date":"2016-07-07T03:58:01.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Vayne isn't even strong.Also adcs are op right now.13-14 adcs are viable and 6 adcs are so strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaos689","date":"2016-07-07T04:07:16.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"100% true.
