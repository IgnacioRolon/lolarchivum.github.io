You may q someone, and use your e, slow all enemies attack speed and such, which is nice. Malphite is not weak at all in teamfights, but he feels he&#039;s just one ult and that&#039;s it. All his basic abilities are almost unnoticable, the effects are so minimal.\r\n\r\nPlease give some love to Malph in terms of VFX. Hell, even is ult is just him jumping into the enemies, if i can call that a jump.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-04-28T03:06:16.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"It doesn't matter how noticeable they are: He hits like a freight train and keeps going. He steals MS, reduces AS in an AoE, has strong damage scaling off of just about everything, massive tankiness steroids, and low cooldowns.","replies":[{"poster":"SS Enforcer","date":"2015-04-28T03:10:27.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didn't say he's weak.
