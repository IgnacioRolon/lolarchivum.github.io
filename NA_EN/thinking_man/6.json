That's why almost all assassins except for like Talon, have an escape. The reason Riot considers Zed a healthy assassin is because he can do just that while also having several weaknesses. Yes he has a strong laning phase, but his teamfight sucks and he is easily countered by several items, champions, and summoner spells. I will admit his waveclear can be problematic in lane, but if he didn't have that then I think his laning phase would be sub par.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-04-09T12:00:40.918+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Assassin as someone who can get in, **get a kill, and then get out. ** That's why almost all assassins except for like Talon, have an escape.\n\nI'd agree. But Zed (and also Leblanc) can get out even if they don't get that kill. That's the difference. And it's because their gap-closer moves also allow them to retreat instantly any time in the next 6 (or 4, for LB) seconds for no additional cost. Kat and Akali use their gap-closer and then they don't get a charge or a reset back unless they get a kill. So they can be punished if they miscalculate.\n\n>  if he didn't have that then I think his laning phase would be sub par.\n\nThat's how assassins work. They usually have crappy laning phases because they roam and get kills. This is why their waveclear is usually either on a high-mana cost move (Talon's Rake, Leblanc's Distortion) or requires them to use their gap-closer on minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-04-09T17:15:49.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marry me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tofutime","date":"2015-04-09T18:24:43.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Compare Zed to Fizz.

His ult also isn't contradictive to encouraging counterplay since his damage has the most counterplay out of any assassin. You cannot QSS Rengar or Talon one-shotting you during the time it takes to blink. Furthermore, if they were to revert his ult back to what it was before, he'd just do what he did before where he R'd you then W'd out instead. Although it'd probably be a nerf since people would have to relearn him, that'd just make you die even faster since his shadow is next to you. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Ratbert,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fZjWc5Kt,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-09T02:05:03.790+0000)\n>\n> Because we all know winrates mean everything :>)\n> Good thing there's no such thing as a player who only plays what pros do without any consideration of their own skill or teamcomp.\n\nidk whose side you're on, even if people play a champion in elos where he sucks or into bad teamcomps, that still doesn't mean that they're good in that elo.
