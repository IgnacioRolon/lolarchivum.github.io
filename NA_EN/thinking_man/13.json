He was wearing the peasant set and using a ladle. I didn't see his ladle at first, so I set up my tryhard Crystal Soul Mass and put my Crystal Magic Weapon onto my Rampart EbolAIDS Lance and prepared for combat.\r\n\r\nI noticed his ladle so I stripped off my Havel's armor until I was in nothing except for my loincloth, pulled my Third Dragon Ring off of my fingers, and cast aside my Lance and Staff in favor of bare fists.\r\n\r\nWe had an honorable duel which ended in me committing suicide for he had clearly bested me.\r\n\r\nHe added me afterwards for being such a great sport and we were talking about his strategy and how he ever wins with an uninfused ladle.\r\n\r\nHe says he's secretly a hexer and he fights with the ladle until they BM him and then he one-shots them with Climax.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story is you can't trust anybody because they might be a hexer.","replies":[]}
