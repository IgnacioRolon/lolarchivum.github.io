When I say it doesn't, what I mean is that rend doesn't give the same damage potential an actual steroid does. Rend gives a lot of damage early game, but it actually falls off a lot later game, unlike real steroids that scale much better. That isn't saying rend is lackluster. It gives a lot of damage for an ability, but it can't match up to actual steriod damage. On top of that, she's lacking some damage in the rest of her kit (particularly the ultimate).\n\nI never find that she really does a lot of damage. She's really strong because she's so mobile, but I'd consider damage a weak point of hers. Not weak enough to actually make her a weak or balanced champion of course, but still a negative for her overall.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Macaromi","date":"2015-05-16T04:47:48.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Retillin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yEAdWcQ9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-22T19:57:18.029+0000)\n>\n> Most of that has to do with the more mobile adcs having been nerfed in the past few months.
