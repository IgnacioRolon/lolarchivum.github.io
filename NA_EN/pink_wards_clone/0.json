I was playing ranked with some friend of mine and we played pretty well. Until late game the whole team, but one player, played well and we all were friendly.

Ofcourse that tilted me hard and i didnt want to mtue him cuz he made some decent calls. Later ingame he just flamed the whole team, me especially, because i wasnt able to kill their jhin once. He kept on blaming the whole team and then i lost it. I told him to stfu and that hes the worst player in this team, i just couldnt help it.

It is just highly unlikely.

There is no such experiment right now.\n\nYour chance to get unbanned right now is as high as walking out of the building and be able to fly.
