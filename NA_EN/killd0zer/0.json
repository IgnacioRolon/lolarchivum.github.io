They are two separate things... Meeps come regardless of whether you collect anything or not. Chimes have to be physically picked up. Meeps also appear more frequently as the game progresses... while chimes appear with the same consistency throughout.\n\nIf chimes became meeps, that also means you get all the chime buff plus the meeps at the exact same time and maybe that's not the way Riot has intended them to work.\n\nWhile I like your idea of condensing two things down to one... in this situation it really doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-02-24T22:29:19.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It could have easily been spun that way.
