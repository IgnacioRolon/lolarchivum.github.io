You stop the misinformation.\n\n\"100 million Tribunal votes later, we turned machine learning loose on the dataset to see if we could classify words and phrases in 15 different languages from negative to positive. Just classifying words was easy, but what about more advanced linguistics such as whether something was sarcastic or passive-aggressive? What about more positive concepts, like phrases that supported conflict resolution?\"\n\nThis is only a clip of the commentary I'm seeking. It DOES target keywords, but it IS more than just a word filter.\n\nWhile I'm struggling to retrace my steps, how about you back your own words up with the commentary by the designers themselves (not some Riot representative) that it is not based on keywords *at all*?\n\n(edit) Riot Tantram:\n\"The IFS uses machine learning. It does not simply look for the presence of words or phrases. It is able to evaluate your history...\"\nIf the system did not use keywords, he would have said 'It does not look for the presence of words or phrases.' Adding the word \"simply\" means that it does not *only* do so.\n\nI will continue to show you, because this is not conclusive enough. If you are looking, try searching between 12/1/2013 and 1/1/2015. The automated system was implemented early 2014.\n\n(another edit) Begin wall of text. There is information that the common user has no use for. The excuse for this is that such common users should not be aware of the specifics of the system, as it is subject to certain agendas. Namely, the ability to skew results. I believe this is enough of a word-padding to discourage most casual readers to stop. Begin actual content: Perhaps part of the issue is that \"dictionary based program\" has no solid meaning. As I'm understanding it based on the developer's commentary, the program identifies words and phrases and assigns them values- both positive and negative- and evaluates the entire string of the user's logs and gives it an overall value. Highly negative values result in rapid punishment. It does not care about context. These values are constantly updated- the machine learning part in play- by evaluating the frequency of reports and correlating words and phrases used in those reports. It also adds words and phrases- both positive and negative- on the same premise. It counts honors as positive reports. So, if paired with a lot of positive values, the chat log is evaluated less harshly- though not to a degree that they can escape their toxicity. It does, however, still give credit to positive chat. Hence why it can be misused by common miscreants... but it doesn't seem to be common knowledge yet. This feature was implemented to help prevent false positives, which was a major concern at the inception of the program. All this is to help establish an understanding of what is meant by 'dictionary based program'. It does not actively translate the words in a way that the program can understand it, it merely assigns values which, in turn, contribute to an overall score.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-11T02:41:13.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is rather mildly negative.

However, this doesn't apply in this case. There's nothing to defend yourself from in any sense when we're talking about League or any online video game.

With such extremes to the single issue, it suggests that something in the middle exists. If you can ignore scathing, volatile comments, you can tolerate a tempered defense.\n\nI am certain that if Riot's rules were applied to real life, you have a situation similar to Dolores Jane Umbridge (Harry Potter). Such suppression dampens the human spirit. In more practical terms, as humans, we're inclined to use anger to overcome problems. Channeled with intelligence and temperament, we are positively rewarded in practical terms (using the anger to focus on the issue and utilize problem solving inclinations) in fixing them and in terms of personal satisfaction (having been able to overcome a source of frustration).\n\nTrolls, careless/idiotic performance, poor teamwork/communication, hostile taunting, being victim of \"cheap shots\", and much more- all contribute to anger. Expressing anger is generally useless, but defending oneself with that anger in a proper manner (it does not matter what emotions you use if you communicate properly) is a tool to establish confidence in competence in others and as a motivational build up for the defender. It also emphasies error in others- and recognizing one's errors IS an important thing.\n\nThe stoic perspective (which is the dominant perspective on this board) abhors anger. It is the vice of self control, viewed as destructive. The truth, this is only the result of rage. Anger in itself is not ugly. Anger propels ambition and achievements, rewarding those who use it. What is ugly is rage- the uncontrolled expression of anger. Rage generally occurs when anger is allowed to build up without release- and without resolution. Hence why Dolores Jane Umbridge is such a bad character. She suppresses the gainful use of anger as though it were a good thing. I wish I could speak on the social opinions on it- such as from various religions- but suffice to say that some recognize anger as evil, others as good, and some indifferently. Generally, the world looks down on it, but science is showing that it can be POWERFULLY positive.\n\nAnger does not control people. These fools who make the excuse \"I was just so angry\" are really saying \"I didn't think about the consequences of what came to mind at the time.\" You don't have to be negative when you're mad. Rather, defending oneself is actually a positive engagement- \"I am capable. I made a mistake, nothing more.\" \"That was an excellent attack. Don't expect that to work against me a second time.\" \"I did not expect that. How should I/we deal with it?\"\n\nWell?","replies":[{"poster":"Catwalk Lady","date":"2020-01-13T07:41:23.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n\n*Gasps at making the connection with that HORRIBLE pink wearing [Dog] that is that professor.

I think that at this point, practically anything can get you punished so long as it is deemed as being 'Negative'. _Anything_. The issue here is that you got reported multiple times _before_ **this** made it to the PSS's desk for a manual review. And once you rack up those reports then they basically punish you as long as there is anything negative in your chat logs. I know that its hard to be positive with people who are being toxic or trolling/flaming. And so, its for this reason that I mute my teammates and everyone else around right before the match starts.

Just sad how money and ego has turned something that was supposed to be fun and entertaining into a nest of toxicity and cult like behavior.\n\nDon't take it to heart. Honestly, while the PB board members are diligent in their own rights and they all have their pro's and cons individually or as a group. They mostly downvote everything! Literally, 99% of the topics here get downvoted. Unless its a topic on someone's account being hacked, its usually downvoted. If you want to actually discuss, you should do it in the G&amp;D forum. Another thing to note is that some of the board members in the PB section are either here to rub one's toxic reports in their faces. Or just be that little guy who likes to play the cop for Riot and tell you in a self-righteous tone on how you've been toxic and were rightfully punished. Its rare for board members to try to 'talk' with an OP and actually help them out or understand them and their issues/where they're coming from. Maybe some of them are numbed down because they've seen too many. Or- its because they just mirror all the toxic posters as one of those who harassed them and so, the treatment is _poor_. Its just how it is. \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThat said, talking about the topic at hand. Riot's punishment policy has become so difficult to implement with a 'human' flavor because, in my opinion, their work never reduces. Whether they can or cannot. Accounts are banned but the players behind those accounts are never banned for a fixed period of time. These players aren't asked to stop playing the game for some time and told to chill; to control their toxic levels. I don't know if this is because they want them to keep playing the game. Or because they aren't able to id ban someone! Whatever the reason is, it causes the report load to never **decrease**. So you ban an account and the player has 9 alternate ones or simply makes a new one! And you're back to square one. Because he's harassing someone again, you're getting the same number of reports **again**. \n\nAnd this why the way that they handle things feel so unfair at times. Its not consistent either! Bots are used to scan reports. I don't know how this AI bot is evolving. Whether it is actually learning, how its learning. What is the degree of learning, to what point it will be able to judge reports once its reached its zenith? Whether it will be able to judge context and make an assessment of a report with human degree of comprehension? But at the moment, its mostly just something that racks up reports. And blots out players who use ZT words, _regardless of context_. Like, some guy calling an actual feeder running down mid - Troll. Gets a smack on the back of his hand with a 10-game CR, just like the guy running down mid. That's the state of things right now. \n\nSo, that is why there's a lack of 'human' flavor. And its going to remain so while there is a huge player base which is probably not reducing anytime soon! The best way to keep yourself safe or defend yourself from other people's nonsense is to simply mute everyone and everything. Play the game at your own pace!","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-10T01:34:44.760+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You were punished for your continual arguing/harassment of another player.

I say this because the IFS hands out punishments based on consistency x severity.\n \n> The reps advice is wonderful but honestly. Muting and ignoring players isn't gonna fix the problem.

Reports only flag a game for review (only one is needed btw), and if nothing of guilt is found then the report is thrown out and deemed false. If it's deemed valid then it consults its backlog of sorts to see if it's a consistent pattern, and if it is then it hands out a punishment, and If it's not then it's stored away for future reference. Bad games happen, which is why outside of extreme circumstances no one is punished for just one or two games.\n\nAs for muting and ignoring, while I get the urge not to mute and to just type back, at the end of the day it's not gonna solve anything. If they're tllted then arguing with them will make them play worse, while if they're intentionally acting up then you're just giving them the response they want. By muting/ignoring them and focusing on your own game you don't tilt them further/give them the reaction they want, making it more likely they'll play better.\n\nSure you could always try saying things like \"don't worry, we'll do better next time\" or \"hey man, chill out\", but if the other person isn't receptive then just drop it and move on rather than pester them about it, as nothing you say will get through to them.\n\nSomething else you could try doing when you're frustrated is yelling and raging at the screen, punching a pillow/bed/chair armrests/punching bag or squeezing a stress ball or something. Any of these things will let you vent without compromising your teams chances of success.\n\nAlso don't forget about things like pings or clicking on cds/jg timers/ults as they can communicate basic things quicker than chat can.\n \n> Thanks for the luck, I'm just gonna take a nice long break till later in season 10. I upvoted you btw {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\n\nSometimes a break can help clear your mind and allow you to view the situation with a clearer head than before. One last thing to note is that accounts can improve their standing over time, but one has to actually play games and show improvement in them in order to do so. Best of luck in your future endeavors.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SirWimder","date":"2020-01-10T01:18:23.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ok so since its just an opinion based topic....\n\nMy opinion is \n\n\"Catwalk Lady: SAlting people for ranks\"  Yet you had to scroll for your chat log.  so who is the one that is salty?  \n\nFacts.

I did flame on this smurf quite a bit, and I'm still honor 3, even though hitting honor 3 on this smurf took longer than it did on smurfs that i did not flame at all, so the system did pick up me flaming in a few games, but it was to such a small level that my honor progress was affected but not stopped.\nat the end of the day, blitzcrank bot is a machine, not a human, and is incapable of seeing what a human justifies as okay. even with the advanced ai learning potential.","replies":[]}]}]}
