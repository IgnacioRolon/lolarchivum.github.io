Just wanted to give some of my own feedback regarding the new client. \r\n\r\nFor the most part, I like the new look and feel. I especially like the responsiveness.

Considering the amount of real estate you have to play around with, there&#039;s just too little on screen. It would be nice if you could maybe select the resolution 1600x900 but keep the interface resolution of 1024x576--you know, display more stuff on the screen. Like the store, for instance---why is it only a grid of 3x4? Sorry, I&#039;m kind of horrible at describing things, but I hope that made sense. \r\n\r\n2. I very much dislike the information displayed on the runes page. I love the overall look, but having little symbols display what stats are present on the page seems very cluttered and confusing. Again, I feel like this comes back to the real estate issue--you&#039;re not utilizing all the space you have to your fullest advantage. I&#039;m not sure how you could display it differently while still preserving the new look, but I will tell you if it stays this way upon release I&#039;m sure I won&#039;t be the only one unhappy with it. D:\r\n\r\n3. The client doesn&#039;t seem to remember any of my last decisions. Like the store, for instance--I do NOT need to see all the skins I&#039;ve purchased. (I spend probably way too much money). It&#039;s really annoying having to re-select all my preferences every time I enter different menus. Maybe a remember last selection feature? \r\n\r\n4. Lack of new features. I know this new client is, well, new, but it would be nice if there was more functionality to it. For instance, I would love if I could display my collection on my profile for my friends or whoever to see. I&#039;d also love if I could display what skins I own, and for that matter, see the skins I own. Instead of having to go to the store and view all the skins I own that way (and only the ones that are currently available for sale), it&#039;d be nice if there was a place on my collection where I could go to see a gallery of all my purchased content. \r\n\r\n5. I actually really miss being able to hide the friends list. Once again, it comes back to the whole real estate thing. I feel like with the different resolution sizes available, there&#039;s just not a lot that&#039;s really visible. I feel like everything is just massive in ration to the client size and it&#039;s all just crammed together. I feel like the friends list is a big culprit--it just feels so massive compared to the rest of the client. I would love if I was able to scale it down a bit.\r\n\r\nOverall, I definitely feel like it&#039;s heading in the right direction. The negatives definitely don&#039;t outweigh the positives--it does look amazing! I just think it could use a few improvements. &lt;3\r\n\r\nI&#039;m in sort of a rush so I haven&#039;t proof read my feedback, so sorry about that. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading and lettin&#039; me test the client! \r\n\r\nClumsily, \r\n\r\nFaye","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-26T16:57:58.057+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fayatrix,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=kV7pKjcW,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-26T00:29:44.954+0000)\n>\n> Hiya!

Adding more stuff to the screens can make it difficult for some players to find stuff, specially for new players. We are always walking  a fine line between not too little, but not too much either.\n\nSpecifically to the store, I agree that some of the grids could show more items at once. At the moment the store in the legacy client and the alpha are the same, but as the client update matures, we'll have the chance to ditch some of the old code for the store. At that moment we'll have more opportunities to make changes like the one you mention.\n\n> 2. I very much dislike the information displayed on the runes page.

Once that happens, conversations about new features can begin.\n\nSidenote: I want those features too.\n\n> 5. I actually really miss being able to hide the friends list.
