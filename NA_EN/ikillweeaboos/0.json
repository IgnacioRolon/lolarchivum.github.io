I know I&#039;m bad and I have a lot to learn, but unlike most bronze players I&#039;m willing to learn because I know there&#039;s a lot of mechanics I need to work on. I&#039;m not talking about CS and other fundamentals-That stuff I&#039;m aware of and acknowledge that I need to fix. I want to improve my own game play. I&#039;m just frustrated because even when I sometimes have a moderately okay game I still lose-either my team throws or everyone else isn&#039;t up to par. I&#039;d like to think that I&#039;m not like the typical bronze player that just blames their entire team and not look at the reasons why we lost....but I&#039;m just lost at what could be done when I&#039;m on such tilt and losing game after game...Where on the web besides twitch streams can players really increase their knowledge base? \r\n\r\nThank you for any tips and tricks...Maybe my approach is just wrong, idk. Please don&#039;t tell me I suck or I need to just get good, If I wanted to read that I&#039;d play more games! :)","replies":[]}
