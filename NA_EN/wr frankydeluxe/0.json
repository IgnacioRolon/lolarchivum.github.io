I've also scrubbed the internet for answers and still haven't found a solution that fixes this issue. even when I do manage to log in, I'm greeted with this in-client popup window that never manages to reconnect me: https://s1.postimg.org/24tj0hyfr3/Screen_Shot_2017-10-23_at_5.45.18_PM.png\n\n I don't believe my wifi or internet settings are the issue since I've tried connecting from multiple sources through my Macbook Laptop.
