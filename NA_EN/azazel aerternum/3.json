I was intending to reroll them into a new champ, but if say the next 5 shards I buy turn out to be duds, and the unlocks aren't what I'd like, would I have been better off just hoarding the IP until the Preseason currency exchange?\r\n\r\nIs IP going to be a 1:1 ratio to Blue Essence, or like Blue Essence (currently) will it have a scaling ratio. I read through the entire 'post' or statement about the changes, and got a direct ratio for blue essence to new blue essence (1:6.5 exchange rate), will IP be better or worse than that?\r\n\r\n-> On a side note, are key fragment drops lesser than before? I came back after a 5 month break to find them exceedingly rare","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-01T21:49:13.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Blue Essence will be multiplied by 6.5 and then added to your current IP value. That will be your new Blue Essence total. AFAIK, the prices on stuff in the shop will stay the same, but will have a big ol' BE tag taped over the IP. A champion costing 6300 IP will now cost 6300 BE.\n\n\nSide Note: Key fragments haven't been changed recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Oak3","date":"2017-11-06T14:57:32.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, you said it is going to be a multiplier of 6.5 but the LOL preseason spotlight says it's going to be 17.8 (https://youtu.be/BGb4MovgqDY?t=318 at 5:18) Is that a typo in the video or which one is it going to be?","replies":[{"poster":"GorillaBoxers","date":"2017-11-06T16:02:05.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=boldi2010,realm=EUNE,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=cR5hd5KF,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-11-06T14:57:32.771+0000)\n>\n> Hey, you said it is going to be a multiplier of 6.5 but the LOL preseason spotlight says it's going to be 17.8 (https://youtu.be/BGb4MovgqDY?t=318 at 5:18) Is that a typo in the video or which one is it going to be?\n\nYesss Thanks so much for posting this!
