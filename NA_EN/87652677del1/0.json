Do RITO WORKERS or ROBOTS take care of them?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wondering randomly, does a worker at riot games take care of reports and review chat logs? Or do robots scan chat log for phrases or slurs. My guess is theres a section and Riot Games that take care of these reports. Whoever was reported for verbal stuff people look at chat log and be like. MM MMM NOPE bad person, and throw down the hammer.\r\n\r\nBUT if it IS people, are they well rested and happy workers? Or tired and ughh workers that just breeze through without much effort into the stuff.\r\n\r\njust random thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T20:37:50.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Little bit of both tbh. Some of it is caught automatically like certain words or phrases. Some of them are handled manually when needed.","replies":[{"poster":"87652677DEL1","date":"2017-10-20T23:03:03.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool!
