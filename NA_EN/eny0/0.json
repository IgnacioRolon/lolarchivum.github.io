( i never play mage champions in ranked games didn&#039;t even tried to learn them since I&#039;m an OTP player).\nthanx, and sorry for my poor English.\n\n***UPDATE*** ==>My point is=>\nI played thousands of games and more than 400 ranked game every season and I climbed from bronze 4 to gold 5 by playing Akali only last season as I said I'm an otp player and I just want to know how should i try to get larger champion pool by adding more assassins (the role I'm good at) or should I add mage champions and try to learn that role?\n\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:28}}\nCurrent Rank: Silver 2\nS7 Rank: Gold 5\nS6 Rank: Silver 5","replies":[{"poster":"Kubox","date":"2018-06-23T17:43:50.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new system coming seems less aimed forcing you to play one lane but rather protect you from autofill by giving the filled player a lower MMR than the one their main role usually is at. So basically, if matchmaking sends you to the top lane but you never top lane, you won't lose as many LP because you were clearly handicapped.  Likewise, if you win, you'll win slightly more LP than usual because you've shown that you don't even need your main or even secondary role to win.\n\nAs for your question, a deeper champion pool is always a boon, but if you do not enjoy playing any mage at all, then I wouldn't bother as your performance will likely be worst than if you picked an assassin. I think you should give various mages a look, if not all of them, to see if there is one you enjoy and can fall back upon, but at your MMR, knowing your champion, the matchups and general game knowledge is more than enough (if not the most important thing) to climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Madsin25","date":"2018-06-23T18:56:27.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game knowledge gets important when you get to plat+. \n\nYou climb lower ranks by faceplanting your keyboard on an extremely OP champ.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Madsin25","date":"2018-06-23T18:50:11.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well tbfh dude if you like assassins play {{champion:91}}.

It sounds like you're an otp I recommend sticking with that unless something changes and you can play any role any lane.  One tricking can get boring I know;  I one tricked Trynd and aatrox for a long time and had to branch out;  I play Katarina now which is a very different playstyle.  If you're thinking about branching out I think it's your brain telling you to try new things.  It's all up to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2018-06-23T16:34:26.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should play champions you like. dont worry about the classification system because most of it is bs at this point. if you have a champion that can deal magic, a champion that can deal physical, and they're both viable then you're good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurtherScape","date":"2018-06-23T16:15:47.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need 16 champions unlocked to play LoL Ranked and to have overall fun and learning the game.\n\nYou get assigned a Lane, you will never get to choice pick a lane, your going to want to Master 3<Champions and 2-5<sideline champions that your good at to avoid Pick/Bans \n\nDepending on the current Meta Game, its not going to matter if your good at a champion or not, they get instant pick/banned. \n\nThis isn't a easy game to pickup like it used to be, but was always planned to be exactly what it is today </CHEERS>","replies":[{"poster":"ENY0","date":"2018-06-23T16:22:55.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx for the reply :)\nI'm not new to the game I know these infos and this isn't my question bro I played thousands of games and more than 400 ranked game every season and I climbed from bronze 4 to gold 5 by playing Akali only last season as I said I'm an otp player and I just what to know how should i try to get larger champion pool by adding more assassins (the role I'm good at) or should I add mage champions and try to learn that role?","replies":[]}]}]}
