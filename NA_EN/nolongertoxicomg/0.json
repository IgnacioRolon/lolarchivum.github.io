You're also wagering the status of the game on this argument, because your jungler didn't help you (whether intentional or not) you're purposefully going to be a detriment to your team by refusing to help them.\n \n To keep it short, be the bigger person and just walk away. It's not about getting the last word in or playing a certain way out of spite, it's about winning the game and keeping your composure. If you can't cooperate with your teammates, mute them and focus on how you can improve the situation.\n\n[](https://.)\n\n##Game 2:\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: get out of my lane\nNoLongerToxicOMG: or get reported and banned\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: you fed them a kill and did no damage\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: report ezreal\nNoLongerToxicOMG: hes crybaby\nNoLongerToxicOMG: he wont stop whinning\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: now its over\nNoLongerToxicOMG: its over\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: gg\nNoLongerToxicOMG: report this toxic ezreal\nNoLongerToxicOMG: Enjoy your ban\n\n\n Continually asking for reports can be considered player harassment as it doesn't do anything to better the situation and it won't result in punishments being doled out more often. It takes one report to trigger a game for automatic review, you don't need to ask other players to report Ezreal.\n\n On top of that, using reports as a weapon (saying things like \"enjoy your ban\" and \"get reported and banned\") is spiteful, unhelpful, and negative. Same thing as above, be the bigger person and walk away. If they make a bad play, tell them _constructively_ how they can play better and help them, don't berate them for it. \n\nEveryone makes mistakes. \n\n[](https://.)\n\n##Game 3\n>Pre-Game\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: in this elo? theyre bad\nNoLongerToxicOMG: bad\nNoLongerToxicOMG: do it yourself\nNoLongerToxicOMG: its over\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: Urgot\nNoLongerToxicOMG: 14 deaths\nNoLongerToxicOMG: stfu 4/6\nPost-Game\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: Remember what I said kass\nNoLongerToxicOMG: Kass players in low elo are bad\nNoLongerToxicOMG: You only killed me twice this game\n>NoLongerToxicOMG: ?\nNoLongerToxicOMG: Later crybaby\n\n\n You really need to stop saying \"it's over\" and being passive aggressive with your teammates, that isn't going to make you more likely to win. Your teammates are there to _help_ you and even if they're being difficult you need to work with them to win.\n\n Focus on improving your mentality, don't take your games so seriously, and try to work with your teammates in the future. \n\n>Is this worth a 14 day suspension since I really didn't say anything vulgar or hate speech, \n\n If you received previous punishments in the form of a 10-game chat restriction and a 25-game chat restriction, yes, these logs will warrant a 14-day gameplay suspension. The next step is a permanent suspension.\n\n Riot has already made it abundantly clear that this behavior is unacceptable, now they're going to start getting more serious with the punishments as a way to stop toxicity dead in it's tracks.\n\n>Also if its important, I carried and won 2/3 of these games, so I don't know how was I suspended for griefing.\n\n It's not really important, honestly. Whether you carried this game or went 0/20, players don't appreciate this type of language and Riot doesn't condone it in any capacity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-06-23T01:45:04.443+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> NoLongerToxicOMG: olaf you need to gank to win\nNoLongerToxicOMG: you cant farm all fuckin game\nNoLongerToxicOMG: Im done\nNoLongerToxicOMG: mid open\nNoLongerToxicOMG: better jg wins\nNoLongerToxicOMG: olaf just afk farms all game and doesnt gank mid or top\nNoLongerToxicOMG: just botlane\nNoLongerToxicOMG: no shit?\nNoLongerToxicOMG: sucks doesnt it\nNoLongerToxicOMG: when no one helps you\nNoLongerToxicOMG: shes been mid more than you\nNoLongerToxicOMG: you have ganked mid 0 times\nNoLongerToxicOMG: she ganked mid 3 times\nNoLongerToxicOMG: theres a difference\nNoLongerToxicOMG: lets do a recap\nNoLongerToxicOMG: you have gotten a dragon\nNoLongerToxicOMG: you havent ganked mid once\nNoLongerToxicOMG: why should I help you when you dont help me?\nNoLongerToxicOMG: what lead?\n\nNot even six full lines in and you start harassing your Jungler, saying \"open mid\", and starting into a needless argument.\n\nAnd, just so you know; _calling \"open x\" is negative behavior, regardless of whether or not you gave up or whether or not you performed well._\n\n> NoLongerToxicOMG: but no jg was presence in this game\nNoLongerToxicOMG: babysit?

You spent an unnecessary amount of time harassing teammates and shittalking people overmuch, and with that being consistent behavior, I'd say it goes over the line from negative to toxic.\n\n> Is this worth a 14 day suspension since I really didn't say anything vulgar or hate speech...\n\nYou don't have to use excessive vulgarity or hate speech to warrant a 14-day ban. If you recently came off of a 25-game Chat Restriction (which seems more than likely given the consistent negativity), then the next punishment on the ladder would be a 14-day ban.\n\n> Also if its important, I carried and won 2/3 of these games, so I don't know how was I suspended for griefing.\n\nIt doesn't matter. Your performance does not exempt you from the rules.\n\nAdditionally, the \"griefing\" subtitle of the **Negative Attitude** report category is a misnomer. It refers to general negative behavior, such as defeatism and passive-aggressive remarks, not to gameplay misbehavior like trolling/intentionally feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-23T01:49:13.516+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Announcing open mid, harassing your teammates for their scores, arguing constantly, calling for reports, etc. (I didn't go through all three logs) are definitely considered toxic, yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JetRam","date":"2019-06-23T03:04:08.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I genuinely wonder if you spent more time typing than playing.
