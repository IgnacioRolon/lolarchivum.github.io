I created an account 2/3 years ago due to problems in the server that I play (Brazil), the problem is that I have 6 accs on the Brazilian server, some to play only with a champion or route, so I come to ask for help. Since the times I tried to recover from the riot site, I ended up losing because it does not have this option. I've tried using other options on the site, but I have not had success. I do not remember the full emails only parts of the emails, but I do not remember the login name and possibly the passwords, since most of them are created per table. Type each part remember another email and password, it's a weird kind of method and should be why in 6 years, playing Ragnarok (300 servers, all with different logins), acc smurf in CS, Lague of Legends, should be the first time I have this problem. If any riot could help me would be grateful, I can pass on the other information by mp.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T21:48:04.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hot dang that's a lot of Ragnarok accounts!
