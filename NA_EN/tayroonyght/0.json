I've checked it over and over, even changed away from and back to the setting, still get the same message. Please help!\nI don't know if it matters or not, but I had LoL on an old computer about a year ago and stopped playing. Just re-downloaded today on a new computer to get back into it. But all the in-game graphics settings I used on my old comp were the lowest settings (free way to decent fps), so I wouldn't think it would make any difference now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T21:03:27.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you still hear in-game sounds despite the black screen?  It sounds like you're connected just fine, but something like a bad driver is failing to render the game.

I found out that if I hit \"alt+enter\" at the black screen, it loads up the game in \"window mode\". I can switch to \"borderless\" and still play just fine, but the \"full screen\" option takes it back to black. Seems to just be something in the resolution settings, but I'm not very techy, and I have a work-around, so I consider this solved. Don't believe it was an issue with the game. Thanks for all your help, Porocles. Rito has at least some great guys working for them. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
