Seven years actually. I'm a toxic player sure, but chat restricts seemed doable. Mute button there for a reason. \r\n\r\nI was never racist, homophobic, and I never encouraged anyone to kill themselves. All I did was flame trolls when they flamed me. Because I have a backbone, I was banned. Years of my life and thousands of dollars later, I'm permanently banned. All because my support started stealing my farm after I made a bad play. All because I'm tired of letting people walk on me in chat. Riot, you're the one with the problem. You can't police your community correctly. My mid lane Yasuo spammed \"kill yourself\" at me for simply being trolled by another player. That Senna will keep playing. That Yasuo will keep playing. But me? Me and my seven years with you? All the good memories and close games. It's all gone because you just sit back and do nothing. You let a chat filter ban me for defending myself time and time again. I wonder if they'll be as loyal as I was? \r\n\r\nWhen will you have actual justice in your game? I would like to say so many angry things and demand that something be done. But none of you care. Just grinding for that next skin release, huh? In a way, this is sort of freeing. I can finally stop being addicted to this toxic cesspool and maybe do something with my life. With policies like this, your game isn't going to last another ten years. \r\n\r\nHappy Anniversary, League of Legends, and goodbye.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-11-13T19:13:03.075+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">I'm a toxic player sure, but chat restricts seemed doable.

Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nIf your teammates had muted you at the first sign of your misbehavior, that would've minimized their exposure to it. However, the only people who wouldn't even see that first sign are those who /mute all at the start of every game. Everyone else would get that initial taste of your toxicity. The rules are intended to make chat _positive and useful_. If your presence means that anyone making the slightest effort to communicate in a team game has to deal with the sort of chat messages you've displayed here, that's on you, not on them. _Behave yourself._\n\nYou are certainly allowed to defend yourself from toxic chat, which is accomplished by muting. This is a 100% effective method. Flaming back is a 0% effective method that also constitutes unacceptable behavior and thus opens you up to reports and punishments. Read about this in more detail [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Pqc6PJUE-players-who-flame-back-in-self-defense-dont-understand-the-meaning-of-those-words).\n\nDid you find something in Riot's store [allowing you to break the ToS](https://i.imgur.com/AvDSnZF.png)? No, because such a service is not offered. Regardless of how much money you spend, you are required to follow the same rules as everyone else. If the IFS determines that you've been validly reported in violation of those rules, you'll be punished according to those rules. If you wanted to avoid a punishment, you should've followed the rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emper√∏r Rhaast","date":"2019-11-13T19:13:04.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, you fed the flame.
