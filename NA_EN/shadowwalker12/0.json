If that update never seems to go through correctly, try using this [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with the option **force repatch** turned on.

I have been getting the whole reconnect thing ever since the latest patch. And, I am up to 25 minute wait times because it tells me I am leaving games, but it never actually loads the client for me to play any games once past the champ select. And, as I can see, I am not the only one having these sort of technical errors. Also, after reading through the forums, RIOT has their middle finger raised and are in no rush to aid those who are experiencing difficulty.  They will still gladly take your money, though. :)","replies":[]}]}
