I checked my payment records to see if it was my fault. I tallied up my PR expenses and I was still coming up with my having about 500 RP less than i should. So I head to the refund option to see if I can get the full price on the refund but it told me that I would only receive the on sale price as the refund. Please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-01T17:12:02.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey RevengeHawk,\n\nIf you were charged incorrectly for Riven, please submit a [ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4584) to Player Support to we can investigate and correct the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2015-08-02T09:50:42.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And here I thought you were going to start complaining that you spent RP on Gangplank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yenix","date":"2015-08-02T03:42:06.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riven is able to cancel her sale now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Candel","date":"2015-08-02T07:00:28.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was also robbed of my RP when I bought the Gangplank skin bundle the day before he was killed and disabled for no reason.","replies":[]}]}
