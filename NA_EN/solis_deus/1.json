I can hear the right sounds but it keeps freezing up at every 10 seconds. Can someone please help? I'm leaving my team out to dry currently\n\nEDIT: Finished the game, went into a custom, still happening. Ping and FPS are fine (never had this problem before), but it just freezes randomly, reverses back to a previous point in the game, and repeat.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-25T23:09:36.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever it looks like your game is going back in time, it's a pretty good sign that you're connection is having some packet loss.
