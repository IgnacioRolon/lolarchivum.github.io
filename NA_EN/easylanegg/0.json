For an ability that also takes no mana and can basically be spammed almost non-stop I want to know if he&#039;s suppose to be able to do this or do I need to report this player from ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-25T03:47:43.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely a bug, if it is hitting you, no other champion is being targeted, and he is not being targeted.\n\nKeep in mind there is a brief delay between turret targeting and firing, if he was running out of range.","replies":[{"poster":"EasyLaneGG","date":"2017-02-25T03:49:42.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thank you, and no he was completely solo and not out of range, literally underneath my turret, I know he couldn't be designed to do that. He did it non-stop so wasn't a one time thing.","replies":[]}]}]}
