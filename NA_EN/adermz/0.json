If you know the person or have them on your friends list you most likely are already using discord. I guess it applies to a few people who don&#039;t have each other added on discord and just want to talk on league.  I think Riot should eventually add voice chat into the games you play without being in a party. Riot could add a join voice chat option instead of automatically throwing everyone into it like in CSGO. I just never see myself ever using the voice chat in its current party state when I already use discord.","replies":[]}
