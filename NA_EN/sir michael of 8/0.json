Hell, I had a friend growing up who has always sucked at video games. He tried league and lasted about a month, and was garbage at the game. It wasnt a problem of luck. He had no skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Michael of 8","date":"2020-01-25T20:20:04.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't see it, sorry.

What dont you see? Lol i dont get it. Typing is a fucking skill. So is manipulating digital sprites on a screen in a precise manner. A \"luck shot\" would be something that shoots in a random direction and its just a matter of luck that it hits someone. A \"skill shot\" is where YOU direct the shot at a moving (or hell, maybe the target is immobile, which would take less SKILL to hit) target with the goal of hitting said target.\n\nIf the game was pure luck like a slot machine, then my 5 year old nephews could beat me or you. Thats not the case with this game, but I bet they could win more than me at an actual luck based game like slots, because thats just based on luck. \n\nIn League, they would click around randomly because they dont have the skill and knowledge of the game to make good decisions, and then actually execute (the skill part) actions based on those decisions. Of course there is skill involved. I dont know how someone could be so blind not to recognize that.

You control the shot but it is luck whether you hit the target because the target isn't stationary or moving in a predictable way.  \n\nIf the target were stationary or moving in a predictable way then you could call it skill, but champs don't move predictably so it's luck.\n\nI'm not sure how someone could be so blind not to recognise that since it's so obvious!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-03-30T20:12:35.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lucky would mean he didn't deserve to win due to his weak skills but had teammates hard carry him out to victory.
