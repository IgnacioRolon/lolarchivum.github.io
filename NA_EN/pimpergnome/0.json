What gives?  First it would be available again on the third...now the fourth...yet it still isn&#039;t available claiming &quot;out of stock&quot; like it has been forever.  Will it be available or not?  My Ziggs is lonely.  Doesn&#039;t seem right to offer something and then not follow through.\r\n\r\nAnother is forcing people to play Gangplank with only a week left.  No offense Riot...but this is insane.  Basically 80% + of people trying to get the skin won&#039;t get it now.  If you play in a draft mode...it will be 100% banned by people who have already played him or 100% first picked.  It will be virtually guaranteed that anything you try to play people will be fighting over him simply to get a skin.  Doesn&#039;t seem right.  Instead players should receive the skin for free if they already owned Gangplank AND they completed all three &quot;missions&quot; available during the event.  That way people can actually play instead of constantly dodging and banning out a single champion.","replies":[]}
