No. When you have a lane that is a constant source of gold and exp, as opposed to the scarcity of camps, they're going to get upset you take their things without permission. If you're behind, just ask. Most jg are willing to give ADC red and mid blue, unless they're feeding. \n\n2. This is kinda true. You should still listen if they want to take dragon or baron because this helps everyone, not just themselves. Use your best judgment. \n\n3. Leashing is an 8 second activity whereas ganking and camping your lane is an extended investment that consumes a lot of resources. It can easily go sour if it fails. \n\nIf you die to a gank, yes, it is your fault. The jungle isn't the only one who will say this. Ward. \n\nIf the enemy jg is invading often, then help. They're overextended into dangerous territory with little to no vision. Take the opportunity to get an easy kill and help yourself in the long run by helping your jg help you. If you don't  then yes, it is your fault again.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-02-07T02:30:29.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":28,"body":"1.

Most of the time those are the worse people on the team, and especially in jungle were people think its a required skill. \n\n3. You still make it sound mandatory, which is hilarious coming from the group of people who hate being ordered. Also depending on the leash and where the minions are in lane, you might just fall behind from the get go in lane doing so. \n\n4. Its not my fault that you can 1v1 the opposing jungler and its not my job to keep him out of \"your\" jungle. I'm not leaving lane to get collapsed on by a mid laner who followed me and a jungler you pose no threat to.","replies":[{"poster":"Raiku Kawisa","date":"2016-02-07T05:04:21.928+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"You leash once out of the entire game. After that, the only time jungle needs help is taking baron and dragon should be a team event anyway, and if they get invaded. More on that in a moment. However, the jungler is constantly expected to help lanes at all times. After their first clear, lanes expect junglers to be their personal supports (not all laners, just the toxic ones). As far as camps go, i have no issue if the laner is behind and top/Bot takes Krugs/Gromp or Mid takes chickens. However, if all three lanes are taking those camps, the jungler is down half of his gold experience income for the next 90 seconds. Laners get a fresh wave of 6 (sometimes 7) minions every 30 seconds i think it is. You can afford to give 2 to the jungler if he took the enemy's flash and/or got a kill. (I do agree that any more minions that that is too much, and never the cannon unless the laner is going back and the jungler is pushing out the wave, And taxing for a failed gank is obnoxious.)\n\nBack to if they get invaded, thats at least +150g for you, double that if you get the kill. You also remove the threat of the enemy jungler showing up in your lane after he just killed your jungle. I'm not saying stop the invade if all 5 members of the enemy team in going after your jungle. Just show up, kill the enemy jungle and get back to your lane, its well worth the missing 3-5 minions. If the invading jungler has help, ping your jungler out and pressure the lane with the missing enemy. \n\nOn the flip side, if you are getting ganked, \"it's not the jungler's job to keep the enemy out of your lane\". Actually, it is. If the enemy is ganking your lane and I'm not on the other side of the map, I'm going to show up to help to make sure the enemy doesn't get a kill, and possibly pick up one or two for our team. \n\nOn the subject of shotcalling I have no comment. I play Shyvana, thus I can solo dragon with ease provided I make sure the enemy has no vision and I know where the enemy jungler is. After that, I don't even bother, I know I don't have the right experience to shotcall objectives. \n\nAs far as leashing. The first clear of a jungler is the most painful. A bad first clear can really fuck up the rest of the game for the jungler. Thats why Leashes exist. The better first clear a jungler has, the better game they will have, and the sooner they can get to ganking.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-02-07T05:16:52.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":18,"body":"The jungle mains you are describing in this game do not exist.
