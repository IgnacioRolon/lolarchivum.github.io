Despite this if he can manage to slap R after a good initiation he can win a vital teamfight for his team despite being 0/9 and having the CS only 12 better than that of the support.  Accidentally using his wind wall well can also win a teamfight for his team by screwing over your adc.  And god forbid you run into the 3 or 4 man premade that runs a \"yasuo comp\".

Basically any early game pressure jungler is guilty with this. In my mind comes {{champion:64}}  {{champion:28}}  {{champion:121}}  {{champion:254}}  {{champion:60}}  every single one of them can execute a low health champion with no effort. Then they complain, because they're getting focused in teamfights while having all of the kill gold in their possession.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2015-12-16T22:46:59.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yasuo","replies":[]}]}
