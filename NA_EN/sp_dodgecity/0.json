But in all Seriousness, While Orianna is really safe, she's not really safe on the level that Ahri is, or Anivia. She's pretty vulnerable to divers so if they have a fed hecrim or Zac, expect to see a lot of grey on your screen. with Ahri... not so much. Your ult will probably be wasted every time and you probably won't have much impact other than drawing attention mid, but at least you'll live.","replies":[{"poster":" Maddened King ","date":"2017-04-04T20:24:48.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I do agree. Ahri is a lot safer. Which is why she is the most picked champion. Orianna does not have Ahri's mobility and as you said cannot deal with dives just like any other non-mobility mage. But at the same time, she can clear waves fast enough to the point you cannot push in the wave for a dive. She plays well when behind and plays extremely well ahead. She has a very flexible build path and is probably one of the best control mages. Anivia is also one of those hidden gems that will see a rise in play. She has amazing poke, her wall is a game changer and she can be non-interactive with her lane if she chooses to with her R. I honestly think that Orianna and Ahri are both amazing champions. I don't think they need a nerf, I think Riot needs to work champions up to their level.","replies":[{"poster":"Viktor Von Lazer","date":"2017-04-04T22:44:02.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name= Maddened King ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mcilahoi,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2017-04-04T20:24:48.438+0000)\n>\n> Oh, I do agree.

Every since ghost and rylais got nerfed Viktor took a pretty hard hit, I wanted to be a Viktor/Ori main, but because the second part of his E is relatively unreliable now and it's pretty hard to get the last tick of damage off on his ult, it doesn't seem  worth investing in. You're effectively going to be doing the same damage as a well placed Ori ult but bring none of that utility. I think he could use, not a damage buff, but a little more reliability to damage already in his kit. And at some point hopefully they'll do something with Azir and his awkward spot. Technically for those who've invested 100+ games in him, he's in a decent spot where mains can hard carry games  but for anyone else he's pretty much asking to lose. Hope to see some word on him soon. A long ranged AoE DPS mage is what Azir is meant to be, hopefully they keep the concept but make it more accessible/not broken whenever they do make changes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2017-04-04T23:06:25.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted.
