Is the game fair for most time (games including ARAM, RANK, and draft pick)?

Look at my game history. When I played ARAM, I always  lost. In 20 percent of my games, teammates afk. My damage dealt is ok for most of games. I think riot should fix it. I know there is a system that riot might use. When I continuous losing the game, some of my teammates become gold ranking players, but it is still useless because they didn't play well as they should be (For example, they should be better than me a bronze player right?\" Another thing is that my enemy are much better than my teammates at most of my game. If I can't carry, I lose. (It include ARAM and draft pick, Also look my game history). Last but not least, ZOMBIEMASTER (this guy) closed another post's comment, and reply me without letting me reply him, such a mean guy). By the way, if you can tell riot of my comment, I suggest they make a Questionnaire survey for each year so that players can directly tell their opinion to them instead of discussing in this comments blog. I think that should be much better to improve the game.
