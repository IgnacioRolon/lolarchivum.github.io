Then I look at the league, and there I got in promotions 1 win and 1 defeat (before the remake, I had only one win).\r\n\r\nI wrote on a eune forum already, but the community told me to write here.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://i.nahraj.to/f/1vln.png      ( Picture of the match....

What you're seeing is a visual issue.  The game was remade, but the match history page has to show something, so it's currently doing a loss or win even though it doesn't actually mean anything.  Also in general, I recommend sticking to the match history in client or on our[ match history page](http://matchhistory.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/#page/landing-page).  Third party sites aren't always up to date or entirely accurate since we don't support them.  Everything look okay!","replies":[{"poster":"Polovec","date":"2016-08-13T16:40:54.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i didnt lost LP but i got 1 loss in promotion...","replies":[]}]}]}
