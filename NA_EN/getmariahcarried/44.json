You also get 5 points every day the queue is available, whether you log in or not.\n* You can apply voting points to your vote in champ select. A voting point &quot;weights&quot; your vote. One voting point makes your vote count as 2. Two makes it count as 3. You can use some, or all, or none of the points you&#039;ve saved up.\n* Total majority rules still apply (if 15 points were used by all players in total in a champ select, leading to 20 &quot;effective votes&quot;, 11 effective votes have to be to the same champ to count as majority)\n* If your choice doesn&#039;t win, you regain all points you applied to your vote (you don&#039;t pay for an auction you don&#039;t win.)\n\nThis would allow players who REALLY want to play a particular champ to express that. Although it might have the downside of making players who spam the queue the most have too much of a say in too many queues. That&#039;s why I added the &quot;5 points a day&quot; rule.\n\nThree reasons I want this:\n\n* Watching players battle over champions, to me, would be entertaining, not toxic (although I... probably should neeeeever make that assumption in League).\n* I&#039;d like to know that - after playing several games and, due to statistics being a pain with its inevitable outliers, not getting my vote 15 games in a row - I have a chance at SOME point of getting what I want. I&#039;d like that for other players too.\n* I&#039;d also like to know just HOW MUCH people want to play a particular champ. If someone REALLY wants to play a champ, I&#039;d go with it, but if someone&#039;s just like &quot;eh, I guess I&#039;ll try Tahm maybe. Oh I guess 20% Tahm won out against 40% Morgana. Whatever. You guys haven&#039;t played Tahm yet, right? Like a million times before?&quot; Yeah... I&#039;d like to not be subject to every whim.\n\n\nAs a person who NEVER queue-dodges on principle, I've started queue-dodging OfA, because I've seen the same crap 10 games in a row, and am just tired of it. I think it's saying something when a laid-back queue is convincing me to become a member of the dregs of the League community. Enough of this please.","replies":[]}
