This item by itself feels like a big &quot;screw you&quot; to current healers. Let&#039;s just look at the philosophy:\n\nRito&#039;s idea to make executioner&#039;s not niche item upon return? &quot;Let&#039;s roll it into last whisper so that you get it for free on an item that two players get by default every game.&quot;\n\n-.-\n\n&quot;And while we&#039;re at it, we&#039;ll make any single act of physical damage apply grievous for... basically two thirds the length of most teamfight (5 seconds).&quot;\n\n-.-\n\n&quot;Oh and uh... you can now get the grievous passive on a cheapass builder item early, in case you want lane-healing to be obsolete as well.&quot;\n\n-.-\n\nNot to mention there&#039;s an alternative tank-buster route too. So now you&#039;re pretty much guaranteed to have two ad&#039;s in a game that will wreck any healing or tanking anyone does. Oh and they boosted the arpen to 40% too.\n\n-.-\n\nI&#039;ll admit, I&#039;ll have a ton of fun when I use these items, but there&#039;s a problem here for certain champs we call AP. Maybe you&#039;re adding spellvamp to ad champs now and you need this, but basically you&#039;re counter buffing ad champs with other ad buffs. So where does everyone else fit in this? Soraka just got pawned.","replies":[]}
