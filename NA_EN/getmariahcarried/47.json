In prior seasons, a single rune page setup was good for a wide swath of champions (one ad, one ap, one ad tank, one ap tank, something like that) but Riot is trying to move away from the monotony in champs (every adc&#039;s gotta have it&#039;s own niche now, for example). And over time, as champions have become more unique, their rune/mastery needs have become very unique. It&#039;s really bothersome to constantly struggle with hitting those sweet spots across multiple champions. I&#039;d like to stop having to think &quot;gee, would be nice if I could have traded out some of that scaling cdr for more arpen, since I plan to build visage on this SPECIFIC ad fighter, but not others, and need precisely 10% less.&quot; This happens all the time in my setups.\r\n\r\nIf Riot&#039;s gonna make each champion unique as possible, setups should be unique to champions as well. I saw in another thread someone suggesting a boost in rune-page number, probably in order to combat this variety-in-needs issue. And yes, with over a hundred champions, all with different needs now, it&#039;s really getting obnoxious not having more options available. But it will get even MORE obnoxious if I have to manage even more pages, and then, with each one, think about over a hundred champions and try to decide, &quot;which champs is this specific rune page change gonna affect. Who uses this page now commonly? Who uses it rarely? What champions will use it now with these rune switches. What champions won&#039;t? What other rune page should I change since this no longer meets the needs of champ xyz?&quot;\r\n\r\nSeriously, just give me rune pages unique to each champion, and I don&#039;t have to deal with this headache. When setting up a rune page for a champion, I only want to have to think about THAT champion.\r\n\r\nAdditional ideas that I&#039;m just brainstorming here. Not sure how I feel about any of them. But they&#039;re worth punting. Take&#039;em or leave&#039;em:\r\n\r\n* Allow addition of new rune pages on a champion by champion basis up to some cap (say, 640 ip for a new rune page on Wukong, or something). Maybe start out with 2 on a champ, and you can build up to 5 or something, I dunno.\r\n* Link a champion&#039;s rune options to their mastery level? (I think this would be similar to a system in HotS, which I wasn&#039;t a big fan of. The hero setup-progression was kinda grindy. Grinds are dumb. But eh, it&#039;s a thought.)\r\n* DON&#039;T create champion-specific rune pages, as in last bullet, but DO consider champion-specific rune customizations. (i.e. tryndamere is given 12 marks, but only 6 seals. Meanwhile, Rammus is given 12 seals, but only 6 marks.) Would add some variety to a rather stale rune system.","replies":[]}
