Awesome ganks. With scaling cdr runes, you&#039;d catch almost every enemy escaping a teamfight. You had pretty decent dps routes for a primarily flat-damage dealer:\r\n\r\n* Titanic\r\n* Liandry&#039;s\r\n* Abyssal/Wit&#039;s to self-boost your passive (NICE TRY RITO! CAN&#039;T STOP THIS!)\r\n* Deadman&#039;s\r\n* Trinity + Sterak&#039;s (plus trinity seals the deal on catching those stragglers)\r\n\r\nBut the main issue now is that early jungle sustain is much harder for someone like Leo. Her aoe is too intermittent for talisman to really sustain her. There&#039;s no flat armor route in masteries, and I missed the percent max-health burn jungle mastery, which, to be honest, wasn&#039;t needed by most champs, but it was great for a few off-beat junglers like Leo.\r\n\r\nNow the only way I can see to get the right sustain to still be able to gank at level 3 is to buy machete and go straight early sustain in my rune setup: ad marks, lifesteal quints, flat armor seals. That gives me REALLY good sustain, along with a few sustain masteries. But all of that is of zero use to Leo mid/late-game. Plus I have to ditch some cdr runes, at which point my build gravitates more towards iceborne/fh, which is cool, but puts Leo much closer to her flat damage/pure-utility role that doesn&#039;t really even REQUIRE items by mid/lategame. At which point, I&#039;m thinkin&#039;, &quot;why even put her in a farming role if I&#039;m not gonna build her to take advantage of items anymore?&quot; which then puts her back into support role, and that steals all the fun out of it.\r\n\r\nHas anybody out there tried S6 jungle Leo, and if so, have you found an easier sustain route that doesn&#039;t sacrifice mpen marks, spammability, good dps item passives, etc?","replies":[{"poster":"deucalion07","date":"2015-11-22T23:43:18.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did on the pbe several times the new green smite makes it too easy star golems red wolves blue and b its totally viable","replies":[{"poster":"dangopee","date":"2015-11-23T00:07:20.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is this green smite you speak of?","replies":[{"poster":"deucalion07","date":"2015-11-25T06:33:26.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ward smite","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dangopee","date":"2015-11-22T23:15:22.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The jungle is still too broken and unstable right now.
