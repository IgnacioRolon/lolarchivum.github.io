Au contraire! Weighing the scale with itself is parodoxically impossible. Therefore it has no self-weighed weight to begin with. Therefore, there's no weighable weight that can be taken away by zero-gravity. Since zero-gravity can't take away the weight, the weight remains in zero-gravity. -Q.E.WUT. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-05-18T05:00:05.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build one of those old fashioned scales with a rock and a piece of 2x4 or plywood. stack enough stuff on the other side to counter balance the scale. then box up and weigh the assortment of other odds and ends.
