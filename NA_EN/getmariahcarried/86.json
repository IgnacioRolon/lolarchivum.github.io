Thanks for giving players a chance to say &quot;OO! Look at all these cool new items... that I&#039;ll never get to try in 4 out of 5 games, since towers are now just glorified mega-sticks of butter waiting to be melted whenever Leo sneezes.&quot;\n\nIt doesn&#039;t matter whether you&#039;re snowballing or feeding, the game ends way too fast to get any satisfaction out of it. Don&#039;t say &quot;oh, we&#039;ll balance these issues out over multiple patches.&quot; Games that are 15-20 minutes shorter and end by the second full item on most champs is a HUGE DIFFERENCE, which should have been OBVIOUS ON THE PBE. And all it takes is a few stat changes on towers, minions, and Herald buffs to have a more conservative, normally-paced SR coming out of the gates with this new patch. I&#039;m multiple times more likely to hit late game in ARAM. That&#039;s saying something.\n\nIf you want shorter, fast-paced games, fine. Then change the gold source mechanics to reflect that and give people a chance to get their items sooner. Better that than changing the mechanics to let players delete their objectives with toothpicks. If you think faster items will favor carries too much, fine!

I mean this post doesn't even make sense.  If the game is designed to snowball, games will be shorter regardless of how even the two teams are.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GetBoomedOn","date":"2015-11-13T01:35:03.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AtheosisX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HvoVukOP,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-13T01:31:29.873+0000)\n>\n> Huh?

I never implied that. I never believed that. I've in fact called people out in other threads that claim comebacks AREN'T possible. Heck, one of the things that pisses me off since pre-season started is that no one will give a single game a chance anymore. Although I can't really blame them when a kennen/taric can backdoor two lane towers, an inhib, two nexus towers, and the actual nexus in the time it takes one teamfight mid to finish (yes, that happened). The chance for comebacks has essentially halved, and with it, people's tolerance for behind games past 20 minutes has dropped to almost nothing. It's dropped to WAY less than it should be, even for this preseason (I feel like the entire community's been replaced by a bunch of quitters, and all the draft-pick meta-ragers are suddenly flooding teambuild for who knows what reason) but still, it has dropped for a reason.\n\nBut regardless, what bothers me even MORE is people pulling lies out of their ass to support claims that are blatantly indefensible. In other words, people like you (yes, like you, and unlike you, I can actually back that). First you lied about your matches. Then you lied about me, which is where you cross the line. This is my one post to clarify the FACTS for anyone else bothering to read. Feel free to reply, but just know, I'm not wasting my time reading any more of your crap. So don't expect any further responses from me.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2015-11-14T22:01:45.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had one last 36, felt super long for what I'm experiencing here.
