From what I gleaned, I guess it's having someone carry your account through a few ranks for you. Obviously not cool. But based on the content of the thread, it also sounded like accounts are generally flagged if they're identified as being used by more than one person ever.\n\nWhy do I bring this up? As stated in another unrelated thread, I \"needed\" two accounts named \"Donkey\" and \"Kong\" (plus tags) devoted to Soraka and Wukong exclusively. I hope it's obvious why... but this was mainly for duoing with a friend in 3s, teambuilder, whatever. Which means I wouldn't be the only one using the accounts. At the same time, I didn't really care who picked which account in a given duo session.\n\nI take it this might be a problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-09-30T22:28:46.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"C.
