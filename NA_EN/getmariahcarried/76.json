Sadly, new raka no longer has this capability, and other healers aren't strong enough, but it seems it&#039;s still possible with Mundo.\n\nLast year, it also occurred to me that you could put 1 raka on each team, superfarm to 18 and a nearly full build with single or double lane proxy while the remaining 8 players assist by suiciding on the rakas. Once raka reaches the triple proxy phase, other players could start a basically lvl 1 match with no minions. It would devolve into a bunch of sneaky team jungle farming/skirmishing until players could handle turrets.\n\nI never got around to trying it that year, but now that I know it&#039;s still possible with Mundo (maybe not as easy to farm up pre 6 though) I&#039;d like to try it this year, but that requires 10 like-minded individuals. Post here if interested, or just gather your own band of players, and let us know here how it goes.","replies":[]}
