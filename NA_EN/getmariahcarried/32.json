Seriously, queue time is like 10 seconds. Surely they can make more options then one blindpick/majority. It&#039;s really obnoxious when I&#039;ve wanted to play wukong for 15 games in a row, and instead, see for the millionth time, Tahm/Lux/Darius/Malph/Brand/Blitz/Yasuo picks. Come on, this game mode has so much potential for variety. Don&#039;t people get tired of playing the same crap over and over? I go into this gamemode hoping I get a chance to try each champ once. Good luck with even getting a new one after the first 10% of champs are down. What you saw in the first 10 games is probably all you&#039;ll see. \n\nHow hard can it possibly be to make a teambuild/draftpick/ANY-OTHER-CHOICE queue along side blindvote? I spam the heck out of this gamemode because, in PRINCIPLE, I love it. In practice, majority pick with no alternative ruins everything. This one aspect makes the gamemode feel like garbage sometimes. I&#039;m about to post a thread on another option I&#039;ve considered. But I don&#039;t care, for this thread, what people think about a particular alternative queue. I just want to know what people think about ANY alternative.","replies":[{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2015-10-18T17:22:22.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of my Friday matches had a lot of variety, although since most of them are LC$ mascots that built AD Offtank, I had a lot of losses","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-19T22:14:11.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find the first 20 rounds have plenty of variety, and then the rest are basically the same as the first 20.
