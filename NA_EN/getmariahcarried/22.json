Okay, that statement&#039;s sacrilegious. Forget I said that. It didn&#039;t happen. Let&#039;s move on.\n\nI suggested this a couple years back, but didn&#039;t get any feedback. My current struggle with finding room for trinity/sterack on jungle Vi has made me nostalgic. To quote the original description (with forum icons, S6 updates, and random double-boot BS added):\n\n> Ever had a champion that you just wanted too many things from all at once?\n>\n>Can&#x27;t play {{champion:102}} without having all these items simultaneously? (I know I can&#x27;t)\n> \n> {{item:1401}} {{item:1419}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3075}}{{item:3143}} \n>\n> #Then this is the gametype for you! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n>\n> #With *** double the cap on items, and double the gold from all sources ***! \n>\n> #Build the perfect full-crit + full-arpen + full-tank build on {{champion:18}}! {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n> #Or just troll the enemy team with 6 additional {{item:3027}} on {{champion:13}} ! {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}\n> #You can never have too much of a good thing... or a bad thing as this will probably turn out to be 90% of the time.\n> #(I'm looking at you AD {{champion:1}}!). {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nThings I would add:\n\n* Double the cap on certain stats (Maybe not CDR. That's an URF thing.)\n* Would be hard to code, 'cause it's pre-game setup, but double the mastery points and point cap on a given mastery.\n* Double the cap on passive/active \"uniqueness\" (Stack them twice, but no more.)\n* Double all stats on minions, monsters, and towers (we don't want them to melt.)\n* DOUBLE THE RESPAWNS! (vague inaccurate way of saying \"halve the respawn times\")\n* Double the level cap, ability point cap, and exp.\n* #NAME IT DOUBLE JEOPARDY.\n\nRegarding uniques: Can be the same version of the passive/active doubled (2 tabis = 20% reduction of damage from aa&#039;s, probably multiplicative, not additive though.) or 2 different versions of the same unique working together instead of one canceling the other (ravenous + titanic). My suggested build for Shyv totally doesn&#039;t make me biased in this matter at all. Just a thought... let it simmer.\n\nP.S. {{champion:39}} + {{item:3111}} + {{item:3111}} + {{item:2138}} + {{item:2138}} + Swiftness mastery x 10 = 90% tenacity {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} ","replies":[{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-09-29T18:36:49.818+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:45}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}}  MOUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HEHEHEHEHEHE HAHAHAHEHEheheehe he cough hehe HAHAHAHAHAH","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2016-09-30T00:26:34.399+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, he'd probably go double morello, double deathcap, and 1 seraph's, 2 luden's, the rest whatever.

If you double certain stat caps, one of them might be attack speed. What happens when every adc is pre-post-reversal kog'maw, only they can move and there's no base damage nerf to 55%? Okay, maybe you don't double attack speed cap, but you still double the uniqueness cap. What happens when each auto can apply borkrazor on-hit twice? What happens when 2 runaan's send out 4 bolts and each bolt applies 2 borks and 2 bloodrazors? What does double guinsoo's do (that's going to give me a headache...) What happens when LW penetration applies multiplicatively twice? What happens when dominick's other passive applies twice? (I don't think cleaver shred cap would increase. You'd just apply 2 stacks per hit instead of one. But still...)\n\nThere's a lot of different ways this could spin depending on the extent to which certain ideas are applied in my original post.
