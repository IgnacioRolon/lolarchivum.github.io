Hopefully I can at least post this thread.\n\nEDIT: Yep, posted. Back to description: I can type things into reply boxes, but when I click \"post\", nothing happens. The post button disappears for a moment, but then the reappears, and nothing is posted. The text box is still there, with everything I typed. Nothing changes. And I can't view my post history either, as stated. Anyone run across this before?\n\nEDIT2: Oh, and also the warning and reply links next to \"My Account\" on the top right have disappeared, too.","replies":[]}
