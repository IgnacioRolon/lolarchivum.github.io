Shyv seems to have a variety of useful build choices, and I'm kind of in that place where I'm torn between too many options, and I MUST HAVE THEM ALL!

Frozen heart, randuin's, they don't quite do it without additional disruptive cc abilities to halt or nerf damage dealing, like malph's or sej's.

You run whatever boots you need, Devourer, Bork, Randuin's , Spirit Visage (or Banshee's if needed) and Warmogs.

I've decided I can get almost all my cdr from scaling runes. Comparing different setups, mr is more effectively gotten from items, and cdr from runes it's seems. I've also considered the fact that maybe I can go without the tiamat, if I go devourer's, with that non-capped damage, buuuut... I've come to the conclusion tonight that cinderhulk is better on shyv. Not because devourer's isn't AMAZING, but because shyv is a strong lane pusher/tower destroyer. Devourer's promotes a lot of afk farming, which, ya know, isn't a bad strategy, but when you have this great champ at deleting towers? Eeeeehhh, I'ma go with hydra/bork, and skip devourer's. Thankfully cinderhulk does resolve some of my tank issues. So I'm thinking... merc's, hydra, bork, cinderhulk, wit's end, randuin's. I'll face it, thornmail is best on mpen champs. I prefer my attack speed marks. Plus I want to make the most of the Oppression mastery (which is why I want frozen mallet.)\n\nSpeaking of ignoring wit's: Yeah I know you can ignore wit's. I ignore it all the time. BUT I DON'T WANNAAAA!

But with shyv, it's a different matter. For about a week now, I've been experimenting with a ton of different builds and setups, trying to get closer to the ideal set of specs:\n\n-The Shyv Synergies (Bork, Wit's End, and Devourer's or Cinderhulk)\n-40% CDR (for q spamming and w speed boosting \n-Thornmail (Necessary... always... no matter what... don't need to see an adc lifesteal up half their health hitting me while I'm cc'd off of them for only 2 seconds. Randuin's just doesn't seem to make the difference by itself. Great active for team support, but somehow doesn't seem half as helpful when chasing.)\n-Tenacity: Merc's, Iron if not Wrath against certain comps, and Tenacious (I've settled on mainly tank masteries. Shyv seems to get a lot more damage from items, and decent tank from masteries. I'll miss the spell/blade weaving synergy, but items just seem to make the most difference.)\n-At least 3k health (kinda doesn't make sense to have thornmail without building at least SOME health)\n-Hydra (tiamat is just too good for burst damage in early ganks, which is handier than chase items like cutlass when you're not a mainly cc ganker in the first place. It's also awesome for counterjungle farming. In addition, having bork with no other ad item really nerfs the lifesteal effectiveness. Hydra may only double your lifesteal on paper, but at least triples the heal in practice. It's almost a better tank sustain item than an actual tank item as a result, unless you get locked down by cc in an end-game fight.)\n-One mr item. Gotta have at least one.\n\nNow if I were playing sej, I could get 5k health, 300 armor, 150 mr, and still cap cdr with scaling runes, masteries, and visage. I'd have everything I need, but that's cause sej builds damage with health, and synergizes better with immolate and thornmail damage due to mpen marks, (sej is kind of broken right now with cinderhulk though, it's not even funny... wait, I play sej, it is funny. Back to old tank jungle item and I'd probably have 3-4k health, but I'd still be happy, and get my tabi back.) \n\nShyv seems impossible for me to be happy with. Not in the sense of winning or losing, I have bad games and I have steamroll games. But in the sense of building. I really want that Shyv synergy combo, bork/wit's end/devourer's or cinderhulk. And I also really can't justify not getting hydra. That leaves me with two item slots. I'm just not going to get the mr, health, boots, cdr, and thornmail (MUST... HAVE... THORNMAIL) I need in two items.\n\nIt's just generally wit's end that gets the shaft, as being the least important. But I love building wit's end on Shyv. If wit's end was meant for anyone, accept a stupid Annie-obsessed puppy, it's Shyv. Any thoughts on how to get it back in my slots without being blown up by an adc after a taric stun late game?","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2015-03-20T06:08:13.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm following a build I saw on Solomid, and so far it's working for me.
