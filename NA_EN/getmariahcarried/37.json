Wanted to clarify what I was saying, but the thread apparently was removed or deleted, so now I can't. Is there a way to message people after the fact?\n\nThe misunderstanding was: I told someone to \"take a bucket of salt with them\" when listening to advice from strangers, referencing the old phrase \"take this advice with a grain of salt\". Apparently... they thought I was accusing them of being salty... uh, nooooot the kind of \"salt\" I was referring to AT ALL, and definitely not the kind of misunderstanding I'd want to leave up in the air.","replies":[]}
