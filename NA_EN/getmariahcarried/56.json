The enemy jungler is near smite range. What is the correct response:\n\n* ~~Hit it faster. The jungler will be awed by your sudden increase in dps, and run away in fear.~~\n* ~~Stop hitting while standing still, &#039;til your almost dead from dragon aggro, and the jungler just kills you.~~\n* ~~Have absolute unwavering confidence that the opposing team is full of nubs, and there&#039;s no possible way they can time a smite on the exact same drag health bar as your jungler.~~\n* ~~Have absolute unwavering confidence that the team with drag aggro has lesser ping on drag health bar, and there&#039;s no possible way they can time a smite on the exact same drag health bar as your jungler.~~\n* ~~Relax and keep on dpsing with the comfort of knowing you can always rage at your jungler if the other team can time a smite on the exact same drag health bar as your jungler.~~\n* ~~Ignore jungler&#039;s caution pings, because he&#039;s clearly mislead in thinking the above five options are crap.~~\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n* STOP TAKING DRAG AGGRO. GET RID OF OTHER JUNGLER.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nYou&#039;re at drag early game, but you&#039;d likely win a skirmish if it broke out. You want to bait drag to get enemies hovering near to engage. Should you:\n\n* ~~Hit drag to ensure you have full aggro from it during the whole fight?~~\n* ~~Hit drag, but try to finish it before dpsing enemy champs that are killing you, because there&#039;s no possible way the enemy jungler has smite up, since he must be a nub?~~\n* ~~Hit drag because it&#039;s clearly the biggest threat on the opposing team?~~\n* ~~Hit drag and then ignore rest of the fight, because there&#039;s no way you&#039;re about to abandon your new farming career as a secondary jungler~~\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n* WAIT AND TRY TO CATCH ONE OUT (note, drag does not count as one)\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nYou&#039;re jungler is chasing off/killing the other jungler and won&#039;t be in range to smite drag. Neither will the enemy jungler as a result, but other enemies are hovering near. What is the correct response?\n\n* ~~Assume enemies are nubs and ya know what? I&#039;m not even gonna finish writing this one. You know it&#039;s dumb.~~\n* ~~Renew your blame insurance, etc. etc.~~\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n* PAY ATTENTION\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\nYou&#039;re jungler has devourer&#039;s, you are taking drag while several enemy threats are neutralized. It&#039;s near gone, he&#039;s on his way, and it&#039;s safe for the 1.5 seconds it will take before he hits it once. How do you proceed?\n\n* ~~Take it anyway &#039;cause you think devourer&#039;s is useless except when you&#039;re raging at enemy jungler&#039;s for devourer&#039;s dps.~~\n* ~~Take it anyway &#039;cause you never know when 3 dead enemies will suddenly use that respawn spell that no longer exists and unleash globals that take longer than 1.5 seconds anyway~~\n* ~~Blame jungler regardless of what he/she was doing because the scenario described in the last question is preposterous, even if it does, in fact, occur, ALL THE TIME.~~\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n* REVEL IN THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR JUNGLER WILL BE ONE-MINUTE CLOSER TO PWN-MODE AS YOU STOP ATTACKING FOR TWO WHOLE SECOND.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\nRanged enemies are behind drag pit as you start taking it. Should you:\n\n* ~~Back up a little, but then go back to hitting before you&#039;ve actually pulled out, because reasons.~~\n* ~~Back up enough, but then walk back in, because somebody else didn&#039;t time their backing up exactly at the same time as your&#039;s~~\n* ~~Backup and then keep walking away and don&#039;t come back, because you don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on.~~\n* ~~Tunnel vision drag and ignore pings and explicit requests in chat to pull drag out, because you&#039;re too busy not pulling drag out.~~\n* ~~Not back up, and ignore the fact that you&#039;re jungler is sitting way in the back, waiting to see if you&#039;ll back up already.~~\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n* PAY ATTENTION!!!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nYou're jungler, and you recognize your team would utterly fail the above questions. Should you:\n\n* ~~Try to correct them, knowing they figure that, whatever the heck you're saying, it's the jungler's fault.~~\n* ~~Try to correct them, knowing they assume anyone correcting them is nub, since all other players are. Especially that opposing team that totally can't time first drag, fo' sho'.~~\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} \n* Say nothing, and recognize that, a League player's beliefs are to them what these skittles are to this cat:\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/xTb1S5v8dtEOD2GuWc/giphy.gif\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Deadly Mittens","date":"2016-04-17T04:59:14.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support player, it breaks my heart when we kill the enemy bot lane, and our jungler is bot side, and they **don't** want dragon.","replies":[]}]}
