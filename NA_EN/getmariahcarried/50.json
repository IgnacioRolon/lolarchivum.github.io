Stacks up to 5 times. Stack-timer refreshes with each hit.**\n\nMY REASONING:\n\n**Why Change Thornmail at All?**\n\nMy guess: Rito wants thornmail to only work on tanks. In the past, thornmail could help ANYONE if things got out of hand botlane. When mpen annie dueling an adc returns a thousand thornmail damage, something's wrong.\n\n**The Problem With the Current Respec**\n\nThornmail is not UBER nerfed from Rito's change, but it IS definitely nerfed:\nBEFORE: returning a 1k crit from an adc = 300 damage\nAFTER: returning a 1k crit = 160 + ~60 even with 300 total armor = much less for every freakin&#039; tank except MAYBE rammus at 500 armor, who... wait no it&#039;s still less.\n\n**The Dilemma**\n\nIf you re-up damage-taken scalings, you risk it being hax on squishies/fighters again.\nIf you buff bonus-armor scalings, that, counter-intuitively, causes the SAME PROBLEM when thornmail BY ITSELF gives 100 armor. A blue thornmail ezreal has nearly 200 bonus armor.\n\n**How To Rework Without Breaking It All Over Again**\n\n_Step 1: Enforce defense requirements MORE:_ Removing armor but upping bonus-armor scalings means thornmail requires MORE tank items bought to be effective, but still does MORE damage on tanks than in the current post-Rito-rework state.\n\n_Step 2: Synergize with tank BEHAVIORS:_ A stacking defense shred not only synergizes with tank offense items, like sunfire and wit&#039;s end, but also with tank PLAYSTYLES. Squishies aren't gonna soak a half a dozen hits to build stacks. \n\n**To Summarize Changes And Why**\n\n* **Boost armor scalings more**, to keep the tank respec but avoid a nerf.\n* **Massively lower armor provided**, to ensure additional armor-building is still required.\n* **Replace armor with other stats**, otherwise, the item is crap without 100 armor.\n* **Add shred passive**, to emphasize SUSTAINED tanking, and tank-offense.\n\nPost your thoughts! I promise not to cry...","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-04T16:54:27.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upon a day's reflection (i.e. I hit the sack, and came back, without intentionally rhyming DANGIT) I feel like a massive armor replacement really does cramp thornmail's style. At the same time, a defense shred is probably all that's needed to compensate for the damage nerf. So here's a simpler alternative:\n\nSTATS:\n\n* 100 armor\n* Passive: Return 15% of auto damage take before mitigation + 25% bonus armor\n* **Passive: Upon being autoattacked, reduce opponent's magic resistance by 4 for 3 seconds. Stacks up to 5 times. Stack-timer refreshes with each hit.**\n\nWhich do you think is best? I really think a simple slight rebuff to the damage, like some people are suggesting, is a mistake if Riot is going for tank synergies (which, upon reading the patch notes, is all they care about.) There are some cooler changes you can make to thornmail along the same line as tank synergy to help rebuff it.","replies":[]}]}
