I understand that some champs are more powerful than others. But right now, it is all about who gets the best champion. Veigar is just about an insta-win. If your team had subpar URF champs, you are nearly guaranteed to lose the game.\n\nWIth a banphase, you can still make it random, while being able to have a 0% possibility of 6 champs that people don't like. That would go a long way into improving the state of the mode and maybe it can stick around longer.\n\nAlso, you did nothing in the way of explain why it doesn't already exist.\n\n Probably because there is NO reason for it to not exist.\n\nLook i realize that there are more than 6 OP champs, even 10.\n\nBut not being able to have to face a Veigar is liberating as fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"SzGamer227","date":"2017-03-07T18:39:51.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are too many broken champs to cover with 6 bans, which is something I hated about picks URF.

It's a great thing not having to see Veigar in every URF game but then still have the possibility of paying him. Same with champs like Garen; would URF really be URF if you didn't have someone permaspinning out of bushes shouting \"BREAK THEIR RANKS\" as they faceroll someone who completely underestimated their damage?\n\nURF just wouldn't be URF without the stupid-powerful-fun champions that used to dominate the picks URF scene, but at the same time it's great to have so many more champions be viable in URF because those stupid-powerful-fun champs don't appear in every game. You might find that one particular champion is really fun that you never would have considered playing before, or find champions that counter the stupid-powerful-fun champs in ways you didn't expect. (URF AP Tank Soraka actually stands a chance against URF Master Yi and if that isn't beautiful nothing is.)","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2017-03-07T22:23:47.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SzGamer227,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gFE436cq,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-07T19:04:30.455+0000)\n>\n> ...would URF really be URF if you didn&#x27;t have someone permaspinning out of bushes shouting &quot;BREAK THEIR RANKS&quot; as they faceroll someone who completely underestimated their damage?\n\nAhem, to quote me, from another thread:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=GetMariahCarried,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=Wa1LOA4q,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-03-07T14:39:56.422+0000)\n>\n> http://i.imgur.com/gjIJVFt.gif?noredirect\n> ^ My team in URF when we sieged a tower for 20 seconds... ... and then Meatgrinder Garen appeared behind us at the edge of my screen.\n> \n> {{champion:86}} : http://i.imgur.com/siqIdkz.jpg[\\img]\n> \n> Me: &quot;wha- no- NO- NNOOOOAAAAAAHHhuuugggghhhh... ugh... well... good run everybody... nice knowing you all...&quot;","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dabrick01","date":"2017-03-07T19:09:10.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ButIdonwanna","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2017-03-07T22:21:02.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.
