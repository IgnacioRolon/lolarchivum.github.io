Example:\r\n\r\n* If you have a stun, the stun is replaced with 20-200 damage, based on champion level\r\n* If you have a silence, it&#039;s replaced with 15-150 damage, based on champion level\r\n* If you have 35% tenacity, it&#039;s replaced with 15% resistance to all damage\r\n* If you have cc immunity, it&#039;s replaced with 35% damage resistance\r\n* If you have a cc breaker, it&#039;s replaced with a heal of some amount\r\n* etc. etc.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know how all the numbers would work out (or should) what&#039;s more important is: why do I propose this sort of game type? As the thread title suggest, it&#039;s a chance to turn every fight into un-mitigated fest of punching each other to death, instead of punching through crowd control. Is that brainless? MAYBE. Do I care? NO.","replies":[]}
