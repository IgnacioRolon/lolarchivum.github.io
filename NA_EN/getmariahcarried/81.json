Between how frequently they can apply on-hit effects and their focus on sustained damage over burst, Fervor of Battle is generally the more efficient option.","replies":[{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-12-31T02:14:41.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fervor is also pretty amazing on Kalista.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-12-31T19:13:43.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or basically anyone who focuses on on-hit effects (kog).","replies":[{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-12-31T19:33:47.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, it's not affected by Kalistas passive or Kog's W damage reduction to champions, it's way better for sustained damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Changsty","date":"2015-12-31T02:56:26.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No it isn't. On hit champions aren't likely to build AD/AP, meaning at best a Thunderlord proc would be doing about 220 damage lategame. From 0 stacks, it takes Shyvanna 4 autos for Fervor to outdamage Thunderlord. At max stacks it takes one Q empowered auto to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-12-31T19:05:40.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention you'll continue to do that amount of the damage for the remainder of the fight, and how quickly she maxes stacks from ult-diving, aoe's, and multi-target Q's, and sated. She's pretty much capped almost instantly at the start of a fight.\n\nPeople can't seem to understand that doing 150 damage on average per auto (when you take into account sated on every other and Q every third or fourth) at 1.5 attack speed far outweighs any advantage of a single thunderlord's proc that goes on cooldown for 20 seconds.\n\nIf shyv is in any way more powerful maxing the cunning route, it's because hybrid flat pen is far superior on her against squishier champs, not because of thunderlord's... hence the thread title.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-12-31T19:00:43.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thunderlord's is not better on EVERYONE, and a shyv that can proc about 200 damager per second on fervor for the entirety of a fight is clearly better than one that procs that amount once at the beginning.","replies":[]}]}]}
