These results reflect my own experience. I must have had 3 Darius games yesterday, followed by a Darius vs Darius game, followed by another Darius game. Of the games in my current match history, two thirds of them are declared-broken champs I see constantly. Look, I don&#039;t mind if a large portion of players want to spam the same champs every game. Just as long as I don&#039;t ALSO have to spam the same champs, because I&#039;m stuck with spammers on my team every game due to matchmaking's total randomness.\n\nIf 6 people in a game of 10 all want to play an overused \"broken\" OfA champ, but 3 of them are on one team, and 3 are on the other, should the remaining 4 players really have to play their billionth game of DarDar dunking, when all you need to do is put 5 spammers on one team, and the 4 players who want some breathing room on the other team? Yes, one player may not get what they want, but that&#039;s better than FOUR players not getting what they want on a repeat basis. We really need a queue where you specify your champ preferences or champ category preferences for matching.\n\n#\\#OfA-Teambuilder\n\n**P.S.** I put \"broken\" in quotation, because there's really no correlation between popularity and winrate with these champs. Yes, Darius is up there at 70%, but some champs with winrates just as high have near-zero popularity (Jax, Nocturne, Nasus, Galio, all champs who I haven't had a chance to try out or even SEE on OfA yet after a ton of games). So please don't make dumb comments such as \"who wants to play a crap champ and get owned by heimer every game?\" My first OfA game this year, my team demolished Darius as Soraka, a champ with both a crap popularity AND win rate. Next game as soraka, nobody seemed to understand the pair-heal synergy and they just kept conserving their health in lane at full mana (facepalm).\n\nEven some high-popularity champs fail hard. But even if it's a low-pop champ failing, it's generally due to people having a lack of familiarity with the champ, or heck, even trying to play the champ effectively in OfA teambuild (I get matched with a lot of people who don't really try with a champ that they don't really like, and spend half the game whining about the pick). Which is why I'd like to be matched with the small minority that a) WANTS to play a low-pop champ and b) ergo, likely knows how to play the champ, or will at least try to make something of the champs self-synergies. If OfA had a Teambuilder, I bet you'd see the winrates flip on their heads. At which point, heck, even the same-pick-spammers would probably add a little variety to their preferences, and this gamemode would become a lot cooler.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilScotsman1974","date":"2015-10-22T19:50:06.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so i have played over 40 matches since it started and never one time had a mirror match up.\n\nOf the top 6 picks\n\nHad Kindred 2 times played once faced once and well kindred being the top pick should have been expected.  Kindred was due to be released in the previous patch so people would have been able to play the champ and then own at the cheaper price before the game mode and probably right before the free week.  unfortunately Kindred got released a patch later and right in time for This game mode so people did not have to pay 7800 to own the champ and also not have to wait till week 3 (free rotation week) to play kindred.\n\nYasuo i think 3 times played 1 time faced twice but thats it i think won every time, the first time we had a dc and still won but yeah it was Annie who we had and destroyed yas.\n\nTahm, played 1 faced 1 lost both times, first time i faced was ojn first day and played him a few days later, wasnt so fun and every other time he may have come up in champ select it has ended with someone dodging.\n\nLux i have faced 2 once as zil and once as Morg, The Zilean game lasted 95 mins it was horrible by the end.\n\nDarius has only came round a couple of times played 1 time faced one time, kicked his butt with brand then destroyed as him.  Problem is he gets banned most times.\n\nDonger has only came around one time and had fun playing him vs Karma but like Darius he seems to get banned alot.\n\nSo for the most part there have been lots of different champs and different match ups am starting to get a few more of the same champs coming up on both sides but have had a good mix of champs so far, probably over half of them and i will also say that maybe only 1/4 of the games have been with 3 man groups or more but even then we dont always agree who to play, we were going to go with someone till one of the randoms picked poppy and we all just kinda said oh that looks like fun so went for it and had a blast playing ping pong late game, stopping trist's.\n\nI know because i have read many threads from people complaining about getting the same champs over and over but i am lucky i guess in that regard, i dont dodge and take who i get no matter.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-22T23:40:44.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding Kindred: Even if you take him out of the picture, it's 38% of all champ picks belong to the other top 5, and if you take him entirely out of the distribution, it's 41% of the remaining picks belonging to the remaining top 5. If you add in Blitz as your new 6th member, it's 48% of remaining picks belonging to the top 6. So basically, without Kindred, it's the exact same picture, about 50% of all non-Kindred picks belong to the top 6 non-Kindred champs.\n\nI too thought, \"well kindred is a new champ\", and within 5 seconds realized, \"nope, still BS even barring him\".\n\nGlad you've had better luck. But imagine what would happen if these champs WEREN'T banned, even with your luck. Then imagine what would happen in the average case. Aka mine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"daemanic","date":"2015-10-21T22:01:04.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL hiem has the highest BTW out of the 45 games ive played 27 of them have been 10X hiemer i havent seen dar or wu since my first game CRY SOME MORE","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-21T22:21:39.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimer's the 6th highest pick, and you just told me you played him over 50% of the time.
