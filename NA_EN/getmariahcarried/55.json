Please actually READ the post before explaining how to play the CURRENT doom bots. Don't jungle. Get smite. Play ranged. I know that. Everyone knows that. That's irrelevant. I'm suggesting a CHANGE to doom bots.\n\nCurrently, there&#039;s not enough reason to jungle in Doom Bots, but more adjustments to the Doom Jungle could actually make quite a few champions, particularly junglers, that are irrelevant in this game mode useful. A lot of champions, especially melees, have no place in Doom-Bot lanes right now, and that limits the flexibility of this game mode WAY too much. There must be about 20 ranged champions that are basically the bread and butter of player picks for this game mode, and everything else falls by the wayside. Here&#039;s one thought as to what Riot could do to make jungles more amusing, terrifying, useful, and possibly imperative at the same time.\n\n**To each jungle buff, add an extreme boost to the buff given, but also an associated debuff to piss you off. **\n\nA few possibilities:\n\n* _Krugs_: Add an on-hit stun to champions, but also make every fifth attack from jungle mobs taken by the player stun the player. Stuff like this could make ganks more meaningful.\n* _Wolves_: Add a short-term cloak to all allies, but ryze-tele a doombot from a lane to the jungler, perma-aggro it to the jungler, and give it a move speed buff until it die. Also, aggro your own base defenses to you until you&#039;re dead (no you can&#039;t go to platform or towers or minions. They will kill you.) This could help ease up lane pressure while putting a jungler on a massive dash through the map to safety.\n* _Dragon_: Give all allies the drag cc-immunity for a couple minutes... in the sense that any cc cast on them is transmitted to you instead, no matter where you are on the map.\n\nNote, these buffs/debuffs would only apply if acquired before the associated mob is aggroed to lane. Let me know what other ideas you guys have.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-10-23T05:10:08.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, your idea is going to be extremely irrelevant because monster buffs are being removed in preseason.

The fact that people have found comps to win even at level 100 is probably counter to their expectations, rather than \"heh I wonder if they'll figure out these comp strats\" or whatever. Trying to make it balanced so most reasonable comps are viable would hinder their scripting dooom fun too if balance was a concern, and tbh I think they wouldve been fine with it even if no one could actually beat the higher levels with *any* comp.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2016-10-23T12:51:47.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They already suggested putting it into featured game mode rotation, and they've made patches to other featured game modes in rotation.
