{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-16T20:05:05.095+0000","title":"One for All Teambuilder with Tweaks","subforum":"Maps & Modes","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"**TLDR VERSION**: Just read the revised tweaks (first bullet-point list, not second).\n\n** Revised, SIMPLER Tweaks **:\n\n* Players can pick UP TO 3 champs they want to queue for, in order of preference, with an additional option to be matched with a random champ if no other options work for keeping the queue time short.\n* Players can pick UP TO 3 ENEMY champ to fight against, and also an option, again, to pick a random one.\n* As with originally posted tweaks, combine with regular queue.\n\nThis handles all the dead-queue problems tackled in the original tweak set, but much more simply. You don't have to give players stats on who's queueing for what.\n\n** Alternative, Originally Posted Tweaks **\n\n* Give players an option to choose an ENEMY champion as well. Maybe you just have to see Tahm vs. Tahm again, etc. This should be optional though, along with selecting a champion to play. You can pick a champion, or an enemy, or both, or queue random for both if you&#039;re feeling lucky.\n* Give players notification of who is queueing for what champion and what enemy champion. You don&#039;t want to wait forever in an empty queue. With a hundred champs, it could take a while.\n* Give players an option to declare what champion they want to play NEXT game and see, for each champion, how many players will try to queue for that champion in their next game.\n* Combine Teambuilder queue with regular queue. It shouldn't be hard to match a bunch of people who blindpicked in regular queue with a bunch of people who picked  {{champion:119}} in teambuild.\n\n**To explain the third tweak:** Let&#039;s say you see an empty {{champion:119}} queue, but you want to play  {{champion:119}}, but you don&#039;t want to wait around for the queue to fill. Maybe a LOT of players want to play  {{champion:119}}, but they aren&#039;t queueing for  {{champion:119}} either, for the same reason. That&#039;s why the queue never gets off the ground. You can go ahead and start a game with another champ, but select  {{champion:119}} as who you want to play for next game. Now, other players can SEE how many players want to play {{champion:119}} in the near future and know what the odds are for the {{champion:119}} queue to fill up if they start to join it.\n\n**Addendum to tweak:** Make tweak 1 affect tweak 3. i.e. if there are 5 players queued random, who have listed  {{champion:119}} as who they want to play next game, match them and give them  {{champion:119}}.\n\nAnd if you&#039;re wondering if all these elaborate explanations were just an excuse to post  {{champion:119}} over and over again, that&#039;s not even in question.\n\nPOST YOUR VEHEMENT OBJECTIONS HERE.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-18T17:00:32.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh, I'll save that thought for another thread I was considering.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2015-10-18T03:03:54.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One for All should be a Draft Mode where everyone gets to pick and counter pick the other team.
