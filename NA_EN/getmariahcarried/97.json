It can be any number. Doesn&#039;t matter. You get matched with players that have overlapping pools of champions they are willing to play, and then League allows players to only vote for champions common to all 5 pools.\r\n\r\nI mainly play featured game modes to try knew things, not play Yorick the bazillionth time. Riot wants to whine about certain champs being spammed in URF? At least there I&#039;m guaranteed my pick! What are they doing about OfA?\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care if I have to wait longer in queue to get a champion. I&#039;d probably queue for any of a hundred champions, so for me, the extended queue wouldn&#039;t be that much longer anyway. Just as long as I don&#039;t have to play the other 20 again that everyone gravitates towards to no end.","replies":[]}
