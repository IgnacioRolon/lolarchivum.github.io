Explain these numbers...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This may go unnoticed on most normal Nasus builds, but I&#039;ve noticed some funny things whenever I experiment with crit on him (it&#039;s S6, don&#039;t even pretend you&#039;re shocked.) A while back, I got a 2400 crit strike in postgame stats on Nasus. I couldn&#039;t figure out how the math worked out, unless my Q stacks were critting as well (or sheen, which would be new.)\n\nI don&#039;t have the build for that game, but take this one for instance:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Wpqhppq.png\n\nThis was my end-game build, and I had about 100 stacks (it&#039;s ARAM, don&#039;t judge me)\n\n{{item:3508}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3009}} \n\nBut my largest crit strike was 1643. Last time I looked at my ad, it was 300ish. So that&#039;s a 750, or round up, 800 crit strike on AD. Add sheen, that&#039;s 1000, and... wat... where the heck does the other 650 come in? I had 100 stacks... what is this...","replies":[{"poster":"360D3GR3SS","date":"2015-12-20T07:52:00.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also your ultimate gives an extremely large amount of ad when damaging enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-12-20T16:35:42.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PSCH, WHAT, NO IT - \\*glances at wiki description\\*\n\nAhem...
