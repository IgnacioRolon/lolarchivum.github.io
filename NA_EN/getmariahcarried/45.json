You&#039;d THINK those would be cool, common picks in OfA, but no. I don&#039;t play either or care for either, but it was fresh, so I was happy.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes of 4 players doubling side lanes nonstop, and no one going mid EVER, LITERALLY, we not surprisingly lost two mid towers, and the solo Morg was chipping away on the third. I jungled. I do what&#039;s fun for me and don&#039;t let players pigeon me into roles. We lost mid. Fine. Everyone did what they want. I don&#039;t care, as long as everyone&#039;s having fun. I was. BUT THEN, I hear out of the dregs of the League community, that familiar mind-numbing regurgitation of total dishonesty, &quot;this is what you guys get for picking a lousy champ&quot;.\n\n... We have 2 ap rek&#039;s and nobody built MR except me. Everyone watched a single Morg chip away at three towers for 15 minutes when we have 5 tele&#039;s and 5 Rek ults. One player rage-quit after not getting a surrender twice, leaving us 4v5. Which obviously means we lost because... because Rek&#039;s just a horrible champ, especially against Morg. Right. Gotcha...\n\nAfter that, two people kept pick-raging for 10 minutes against all sanity, even after one rek quadrakilled 2v4 - because, oh I don&#039;t know, maybe this massive derp-fail had nothing to do with R-... NOPE, can&#039;t say that, garbage pick is garbage.\n\nThank you toxic rung of the League community for making me wonder why I still have to play with you in order to play this game.\n\nHere&#039;s a hint: You don&#039;t want to play a champ? Dodge. I&#039;d rather go back in queue and get another champ than pretend I&#039;m actually getting to play a round, only to have it snatched from me halfway through. The dodging penalty is shorter then the 20 minutes you plan to troll before spamming surrender - surrenders that nobody who actually plays this for fun votes yes on.\n\nYou think dodging is noobery? Then stop downvoting suggested fixes to this ridiculously awful OfA lottery system that causes easily avoidable tension between teammates regularly. Which is better: Dodging/Fixing OfA matchmaking? Or short-lived rounds degrading into pointlessness after nonstop senseless whining?\n\nHere, I&#039;ll put it to a vote, since you love that:","replies":[]}
