Ranged get trashed easily, but still have a shot of escaping and kiting. Melees basically just have to sit back and decide when to commit suicide to help a teammate survive. That&#039;s boring. Horrifying difficulty is entertaining. But press-any-key-to-lose is not. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s a few rare exceptions. Galio is well suited for Doom Bots, given most doom bots are AP (why don&#039;t more players take advantage of this? 5 banners in the occasional all-AP doom-bot match would be hilarious.) Tryndamere can at least do something for a few seconds while invulnerable. But for the most part, nobody goes into Doom Bots with melee, because they know the outcomes will be predictable.\r\n\r\n**Shredders:** Why are the defense buffs on high level doom bots all primarily health? This makes champions like Kog or Brand WAY more effective than... well... everyone else. Spreading the buffs out over all defenses would give some other champions that generally have non-health defense-busting capabilities some meaningful roles (this would also give a lot of melees a leg up, since its their specialty: Darius, Vi, J4).","replies":[{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2016-10-22T03:37:37.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/wqa0WUI.png","replies":[]}]}
