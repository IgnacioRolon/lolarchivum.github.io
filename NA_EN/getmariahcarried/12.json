Bot lane was a quintessential aspect of the game and the dueling lane was amazingly fun.\nPreviously, snowballing didn't happen if your top lost and your bot lane won; your bot would cover your brief point loss and either force a 2v1 to re-capture the lost bot point (and thus a 3v4 top).  Now, it's whoever just makes the dirtier team fight comp, because the points honestly don't matter.\n\nI was really excited to see my favorite game mode coming back, but one game in and I honestly have no more interest.  The games are absurdly snowbally and have genuinely lost almost all strategy in respects to when to push, defend, etc.\n\nVery disappointed, Rito.  Disappointed for never making ranked Dominion.

It is hard to do that when 3 of your teammates want to defend the crystal from a Garen(the same people who think Garen is a good ban pick). \n\n And it keeps happening. Three more games and I get the team who doesn't know what to do, who to pick and where to go.
