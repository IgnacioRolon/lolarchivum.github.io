It&#039;s a decent thought, until you realize nobody gives a crap about the extra 100 or so dps you&#039;ve added through a few hundred stacks from that stellar &quot;late-game&quot; tactic, when the other team has - uh, what&#039;s it called? Oh right! - LATEGAME CHAMPIONS (you know, the actual ones) that dish out 9 times that amount on every autoattack every half a second.\n\nI&#039;m almost tempted to start dodging every time I see a Nasus player. About 95% of them can&#039;t figure out that the outcome of a game doesn&#039;t revolve around a purple number on an ability tooltip. I can pretty much start placing bets on guaranteed loss the moment one of them brings up something about &quot;lategame&quot;. You mean that stage where your puppy face gets melted before you can get off 2 Q&#039;s? Sure, good luck with that. I&#039;m sure that warrants last-hitting minions 20 feet away from an enemy tower for 3-4 minutes straight through two teamfights mid long past the laning phase, and never ever even touching that objective right in your face (yes, that happened. That almost always happens. Just another day in a game with the doggy.)","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-12-07T23:51:11.448+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Nasus was actually tanky, maybe he'd have a late-game.

Veigar ends up building damage anyway, meaning stacking farm all day isn't a must. Plus, Veigar's damage is more suited to shredding people, not waves","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-12-08T00:13:24.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar's a mega-burster.

If you have around 300-400 stacks, Iceborn Gauntlet and Spirit Visage by 20 minutes into the game, you are a monster during skirmishes and 1v1s.\n\nHonestly, at that point your best bet is often to roam around the map taking towers with your team and fighting for objectives.
