(Note, the every-n'th-cast mechanics are designed to roughly pattern after the different ability cdr's for the different champions.)\n\n* Passives: Just give them both.\n* Q: Regular hecarim helicopter BS, but every third one includes Sej's dash knockup and damage, and then ends with helicopter BS (sort of like Yas's e/q combo).\n* W: Sejuani's W. Every third one also includes Hec's AOE.\n* E: Holds up to one charge of each champion's e, with recharge rate matching each champion's E cdr. On click, casts one of the charges. Cast choice prioritize's sej E if enemies within range are permafrosted.\n* R: Casts Sej's R. At the end of popsicle duration, cast's Hec's R. (Gotta stagger dat cc, homie.) If Sej's R misses, can cast Hec's R any time subsequently, once, until Sej R off CD again.","replies":[]}]}
