People claim the all-ad meta was inspired by Riot breaking ad champs, but let&#039;s be honest, it was mainly a consequence of all the new stuff being ON ad champs. It&#039;s like when a new champ comes out, and you see them in every game for a week. That&#039;s not because the new champ is broken. That&#039;s because it&#039;s new.\n\nHere&#039;s the evolution as I&#039;ve seen it so far:\n\n* First everyone went ad. People raged that Rengar and Yasuo were broken now (rengar/yas good against a team of ad glass cannons? Who woulda thunk!) People (including me... a lot) started complaining that SR was far too short because people ripped through towers, which, duh, when everyone&#039;s an ad glass cannon, happens. Sure, Warlord&#039;s bloodlust is too strong, but that&#039;s mainly a consequence of it being only one of two keystone mastery that doesn&#039;t apply strictly to champs. That&#039;s more of an oversight, and an easy fix. And it&#039;s JUST one keystone mastery.\n* Then people started playing tanks again, and, shocker, it&#039;s a lot easier to play a tank when everyone on the freakin&#039; enemy team has the same damage-type. So what did people complain about next? &quot;waaaaah, tanks are broken! Bork is useless! Rammus is nuts! He&#039;s totally wrecking all my team comps of graves top, yas mid, caitlyn bot, wukong support, and rengar jungle!&quot; Uhhh, right, am I learning something new here?\n* Then in response, people started playing mages again. And (who woulda thunk, again!) tanks could no longer just build the classic thornmail/deadman/tabi/sunfire/titanic/randuin&#039;s armor-dps build of apocalyptic ad crushing. And (shocker again!) tanks have to balance their builds once more. It&#039;s almost like, uh, I don&#039;t know, mixed damage helps counter tanks! WHAT A MARVELOUSLY NOVEL CONCEPT!! (hint, sarcasm)\n* Now, not surprisingly, without a bunch of ad nukers on both teams, and at least a few tanks and mages on each, towers STILL fall a little faster than they used to, but they don&#039;t drop like flies like they were a couple weeks ago.\n\nSo, where are we now? 40 minute SR games that generally consist of a balance of tanks, mages, adc&#039;s, fighters, and that tend to swing back and forth in leads rather than snowball in one direction. Huh, what does that remind me of? Oh right! LEAGUE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME.\n\nI should probably stay out of all these balance quibbles people work themselves up over in League. If you genuinely thought there&#039;s a game-breaking issue, you&#039;d stop playing League. A lot of players get pissy over these problems out of personality faults, not out of genuinely honest assessments of the game&#039;s state (downvote all you want, it&#039;s true.)","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2015-11-22T08:42:24.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">when everyone's an ad glass cannon, happens. \n\nThe thing is, even AP champs or tanks eat towers for breakfast kek.\nI agree with the rest tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-11-22T09:01:37.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its only the few highly specialized armor tanks that are being picked.\n\nrammus, malphite, even taric that are spiking in play/winrate. a natural reaction to marksmen being overtuned to the point its stupid. \n\njust because 2 or 3 hard counters to ad carries are now regularly picked to be able to deal with them, doesnt mean the game is in a balanced state. marksmen need massive nerfs. theyre still dealing twice the damage than anyone else, even when behind compared to their teammates.\n\nthe problem is, that the game has been reduced to a very small champion pool focused around adc and adc hard counters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IimWWPEmdu","date":"2015-11-22T08:20:41.433+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"You're silver.
