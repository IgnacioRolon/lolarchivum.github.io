It was a reminder of everything utterly infuriating about Tahm Kench that I have personally experienced in-game, &quot;wha- WHY ARE YOU PUTTING JINX IN THE MIDDLE O- oh it&#039;s tahm, nvm&quot;. \r\n\r\nAs if Tahm doesn&#039;t already provide enough insult to go along with his injury, KOO put him botlane with Darius for the first 10 minutes. The humanity...\r\n\r\nI generally don&#039;t rage or care about the state of champion balance, but am I the only one who finds Tahm to be total BS? He tanks, deeps, and supports, and in all cases, does so excruciatingly effectively. Literally, it&#039;s excruciating watching him get away with so much crap, all the time, everywhere, across the map, under your turret, in your bases, roaming your jungles, eating your carries, denying your kills, GO AWAY YOU STUPID CATFI... sorry, had a nightmare blackout.","replies":[{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-10-11T00:00:42.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't even escape him if he hits a single Q since it slows like a bitch (around 80%) THAT DOESNT FUCKING DECAY, and it only has like a 4 sec cooldown.\nIt's impossible to get away. He can build full tank and 1v1 anyone with having two health bars.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2015-10-10T23:57:33.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that you can eat CCd targets pisses me off to no end. If tahm were some squishy bastard that drops when you sneezed on him it'd probably be a different story, but 9/10 times that priority target you caught out and deserves to die is getting a free escape.\nWhy Kalista ult and Tahm devour can work on CCd targets is beyond me, they're both already obnoxious to deal with, but there's no way to even play around it.","replies":[]}]}
