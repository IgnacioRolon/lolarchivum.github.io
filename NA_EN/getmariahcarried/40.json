But when a Yi goes devourer&#039;s? It&#039;s like no one ever told them kills give stacks. Scuttle gives 2. Successful gank-stomps botlane give free drag, which equals FIVE... PLUS TWO.\r\n\r\nThe fastest I&#039;ve ever gotten sated was off of high early kda&#039;s. But no, don&#039;t tell Yis that! They might learn how to win. Then we can&#039;t call them totally unskilled nubs anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"HeadHonchkrow","date":"2016-02-05T11:23:43.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bbbbbut mah cs\n(I agree with you)","replies":[]},{"poster":"PiVoRx","date":"2016-02-05T13:14:38.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its not about Yi dont want to gank, its that he sucks at ganking. If his laner dont havy any sort of cc or enemy champion is ungankable theres no point doing that.\nThats why imo Yi needs some sort of a cc,maybe slow on E active, so he can emerge from his dumpster finally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Restless Slumber","date":"2016-02-05T15:15:26.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most Yis I get actually are pressured to gank more than farm and end up never getting sated in a 30 minute game. *reminder* these are gold level players doing this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jbirdsando","date":"2016-02-05T14:43:21.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, a smart Yi realizes that bot lane can be 2 stacks, CAN BE. But you have to realize that he doesn't put them at 2 easy stacks, because he looks at the bot laners as trash. Maybe prove to him you are competent and he will gank, but otherwise I think he'd rather prefer clearing 3-4 camps instead of helping out bot.","replies":[]}]}
