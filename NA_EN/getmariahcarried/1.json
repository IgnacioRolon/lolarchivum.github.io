{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-31T05:26:50.630+0000","title":"A Better Valor Rework (meh, close enough)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Riot has repurposed Valor to a more ubiquitously effective role by replacing his assassination kit with... well, they didn&#039;t replace it. They just deleted it. He is now a transportation device. But a highly spammable one! This would be okay, except the Quinn/Valor mantra is &quot;tag-team&quot; and Quinn cracking the whip on Valor is not a tag-team.\n\nIf you want to make a REAL tag-team, each character must have a unique set of independent actions as before, but Valor can&#039;t have an assassination kit with ranged adc stats, turning him into an assassin that&#039;s more high-risk than actual high-risk assassins. The synergy between ADC and Assassin is so great that you have to nerf the effectiveness of both to the point of making Quinn one of those RPG jack-of-all-trades classes that kind of sucks at everything. That&#039;s what Riot is trying to fix, but that SHOULDN'T MEAN &quot;no more tag-team&quot;.\n\nI propose Riot DOESN'T give Valor a melee-assassin glass cannon kit that&#039;s basically a copy-cat of Quinn&#039;s toolkit, but DOES give Valor a more orthogonal kit that fits his style. What is he now when you&#039;re Quinn? A warder/blinder/damage-buffer. He&#039;s utility. Utility that can&#039;t be eliminated because he&#039;s not a target when you&#039;re playing Quinn (if only I could shoot that dang bird when he CAWS at me with those STUPID TARGET RETICLES!) Sounds a bit like a hard-to-catch support to me. Besides, as I said in another thread, he&#039;s a bird, not a gun/crossbow/cannon-toting serial killer. Why should he be an assassin (besides, isn&#039;t that Nidalee&#039;s shtick? And isn&#039;t Quinn suppose to be unique?)\n\nSo what do I suggest Riot gives Valor that fits his style and preserves tag-team? That is spammable to some degree, so Valor fits an equal role with Quinn, as a tag-team should? That makes Valor useful more generally instead of only when that poor enemy Cait is split-pushing alone? That doesn&#039;t make the toggle ult match other existing toggle-ult purposes? That fits a melee role without a) requiring Quinn to tank-itemize like she&#039;s gnar or something, nerfing her glass cannon nature but b) doesn&#039;t over-steroid a melee fighter from glass cannon items? \n\nIn summary, my suggestion is: a flat scaling Valor support toolkit with little need for or impact from itemization. If you can think of a another support toolkit, BY ALL MEANS, POST. It&#039;s the intention of the following toolkit that I care about the most: VALOR, THE SUPPORT TERROR. Details can be overhauled. And I&#039;d really like to seem some alternative, practical choices if you have any.\n\n* **Passive**: \n * *50% bonus move speed.*\n * *Attack speed and ability-damage are reduced to a third.*\n * *Basic attacks apply Valor marks on-hit. Marks can be consumed by allies while you're Valor.*\n * *Cooldowns for Q and E are 30% less for Valor than for Quinn.*\n\n\n* **Q**: *Attack in an aoe. Enemies hit are blinded and their vision-range is reduced to 200 for 1 second.*\n\n* **W**: *Reconnaissance: Valor breaks cc and, after a 1-second in-place channel, soars above the battlefield for 7 seconds. Can be ended early after 2 seconds. Channel cannot be canceled, but is interrupted by hard cc. Holds 2 charges. Gain one charge every 30 seconds (while Quinn or Valor). Upon returning to the battlefield after another 1-second, in-place channel, Valor has 50% bonus move speed for 0.75 seconds and is untargettable for 0.25 seconds. While above the battlefield, Valor*\n * *is untargettable*\n * *has 800 sight range*\n * *can move over and see over walls*\n * *cannot cast Q or E*\n * *loses untargettability for 0.5 seconds whenever basic attacking*\n * *is visible to all enemy champs (\"It's a bird!\" \"It's a plane!\" \"We're screwed...\")*\n\n\n* **E**: *Valor dashes in a straight line, damaging, interrupting, and slowing all enemies in the path. Q can be cast during the E-dash and does not interrupt the dash.*\n\n* **R-Toggle**: *20/15/10-second cooldown both ways and a 1-second channel time during which you CAN still move, attack, and cast abilities.*\n\n* **Skystrike**: *Does no damage, but arrows hitting the ground act as traps for 5 seconds, applying Valor marks to enemies that walk through them.*\n\nThis positions Valor in a battlefield-scoping role when you&#039;re roam-spamming, with a teamfight-role of being a hard-to-catch bird, undermining enemy actions as a battle starts, assisting allies with damage output, and then positioning Quinn to bring in some high burst when you switch back.\n\nSome specific points to my thinking:\n\n* Reduced damage/attack speed: Valor is a support bird, not a homicidal psychopath.\n* Controlled valor-marking. Marks consumed by alliies: support steroid.\n* Additional vision-reduction added to blinding: support steroid.\n* W is most of the juke stats, but has various counter-mechanics to keep it subdued (visibility to enemies, channel times to react to upon entering and leaving reconnaissance, etc.). It basically turns you into a fast-moving, player-controlled scrying orb (support steroid). I added the additional 0.25 second untargettability so there would be time to cast E or Q to juke upon landing (No enemies going \"Valor's landing here guys, gather around for dinner.\")\n* E is now a multi-target skillshot that passes THROUGH enemies. Think utility-oriented, skillshot fizz jousting. EQ combo for awesome enemy dive-through Q-bombing skillz. Again, support steroid and juking. \n* R toggle cooldown BOTH WAYS: Use and time Valor and Quinn wisely.\n\nLet me know your thoughts and any counter-suggestions.","replies":[{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2015-11-01T18:54:54.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The strange thing about quin right now is how her ult works. Why not remove the secondary effect of her ult but remove the windup so her R is a pure utility ability.  So:\n\n* W: Skystrike  (currently the secondary effect of her ult)\n\nThan when in valor form (you can't go in combat in this form):\n\n* Q: Some kind of movement boost (no damage)\n* W: Heightened Senses\n* E: An dash (no damage)\n\nThis means she an only use Heightened Senses while in her ult form.

None of these, or any of the OTHER sources of invulnerability/vision in this game mode, or the one I'M suggesting, are ACTUAL sources of \"infinite ANYTHING\" and for most of them, the thing that makes them balanced is JUST a matter of numbers and counter-mechanics. \n\nIf you can't actually quantify the amount that's given (in this case, up to 10 seconds every 60 seconds tops, with fully disabled abilities, while granting vision to enemies across the map on you no matter where you are) and provide a counter-suggestion on numbers, counter-mechanics, or mechanic-debuffing, you're not contributing to the discussion.\n\n* How about decreasing the duration and increase the toggle-charge time. Only 5 seconds tops every 75 seconds? (It wasn't \"INFINITE\" before, but since you bring up invulnerability and vision range, let's talk about how much each really is, and how much they could be.)\n* How about removing all movespeed buffs in recon mode?\n* How about reducing the vision range from 800 to 600?\n* How about removing vision in bushes (except those directly below), but keeping vision over walls?\n* How about reducing the untargettable state to only abilities and auto-attacks cast below 300 range (maybe Darius can't get to that blasted bird, but Caitlyn can! ... as long as it's not directly above, with the sun in her eyes.)\n* Maybe add a channel time to the cc clear, or only clear certain types of cc's.\n* Maybe disable marking during it as well.\n* Maybe keep marking, but remove untargettability while marking for 1 second.\n* Maybe do a TON OF THE ABOVE\n* Etc.

Or maybe you added it after my comment. Even still, it operates on charges, so you could very well be invulnerable for a full minute.\n\nYeah, but Panth effectively can't help his team in any way as he prepares his ult. Karthus passive lasts 7 seconds, he can't move or auto or use actives, and he has to die to get it. Ashe's vision is linear, only lasts a second or two, and actually has like an 80-sec recharge time. I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to prove when you say summoner platforms provide invulnerability (they actually dont) or that Zhonyas provides infinite invulnerrability- when it lasts 2.5 seconds? Were you high when you typed that first paragraph.....?\n\nFirst off, the idea in theory is still insane. You would never be able to catch her.   For one, she gets 50% bonus move speed. Your wording is unclear, this either means she has 600+ movespeed AT LEVEL ONE or like 700-800 at level 12. Secondly, you're all about \"massive jukes and tanking\" with her two forms, when really, it just basically means that any time she gets caught out she just becomes untargetable for 10 seconds with no counterplay and move wherever she pleases. I don't want to be rude but if you honestly think that would ever be balanced and/or be in the game then you are stupid. 0lus it CLEARS ALL CC? This further reinforces the fact that she would never die unless she never leveled the ability or was blind. How can you possibly defend that ability?\n\nP.S. Don't be a smartass of your answer isn't even coherent.\n\nP.P.S. This isn't some official red thread and you're some mod who fosters debate and whatnot.

Toggle charge consumption is both ways. And it's technically not even 30 seconds, with vulnerability in intermediate intervals. Even so, I still suggested about a half a dozen different ways to nerf that, and none of those nerfs are that complicated.\n\n\"Yeah, but Panth effectively can't help his team in any way as he prepares his ult.\"\n\nAnd Valor can't use Q or E. I even suggested removing the proc passive, which basically removes everything except vision and movement, which I also suggested nerfing. \n\n\"Karthus passive lasts 7 seconds, he can't move or auto or use actives, and he has to die to get it.\"\n\nBut he gets to use abilities and my valor rework WOULDN'T?!

What are you arguing about here? The semantics of: \"Massive steroided Mundo health regen + insta-deletion for any enemy that tries to get to you on the platform\"... vs... \"invulnerability\". ... Really? You're TRYING to find a reason to argue when there isn't any, and therefore I know reading any more of your comments will be a waste of time after responding to this one. But for the sake of other people who shouldn't be misinformed by you regarding my Quinn suggestions if they read this at all, I'll finish my thoughts this once.\n\n\"or that Zhonyas provides infinite invulnerability- when it lasts 2.5 seconds?\"\n\nExactly, numbers. Way to go.\n\n\"Were you high when you typed that first paragraph.....?\"\n\nLike I said a few sentences ago: \"don't feed the troll\" alarm bells are going off. But for other people's sake...\n\n\"You would never be able to catch her. For one, she gets 50% bonus move speed. Your wording is unclear, this either means she has 600+ movespeed AT LEVEL ONE or like 700-800 at level 12.\"\n\nIt's not unclear. You don't know stat math, or you're pulling numbers out of your ass just to incite arg-... oh right, alarm bells, forgot...\n\nI'll do the numbers for everyone, although I'm pretty sure everybody else knows how percent bonuses work. 50% bonus move speed = 0.5*335 base move speed = 167.5 move speed buff, which is currently 167.5 LESS than what Valor has now (in combat it slows down over time though) and also significantly less than what's on the PBE (130%). And I NEVER gave a level-scaling for anyone who's wondering.\n\nOn PBE you instantly return to Quinn if attacked. Here it would be way harder to catch you, partly on purpose (it's not like you're performing a glass-cannon carry role during the duration) but I still suggested, again, about a half a dozen nerfs to handle catchability. Additionally, other CURRENT passive stats that would act as counter-mechanics are open to possibility (goes without saying, but technically, all of this should go without saying. Some people refuse to think, so I'll do it for you this one time).\n\n\"really, it just basically means that any time she gets caught out she just becomes untargetable for 10 seconds with no counterplay and move wherever she pleases.\"\n\nOnly as Valor, if you ever actually had to do Quinn glass cannon duty, you'd find it very hard, when in trouble, to channel your ult just to then hit recon mode and juke out. And again. Read. Bullets.\n\n\"I don't want to be rude\"\n\nYou've made the OPPOSITE abundantly clear from your first post onwards.\n\n\" if you honestly think that would ever be balanced...\"\n\nUh, i'll finish that sentence: then, I actually did the numbers and I at least read MY OWN bullets.\n\n\"Plus it CLEARS ALL CC?\"\n\nBullets.\n\n\"This further reinforces the fact that she would never die\"\n\nJust like GP and Fizz... oh wait, they still die. Yes, it's a cc-break AND an untargettable state. But GP and Fizz can cast once every 14 seconds and 8 seconds, respectively. Valor's would be every one minute, possibly stacking up to 3 in a row once every 3 minutes (if you saved them the rest of the time) with at least 4 seconds in between each based on toggle cooldown which can be changed, and toggle-charge cap, which can also be nerfed. Again: PLETHORA of ideas here for anyone who ACTUALLY wants to discuss this topic. You clearly don't.\n\n\"How can you possibly defend that ability?\"\n\nBullets.\n\n\"Don't be a smartass of your answer isn't even coherent.\"\n\nI'm not, and it wasn't. Facts are apparently incoherent to you. There's nothing I can do about that.\n\n\"You're lucky I even commented at all\"\n\nYes I love cleaning up other people's messes.\n\nYa know, I remember a massive outcry at the Aatrox release because players somehow thought his W as described in the spotlight would provide INFINITE SUSTAIN (yes I do believe they used those words) THE WORLD HAD NEVER SEEN. I just rolled my eyes, and was relieved when they finally shut up after he got trashed in half of matches the first few weeks of release, which I wasn't surprised at all by.

It will be a short channel and no damage, got it. Also He should screech, enemies should also hear him coming.\nIm still urging a further nerf of duration down to 5.\n\nand I know know and acknowleged that W is no longer a Toggle, it is in short:\nA 1 sec channeled ability that allows him to fly above walls untargetable with a reduced sight radius for a short duration. And on second cast or when the duration ends there is another channel before he comes back down.\n\nQuestion when you say Channel cannot be canceled, you mean by Valor him self. Ex - Recasting W will start the channel but once started entering another move command will not stop the channel correct? I guess I misunderstood that before, I thought that you meant that an enemy could not stop the channel, my bad.\n\n\"Channel cannot be canceled, but is interrupted by hard cc\"\nyou mean on the way down right? But isnt he already untargetable? no one can hit him until the channel is over for him to come down anyways.\n\n\"Can be ended early after 2 seconds.\" could change this to a Static CD.\n\nStill don't think that he needs to be untargetable when switching between Recon and regular flight. He already is moving faster than any other champion, especial during the dive. Also an enemy champion that is trying to hit him will not know exactly where he will land, even if they are trying to get right under him.

After a 1-second channel, and flies above the battlefield over walls for 5 seconds reducing his sight radius to 800 units, able to see over walls. Valor becomes untargettable, visible to all enemy champs and cannot cast Q or E. He loses untargettability for 2 sec whenever AA'ing. \n2nd Cast: after a 1 sec channel Valor screeches and returns to the battlefield gaining 75% bonus move speed for 0.75 seconds.\n\n\nadd ignores unit collision to E, you want him to fly through, or over enemies right? But make sure that everyone knows that he cannot go over walls with this, thats for Recon.\n\nstarting to get the gist of this. I understand now it really is a support kit, kinda like a Bard or Zilean kit where only one spell does damage and the rest provides some kind of utility. Ok the next thing that needs to be done is developing Valor's  support focus. From what I can see it appears that Valor will be helping to ward and gain vision of the map and location of enemies. I think that is super cool. Can he mark neutral targets too?\nThis is seen in the Marks of the passive, if he marks and enemy that will show them to them to his team. Also of course W. Q is nice because it plays the opposite side for enemies by reducing sight. \nAnd I have an idea for E: allies passed during the dash gain a slight MS buff for 5 sec if they follow Valor.\nThis will help allies lagging behind catch up to the enemy that Valor has seen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-11-01T19:17:07.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I think he should still see into a bush that he's directly ABOVE (He's technically IN the bush under those circumstances, based on 2d map coordinates)\"\nit makes since, but it could also count as a nice disadvantage to not have that, that would be a reason for him to come down.

So I'm gonna change it to two charges max on W, one charge every 30 seconds.\n\nI thought you were getting rid of the Charges part? Well I guess that was if it was a toggle right? Now its not so you brought the charges back huh? Heres and idea to compromise: First a mini CD between cast, second the Second charge of the ability should last for a much shorter duration.\n\n\n\nRemove \"in-place\" on W's channel, all channels are normally scripted to stop the player and force them to remain still and unable to cast other abilities, unless specifically coded to allow for one of those things. \nRemove \" but is interrupted by hard cc\" for same reason as above.\n\n\"Channel cannot be canceled\" This is the whole point of a channel, it allows for counterplay, its more than just a delayed cast, it allows an enemy to stop an action that they would not want. I really think that you should let the channel be canceled, first because its pretty short so its not bad, but also unlike some other abilities that make the champion untargetable, its way more balanced, especially since his unhittablity is the longest in the game.\n\nive got more suggestions..., but fo now\n\nW: Reconnaissance: Valor breaks soft cc, after a 1-sec channel, soars above the battlefield for 7 seconds. Can be ended early after 2 seconds. Holds 2 charges. 2nd Charge duration of flight is reduced to 2.5 sec. Gain one charge every 30 seconds (while Quinn or Valor). \n\nUpon returning to the battlefield after another 1-second, in-place channel, Valor has 50% bonus move speed for 0.75 seconds and is untargettable for 0.25 seconds. While above the battlefield, Valor\n\nis untargettable\nhas 800 vision range\ncan move over and see over walls\ncannot cast Q or E\nloses untargettability for 0.5 seconds whenever basic attacking\nis visible to all enemy champs (\"It's a bird!\" \"It's a plane!\" \"We're screwed...\")\n\nalso you post is looking MUCH better and clearer now, really gud job there","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-11-01T05:43:05.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything on the Passive appears to be fine except\n\"Autoattacking is replaced with a 2-second-cooldown, enemy-mark ability.

Also may consider increasing toggle from CD  (only when he has switched from Recon to Dive, so the ability to toggle back to Recon takes much longer) due to what comes next...\n\n10 sec untargetablity is pretty OP, but you can't do anything either, so I guess it balances out? Would consider reducing that time in Recon Mode.\n\nAlso get rid of: \"Switching from Dive clears all cc. (juke stat #1)\"\ni think its OP, like a GP orange, except a much lower CD, just soft CC and Airborne is enough, the other hard CC makes sense that you cant use abilities even Recon\n\n\"has vision within 800 range\" I am super happy that you reduced the vision range (officially called Sight radius). I think that it is one of the perfect drawbacks to such a powerful non-ult ability. Of course it \"moves with you\" thats how sight radius works on him before the update. \nWhat do you mean by \"has no duration\" when Recon Mode ends your sight radius would go back to normal\nI DO NOT think that he should be able to see into bushes tho, but keeping the ability to see over a wall within the sight radius would be OK.\n\n\"is visible by all enemy champs\" another great draw back, because even if he could fly away over a wall, he would be so high that they could still see him\n\nstill tho that is a lot of ground covered with that increased MS and the ability to go over walls. I would say that there needs to be a delay in cast time when going from Dive to Recon, so maybe get rid of \"Switching requires zero channel time. (juke stat #2)\"\n\nAlso drastically increased CD when going from Recon to Dive.

I would suggest removing that for balance and counter play reasons (pls dont think im heartless for saying that). The second that Recon mode ends before Valor even visually swoops down he should be target-able, sure he is moving fast but there are people who in this world (our normal world with some slightly above normal people compared to the LoL champions) who can redirect a bullet with a sword, so I think a Falcon diving is not so fast enough that someone who sees it coming couldnt deal some damage to it. \n\nto augment his lack of AA, maybe consider giving Dive mode an initial damage component. such as Dive Mode: Valor selects an area of the ground. After a 2 sec channel Valor swoops down to the battlefield to dealing damage to enemy units in that area and  gaining 50% movespeed for 0.75 sec. Last indefinitely.\n\nFinally pls consider changing Dive mode to Action Mode\n\nAlso you really need to add your notes on each ability either after each ability or at the final end, cause it really clutters things up, most people will want the bare bones first and explanation later, it helps in digesting the information.\n\nFINAL POSSIBLE RESULTS OF  W SUGGESTIONS\n\nW: Heightened Senses - Toggles Valor's Flight Style \nRecon Mode - CD 3 sec: after a 2 sec delay Valor soars above the battlefield able to pass walls for up to 5 seconds. This clears soft CC and Airborne effects to become untargettable but unable to deal damage. He becomes visible to all champions and his sight radius is reduced to 800 units, but he can see over walls. He can still mark targets.\nAction Mode - CD 17 sec: Valor selects an area of the ground. After a 1.5 sec delay Valor swoops down to the battlefield to deal damage in that area and gains 50% MS for 0.75 sec. No Duration.\n\nW Notes: this is where \"tanking\" comes in the form of massive juking; 1.) while in Recon Mode is untargettable, 2.) Switching from Action clears soft cc and Airborne 3.) MS buffs. Basically You're like a fast-moving, player-controlled scrying orb. \"It's a bird!\" \"It's a plane!\" \"We're ****ed...\" Action Mode is basically NORMAL mode, giving you the rest of Valor's kit without the recon passives\n\n\npls tell me if i missed anything","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-01T15:59:32.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm getting rid of the toggle charges.

Soft CC includes Slow, Blinds, Disarms, and Roots, they are specifically coded to allow for abilities to be cast. Any other type of Hard CC has to be dealt with, (due to the games coding rules) and it would be unhealthy for Valor to be able to instantly get rid of them and go into an extended unhittable mode. \n5 sec is already pushing it mate, but with a delayed cast time (channel), and the other disadvantages that you have tacked on, it may start to balance out, but I encourage to to limit CC cleansing to only soft CC.\n\n\"I'm gonna make it a one second channel both ways.\" Thats is nice it allows for counterplay because after the ability is cast Valor cannot immediately go into the air.

It would hit multiple targets now. It's also a skillshot (wasn't before). It also goes through AND PASSED the enemy in question, instead of only right up to them. That was one of the danger points before. Before, E'ing Darius was like flying into the loving arms of a passionate axe murderer. Now, it's like flying PASSED the loving arms of a passionate axe murderer and saying, \"no thanks, I don't like KFC\". Hence why it's more juke-ish than before.\n\n\"And Q is pretty much the same as well correct?\"\n\nBlinds and vision loss are different. Blind = Teemo dart. Vision loss = Nocturne ult. I'm suggesting you add a one-second vision loss to those hit.\n\nI'm basically trying to add to the cc of some of these abililties while dumping the damage. Sorry if the descriptions weren't clear.\n\n\"Or will he do it for a quick sec and continue on?\"\n\nI was thinking he'd continue on. The main dilemma in my mind though is timing. Current dash takes like a quarter second. That would be hard to pick the exact moment to Q. Maybe it's a slower dash? Or maybe if you click Q and E simultaneously, Q goes off at the first moment you're near an enemy during the dash? Or, heck, just leave it difficult? Ali-wq-combo mains incoming.\n\n\"You know what would be cool? When Q is cast during E, he does a barrel roll releasing a small cloud of feathers that slowly drift to the ground and continues on his path. (so then Q becomes like a mini graves smokescreen)\"\n\nI guess that's what you thought I meant earlier on the regular Q description. It actually wasn't, but adding it to E combo's would be nifty. If Valor goes bald though I'm blaming you >:(.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-11-01T05:27:45.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok that makes sense","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2015-11-01T03:48:07.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Q: Now reduces surrounding vision for one second\" so like his thrashing around caused him to lose a few feathers and make a kind of dust feather cloud?
