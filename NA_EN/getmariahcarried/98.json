But still. There&#039;s an issue as almost any adc (even some melee), where attack speed buff abilities (which might as well be permanent in urf) plus any ONE attack speed item can give you pretty much capped attack speed. And yet 3 of the 5 items in SR that give crit give hefty amounts of attack speed. It feels like such a waste, but I still want crit. What am I suppose to do, just buy another infinity edge instead? (I&#039;ve been doing that actually...) Seems like URF needs one of three things:\n\n-New URF crit items that focus on TONS of damage (attack speed is for nubs)\n-Elevated attack speed cap (probably a horrible idea, unless you WANT to see jinx start the apocalypse.)\n-URF crit chance buffs, so you don't need more than maybe two crit items to reach 70% (this feels boring to me, and will nerf yasuo's comparative effectiveness even more.)\n\nAny other ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Conturbatio","date":"2015-04-07T23:01:27.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should add 5% more crit chance to IE in URF only, that might help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cpt Archa","date":"2015-04-07T19:56:08.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build an extra IE and your fine on crit lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-04-06T01:10:55.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but there goes bork, which is still good against certain champs on urf, and a nice lifesteal addition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2015-04-04T19:31:27.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you do?
