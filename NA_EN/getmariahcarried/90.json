You cut the passive in half. SHEESH. Talk about giving Kayle the cold shoulder.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this was extreme? Generally when Rito makes a change, it&#039;s 5% here, 10% there, not &quot;we&#039;re just gonna dunk this item with the power of our unending scorn and nerf it by 50%&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"Francisco Pires","date":"2015-10-04T10:14:44.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know Kayle was very strong with devourer, but I think shyvana, ww, xin zhao, MASTER YI, etc, are the ones who can use it better, it shouldn't be nerfed just for ranged junglers (actually the only one I can think about is kayle, twisted fate and twitch could use devourer, but they are only played in jungle as troll picks in normals.)","replies":[{"poster":"kagepaladin","date":"2015-10-04T12:44:49.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kayle is certainly not a troll pick picture someone with a speed up/slow a heal a ranged AOE and an invincible ult for the allied laner to tower dive and make it out alive with little to no consequence. it just happened to be  a side effect that kayle happened to use devourer.","replies":[{"poster":"Francisco Pires","date":"2015-10-04T12:48:30.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kagepaladin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EF9ux4qR,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-10-04T12:44:49.806+0000)\n>\n> kayle is certainly not a troll pick picture someone with a speed up/slow a heal a ranged AOE and an invincible ult for the allied laner to tower dive and make it out alive with little to no consequence. it just happened to be  a side effect that kayle happened to use devourer.\n\nI'm saying the only ranged jungler i can think about is kayle, I said tf and twitch in jgl are troll picks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-10-04T09:58:25.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"devourer is kinda weak compared to the other jungle items and only a very few champions can actually use it effectively and on none of them it is so strong that they have no other option but to buy it.\n\nalso, aside from MAYBE kayle, there was no ranged champ it was even remotely viable on, so the nerf is completely useless and bullshit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2015-10-04T09:46:46.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it was to stop the vayne QQ.
