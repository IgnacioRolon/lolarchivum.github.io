Can't play shyv without having all these items simultaneously? (I know I can't)\n\nDevourer's, Bork, Hydra, Wit's End, Randuin's, Thornmail, Visage, Tabi, Trinity, Cinderhulk, Locket, Warmogs\n\nThen this is the gametype for you! With *** double the cap on items, and double the gold from all sources ***! Build the perfect full-crit + full-arpen + full-tank build on tristana, or just troll the enemy team with 6 additional rod of ages on ryze! You can never have too much of a good thing... or a bad thing as this will probably turn out to be 90% of the time (I'm looking at you ad annie!). \n\nP.S. Please combine this with urf (or just double the cap on cdr, but scratch the innate cdr buff. You have 12 items. I mean come on, you'll probably end up with 80% cdr anyway.)\n\nDouble P.S. (those are allowed too now) If YOU have an idea for the perfect 12 item build on your favorite champ, please share below! The more ideas the merrier to promote imagination (If it's 12 trinity forces on hecarim, I'm not sure that promotes imagination, but I'll take it.)","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-03-31T05:38:53.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the wake of tragic news from riot studios regarding their recent decline into subpar, misguided, poor, inadvisable, depraved, sacrilegious, unspeakable, evil, Voldemort-homaging, Knoxian-approved, not-presented-the-day-before-April-1st-in-an-entirely-invalidating-way, urf evaluations, a bump is justified.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-26T06:50:46.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of wondering what people think about this a half a year later.
