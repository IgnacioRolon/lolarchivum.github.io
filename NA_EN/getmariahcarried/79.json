There are apartment complexes that don&#039;t allow alternate services to the ones the complexes provide. There are towns/regions monopolized by certain net services, and good competing services don&#039;t exist (the be all and end all of why Time Warner gets away with so much crap). There are also people with these things called budgets.\r\n\r\nNo, I&#039;m not moving just to make a few occasional League games better, and I won&#039;t dish out cash just because you can&#039;t stand games where allies aren&#039;t carrying you. If you haven&#039;t noticed, &quot;f2p&quot; doesn&#039;t stand for &quot;pay to play&quot;. Get a grip on priorities and not being an ass in chat. When everything else works well enough, League can suffer a few lag issues. I don&#039;t care if I lose a few games to allies with net issues, and neither should you. It&#039;s life, and this is just a game. Get over it people.","replies":[{"poster":"Samus72","date":"2015-12-14T05:24:49.809+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"It is simply not fair to place blame on a player for their internet connections.  I worked in the industry.  There are things within it that are simply out of the customer's hands.  But that's not to say the user does not have options.\n\nA quick tip.  You, as the consumer, to have every right to press the issue with your ISP that your connection is sub par.  They are the one providing the connection for you, after all.  Granted, you cannot just stop paying them because they can then stop your service.  But you can complain to them and other businesses to make things happen.  And if your landlord refuses to allow upgrades such as new wiring for your apartment, there are things you can do there as well.  Know your rights.\n\nStill, there is some frustration associated with someone who keeps being disconnected.

League has system requirements. If you meet them, you can play. Simple as that. Same as people with good internet can choose not to play. If they have any issue with anything that anyone does regardless of how much, how small, or how big. If you have an issue, you can leave. The people not having fun are the ones who should go because I can have more fun with a person lagging so bad that they can't function who has a good attitude about it than the guy who rages at him for it. That's the guy I never want to play with again, and you best believe I report it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragfin","date":"2015-12-14T15:20:15.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=cuddlykitten4,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GLMfFAFJ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-12-14T02:44:04.725+0000)\n>\n> They sure do, and since it's a choice they have every right to choose to play if they want.

I was reading your opinion and taking your thoughts into consideration until I got to this part \"You are passive to everything in your life and part of the problem not the solution.\" At that point I stopped bothering to read it, I'll tell you why. You presume to understand who I am as a person. I'll let you know now that I am anything but passive, in fact I'm extremely proactive in my life. If there is a problem, issue, or simply something that irritates me I immediately address it and deal with it. If you're going to try to prove a point (especially if you plan to do so in a hateful manner) you should be very sure that what you are saying about the psyche of the person you are talking to is actually true. Don't just throw an insult because you think it will be offensive. You killed your own validity with it since I do legitimately know what kind of person I am, and therefore know out the gate that you are just guessing. I assume all your information comes from guesses resulting in you not having an opinion, just a series of words smashed together for the sake of someone listening to you, most likely for attention alone. In fact, anyone who posts on this board are proactive people to at least a small degree since they are participating, common sense would dictate that knowledge. Having said that, I'll now say this. You were right about me being a selfish person. I totally am, I've never denied that to myself or anyone else. I'm perfectly fine with it. I'm not going to not have fun so some stranger can be happy. When left to decide if I should be happy or you should be happy, well, I'm going with me every time. If you don't like it come unplug my computer. Short of that, the only power you have is the power you obtain via illusion of idol claims which few people will actually fall for. Next time, just calmly and nicely post your opinions, maybe I'll actually read the second half of your post that way. To be noted, I will only correct toxic people once. After that, you are talking to yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragfin","date":"2015-12-16T18:47:00.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=cuddlykitten4,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=GLMfFAFJ,comment-id=0001000000010000,timestamp=2015-12-16T17:59:21.464+0000)\n>\n> I'll be straight up with you.

Probably big time. My opinion is about all people who feel the way you do and find nothing wrong with wasting others time. There is only one meaning for that and it's self absorption. You are useless in my world as I have stated and even more so now that you found the need to try and justify it, lol.
