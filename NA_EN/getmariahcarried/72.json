I bet if you compared statistics for late s5 to those for this new season, you&#039;d see a crushing of that bell curve with a lot more matches on the outter edges of the ratio spectrum.\n\nI could be wrong though, most of this pre-season snowballing centers around objectives, which are a dime a dozen now. Maybe a better histogram would be ratio of towers taken on one team to towers taken on the other. Who knows. All I&#039;m saying is it would add some hefty evidence to how things are fairing lately.\n\nSomeone add this to a LoL stats site. PRONTO! BIP BIP!","replies":[]}
