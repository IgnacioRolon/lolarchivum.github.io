If it&#039;s gonna be that way, I think every player should have a say in who they don&#039;t want to play. Doesn&#039;t even have to be a ban for both teams, each player on your team can ban one champ from being voted on. That way you don&#039;t have to see the exact same champ for the 10th game in a row. Better that than have one dude get full veto power on any idea anyone suggests before ban phase ends. Few games back, some guy goes &quot;who&#039;s up for Nami?&quot;, banner instantly bans Nami. Ugh.","replies":[{"poster":"FDru","date":"2015-10-21T14:32:50.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"All draft modes that aren't ranked SR should work like this. Hell, ARAM should work like this.\n\nThere's no excuse to not have a better ban system in all the modes that Riot doesn't even attempt to balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2015-10-21T16:51:05.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One for All is definitely best enjoyed with a group of at least 3, preferably a full premade. But with at least 3, you have a good shot that one of you is banning, and you can guarantee you get the champ you all pick.","replies":[]}]}
