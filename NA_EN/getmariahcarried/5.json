Meanwhile, the enemy team just kept aa-pushing botlane, ignoring me while I banana'd them to death. Literally, the karthus never put a lvl in w. AOE never showed in his passive. He just kept aa-pushing with everyone else on his team in botlane. I went 26/1/5 (got distracted while autoing them to death on their platform around the time they finally stopped moving.)\n\nI suspect these level-farmers are populating the queues with a ton of bots late at night where it's unlikely they'll be queued with any actual players. A bot's not gonna report a bot, right? I know I just posted a thread asking about bot prevalence, but this one bot match deserved its own. Why am I the only human being in a blind pick? This shouldn't be a question that even comes up. This crappy, pathetic, easily-identifiable bot behavior should be programmably detectable and flagged.\n\nI suppose if nobody cares what happens in lower level matches, Riot won't earn money _investing_ money to fix this. *sigh*, I'm sorry, but this is just pitiful to see. Guess I now know the crappy side of matchmaking (no, elo-hell doesn't count, that's not an actual thing people. Get over your self-proclaiming-of-under-certified-proskillz.)","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-09-29T07:34:59.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should've left it on for a while, grind 120 IP","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-09-29T08:48:48.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Very Toxic Jinx,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=gPF3utjJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-29T07:34:59.922+0000)\n>\n> You should've left it on for a while, grind 120 IP\n\nLol, I tried to \"leave it on\" just to make it more obvious if I got up to 50 kills as soraka on 3s with a stupid build. But I made the mistake of taking top tower early. Which means those proxy-top-bots suddenly weren't proxying anymore, could legitimately push, and in addition, the other team of bots wouldn't stop them, due to botlane pushing routines. What are ya gonna do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-09-29T07:13:31.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"play ranked 3s\n\nproblem solved","replies":[]}]}
