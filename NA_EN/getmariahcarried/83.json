While this was for the purpose of terrorizing meta players with pool party fiora/taric bot combo (fiora spammer here), I hope Riot will see passed my many faults in life, and allow me to refund this. I have not used the skin yet. Is there any way to convert this purchase to a gift, or refund the RP so I can directly purchase it as a gift this time?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-21T05:35:43.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot strictly holds to their [refund policy](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ); they want you to be absolutely sure you have selected the intended content before you purchase it as you are only given 3 refund tokens. The Gifting Center is in a completely different area from the Store where you buy things for yourself, and has several extra steps and a different layout, so it's nearly impossible to make this mistake.\n\nWhile you're very likely out of luck, you can try asking them by submitting a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2016-07-21T06:00:04.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying it's impossible because it doesn't occur to me at 1 in the morning that it aint like Steam - which puts gift selection after merchandise selection, instead of vice versa - is unreasonable. It doesn't matter which order it's in. It's equally likely to happen. And given they changed up the store recently, it makes it even more likely.\n\nI checked support tickets, but no categories fit. That's why I came here. If they want to adhere to their oddly restrictive refund policy, that's fine. But there was no harm in checking in the one place that doesn't require a ream of categories to fill in, that ultimately don't match the request. I might try an \"other\" ticket category though. But it doesn't sound like it's worth it.","replies":[]}]}]}
