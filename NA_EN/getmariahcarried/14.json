Given shyv&#039;s potential for insane clearspeeds (devourer+tiamat = 1-second-mob-deletion) and the fact you can get stacks from monster assists, not just monster kills, AND champ takedowns, AND 5 stacks from drags (you have 5 smites... this part shouldn&#039;t be a problem), five sated shyvs seems very doable in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe general problem with getting anyone to try it though is a) nobody really wants to play shyvana on OfA (no hilarious self-synergies with that champ, just massive op-ness), b) nobody wants to coordinate their jungle/lane rotations that much, and c) even if you do get a game with shyv, what are the odds of everyone being willing to try sated anyway? And even if they do try, how many are gonna be half-hearted about it and half-ass the effort? I see very little chance of finding 5 people enthusiastic enough about this idea.\n\nIf you&#039;re out there... PLEASE FIND ME!
