Would be nice if Riot did the same for runes.\n\nI felt that scaling cdr runes had a critical impact on tank fighters for me, opening up some very non-cdr-based itemizations (example rand&#039;s+visage+thornmail+warmog&#039;s+sunfire+merc&#039;s on sejuani) while still allowing me to turn a fighter into spam-city. Capped cdr allowed some champs like sej to become a nightmare without itemizing damage. Scaling cdr runes meant I didn&#039;t have to get a frozen heart to pull this off when the support was likely getting one anyway. I could get a thornmail and a pair of shades instead (until Riot nerfed TM. This route isn&#039;t so cool anymore, but still, it's fun.)\n\nNow though? Not so sure. With all the new cdr routes, I imagine a lot of AD fighters are gonna cap cdr easily with essence reaver, trinity, and other changes. Not so sure about AP tanks, but I bet it's coming too. And yes, I used scaling cdr on AD fighters too. They were amazing on wukong. But now, caling CDR runes may become as meaningless as other niche rune choices that used to be cool. Lifesteal quints? They nerfed&#039;em once, and now I think every adc is likely grabbing runaan&#039;s, max crit, and uber-effective heal items, which will do boatloads for their heals anyway. So who needs&#039;em!\n\nI really feel like runes need that same &quot;decisive&quot; rework coming in on masteries. There are so many runes these days that, frankly, have no purpose (I&#039;m looking at you mana marks) and currently-common runes that may soon become less significant than they already were (what&#039;s the use of flat armor runes in the face of a rushed youmuu&#039;s which, now with the an actually decent amount of AD, might be more common?)","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-10-31T02:28:19.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ferocity tree is my least favorite.
