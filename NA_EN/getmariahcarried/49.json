Anyways that aside: the results.\n\nDoes Talisman do additional damage?\n\nYes, when hitting the krug I got it from 1400 down to like 1357 or something the first hit and then down to like 1318 without any items (rough numbers I don't remember exact values)\n\nUpon buying Talisman I ended up getting it the same for the first hit but during my second hit the number changed, I determined that Talisman gives roughly 2 damage per second whenever you damage a monster, but not on the second that the damage hits, it will be applied on the following second.\n\nIt's such a small number that it basically doesn't matter, but it does indeed steal hp.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-23T19:31:25.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's 20 health-steal over 5 seconds, which translates to 4 per second.

It doesn't always affect too much because the beam still applies the passive and the turrets target the unit Heimer most recently attacked, but when Heimer is leaving a camp's range to go to another camp it would help so much if the turrets could apply the passive, especially if Heimer wants the turret to die before he moves on.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-22T22:11:49.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be shocked at the thought of dongerjungle, if I wasn't more shocked that I even have to redact my \"it procs on ability damage\" comment.

Heimer turrets don't proc spell effects, like crystal scepter's. Hence my theory. Soooo I guess Riot somehow forgot that not every form of damage procs either on-hit or spell effects... ...
