Roaming.\nI suppose it&#039;s more interesting than designated laning, but I do wonder what&#039;s with all the love for this one SPECIFIC gameplay facet over the past few months. No wonder OfA had the teleport meta (okay, I&#039;ll be honest, unless I&#039;m in 3s, I use teleport. But still...)","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2015-10-30T16:34:08.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is wrong with roaming? If the roam fails and they dont get anything or don't really help the lane they roamed for then it is worthless. No different if a jungler ganks and the enemy gets away with full HP instead of taking a jungle camp. There is always an outcome of the roam and maybe people should learn to ward better.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-30T16:53:05.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not saying it's bad. Just feel like it's on Rito's mind a little more than it needs to be. There are other ways to improve this game too that are likely being ignored. And there are already existing highlights that are being dumped in favor of roaming. I mean, it's fine, but it shouldn't mean gutting one of the side roles of a well-loved champ.\n\nRIP Assassin Bird","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-10-30T16:40:28.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roaming is just fun for some people.
