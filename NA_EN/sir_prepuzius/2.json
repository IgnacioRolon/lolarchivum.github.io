Ahri, mage, that's a maybe to try. Jinx, marksman. Doesnt catch my interest...\n\nThen I encountered Sona, and she's a support! Perfect!

As a Rakan main, it was relatively obvious that I would go with him. However, after that... it became kind of hard to imagine who I would be fine playing with only 6 champions. Soraka was my former main, so I suppose that one wasn't as hard -- Zyra is just... well, kinda there for when I need a poke-poke support.\n\nVarus... well, he's what I would play in ADC role, I guess. I've always loved him, but I just don't play him because... well, not an ADC and Varus support doesn't work out that well (I've tried). Orianna is one of the first champions that drew me to League, despite never learning how to play her -- still think she's really cool though. Morgana is what I play midlane (because I need the W CS) and I enjoy her support as well. This was really hard and would probably change after Rakan, but this is what I got so far. lol","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-10-17T13:42:56.359+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may not look like much, but when that teamfight comes around, you will land the ability that turns the game around.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-10-17T12:40:04.640+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:222}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:81}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2018-10-19T04:48:08.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"top: Yorick and Urgot\nMid: Veigar\nJg: Nunu and Braum\nSup: Braum\nADC: Urgot","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Prepuzius","date":"2018-10-19T08:15:15.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"braum jungle?? tell me more","replies":[{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2018-10-19T18:06:36.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum's level 6 ganks are insane.
