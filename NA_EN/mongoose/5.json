I agree with some comments, just having Galio present makes the enemy team very cautious with their CC and I have won 3 consecutive teamfights without using his ultimate, just by charging in and scaring the enemy out of position. I love him and how he can be played, but every once in a while I get this bug where I ulti, it gets cancelled before it triggers, and I get locked into the ultimate posture but without casting it. I just think stopping enemies from just tapping that AA CC \"As\" they get taunted is unfair, they should either have it primed before hand, or they be outside and activate it, so somehow closing the window where they can counter it would be nice.\n\nBut to be fair, something much simpler would make Galio's life easier, if his ultimate is cancelled, reduce the cd of the spell, not a lot, but from 3 minutes to 2, most of his opponents have such short ultimate cd that even though he counters them, if they are just aggressive enough they can hit their ultimates twice before he can use one that is very difficult to land or get in range with\n\nShorter cd if its cancelled, and turn his e into a charge and his spells would synergize much better without taking away counter play options","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-03-27T00:31:27.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would probably work pretty well if his ult applied a debuff to enemies that were caught in it when it was first cast that disabled on hit CC only on them, so if you are playing Leona or something you can still use the Q to stop the ult just only if you were outside of it when it was cast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kise","date":"2015-03-27T00:17:46.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"outplayed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rueian","date":"2015-03-27T00:10:17.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make it a charm rather than a taunt and give it bonus damage for each charmed champion within his AoE.\n\nOr\n\nLower the base damage, make the explosion radius bigger, have it do multiple waves of small taunt/charms and have him CC immune during it.\n\nHis ultimate looks like it should suck people in hence the charm effect.","replies":[]}]}
