Either the other two branches need to matter lategame or masteries should be reworked entirely. \r\n\r\nTL;DR 21+ in Offense matters more than anything else right now. It doesn't add depth or diversity to the game yet it's strictly better on most champions. Masteries deserve a rework.","replies":[]}
