It's just odd, seeing that it's currently the only Legendary Tier item that shares part of its name with something else (save for Frozen Heart and Frozen Mallet). It's a little confusing because both items are VERY similar, but you can't quickly tell someone \"Buy Hydra\" any more.\n\nIf you're looking at monsters I'd suggest Nidhogg, Orochi, Typhon, or Jormungandr.
