People who tell others to kill themselves still get to play/aren't reported, but like OP, saying \"f%%\" and then calling someone a \"Trump supporter\" and to \"walk on legos the rest of their lives,\" is worse than death threats? I'd like the chance to prove reform if I get suspended. I have video evidence of playing league and being a good person, and the escalation ladder of the punishments is there to help someone reform and move down it _if_ they show good behavior. I can prove I can be good, I'll stream every day now if I have to. I just want my friends (on that league account) back.","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-03-17T22:46:31.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can assure you, \"Trump supporter\" and telling someone to \"walk on legos the rest of their lives\" are non-punishable offenses.

It's unfortunate because *that* account has all my friends and money and time and memories. Also the name. I lost everything and want to show reformation and become great again like Jensen when he came back from his past and is now in a consistently top LCS team, or Uberdanger who has had several chat restrictions and maintains a good standing to this day after getting nicer.\nI just want to prove it was a mistake on my part and I want to make amends. I still want to work for Riot and give back for all the years of support they gave me, but now that this has happened I feel much more despondent in life in general. I just miss it, I miss friends and I miss the game, and I'm still following all the casters and Riot accounts and LoL accounts on every social media platform and receiving emails from their Indeed Career page and it just generally *sucks*. I'm incredibly upset over this fault of mine. Honestly, I'm going to regret it the rest of my life, even more so because hateful people saying far worse than what I said those two games, get to keep playing.\nI'm just sad. I miss it. Idk, this has become a sob story i'm sorry. Gotta blast, thanks again for the nice words.\n-S","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2017-03-17T08:45:41.821+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Racism/hatespeech or other extreme toxicity can lead to the System skipping punishment Tiers.
