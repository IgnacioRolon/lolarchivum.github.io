I have had no problems with the new launcher either, until yesterday, when i tried to start the launcher, a windows error pops up, it says something about it was a problem with league or it's not made for windows 10 and a bugsplat report.\r\n\r\nSo what i did was reinstalling league. For some reason after it was installed it was using the old launcher. But that day it actually worked when i tried to start league today, when i opened the launcher and clicked launch, i got the same error as yesterday.\r\n\r\nI also did a quick scan on windows defender in case a virus was causing the problem, but windows defender found nothing.\r\n\r\nAnyone experiencing the same problem or having any solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-28T00:55:16.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your installation of League has some major issues.
