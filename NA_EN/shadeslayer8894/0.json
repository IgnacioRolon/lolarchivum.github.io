I try and open league, then the League of Legends logo shows up, closes, the new patcher logo with the grey bar appears loads, and then it says that Riot Client Patcher has stopped working. I've reinstalled, ran as admin, and forced a patch and it still hasn't worked. This problem is brand new to the 4.15 update and I'm guessing it has something to do with the new patcher. Any advice or fixes?\nEdit: I'm running Windows 7","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadeslayer8894","date":"2014-08-28T14:03:08.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Server: NA\nType of Bug:Riot Client Patcher has stopped working\nDescription: Tried to do a fresh re-intstall of league but every time i do the below error occurs\nProblem signature:\n  Problem Event Name:\tAPPCRASH\n  Application Name:\tLoLLauncher.exe\n  Application Version:\t2.17.0.280\n  Application Timestamp:\t53f6a71c\n  Fault Module Name:\tHTTPHandler.dll\n  Fault Module Version:\t2.8.13.1\n  Fault Module Timestamp:\t4f33e386\n  Exception Code:\tc0000005\n  Exception Offset:\t0001243d\n  OS Version:\t6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.48\n  Locale ID:\t1033\n  Additional Information 1:\t0a9e\n  Additional Information 2:\t0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789\n  Additional Information 3:\t0a9e\n  Additional Information 4:\t0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789\nVideo / Screenshot:\nSteps to reproduce:\nExpected result: Open patcher\nObserved result: Fails every time\nReproduction rate: Every time I try to do a reinstall\nSystem specs:\n\nProcessor\tIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-2520M CPU @ 2.50GHz\nVideo Card\tIntel(R) HD Graphics 3000\nMemory\t8.1 GB\nOperating System\tMicrosoft Windows 7 Professional Edition Service Pack 1 (build 7601), 64-bit","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinigamiBlaze","date":"2014-08-27T20:39:32.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess i'll join in here.
