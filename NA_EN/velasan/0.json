First I want to say new rework looks amazing, and I do really like the added sound effects.  Particularly the &quot;soundtrack&quot; that goes off when he ults.  Props on the good work and a shout out; I very much appreciate the detail that went into it.\n\nSo, my question is this:  Can my opponents hear that ultimate theme?  What about the sounds of all the crows taking off?\n\nI know Jhin for example has sound effects that only the Jhin player can hear (I assume because they are supposed to be in his head).  I really hope that everyone can hear Swains new effects, gives him a more intimidating edge.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotKarateMonkey","date":"2018-01-24T02:28:37.380+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no custom music on swains ult.

At least I've noticed his theme playing at times when you start a game. Zoe as well. Guessing it has to do with whether or not the themes fit with the general Rift music.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-01-24T15:31:22.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Question, this is kind of a dumb request, but when Eve marks someone with charm, can her piano theme play for them and her?
