Caused me to die when I was so surprised I couldn't react. I also noticed lag spikes with azir where my ping never changed and stayed a constant 50 and fps didn't drop either. it was like the game froze for 1 sec. Only happened twice when I tried to auto attack cancel.","replies":[{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2016-03-15T23:53:46.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point I have such a love/hate relationship with Azir.  I like the Egyptian themed characters and was excited for Azir on his release, he felt good, came to me naturally, and I mained him throughout much of the season when he was released.\n\nThen came the bug fixes... he was broken like every other week in some way or another for months at a time.  When they finally got 'most' of his bugs then they decided he was too powerful for his utility in LCS play and immediately got nerfed into the ground.  Two parts of his kit were actually 100% removed... that's how hard he was nerfed (the CDR to attack speed and knock up as well as his soldier range).\n\nIt's probably been one of the worst playing experiences I've ever had, essentially having a character I would love to play, but is always either full of bugs or nerfed so hard I never know where he's at anymore.\n\nHope they fix this one soon.","replies":[]}]}]}
