Had a quick question for anyone that can help. Around Christmas time, I sent a friend one of those gift packs you buy with blue essence, but every time I log in... I get a prompt saying: \"(my friend) has opened their gift!\"\r\n\r\nVery small problem.. only a minor nuisance, but if I can do something to resolve it, it would be awesome. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\n- Trist","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T04:43:59.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try toggling the 'esports notifications' option to see if that makes it stop sending you those old notifications.
