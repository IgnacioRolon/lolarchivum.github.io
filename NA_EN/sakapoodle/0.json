I usually take a printscreen of 3 rows of champs whenever I'm about to redeem another \"free chests\", the problem is that champs with golden borders (ie. obtained chest champs) get mixed in with those that don't have golden borders yet.\r\n\r\nAnother solution to this would be to enable a mark in champ select that fills this function. Wouldn't need to take screenshots at all or write down stuff before making my selection in champ select, because I would easily see what champs are eligible for redeeming the free chest and which aren't in champ select.\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows any third party website that makes use of Riot's API to tell me at a glance which champs that have yet to redeem the free chest then that would be really nice. Of course I'm hoping for a native UI update to enable this feature, but a temporary workaround would be an implementation through Riot API.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T17:22:01.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sakapoodle!
