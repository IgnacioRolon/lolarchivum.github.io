But what about the rest of us? Can we take legal action if Riot is infringing on their own Terms of Service? &quot;But you&#039;re just a random Joe, you couldn&#039;t possibly take Riot to court lel&quot;. I&#039;ve already taken MUCH larger corporations to civil court and left with settlements up to $75,000 for similar reasons. Back on topic: Will the fact they&#039;re violating their own mandate force them to re-establish the rulebook? The word &#039;permanent&#039; should hold unbiased weight, especially if it&#039;s conveyed as a rule to abide by. I&#039;ve seen so many arguments on every side.. Riot confirming their adamant stance that absolutely NOBODY will have their punishment given a second look. Yet here they are (again), undermining their own rules in spite of a recent scandal regarding one of their employee&#039;s comments on a big streamer. \r\n\r\nWill this particularly shameful display of Riot tolerance open doors for recently punished players to be given sanctuary? The fact it took Riot&#039;s true nature being exposed to the public beyond the playerbase... has Riot in a scramble trying to show they&#039;re a Ma&#039; &amp; Pa&#039;, good &#039;ol fashioned, down to earth company. Fucking shame. Willful negligence and a conscious effort to coverup their own errors.. when this game&#039;s death begins to escalate quicker than it already is, I bet my soul they will expedite their policy on what &quot;permanent ban&quot; really means. \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re wondering, no.. I have no permanent bans. So this isn&#039;t some shit post or &#039;salty&#039; rant. Just a casual gamer commenting on this company&#039;s nature come to light. \r\n\r\n- See you folks in Player Unknown Battle Grounds","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-10-20T03:18:45.629+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are not unbanning his account.

Who, coincidentally, happens to be on one of their employee's (Riot Phreak's) shit list? You're obsessed with this idea that anything Riot concludes is just and fair... yet they've a history of abusing their own rules, and players. This is nothing new, regarding their employee's tasteless comments... as it's happened in the past to smaller, more unknown players.\n\nWhen this game is dying, as all games do (Hello Warcraft), you'll start to see things clearly. For now, enjoy a game on its last legs. \n\n- PS, I'll be in Player Unknown Battle Grounds for the next 15 minutes.

You can try.  Will it work for you?  Depends on what the situation is, how good your attorney is, and just how much effort you feel like putting into it.  But can you do it over permanently banned accounts with the reasoning of Tyler1?  Nope.  Tyler1 is not the first player to be given an indefinite player ban, nor would he be the first player to have that indefinite player ban rescinded.  Jensen also had one, and his previous accounts were never unbanned when he was allowed to return to playing League.   \n\nYou can see this quote from The_Cactopus in the [Tyler1 Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/75d9t3/tyler1_unban_conditions/) which explains a bit more about the bans, and what the difference is.  And how Riot is **not going to be changing their policy**, even if they do end up rescinding the ID ban on Tyler1.  The main time permabanned accounts are unbanned is when it is done in error.      \n\n> Edit 3: Received a message from u/The_Cactopus (Rioter), requesting me to add the following clarification:\n> “I’d like to address some confusion I’m seeing about the difference between “account permabans” and bans like the one Tyler1 has. A better name for “indefinite ban” would be “identity level ban” or “ID ban” since it’s about the person. Regardless, we’re not changing our policy around permabanned accounts: Once an account is permabanned, it (almost always, except in rare cases) stays banned. That applies to accounts from ID banned people as well.”","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-10-20T03:35:32.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has to be an ironic meme post.
