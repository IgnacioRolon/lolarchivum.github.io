But, one change that can be made to his W is to make it so it's not invulnerable when invisible, which means a pile of boxes might mean a pile of gold for a mage that is smart enough.  I believe that's enough counterplay.  \r\n\r\nShaco's E fits both roles as well, great for setting up an asshole Q on a low health target or for getting off great ganks.\r\n\r\nShaco's R is what needs to be revamped IMO, maybe not its AP ratio, but its range.  Shaco's R should be what makes his teamfighting viable.  There are two possible things you can do with his R:\r\n\r\n#1 -- Put it on a very short cooldown, but make it so it has reduced auto damage and low damage explosion.  This would make Shaco great at scouting areas with his clone and the short CD would make it easy for him to do it.  Put his clone on a 30s cooldown or something, or...\r\n\r\n#2 --  Make the explosive radius larger, and make it do increased damage based on what percentage of its damage was taken by players on explosion.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDr√°co","date":"2015-02-06T05:43:21.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think Shaco needs any damage or utility changes, he just needs QoL changes. Maybe make it so his boxes are like Zyra plants and dont die immediately to AoEs. Also even though its been said to death his clone should display buffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2015-02-06T04:22:13.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the boxes need a buff, so that 100 AP gives them +15 seconds duration while invisible. If you buff his invisibility, make it increase duration like 1 second per 100 AP. I think his ultimate is more than fine. It's already a very short cooldown. You can get CDR if you need to improve it.","replies":[]}]}
