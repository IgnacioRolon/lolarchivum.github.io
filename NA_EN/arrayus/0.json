After trying to reconnect 3 times it would crash at 100% every time. Upon rebooting the patcher I was told I had some corrupt files that needed to be repaired, and I asked my friends not to report me. They didn't, but I got a Leaverbuster for Leaving/AFK even though they remade, when it was beyond me control! I asked the support team for help, but as you can see, they say there's nothing they can do. I'm almost done playing all of the games now, but it kind of sucks I wasted 100 minutes of my time, could I get RP? This isn't the first time I've been unable to get support for false-tribunal issues, and it kind of sucks to waste my time when I have a lot of stuff to do outside of the 45 minute League game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T22:50:45.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The /Remake system will trigger if anyone was marked as inactive due to not taking action for 90 seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match. The system is automated, so if you're marked by the system, you'll see action taken automatically, despite reports.  Regardless of intention, disconnecting from a match negatively impacts everyone in it. This is a key reason as to why all disconnections are treated equally by the [Leaverbuster system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) and why penalties cannot be modified or removed. \n\nIn order to resolve the core issue as to why your game is crashing, I recommend continuing to work with R041 to find a solution. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
