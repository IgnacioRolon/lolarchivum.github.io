I remember doing this back when I first got the game. It was more to play with new friends but every now and then I would jump on a lower level to beat on people who were new. Realized either way I am still really bad at this game but beating up new players is just dumb and rude.\n\nThat and now that I find most silver or bronze players easy to beat I don't mind playing vs them every game. And anyone higher may dick on me but at least it challenges me and I can try to learn. But yea OP bad qq thread.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ultra Combo Ryze","date":"2015-12-08T20:42:12.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not Smurfing, Im from Guild Wars 2 this account is my first\n\n\n2nd: Ultra Combo Ryze is my name because im a Kjller Instinct fanatic \n\n3rd: I just want all Spells to be unlocked at lvl 1, so no one has an advantage, like guild wars 2 Pvp","replies":[]},{"poster":"LuluInWonderland","date":"2015-12-08T17:55:54.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're obviously smurfing.

I understand there should be a way to ease people into the game instead of giving them everything all at once to figure out. Smurfs are not Riot's priority.","replies":[]}]}
