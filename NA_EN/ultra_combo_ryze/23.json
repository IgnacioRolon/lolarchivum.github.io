Don't overstay to protect dying turret and freeze lane to close the gap between u and ur opponents. Remember to ping mia if you only see one opponent @ bot lane. If the support is trolling then dont say \" it's k we can still do this\", this'll make the support troll even harder. Pretend you're suffering hard so the troll will sit back and laugh.","replies":[]}]}
