I literally did nothing wrong the automated system messed up","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"So here&#039;s my story of the way i got a 14 day suspension unexpectedly,\nI got banned after calling my teammate out for saying &quot;Shut up %%%&quot; after i said in chat &quot;vayne q&quot;, there was no previous hostility or anything. Then post match i had called her out and told enemy team about this to try and bring her to justice because how the system works (or at least i believe, the more reports, the more credibility)\nHowever I was unfortunate and was in a game with 3 toxic players after most people left the enemy neeko and my fiddlesticks and the vayne started making fun of me saying stuff like &quot;go cry to ur mommy&quot; &quot;suck on my milk&quot; &quot;ur gay&quot; etc. \nI had said that saying %%% was not cool in this day and age and that it was derogatory. \nHowever in doing so i had said the individual word &quot;%%%&quot; in the sentence (Ex: &quot;%%% is a derogatory term&quot;) and i believe the system had seen me saying %%% a couple times and it ended up getting me banned even though i had never said it in a bad context was just referencing the word to say it was bad. \nI had also called their response to me (ie making fun of me and calling me names) &quot;toxic&quot; and that it was creating a toxic environment and this behavior had no place on the internet. I do not think i should get any repercussions what so every I was very nice about it the whole game and did absolutely nothing wrong. I think the system really messed up cause it doesn&#039;t look at the context of my chat only the individual words.\n\nPlease let me know if i&#039;m wrong or what i can do to not get a 14 day suspension. This really saddens me cause i wanted to join BDE and was really excited for getting close to honor lvl 3. I am almost honored in all my games and the only reason i had such low honor was because i had had leaverbuster but that&#039;s all that has been on my account. I don&#039;t understand riot went straight to a 14 day suspension.\n\nhere are my chat logs : \nGame 1 \nIn-Game \nblaze0: thats dmg \nblaze0: wow \nblaze0: sorrys \nblaze0: mb \nblaze0: fuck \nblaze0: my bad \nblaze0: fiuck \nblaze0: cayne q \n(right here is where i got unexpected out of the blue &quot;shut up u %%%&quot; from vayne)\nblaze0: okayyy \nblaze0: report vayne \nblaze0: called me a %%% for saying vayne q \n(Enemy neeko was doubting that this happened)\nblaze0: trust me \nblaze0: gg \nPost-Game \nblaze0: she said shut up %%% \nblaze0: like really \n(The 3 of them started to harras me here)\nblaze0: %%% in this day in age \nblaze0: %%% is a derogatory term \n(Then it continued for a good 10to 15 or more lines of chat and i eventually gave up and decided to just report them)\nblaze0: what evs im reporting all 3 of u for being toxic and not recognizing what a toxic environment ur creating \nblaze0: its just not funny or fun \n(They proceeded to tell me to go back and &quot;cry to my mommy&quot;)\nblaze0: get off the internet if ur gonna be this immature \nblaze0: have fun with the ban u guys&#039; \nblaze0: &lt;3\n\ni was in the process of reporting them and about to screenshot chat when i was kicked off the client :( I believe u should let people screenshot chat b4 being kicked off or at least give logs of all peoples chat not just ur own.\n\ni believe all 3 of them reported me which is why i got such a serious ban even though i did nothing wrong which proves the system is broken.\n\nAlso i have sent a ticket but got back a response from a bot which was zero help and asked for a human and thats where im at now. I&#039;m afraid i wont get my honor back ive been working so hard to get it back to apply for BDE.\n\n\nUpdate: thanks to the very kind player support they got back to my within 12 hrs <3 sending tickets really does work\n","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-13T08:36:58.236+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"report vayne\" and constant bickering might earn you a chat restriction, but the derogatory term you're focused on is actually a zero-tolerance phrase, meaning that anyone who puts that in chat can basically expect to be instantly and automatically banned. Given that your entire usage of that phrase was in taking issue with it, you might actually benefit from submitting a support ticket and explaining that. I wouldn't be surprised if they take a look at it and reduce your penalty to a chat restriction or something.\n\nKeep in mind the first reply is automated, and will just explain that you broke a rule and that's bad. You'll need to keep at it until you get a human response.","replies":[{"poster":"blaze0","date":"2019-01-13T09:21:45.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank u all so much for the replies i have been looking through this board and had realized the thing about saying to report someone after i had posted this. The reason i had done this previously was because i had been under the impression that a report gains more traction on a player if multiple people report the same person (ie it treated it as repeated offenses). Now that i know this, I will not do this in the future.\nAlso ya i think I've learned my lesson not to repeat the exact words in a different context cause were dealing with a automated system.\n\nAlso I don't tend to bicker just wondering where u think the bickering is?\nEdit : I do see how the last couple parts are a little bickering, i have a problem with thinking that possibly i can make a little difference in a persons attitude by trying to have a civil conversation about the situation.

Granted, you did something wrong while ignorant to the fact that it _was_ wrong, but still; this wasn't a wholly unjust punishment. KFCeytron put it best, so, I can only really summarize what they said and add a little context to both offenses;\n\nSo, report-rallying. There is _zero_ reason why you should be \"calling out\" a teammate to the enemy team. If your teammate is breaking the rules, _you report them._ That's it, that's enough to get them punished. The IFS doesn't care how many reports are filed - if there's even _just one_ report, the IFS will review the player's behavior, and punish accordingly.\n\nAnd, the offense that jumped your punishment from Chat Restriction to 14-day ban; copying hate speech. This is something that I have a hard time understanding in general, but, for real, **DO NOT repeat what others say** if you feel that they're breaking the rules.\n\nIf someone says a bad thing (be it hate speech, insults, etc.), and you're 90% sure that it would get them punished if they were reported for it, _**do not say it yourself. Ever.**_\n\nThat all said, it is possible to get your punishment appealed via a Support Ticket, but I wouldn't hold my breath on it.","replies":[{"poster":"blaze0","date":"2019-01-13T09:19:23.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank u all so much for the replies i have been looking through this board and had realized the thing about saying to report someone after i had posted this.
