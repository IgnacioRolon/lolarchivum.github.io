I have restarted the computer, checked graphics drivers, changed ingame graphics.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I was thinking about doing is uninstalling and reinstalling, but would rather not do that unless it's a last resort.

Second, that's a great question! To add further context to Tseihei's answer, Nvidia video cards have the ability to display games in 3D--this feature is called \"3D Vision\"--which creates the effect you've witnessed. With the proper equipment--like 3D glasses--things will look 3D (with assets being shown at different depths), but without it, you'll see split images layered over each other; this is also something you can witness if you go to a 3D movie, but don't wear the glasses.\n\nCtrl + T is a hotkey to toggle the 3D Vision feature on and off. As you've already hinted at in your first reply, there are some cases where 3D Vision automatically toggles on after a video card driver update. So the next time you update your video card drivers and notice that you're seeing layered duplicated images in-game, use the Ctrl + T hotkey to toggle the feature off.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"specialmissile","date":"2016-05-21T06:25:43.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try pressing Ctrl T.
