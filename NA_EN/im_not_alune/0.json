The first few minutes were fine but i right after 2/3 mins in, i kept on getting disconnected and reconnected. I checked connection to league using Haste and it doesnt show anything out of the norm. Tried connecting again around 19:29 mins and it works but once it got to 21 mins, i dc but everything suddenly works after 23 mins. Im not sure if it was player caused or not so im just posting it here so i can know how to avoid this.","replies":[{"poster":"Im not Alune","date":"2017-07-23T04:55:47.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright :)\nDone with the match so i can take a look st the guide","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im not Alune","date":"2017-07-23T04:10:33.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened during my promo series as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T04:21:20.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes that really sucks that this happened in a promo!
