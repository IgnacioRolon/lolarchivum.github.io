Honestly, in Bronze 3 most of the time just playing defensively will get you snowballing because players in that ELO become extremely blood thirsty after a while and will make rediculously stupid mistakes trying to get a kill, and thats where you catch em   *IE:* Enemy tries to tower dive you for some reason because you've been under tower for too long lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khas","date":"2017-02-11T01:54:47.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mister Lau,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=rrBAddEE,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-02-11T01:14:40.604+0000)\n>\n> Hey all Mister Lau here, have been coaching for quite a while now and have been quite successful.
