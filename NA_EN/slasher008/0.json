How can you care about  the customer's satisfaction if you dont have staff just for that. Im wondering has this company grown so fast you guys are trying to catch up? If so, please please please hire a more competent manager. This may not be an issue that is of concern yet but trust me I have a degree in management, trust me when I say this will grow over time and become a major issue in the future. \r\n\r\nThe one thing I have learned about all games in the last 20yrs I've been around the industry is that no matter how popular a game is there is always the wave. One minute your high and the next your going downhill and the only thing that will keep this downhill momentum from going to fast is good management team. I would love to give you some pointers on some other issues I found with the way your running this company but for that I'd prefer a private conversation through email. I wish Riot the best but Im very concerned especially with you guys being a organization that donates, you need all the help you can get.","replies":[{"poster":"Slasher008","date":"2016-11-01T14:42:36.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I give your the support ticket would you please look into a support ticket that has been waiting a response going on 3 days?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T01:11:21.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not sure I understand the issue you encountered with our email support.
