This post specifically outlines the first rough draft of what would be GD-specific rules posted and stickied to the top of the section.  This draft is based on the feedback from the four nominated GDers.  In some cases, feedback was split amongst them or some didn&#039;t provide feedback at all but we had to include something in the first draft so moved forward based on overall thoughts from those nominated and GD as a whole.\r\n\r\nAgain, the idea here is to have a set of rules that GD can reference easily and that also is clear about what is and isn&#039;t allowed.  Keep in mind, there&#039;s no way to give examples of every possible thing that is or isn&#039;t allowed, so we have to work together to find a way to make the concept of the rule and what it covers as clear as possible.  We welcome your feeback in this regard.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_**Disclaimer:**_\r\n\r\n_The discussion content within this sub-board reflects the views of individual people only._\r\n\r\n_Any rules not listed here applies the same as the normal Universal Rules._\r\n\r\n**The Golden Rule**\r\n\r\nAlways be respectful to players, community members, Moderators, and Rioters. Joking with friends and playful teasing will not be removed. Flaming and insults specifically targeting someone is still against the rules and deleted. If the targeted player asks to stop, it is not considered a joke anymore and action will be taken as appropriate.\r\n\r\n**Mature Content**\r\n\r\nPornographic material, real life depictions of gore, content that represents sexually explicit acts, underaged content, and NSFW material is still not allowed. &ldquo;Sexy&rdquo; content can be posted as long as the discussion intent is for appreciating the art and not objectification/sexualizing.\r\n\r\n**Spamming / Trolling**\r\n\r\nSpam, bumping, and necroing are considered okay in limitation. Daily discussions are allowed as long as conversations are happening within. Mindless spam will be handled per normal. Necroing a thread that has become relevant or bumping your own old thread to reignite further discussion is okay.\r\n\r\n**Hate Speech**\r\n\r\nThe rulings still apply to this category and even jokes using hate speech will result in severe punishments.\r\n\r\n**Inappropriate Discussions**\r\n\r\nPolitics and social issues are allowed to be discussed in this space only. These discussions will need to be kept civil and trolling/harassing someone over a topic point will result in punishment.\r\n\r\n**Impersonation**\r\n\r\nImpersonating to poke fun is okay. It is not okay when intentionally trying to make others believe you&rsquo;re someone else to negatively affect said person.\r\n\r\n**Spoilers**\r\n\r\nSpoiler rules will stay the same. Please use [SPOILER] tag when creating discussions with spoilers in the content or conversation. This will be moderated heavily.","replies":[]}
