I&rsquo;m &ldquo;TheCurator&rdquo; and I am one of the Boards mods.  I started working with Metaverse last fall after being introduced to one of the VPs at PAX East and have been part of the moderation team for the Boards since earlier this year.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to being part of leveling up the visible moderation around here. I believe it will help answer a lot of the &ldquo;Why&rsquo;s&rdquo; in regards to mod actions and help us move forward into the &ldquo;How&rsquo;s&rdquo; in regards to making the Boards a more enjoyable experience for the community.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ve been participating in online communities since 2003 or so, primarily in MMOs at the start and then transitioning into MOBAs.  I&rsquo;ve been playing League since the end of 2010 after PAX Prime where I got my PAX Jax skin and immediately installed the game and started feeding because there was no tutorial to tell me how to play yet.  Good times.  When I&rsquo;m not queueing up for ARAMs, I&rsquo;m probably playing Witcher 3, catching up on the backlog of TV on my DVR, or out at the movies.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ll be checking up in this discussion when I can to answer any questions you have about me or the moderation of the Boards.  Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll be fretting over the future of my Pick&lsquo;em as today definitely had some unexpected outcomes (C9 + CLG wut?).  :D","replies":[]}
