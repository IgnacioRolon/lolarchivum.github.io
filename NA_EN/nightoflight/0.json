I used to rush the zeal for the triforce for ther early game mobility but I cant do that now with the item until I fully finish the item. What im asking is probably selfish but I would love this change. While were at it give any item that this builds this movement speed as well would be fun to give {{item:3115}} movement speed especially for those satan players MWUAHAHA.","replies":[{"poster":"SonaTitsAndAss","date":"2016-06-08T19:47:44.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3044}}","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-08T19:54:16.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he wants the movement speed out of combat too.","replies":[]}]}]}
