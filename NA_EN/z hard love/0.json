So 2 of my friends messed up their runes and asked us to just stay afk and remake the game (we were 5 people so...). After we surrendered i got the leaversbuster thing and was suspended playing this game for 5 games waiting 20 minutes BUT none of my friends got it. So I wonder if you could remove that thing because the only time i could play ANY game is at Friday evenings , Saturdays and Sundays. I do not feel like waiting 20 minutes especially when it is not my fault. And in my opinion the leaverbuster is broken...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-08T18:58:28.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remake isn't really intended for wrong runes, but technical issues that would cause a player to leave.  I appreciate you for trying, though, but it's still required for players to participate until a remake vote goes through.  If you are not participating in the game, then you can get flagged as AFK and treated as a leaver along with the remake causer.  If you do see a /remake ocurring in your match, make sure you're still playing!  In normal cases, you never know if that player is returning or if the vote doesn't go through.","replies":[]}]}
