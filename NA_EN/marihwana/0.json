It requires a full repair from the client so 100% of the time they will have to remake. If this issue is inevitable, can the player be exempt from AFK penalty or loss prevention in ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T00:02:21.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap, that sucks that your pc ran into some issues with your DirectX drivers, but League won't be able to detect issues like that until the error occurs =\\ . It's especially frustrating that this crash caused you to end up with an AFK penalty, but those penalties will only happen after multiple left matches over a short amount of time. If you keep getting that same crash over and over, it might be better to try and troubleshoot that before you jump back into matches.\n\nLet's first try making sure that your DirectX drivers are all up to date, and if that doesn't seem to help let's also try the steps in this guide as well. Make sure to test those changes in a custom or practice game, and let me know if that was able to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Marihwana","date":"2017-05-14T01:29:25.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I guess if that happens it is unfortunate {{champion:32}} Thank you for your concern!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JollyChop","date":"2017-05-13T06:31:30.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"HACKINGHARD","date":"2017-05-13T05:07:01.609+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"same here. please. help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"HACKINGHARD","date":"2017-05-13T05:15:09.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"AFK PENALTY IS A DUMB SYSTEM FOR INNOCENT PEOPLE.
