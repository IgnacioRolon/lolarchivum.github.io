That's why i'm playing that champ. Jay sea is also really good... But a lot of it is practice. You can only learn so much before you have to perform it.\n\nSome people have told me \"if ur bad, don't play ranked\"\nbut there's also that thing where \"I'm more serious when I play ranked\"\n\nwho wants to play with a bunch of obviously inting idiots?\n\nanyways... I think build paths are more important than the build itself... Also power spikes are something that isn't exactly obvious either.

I think build paths are more important than the build itself... Also power spikes are something that isn't exactly obvious either. They take time to learn!\n\nBuild paths are part of the build, and both are important. In this case, it's crucial to realize that Tryndamere has no on-hit effects, and Guinsoo's is an item that scales heavily based on the strength of your on-hit effects due to the passive it has. Try replacing that item with an earlier Guardian Angel or a Death's Dance or a Stormrazor and you should find yourself having more success.","replies":[{"poster":"Thr33Zer0Thr33","date":"2019-04-26T15:52:48.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I use the Guinsoo for the on hits I get from tiamat and shiv though... it makes my wave clear something I'm not embarassed about...\n\nSomething that's funny to me is the \"perfect cs\"\nhigh elo players can get 300 cs at 30 minutes... the people I play with MAX at 200 cs at 30 minutes. 300 cs is like a 50 minute game!\n\nYet, I'm the one who's bad.

It's not worth sacrificing the strength you get from other itemization options to shore up a weakness that isn't even that much of a weakness in the big scheme of things.

Yes they can mute you but they shouldn't have to just so you can be immature and petty. Not only that but the time you spend flaming someone is the time not spent playing the actual game itself. From the [Instant Feedback System FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q7): \n\n>**WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!**\n* Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n* Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\n____________\n\n> I don't find it reasonable to ask someone to mute their teammate or face certain banning.\n\nIf you find it unfair/unreasonable to ask someone to mute their teammates then why force them to make that choice when they deal with you? Don't you find it unreasonable to have others be forced to mute you just so you can fight fire with fire with a misbehaving knucklehead or three?\n\nThat aside the only time people face bans for chat related behavior is when they consistently display negative behavior, but even then it only results in the normal escalation path under normal circumstances (zero tolerance policy behavior such as death threats/wishes, hate speech and racial comments aside). If you don't display negative behavior but display neutral or positive behavior instead then you won't have to worry about being punished for poor behavior.\n\nAlso, since you think it's unfair for Riot to permaban an account with lots invested in it (even though spending money =/= rule immunity) to quote [Kei143](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mmh6PidR-the-dreaded-downvoteers-in-this-discussion-board?comment=0001000100000000000100000004): \n\n>When Riot permabans someone, their philosophy is \"the chances of this guy reforming isn't a whole lot, we'd rather not have him in the game\". Thus in their eyes, they have already written off the toxic player as a paying client.\n\n>From a business standpoint, do they want to remove the toxic guy who has spent $500 but is causing a negative environment for 4-9 other players in every game? Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-04-26T21:25:33.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the vast majority of players disagree with you that players should be allowed to flame for **any** reason.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2019-04-27T00:52:27.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not his opinion, that's Riot's policy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-04-26T16:50:53.311+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thr33Zer0Thr33,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1gFdVTbA,comment-id=000200000000000300000000,timestamp=2019-04-26T16:49:06.048+0000)\n>\n> So it's okay for them to harass me based on my gameplay, but I'm not allowed to retaliate... okay, now I understand this is a nazi moderated game.\n\nWhen did I say their behavior was okay?\n\nI said each person was responsible for their own behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Thr33Zer0Thr33","date":"2019-04-26T17:04:06.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AeroWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1gFdVTbA,comment-id=0002000000000003000000000000,timestamp=2019-04-26T16:50:53.311+0000)\n>\n> When did I say their behavior was okay?\n> \n> I said each person was responsible for their own behavior.\n\nyour review only put me in a bad light... which is to be expected, as i'm only a lowly bronze player who can't climb... seems to me that everyone here is tilted that i'm even allowed to download the game.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-04-26T18:50:38.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thr33Zer0Thr33,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1gFdVTbA,comment-id=00020000000000030000000000000000,timestamp=2019-04-26T17:04:06.215+0000)\n>\n> your review only put me in a bad light... which is to be expected, as i'm only a lowly bronze player who can't climb... seems to me that everyone here is tilted that i'm even allowed to download the game.\n\nAt no point have I mentioned your skill in the game.
