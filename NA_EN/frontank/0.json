Even thought that ain't my problem since it only happens once in a while i am pretty okay with it . \nHowever when the dc happened i landed in the client again  , i believed that the game didnt even started After all i was 3rd pick and i got the dc when the 4th people picked . \n\nSo what happened ? I landed in the client with FULL functions , like chatting with friends etc. and even choosing another game mode like 3vs3 etc . \n\nHowever as i wanted to play another game the game told me yeah , it seems like you are in a game . Start the client again . \n\nSo i restarted it , and naturally the new fck client appeared . I downloaded a while ago , pretty much disappointed since the old client is reacting way faster . \n\nSo i went with the new client \"rejoining\" the game . \n\nI had a pretty long loading screen and what awaited me was a goddam surrender :^) . \n(That surrender at 5min)\nI lost lp while getting a ban . \n\nThat's the story , my question is WILL the ff stop when one is rejoinining the game ? \nSecond of all can one delete the new client , nothing against it but i only have bad experience (couldn't change masteries when i first started it) . \n\nIf it is not there to stop the ff when rejoining is it possible to implement it into the game ? \n\nI kinda shared the story so people who read it won't be like me going to toilet or anything before they make sure that are REALLY not in a game when they have a dc in champ select .","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T16:56:15.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your case sounds a network problem that caused you to lose sync, even though champion select had already finished and you were locked into the match.  Your intent to return to the game is appreciated, but you can still receieve a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) due to being gone for a duration, which still causes negative experiences for others.  As a heads up, the updated client is still in testing and not required right now so you can stay in the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nIf you have any technical issues that would prevent you from staying connected I'm happy to help.  We won't be able to reduce any lower priority queues, though!","replies":[{"poster":"Grizzliii","date":"2016-11-29T17:26:44.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thing happen to me, but it quit in the middle of the loading screen and randomly repaired my client.

It has never happened once the game has started, not sure if it has something to do with the process of the loading screen or what. I fully understand why the /remake is there and praise yall for implementing it, but could it maybe be tweaked with to be around 5 minutes instead of 3? I think it would help us pour country internet folks out a bit. \n\nI have only had the 5 game 20 minute wait twice this year and I deserved them both for wasting others time, but I know if I had an extra minute or 2 to reconnect to the game that I could have made it a quality game. Also if you have any info on how I could increase my network reliability to the LoL server that would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"darkmage1000","date":"2016-11-29T20:43:28.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"company always blames the user. i love when you get bug splat use task manager to exit all things league and still have to restart the computer to get it to open. i get wonderfully punished with an hour of my life for wasting 3 mins of others due to riots bugs they cant fix. they can get over their self righteous attitude and fix things before handing out punishments. i have plenty of people just afk in games by running in circles but i cant dc for 3 mins once a month.","replies":[]}]}
