I managed to report someone who was obviously toxic and i got thanked for reporting, but i get suspended in return. \r\n\r\nThe funny part is that i do get a chatrecords of games where i had a minor tilting moment, but more in a fair-arguing manner. But my last game (mentioned above) wasnt noted in the chatrecords. \r\n\r\nI did notice that the auto-detect probably suspended me because i call someone a noob. It&#039;s a  given when ur trying to smurf ur way out of bronze lolol. \r\n\r\nBut does that make sense when someone in that obvious position calls you a noob? I mean, perhaps i may have talked a lot on, and offtopic, but it escalated when u try to defend yourself when that said player also attempts to make you look bad on allchat (or begs in team/allchat to report you). In most cases, i kindly ask the allchat to mute him for his behavior and i end up ignoring him unless he demands an answer from me. \r\n\r\nAre we nurturing a community by teaching everyone to stay quiet? The reporting system seems to have a lot of holes from all angles it seems.","replies":[{"poster":"AraMoOse","date":"2017-08-11T02:45:38.006+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luslec,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=tWoiOryW,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-08-11T02:41:21.576+0000) \n> Are we nurturing a community by teaching everyone to stay quiet?
