I'd like to help!  Your specific issue seems like a pretty severe connection problem failing to reach the game server.  It's really important to start off with some basic network troubleshooting, which in most cases resolves issues like this.  Run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, and test it in a custom game.  Let me know if the results help!","replies":[]}]}
