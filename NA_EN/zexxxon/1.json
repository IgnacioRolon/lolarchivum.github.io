It does sound like you're having a pretty serious connection issue though, and if left unchecked, can continue to accrue losses of the match and LP.  I highly recommend going over every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this and fix up that instability.\n\nUntil that's completely, I don't suggest playing another ranked game at the risk of another loss.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
