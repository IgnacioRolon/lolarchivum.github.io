I also tried to uninstall the client and re-install it. This too did nothing, so now every time i log in it says that the game is still in progress (which i know it isn't because the game was two hours ago) and it won't let me do anything. Can anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Másón","date":"2017-06-19T23:29:55.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the exact same issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-20T00:59:13.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yoooooo you found someone else who was in the Ghost Game! Essentially what happened is when the game ended, it never sent the end of game notice to the servers for some strange reason. Typically, once 2 hours have passed from when the game ended, you'll be able to queue back up. Sometimes you need to restart your pc, but if you still can't get queue'd up reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to get you guys back on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Goxzy","date":"2017-06-20T01:36:05.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was in the same game aswell.
