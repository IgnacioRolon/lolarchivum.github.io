We spoke briefly at LeagueFest, and I couldn&#039;t think of any questions apart from &quot;what do you think of Teemo?&quot;. xP\nHope you&#039;ve been well since then! I&#039;ve thought of a (hopefully) more interesting question. :P\n\n-&gt; Are you going to take advantage of the Aegis changes to take a look at Heimerdinger?\n\nI don&#039;t think he&#039;s in a bad place per se, just in need of a few quality of life changes.\n\nReading about the Aegis stuff reminded me of {{champion:74}} because {{item:3060}}  is a fairly popular choice amongst a certain amount of Heimer players and streamers.\n\nSo.. since Banner of Command is integral to Pusherdinger (turrets + banner + zz&#039;rot top for example), it seems (from the outside) like a good time to solidify Heimer&#039;s strategic identity.. because this change will affect him regardless. :P\n\n---\n\nA couple of thoughts:\n\n*** Any possibility of adding visibility to his passive? **\n\nEven if its just as simple as adding one of his stored turret indicators to allies under the influence of his aura. Ally appreciability of his passive is practically non-existent. To be honest it could actually be pretty broken numbers wise, but we can&#039;t really tell.. the effect is invisible and has been for a long time.\n\n*** Is a split-push play style something you want to continue supporting?**\n\nI know ranged champions in top lane can be a contentious issue (to be honest I don&#039;t know why top lane Quinn fell out of favour), and Pusherdinger can be particularly annoying to face. I also know that for some players, split-push Heimerdinger is their preferred play style. \n\nI guess it partly comes down to the perceived future of split-pushing in League. Yorick&#039;s been Riot&#039;s most recent exploration in that territory; as I understand it the feeling is that to be able to split-push effectively you have to make a choice and give something up for that to happen (i.e. you give up The Maiden&#039;s teamfight threat when you send her down a lane).\n\nWith Heimerdinger that&#039;s not really there to the same extent. He can easily move to another lane and set up his turrets there. {{item:3060}} and {{item:3512}}  allow him to make up for his shortcomings. So he can protect lane turrets and prevent enemies from pushing, whilst at the same time moving inexorably towards their base.\n\n*** What about strengthening his identity as an anti-siege champion? **\n\nI wasn&#039;t playing League for Heimerdinger&#039;s release or rework, so I don&#039;t know what the rationale for his passive was. My assumption (pls correct if wrong) is that it was placed there to keep both Heimerdinger&#039;s turrets and his whole team in lane longer - aka to combat enemy sieging.\n\n{{champion:115}}  had some nice tweaks in mid-season. ahh.. I still love the turret execute. &lt;3\nAnyway. Ziggs&#039; changes reinforced his artillery and structure dismantling / deconstructing / demolishing theme. :D\n\nYes. I am going to suggest turret healing. I am that guy. :P\n\nOkay, so this is just a small suggestion. Being able to execute turrets was ruled out a while back, just as Turret healing was. It doesn&#039;t need to be repairing Turrets to max health. At max W, Ziggs can execute towers that are at **35% health or below**. Why not go the other way with Heimerdinger and allow his aura to repair towers up to 35%? Obviously this would be accompanied with power changes in his kit.\n\nPeoples, please remember this is just a suggestion and I'm not asking for it to be put into the game immediately. xP\n\n\n*** Tweaking stun grenade&#039;s speed and hitbox? **\n\n~~Possibly bringing it closer to Nami&#039;s bubble? ~~\nOkay I thought about this one, and making the stun easier to hit would need to be accompanied by an overall reduction in damage.. or else Heimerdinger would just be broken. xP\n\n---\n\nI&#039;m not advocating Pusherdinger over Turtledinger (or vice versa), just interested to see if some improvements can be made either way. :&gt;\n\nI hope that&#039;s all understandable.. it&#039;s 02:40 and I&#039;m half asleep. :P If it&#039;s not, I&#039;ll clean the post up later!\n\n_P.S. Heimerdinger mains... what are your favourite builds / play-styles / lanes? Are you worried about Banner changes? Couldn&#039;t care less?

Hope LeagueFest treated you well?\n\nWe don't have any specific plans for Heimer in pre-season. Banner of Command I can talk about a bit though. Current plan is that some form of Banner of Command will still exist, just without the aura. I'd expect its stats to be about as appealing to Heimer as the current ones are. That could still change of course, we're still partway through pre-season development, that's where we're up to now at least though.\n\nIn terms of split push that's a style of play we do want in the game. When we've made it pretty ineffective the game's lost a fair bit of strategic depth. At the same time though we're constantly trying to find ways to make sure it's an interactive and interesting approach. Some types of split push hit that well (e.g. a champion you can send one of your team to duel who you'll fight or be able to catch like Nasus), some don't (e.g. champs who'll just disengage and never engage with you like Shaco often does, or champs who constantly push, rather than having windows you can take advantage of). \n\nImproved visibility on Heimer's passive, at least for the Heimer player, seems like a great addition. We'll add that to a backlog of work and probably get it in at some point. Probably Heimer only healing text and visual effects on a heal every 5 seconds or something rather than a constant aura effect (same gameplay, just with a bit more concentration and visual support). \n\nRegarding healing towers that's something we've generally wanted to avoid, given its potential to lead to long, stalled out games. It's a really unique space, so would be cool to find the right way of delivering on it, would want to make sure we had a fair bit of time to try different directions if exploring that idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-09-17T01:23:37.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be cool if people affected by Heimerdinger's Passive actually had little Repair Bots flying around them that are \"healing\" them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxxLumberJackxxX","date":"2016-09-17T12:28:28.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can heimer have instant access to all his abilities after pressing R Please?

Its extremely buggy, and makes him really hard to play right now when ur a pusher and your turrets wont attack minions or structures a lot of the time. many many people have mentioned this but ive never seen a reply from riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Time42","date":"2016-09-19T20:11:34.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Likewise! Yeah, it was a great time. Wish I could've stayed for the whole weekend.. next time for sure. :P How was the weekend for you? :D\n\nAh, that's good to know, thanks! I'm excited to see all the systems stuff for the pre-season. :>\n\nOh yeah, I definitely agree split pushing in general is good for the game. So far Yorick seems to be a step in the right direction! My concern was mainly whether Heimerdinger does it too well given the synergy of his turrets with those two items _and_ at the same time is good at stopping enemies from pushing. You guys have the info on whether that's true or not though. :> Heimerdinger has a unique enough playstyle that I don't think he appeals to everyone (not necessarily a bad thing), which I guess means he's not seen too often in top lane in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAwesome, that actually sounds pretty nice. :D Ally visuals off the table though? Is that because it'd be a lot of effort for a small gain, or something like avoiding visual overloading - i.e. it'd be too much with other buffs (Ocean Drake, red buff, etc)?\n\nFair enough, I can see that healing on turrets would need **a lot** of experimentation. I agree it'd be nifty to see more interactions with towers in the future, it's a nice aspect of Janna's (and now Ziggs') kits.\n\nThanks for the reply, I appreciate it. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"tpnm","date":"2016-09-17T02:45:46.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm so sorry but this would be the only way to send you a message.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJinx is fine.. but there's a bug boosting Jinx's power.\n\nWhen Jinx uses Q-cannon w/ Runnan, she gets additional DMG from it.
