It only happens in full screen mode which I always play in. I had window updates this morning but I restored the system to that point but didn't help so I guess it's not because of window updates. I tried to repair the client also. I need help. thank you\r\n\r\nMy pc: \r\nwindow 10 64 \r\ngtx 750 ti \r\nram 8gb \r\nintel i3 4160","replies":[{"poster":"Jiggy Elve","date":"2016-10-05T21:35:28.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you figure out what the problem was? I seem to be getting the same issues just after I had a Windows update last night. Can't seem to find what causes this. There are no other programs running in the background when tried.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T22:21:25.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have a 3rd app in the background or setting that's making your performance drop when switching out or in.  The best thing you can do is not alt tab out, but removing the programs can also help rule out possibilities.  If you have any running like play.tv, any overlay, lolrecorder, etc remove them.  Also make sure that your drivers are up to date just in case, with instructions available in our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"9623","date":"2016-09-03T22:36:24.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I installed the newest graphic driver and reinstalled LoL. But didn't help. I don't have any of the programs you mentioned above. How do i check if i have a 3rd app in the background? I think the FPS is ok, but i don't understand what causes the screen to flash once after alt tab back in, and it only happens in full screen mode. Never ran into this problem before","replies":[]}]}]}
