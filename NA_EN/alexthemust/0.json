We had a good game and my team won. The thing was that facing a riot employers we wanted to have some fun so my friend and i started typing with him. When he did bad things and failed we gave him jokes aswell played when he flashed into a wall...afterall he was bronze V so what did i suspect. In the game i think my friend typed wp to him when he did bad things and like tbaged him sometimes when he rekt him in 1v1(ctrl+4). When later the day he signed in he got perma baned.... So i say why the fuck did that happend? Basicly the riot employer we faced had baned him for no reason. He was abusing his power...but afterall what do i suspect... all ppl that get admin sooner or later abuse it. And my friend hadn&#039;t got any penatly before....I&#039;m not toxic at all im just wondering why riot employers can abuse their power when ever they want?","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-01-08T16:52:33.630+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.
