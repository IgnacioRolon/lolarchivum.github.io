My question is why are the people who troll and cuss me not receiving them as well?  If you cuss at me and troll the entire game and I decide to cuss back at you than we both deserve a damn chat restriction. Pretty damn unfair how my reports are being blatantly ignored by Riot while these people can ruin others games and not get a single lick of trouble. \r\n\r\nNow I have to wait another millennium to get enough essences to unlock mastery 6 for my morgana.

The game sends a notification to you when someone gets punished saying something along the lines of \" summoner continued to display bad behavior and is now being punished\" Which means they were also reported in another game after mine.  If someone cusses me out the entire game and trolls... that should be an instant punishment and should not take multiple games for that to take effect like it does for me.\n\n2. I've had people in next games specifically tell me about an individual who I just so happened to have been recently played with and was clearly not chat restricted because he trolled/cussed them out too. \n\nThere seems to be very little faith in the penal system in this game.  When you start a match and people blatantly engage a 1v3 fight then use both of their spells and still die, then cuss you out for not helping them as they continue to repeat this process not listening to logic at all. You get annoyed a say somethings and end up getting reported and losing a game all because these people don't give a shit if they win or lose. \n\n\nI just wish I could play troll/toxic free individuals who don't intentionally bait people into reports.

Your concern is that you're worried other players who deserve punishment aren't receiving punishment.\n\nWhile they may have been toxic in your game, as long as they aren't displaying consistent or extreme toxicity, they likely won't be punished.\n\nThe system is designed to punish those who exhibit extreme or consistent toxic behavior only and pardon those who had a bad day or tilted a bit. \n\nYour concern is answered with your case though, if they do indeed deserve a punishment, they will receive one as you have.","replies":[{"poster":"MexicanLyncher","date":"2016-10-06T15:00:02.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So what you are saying is you can be extremely toxic in one game and a saint in the next and not get punished? thanks for the info!

If you exhibit extreme toxicity in one game you can receive a punishment you can also receive punishments for mild-moderate levels of toxicity over a short period of time.\n\nBeing toxic in one game, then being a saint in another then reverting to toxic in the following game will land you punishments and punishment tiers can escalate into account closure.  \n\nEven if you skip a few games or even a lot before you start exhibiting toxic behavior, you'll still be punished. \n\nWhat I'm stating is, somebody who usually isn't toxic but had a bad day and was toxic in one game but reverts to their usual positive or neutral behavior afterwards would not be penalized. \n\nI advise you to reform your behavior to avoid further punishments because you won't evade the system by being a saint in a few games in between your toxic ones. Even if you're a saint in some games, it doesn't excuse your toxic behavior in others and the system will detect your toxicity and punish you for it.","replies":[{"poster":"MexicanLyncher","date":"2016-10-06T15:28:51.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Breaking the rules, is breaking the rules.

Like I stated, the system takes into consideration of those who had bad days. This doesn't excuse them from their behavior and if they continue to exhibit this behavior they will be punished. \n\nThis practice is pretty much adopted around the globe. You receive a few chances at first but if you continue to exhibit inappropriate behavior, punishments will follow. In some cases here and in life, no chances are given due to how extreme the circumstance may be.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-06T15:18:03.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, what he is saying is that if you occasionally have bad days you won't get punished, but if you show negative behavior over a period of time, as you are suggesting now that people get away with, then you will get punished.\n\nThe system works, as the above people said you will only get notified if you reported them in the game that got them restricted/suspended/banned. I also heard somewhere that it had to be the last report out of the bunch if multiple people are reporting them but I could be wrong on that. Either way, its the system that tells you that someone got punished that needs serious work, which it will get.\n\nYou seem to believe that for whatever reason the system targets you with a higher priority than other people doing the same thing. In order for that to be the case Riot would have had to code it specifically with your username in mind, which I guarantee they did not do. That would be counter-productive to creating a stable report system, and cost them extra resources on top of it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-10-06T13:40:44.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am sure there is a Louis CK line here somewhere about minding your own troubles.","replies":[{"poster":"MexicanLyncher","date":"2016-10-06T13:47:51.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Right, so it's fair for me to get treated like shit and wanting to know why these people are also not getting punished? your logic is on point.","replies":[]}]}]}
