I don't come across one a lot but when I do I just find it to be terribly boring and unfun because I can't seem to counter play him at all. I play mostly assassins or bruisers that need to walk up for farm or trades, but vs pantheon he can just q me out of lane if I try to farm. No matter how passive I play I always get poked out of lane at least three times. Even if I'm farming under tower he just walks up, q's me, w stuns, channels an e, and then walks away after igniting me and gets a free kill without even taking damage from a single tower shot. I don't want to be wasting a ban on him every game when there's a large variety of other champions I would rather ban, but I can't seem to deal with it. Even if he gets to late, his split push potential is still insane and can easily duel me when I go to answer his push. Please help me out here. i find him extremely annoying to deal with due to his kit that leaves me little to no room for counterplay (at least in my opinion).","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-03-11T04:16:23.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You pick a counter to pantheon.\n\nCant outplay zero-skill trash champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ODiiiiiN","date":"2019-03-11T11:43:08.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe by not letting him dictate the lane? Why do you have your back against the wall waiting to be Q under the tower? The best defense is offense. Make him want to play passive by making him bleed a lil early. He is tanky af though so you cant go all in and always gotta watch out for his jump stun. But you can definitely make him not want to press you too hard early. I mean it all depends who youre playing. Best thing to do is counter pick or wait for JG ganks, but no reason you should be scared under your tower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"feintfiend","date":"2019-03-11T10:58:29.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not even kiddiing you just don't die\nif your jg ganks once he's beyond screwed and will be desperate for kills\nThe best way to tilt a pantheon is to know his damage and never feed him\nSometimes I take ignite as {{champion:24}} and just solokill him lvl 3 or lvl 6","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boatwhistle","date":"2019-03-11T04:23:21.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one does by getting another so two can deal with pantheon.","replies":[]}]}
