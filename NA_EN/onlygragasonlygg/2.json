At least, I can hope for outscaling under certain circumstances (e.g. Nasus vs Pantheon) but if I'm too far behind, it's over (for me anyway, I'll need to be carried). \n\nI do think it's hypocritical for them to turn around and blame you for something they asked, but for me, there are times I'd rather the jungle just leave me alone (no hard feelings of course).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2016-04-15T02:35:59.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the top laner doesn't ask for ganks and feeds terribly, the only person he can blame is no one but himself.
