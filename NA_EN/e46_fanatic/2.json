What I am talking about is how on your league profile, you have your ranked stats with your emblem (gold, bronze, plat etc.) then you switch over to normal(classic) where you have your wins, takedowns and creep kills. \nIn that classic area, are the emblems simply based on how many wins/takedowns and such? In ranked I am bronze, but in the classic area it shows the diamond emblem, I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just because I have a high number in those stats? 33,713 takedowns ---- 1,013 wins / 970 loss ---- 237,615 creep score\n\nAlso, does it mean I'm a decent player with a champ if my stats are higher than the average challenger player with that champ in the past 25 days?  \nI'm not getting full of myself, that's why I am asking questions. Any help is appreciated!! thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Zen Ineth","date":"2017-01-10T04:23:59.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't mean you should be diamond ranked.
