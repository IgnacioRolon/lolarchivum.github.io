I can't get to the repair part on the client because it's right after clicking the .exe when I get the error. I don't want to reinstall if I don't have to, but it seems to be the best way to go about it any repairs. I don't know if this will help at all, seems like it should, but below is what I found in the LeagueClient logs folder. Any help or advice is appreciated, thanks! $$$$ &lt;------ Here is some moneys 4 you\n\n\n000000.000| ALWAYS| Logging started at 2017-03-04T11:58:33.981\n000000.000| ALWAYS| Application Version:7.4.176.9146 - CL:1769146 - Build Date:Feb 17 2017 - Build Time:14:35:27\n000000.000|   OKAY| Running in Launcher Mode (Version Switcher) from cwd 'C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends'.\n000000.000|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Patching::EnumerateInstalledReleases: (league_client_sln)\n000000.000|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Patching::EnumerateInstalledReleases: Found candidate \"0.0.0.20\" (0x00000014).\n000000.000|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Patching::EnumerateInstalledReleases: Failed to find OK-file, candidate is not valid\n000000.000|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Patching::EnumerateInstalledReleases: Found candidate \"0.0.0.23\" (0x00000017).\n000000.000|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Patching::EnumerateInstalledReleases: Found OK-file, candidate is valid\n000000.000|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Patching::EnumerateInstalledReleases: Found candidate \"0.0.0.24\" (0x00000018).\n000000.000|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Patching::EnumerateInstalledReleases: Found OK-file, candidate is valid\n000000.000|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Patching::EnumerateInstalledReleases: Succeeded.\n000000.001|   OKAY| Initial working directory: \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\"\n000000.001|   OKAY| Current process: \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\LeagueClient.exe\"\n000000.001|   OKAY| Command line arguments:\n000000.001|   OKAY| Launching release '0.0.0.24'.\n000000.001|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Common::SolutionManifest::Load: (\"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/league_client_sln/releases/0.0.0.24/solutionmanifest\")\n000000.001|   OKAY| Riot::RADS::Common::SolutionManifest::Load: Succeeded\n000000.001|  ERROR| Riot::Client::`anonymous-namespace'::RunRelease: R:/code/RiotClient/rClient/VersionLauncher.cpp(153): Cannot run latest release because file, \"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/projects/league_client/releases/0.0.0.54/deploy/LeagueClient.exe\", does not exist\n000000.001|  ERROR| Riot::Client::Launch: R:/code/RiotClient/rClient/VersionLauncher.cpp(411): Failed to run the latest release \"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/projects/league_client/releases/0.0.0.54/deploy/\".\n000000.001|  ERROR| Assertion failed!\n\nExpression: ALE-1111000C\n\nDescription: Failed to switch from the install-root instance to the RADS release one.

As a first step, try our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that your OS is allowing the patch and client to launch, or specific game files needed to do so.
