Kassadin benefits because he gets a normal rune while everyone else is picking a rune just to get around the godawful creep block we've had the past few months that has only gotten worse.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-09-18T04:18:51.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty sure phase rush and nimbus cloak do that","replies":[{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2018-09-18T04:22:25.446+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SugeMinPikk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5Wt8thxN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-18T04:18:51.711+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure phase rush and nimbus cloak do that\n\nnimbus cloak does but I'm thinking a more consistent affect, at least not having to do with your ultimate.
