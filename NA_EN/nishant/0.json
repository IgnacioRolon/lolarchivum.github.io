The whole \"Gameplay knows balance\" meme prevails, and we all move on to the next champion, blissfully ignorant of what actually happened.\n\nI remember when the Juggernaut Update launched, and players gave feedback on the different champions: initially, several of the reworked juggernauts were legitimately weak, and the players on PBE had made that known. As a result of this, RiotReperoir buffed Garen and Skarner, and for a time things were fine, as noted by those same testers. Very shortly before the patch cycle ended, however, another series of buffs followed, this time going _way_ overboard, and those champions ended up getting released in a severely overpowered state. Meanwhile, CertainlyT absolutely did not communicate with players at any stage during the PBE cycle, and released Mordekaiser's rework with a similar degree of gross overtuning. When players pointed out how these champions were ridiculously unbalanced, some to the point of severely affecting Worlds 2015, Riot chose to blame the PBE testers for misjudging balance, rather than themselves for a) implementing those balance changes in the first place, and b) for buffing those champions at a point where literally no-one had asked for more. Effectively, the entire meme of player feedback being useless on balance is founded upon a lie, one specifically designed to divert blame.\n\nSo let's not make that same mistake again either. For sure, not everyone on here or the PBE forums is an expert at balance, but cases like these now routine hotfix-buffs are the kind of balance changes that many of the players here expressly do _not_ want, in large part because they tend to have a pretty bad impact on the game for the next few weeks. Even with our lack of expertise or direct access to data, we know that champions take time to learn, and so shouldn't be balanced around having a 50+ win rate from the get-go, especially if the champion in question is meant to be especially difficult. Gameplay did not want champions like Kai'Sa, Aatrox or Irelia getting hotfix-buffed, nor do most people here want the same to happen to Akali either. When Riot inevitably goes with the above and hotfix-buffs Akali, let's remember this and not blame the people who made themselves heard specifically to _prevent_ that from happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Nishant","date":"2018-08-03T16:35:47.527+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're definitely correct.

Yes, the playerbase indeed clamored for buffs and received them, _as I literally just said in my first comment here_. If you were to actually read Skarner's changes properly, you will see that the subsequent nerfs he received did not fully pull back on these buffs, indicating that they were indeed necessary to a degree, and that the problems stem from Riot way overshooting on them. You accuse me of bias, yet contradict yourself by stating that players demonstrated satisfaction with Skarner in the last stages of his testing cycle, but then afterwards claiming that no-one expressed any such opinion on his balance. It is clear you came here with a conclusion already made up, and decided to go on a long, weaksauce rant when your opinions were found challenged.\n\nUnlike you, I was actually present and one of the testers during the Juggernaut Update, and I can tell you that the major sources of complaints came from the gimmicks added to those champions, a fact you yourself brought up without seemingly realizing its importance. There was also a distinct period of time where those champions did feel weak, followed by a second phase where they felt much stronger after their buffs: again, your own reply mentions this, and it does not take real-time experience then to be able to see this fact, as the comments on those threads are visible for all to see, assuming one can read properly and is intellectually honest enough to not try to pretend the exact opposite. At the end of the day, it is clear those champions were in need of buffs, which Riot overshot, and then subsequently blamed upon their testers while simultaneously ignoring the meat of their criticisms (e.g. the gimmicks added onto the juggernauts). You yourself do not outright deny this, so while you still try to base your entire counter-argument on deceitfully irrelevant tangents, you at least get that much credit.","replies":[{"poster":"SirLapse","date":"2018-08-04T18:02:45.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teridax68,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=piXb6JVU,comment-id=00030002000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-04T15:29:27.209+0000)\n>\n> Read the dates properly.

His rework was noted to be one of the worst because it did not solve his core issue of being kited and thereby being a negligible carry in his own games. He did not have in-combat healing or shielding, whereas literally every other Juggernaut did. These are popular complaints about the whole debacle, so I have to ask if you even played the game around this time and gave a damn. 'Cause I sure did.\n\nHis **design** inherently proved to be stronger in lower elo. He suffered for it in higher elo due to balancing. This is an example of where the *balance didn't matter* and a *design shift* was actually desired if they were only going to nerf him. Fix your definitions of balance and design. They are different things in gaming even if they are co-linked by the fact a dev has to do both well in a PvP game. The DESIGN was not appreciated. The balancing was the aftermath that was also unappreciated.\n\n> Wait, so one (1) player expressing satisfaction at Skarner&#x27;s kit, proves... what, exactly? \n\nI feel like you need to reconsider your own evaluation of other people and go to actual social debates/politics or something. You need to realize that what I mentioned was in regard to the entirety of the thread in relation to the rework itself. The relevance of each post can then be filtered (as I told you that you would have to do) based on who has actually played Skarner to give an opinion, then sorted by posts in regards to how Skarner feels **numbers wise.** Very few people said he was overtuned. A Master tier Skarner player may be saying that the rework is now \"fine\" to absolutely abuse him for elo, which is why I mentioned that it might have been bias. If you want to give a good discussion at least put some effort to reading long ass threads instead of just long ass replies.\n\n>If you were to actually read Skarner&#x27;s changes properly, you will see that the subsequent nerfs he received did not fully pull back on these buffs, indicating that they were indeed necessary to a degree, and that the problems stem from Riot way overshooting on them.\n\nThey didn't completely pull back the buffs because as you would see in the stonewall video I posted, his clears were not only janky based on what area you completed them in, but his clears were actually garbage in relation to the other meta champions at the time. That wasn't the argument here. The bias I'm talking about is that you're prone to agree with kneejerk opinions and reflect on the game with inaccurate information because we're looking at it from the present without necessarily involving the input from people at the time. And it's reflected even moreso based on how you're replying to me and didn't go out of your way to mention posts that counteract the assumption that people \"did want more Skarner buffs.\" \"Feels terrible\" was one of the main complaints seen in many posts which inevitably can be (and was) perceived as asking for buffs. Since the \"New\" sorting function can be assumed to be based on the last change, which was to the Crystal position, we can thoroughly see that the specific change that made Skarner more functional was that change itself. This is the buff that fixed Skarner's clunkiness but left him with hugely overtuned numbers. However, everything that came before was done in an effort to compensate a more clunky Skarner that people clamored about. Hind. Sight. No nerf threads were seen until after he began to rampage in solo queue.\n\nEvery post I've seen from you has literally just been other people's present-time opinions summed up like a blender. It's like you don't actively think unless someone else has spoken first. But that's face value, I'm not implying that is how you do everything or think about everything.\n\n> Unlike you, I was actually present and one of the testers during the Juggernaut Update, and I can tell you that the major sources of complaints came from the gimmicks added to those champions, a fact you yourself brought up without seemingly realizing its importance. \n\nI was there. But yes, please go on with your ad hominem throughout your posts like you know where I've been. It's very useful to the topic at hand. I want to steer you away from me as the main focus of the thread itself and point you to the actual topic matter, which had more to do with BALANCE and not DESIGN. It's like a deja vu with the last time I spoke to you ages ago, since you didn't know the difference last time. Whether people are satisfied with a design or not shouldn't be influencing balance, but that is EXACTLY how the juggernaut reworks played out. All complaints over champion feel regardless of positive changes, no complaints over champion strength that stood out notably on its latest change until release. Where's the deceit in that blatant evidence? Or do you just not want to look bad because I'm telling you that you need to rethink something? Don't be inflexible.\n\n\n>At the end of the day, it is clear those champions were in need of buffs, which Riot overshot, and then subsequently blamed upon their testers while simultaneously ignoring the meat of their criticisms (e.g. the gimmicks added onto the juggernauts).\n\n\"which Riot overshot\"\n\nDo you not see that I'm saying that this was in hindsight? Where do you see in that PBE feedback thread outside of a good minority of people that he felt a bit strong? Even then, they didn't say how strong, only that they won a lot. PBE MMR makes it difficult to judge really how powerful something is. Move onto reddit threads and it was his actual release that ended in wanting hotfixes. I want to also remind you that these buffs were done in a matter of **DAYS.** Do you understand the clear gap in testing that Riot does these days even now for changes in relation to that? It's not just that Riot overshot. The community was too focused on his passive and wanting to re-rework it **rather than** focus on numbers. This has been shown very blatantly THROUGHOUT the feedback thread, youtube videos, and even forum threads at the time.\n\nIn conclusion, to remind you once again. The community was at fault for asking for those Skarner buffs to the extent that they did with too few moments of feedback to really focus on **balancing Skarner.** Where are the \"Skarner is too strong\" threads from the 8/7 change? I don't see them. Clear speed was his primary strength as his ganking was seen as lackluster pre-6 (until people got better with him). Balance is about both ways, buffs AND nerfs. Riot screwed up because they didn't continue testing properly. It's not entirely the fault of one or the other, but the feedback visibly from that fiasco can be seen even now in hindsight over how limited proper feedback was over the actual design choice Riot chose. Whether or not the design choice was correct or not, people on the PBE were NOT set on the idea of making it work. So many passive re-reworks, not enough \"hey let's compare his clear speed to competitive junglers\" and \"how does he teamfight?\" as feedback. You cannot just shield the community and say \"they did no wrong\" when they are at least partially responsible for that release's abomination and limited feedback. Nobody was deadset on wanting more time before the release either, not at Riot and not in our community. There was no winner for the Juggernaut patch in terms of correct balancing.\n\nYou chose your narrative to be based upon Riot not listening to the posts about gimmicky reworks when the community did not even try to make it work. There was no tangent to go on. This is the topic matter. Balance, not design. Akali rework \"avoid buffs.\" Balance-related changes, not design-related changes. Do not derail it any further by referring to \"design complaints\" on Juggernaut patch as your example, and instead refer to Swain, Ornn, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-08-05T04:13:15.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirLapse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=piXb6JVU,comment-id=000300020000000100000000,timestamp=2018-08-04T18:02:45.395+0000)\n> \n> Every post I&#x27;ve seen from you has literally just been other people&#x27;s present-time opinions summed up like a blender.

Otherwise please refrain from putting words in my mouth, particularly when doing so involves lying outright. At no point did I ever say anything even remotely resembling the notion that the playerbase is somehow immune from fault, and in fact my point rests on the fact that the playerbase _isn't_ perfect, and is made up of many different players with different opinions, biases, and degrees of expertise (none of whom are experts, though). At the end of the day, the playerbase can only give feedback, not change the game directly, and in many cases, their consensus does happen to be correct, as was the case on the assessment of Dynamic Queue, or the state of damage in the game right now. If a champion turns out unbalanced, the fault lies squarely with the people who had full access to data, as well as feedback, and whose job and expertise is to balance the game, yet who still made the wrong decision. For sure, players individually make mistakes and evaluate things wrongly, as you have throughout this argument, but that does not damn the playerbase as a whole, nor does it justify blaming people for daring to give feedback. The problem with your attitude here is that you are ultimately trying to silence players for giving out their opinions on the game, which ultimately would only make matters worse. By contrast, my goal here is to establish a clear distinction, one where we acknowledge that players aren't perfect, but then also realize that we can't just blame each other for Riot's poor decisions. With this distinction in mind, it should be possible for players to give feedback, and for Riot to sort properly through it and make decisions with a proper level of accountability. The very idea that Riot is pandering to players with hotfix-buffs, when they have openly accused those same players of being wrong on balance, makes no internal sense to begin with, and perpetuating that kind of drivel is at the heart of the toxicity on Gameplay.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=SirLapse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=piXb6JVU,comment-id=000300020000000100000000,timestamp=2018-08-04T18:02:45.395+0000)\n> \n> You chose your narrative to be based upon Riot not listening to the posts about gimmicky reworks when the community did not even try to make it work.

In fact it's a basic attack on politicians by commoners who don't understand the complex language/logic being used. Trying to understand people isn't about attacking them over shit you don't understand. I'm not going to bother looking up the fallacy/bias charts, referring to those already demeans the discussion and pushes the emphasis to ad hominem. I'm not going to play your game of trying to make the other person look bad and use that as the primary weapon for \"proving myself right.\" It's childish.

It clearly didn&#x27;t, and still doesn&#x27;t feel good to use.\n\nI really question if you actually go back and reread your posts. Hell I question if you even reread mine for clarity.\n\nYou made the narrative blatantly about \"Riot should listen to the community this time\" with:\n\n>When players pointed out how these champions were ridiculously unbalanced, some to the point of severely affecting Worlds 2015, Riot chose to blame the PBE testers for misjudging balance, rather than themselves for a) implementing those balance changes in the first place, and b) for buffing those champions at a point where literally no-one had asked for more. Effectively, the entire meme of player feedback being useless on balance is founded upon a lie, one specifically designed to divert blame.\n\nThis disregards the timing of when these complaints happen and generalizes it to the point of making a shallow jab at Riot directly. Skarner is the perfect example of a champion that quite literally didn't receive buffs that \"fixed\" his problems as a champion until the very last cycle, and in that point in time, there was barely any clamor for nerfs. The complaints for the Juggernaut patch notably happened **during live** when it came to BALANCE. Since people weren't set on making the rework actually function AS IS without being broken, barely any feedback was really dedicated toward that idea in the PBE and even after.\n\nThis is not the first time Riot has disregarded design complaints, especially with Karma rework being in the past already. They're not going to dedicate resources to essentially re-redo a champion, especially not in a short timespan. But players still submitted their frustrations and ideas regardless of this development idea and did not give enough proper feedback toward what would make the champion \"balanced.\" It's not about whether they should voice their concern or not. Many scorned the reworks before ever even trying them. There is a time and a place to argue over concepts and designs vs. balancing what is essentially a \"finished product.\"\n\nThe consistency in the argument is that fault is definitely existent for the playerbase in the problem that arose. You might switch it around to say that I'm implying Riot did no wrong, so I had to include the full story basically to prevent any kind of misunderstandings or possible jabs. And with any full story, that means actually reading the topics in question and mentioning some example posts, not literally copy/pasting the thread and assume that another person is going to read the whole thing and *pick out specifically what I'm telling them.* I used a generalization toward the information you'd find and through the action of mentally filtering those posts after sorting from Newest to Oldest, ANY person can go judge what I'm saying from the totality of the topic. Ctrl+F isn't hard for reddit either.\n\nYou also submitted player-oriented posts over \"Gameplay getting blamed.\" That already shifts the narrative against Riot when we are not a hive mind in here. People can correctly/falsely assume whatever about other people or the boards in general. Freedom of speech. Riot is not blaming the playerbase themselves, which is an idea people will get from your words (and one person other than myself already did react that way).\n\nAnyway, if you've got something to say that isn't your continuous chain of questioning the coherency of my words (when that in and of itself can be worded in a nicer way to ask for a different method of explanation instead of assaulting the explanation), then go ahead. Otherwise if I were you, it'd be better to refrain for your own mental and emotional health. This is literally just a comment on the league boards.

You've yet to debunk how your juggernaut reference is irrelevant and actually proceed to dodge anything that makes it feel irrelevant, like say, the majority of the design complaints in the post that completely obscure any relevant posts over balancing Skarner (and other juggernauts for that matter). It is not a personal accusation at all, but you're receiving it that way because of blanketing. It is talking about the problem behind your declarations, not you as a person outside of the portions that actually do talk about you as a person.\n\nI will go over the process more in-depth so that you can stop with this banter of declaring yourself to be correct and me being incorrect, since your dynamic lacks an actual focus on the topic itself for the majority. You also don't know how to condense a topic and represent it repeatedly in different manners, making your posts redundant and ever longer for no gain. It becomes draining for both sides, which you evidently don't see or care about in a discussion. I will show you a structural example that you may use regardless of its contents of information. I am telling you with the intention that will stop your *actual* wordy posts that try too hard to address things on minute details without drawing back on the bigger picture (which is what even encourages those tangents subconsciously).\n\n> Except that&#x27;s not what I said either, I said players on the Boards _in general_ have made threads asking Riot to avoid hotfix-buffing champions. Once more, you are trying to shift the goalposts here by trying to make me say things I have never said.\n\nSure, let's say that's my mistake. But that doesn't really change its irrelevance toward the matter simply because the truth of the statement is that they do not even represent a major *fraction* of even these boards. Yet you mention them as though they matter. Very nice of you, but not something worth mentioning. Doesn't even relate to how the Juggernaut update went either with regard to its feedback, as I already mentioned that hotfixes only happened after live hit.\n\n> Once again, your sentence makes no sense, a phenomenon that seems to occur most frequently when you are directly proven wrong, and have no means of escaping from the point. If you truly believe there&#x27;s no &quot;right way&quot; of explaining something to me, why still try? Would it not be hypocritical to declare it impossible to argue with someone, yet still continue arguing with them? At the end of the day, you have been caught messing up the timeline of the Juggernaut Update, and the fact that you do not even have a response to that shows you yourself know you&#x27;ve been caught red-handed.\n\nI am extremely stubborn when it comes to talking with people, especially because I believe in the idea of conversing with anyone regardless of conflicting ideals. However, that's not relevant to the topic and you will proceed to bounce back and forth like a child whenever anything is mentioned about you, but somehow declare it to be bad when I talk about it. I say it to be brief and voice my discontent at your behavior, not to dedicate actual entire posts to it like you already have. You are way too thorough on something you cannot even be thorough about, since you don't know a damn thing about me.\n\n\"Timeline of Juggernaut update\"\n\nThis is basic logical pattern I am using. I'm going to simplify it as humanly hard as possible as I stated I would before on a comment that was removed:\n\nSkarner rework > frustration over rework > negativity remains over rework affecting balance feedback by reducing its effectiveness > shown by thread participants in archive.\n\nI AM WORKING UNDER THE PREMISE THAT THIS IS CORRECT INFORMATION.\n\nIf frustration over the rework is blatant due to overlapping negativity of gameplay problems AND design issues, the focus of design issues will be pushed MORESO than gameplay issues. If gameplay issues are not fixed well enough, a champion will be overbuffed to cover these.\n\nIF CHAMPION IS OVERBUFFED, that does not mean that the wrong fixes were applied. Sometimes it's because a middle number wasn't reached, or a prior fix was not placed into consideration over whether it fixed a champion's problems enough so that numbers would not be necessary.\n\nWITH THIS IN MIND, a playerbase focused entirely on design complaints is rendered unable to think about all balance woes and proper implementation in the game in a dedicated, motivated and civil manner. The few who were capable were obscured and it resulted in limited feedback REGARDLESS due to it being a minority, not even having to include the fact that PBE is a minority playerbase as it is already.\n\nIT IS NOT ABOUT WHO IS AT FAULT. It is about what the major complaints were. YOU ARE USING THE ENTIRETY OF THE UPDATE regardless of this chain of logic, even using it to your own ends to slander Riot over not listening to the playerbase over what was essentially a doomed update to begin with. This is NOT EXCLUSIVELY due to player opinions, but if you are asking for people to help you with something, SANDBAGS ARE NOT HELPFUL. BALANCE IS THE MAIN EMPHASIS OF THIS THREAD. BALANCE WAS NOT THE MAIN EMPHASIS OF THE JUGGERNAUT UPDATE. World's is where it was, and it had to go through this unfortunate chain of events that all happened in an EXTREMELY SHORT amount of time.\n\nI repeat, YOU ARE NOT CORRECT IN USING THE JUGGERNAUT UPDATE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR A THREAD LIKE THIS. There are plenty of others threads like for Swain, Ornn, etc. where balance dilemmas existed with many ideas of approach and no voice heard. Furthermore, the generalization of the juggernaut update as a whole demeans the process I stated and allows you to speak for a narrative that wasn't even really there for you to use to begin with for a thread such as this, especially when it was ripe with issues that had more to do with lack of time than with \"lack of player input being considered\" which you mention as a \"crucial issue.\" As I stated already, **nobody mentioned that any brakes should be placed on the updates.**\n\nIt cannot get more simple than this. If you find any of this to be false, use the same structural pattern to actually paint the picture YOU and ONLY YOU are trying to declare over the entire issue and how it relates to an Akali balance thread that merely states \"don't hotfix.\" DO NOT refer to how my crap is false. It obscures your own opinion in its totality because the full opinion/knowledge is not being stated and is why this comment chain even got this far. Most people DO NOT respond this far in, and I would hope you value your time more to be able to condense your opinion better rather than react to statements and follow another person's words.\n\nIf after all that an agreement cannot be reached over the ideas over simple dynamics such as relevance, then it is only a matter of agreeing to disagree, which I will respectfully use instead of letting this drone on forever (which is how my last conversation with you ages ago would have went).\n\n> It is impressive how wrong you are at every sentence. My initial comment here was not about design, nor did it try to pre-empt a Riot response.\n\nIt is impressive that my stubbornness is the only reason I have given you any ground to work with. People blatantly avoid arguing with you at length because it is a waste of time and you usually do fall back to accusing them of something or another. I am hoping to see something different because people like you only need a little guidance and *humbleness* to actually accomplish something for themselves. To see someone else as an equal when speaking to them, ignoring bygones and letting them be bygones, etc. It's about being a genuinely good person within discussion and being tolerant, or otherwise you push the individual to do worse. That also means forgiving past issues, which is one of the harder things about life. Everyone is only human. I do that every time I post to you. It is not about superiority, it is about actually trying to attempt for discussion.\n\nI pray that this will be the last post I have to dedicate toward your behavior in specific rather than the actual contents of your posts. Otherwise, godspeed. I do not see a reason to keep attempting toward something if I've already given it multiple chances, with a huge time gap in between at that.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-08-08T11:31:52.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirLapse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=piXb6JVU,comment-id=000300020000000100000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-08T11:08:01.783+0000)\n>\n> Hilariously incorrect.

This is NOT EXCLUSIVELY due to player opinions, but if you are asking for people to help you with something, SANDBAGS ARE NOT HELPFUL. BALANCE IS THE MAIN EMPHASIS OF THIS THREAD. BALANCE WAS NOT THE MAIN EMPHASIS OF THE JUGGERNAUT UPDATE. World&#x27;s is where it was, and it had to go through this unfortunate chain of events that all happened in an EXTREMELY SHORT amount of time.\n\nRepeating yourself in screamy capital letters will, once again, not make you any less wrong. It is hypocritical to say that \"it is not about who is at fault\" after devoting a multi-paragraph explanation of why you think the PBE playerbase is responsible for overtuning juggernauts, and it is strange that you would conflate balance and design then, yet acknowledge the two as separate in a context where that difference is not relevant. The problem here may be not so much that you implicitly conflate balance and design, but that you choose to do so when it suits you, which is arguably worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-08-09T12:19:22.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirLapse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=piXb6JVU,comment-id=00030002000000010000000000010000000000000000000000000003,timestamp=2018-08-08T19:36:24.235+0000)\n> \n> You really do only react based on quotes and make assumptions like these as though I am explicitly saying that &quot;you are saying x.&quot; Unless I am explicitly saying that you are creating an idea, saying something or I am quoting you, **I am not actually speaking with any regard to what you purely said.

Our entire discussion on the Juggernaut Update and PBE player feedback is proof that you yourself are aware of it. It is not particularly mature to feign ignorance on a matter you yourself have implicitly acknowledged already.\n\nOne who does not know how to clarify his own evidence is thinking inside his own head and assumes that others are thinking within this pattern, predicting and somehow being aware of one's own thoughts. This might be reflective of why you constantly assume everything to be right/wrong in a rather black/white fashion, but it shapes how you're being rather nonresponsive when it comes to presenting your own opinions and ideas in a much more structured and consistent fashion. You should not have to constantly refer yourself to other posts you have made without actually having to clarify what you are saying and why you are saying it. The presentation of your \"ref to evidence\" otherwise comes off as conjecture, unlike what I present which is an easy generalization that could be as easy to prove as it would be to debunk because of how broad I was being. I was and still am that confident about the information, which actually puts the burden of proof in your hands. With such a ridiculous claim, it can be proved or disproved just by reading and stating specific observations. That's the core reason why I have no need to defend myself and say you haven't really done much.\n> So the fact that many players have taken the time to give feedback on a champion is evidence that they are &quot;unmotivated&quot;? \n\nYes, I'm sure that it speaks very well to your narrative of my \"evil whims.\" Being motivated for one task does not mean you're motivated for another. This is fact.\n\nI don't know how you interact with people but \"blaming people\" and \"claiming fault\" are two different things. If we talk about preventative measures, it still falls under someone to do SOMETHING. If there was really an adequate drive to solve juggernauts instead of reject them, I don't think that update would have went as bad as it did. This undoubtedly is an opinion, but that much you should be aware of. It's an opinion constantly floating around. And you can't kill an idea.\n> Emotional what now?\n\nWorking on your sociopathy I see. If you don't have something meaningful to give, why include it in your quote list? OCD? I submit what I think matters for discussion, not proceeding on a machine gun of negativity/put downs/whatever you will call it. It's not perfect but I certainly cut it off as much as possible after some point.\n\n> I&#x27;m not switching positions whatsoever,\n\nYou are switching MY position with regard to what I am saying it and when I am saying it. There are even times where you are making the statement reflective of something I'm not even talking about. I'm pretty sure if I went into a tangent over a post but gave a quote for it, you would be genuinely baffled as to what I'd be getting at only because you are focused on reacting on singular topics and me quoting you. Where is the critical thinking happening?\n\n> I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re aware of this, SirLapse, but people don&#x27;t normally lose all sense of reason for days at a time just because they&#x27;re upset, and in fact most people don&#x27;t get continuously upset for days at a time. Your argument here is based on a very warped mentality, and as such is critically flawed.\n\nWarped mentality? You must not be aware of what kind of posts people are capable of. I see my assessment of your blind trust was correct, as you pride others much too highly on their capacities. We're only human and \"this is just a game.\" It is very easy to justify anger without logic/remorse continuously to this game. Visible even in your feedback link. And Riot reading that, how can you confidently say they did the best they could? Statistically people do WORSE with constant criticism.\n\n> If that is the case, then you are confusing what _is_ and what _ought_ to be. Just because Riot overtuned juggernauts in view of design feedback does not mean that is the course of action that should have been taken, much less the players&#x27; responsibility.\n\nBut I never said that? In fact that post even tells you straight up that I'm not telling you what *should* have happened. Where do you get these notions from my context when it is directly there in front of you that I'm saying the opposite?\n\nIf you have the potential person to make that one change, it is always going to be remembered as a missed opportunity if that person never speaks. The obscurity of well-thought posts created this impact. There is no way that the playerbase made things *easier*. It's not a fault that matters in the long run since we're already still playing this game in 2018. But it definitely matters with regard to Riot's capacity to receive good input and their willingness to consider it.\n\nRefer to Riot & playerbase in 2015 and what do we get as a comparison? A dilemma unlike the Akali rework in 2018 because mentalities have hugely shifted. Hotfixes were rarely common even after Skarner. It was the LACK of change that was the problem, now it is TOO MUCH change.\n> Where exactly did I say this? Please point to any part of my comments that claimed PBE players actively called for nerfs.\n>...In neither case am I actually talking about players giving feedback on balance or design, I&#x27;m talking about how part of the playerbase perceives other players, including PBE players, to be terrible at balancing, and so in part due to the Juggernaut Update.\n\nYou really do only react based on quotes and make assumptions like these as though I am explicitly saying that \"you are saying x.\" Unless I am explicitly saying that you are creating an idea, saying something or I am quoting you, **I am not actually speaking with any regard to what you purely said. I do not revolve around you.** You can easily read back (funny notion but I suggest it) and see that I do not even imply what you're saying. The post was about player competency, not \"you said they said x.\" I have no idea how you even get these conclusions unless you only refer to me quote by quote in an isolating fashion. That for sure would amaze me.\n> Except neither have. Up until now, Riot has hot-fixed buff new champions on an almost routine basis, despite the negative results those created, and the playerbase blamed the Boards each time. Moreover, the myth that PBE players are responsible for overtuning the juggernauts still persists to this day.\n\nThere you go again declaring that a small set of people = \"the playerbase.\" It's a generally true statement because they play the game, but it's not a \"real\" truth in the sense that many people see it that way. It's a falsehood hidden behind a partial truth, and it does create a narrative whether you intended for it or not.\n\nAnd it was no myth that buffs were asked for, seen even within that PBE thread you linked. Mostly applies to Skarner, not Morde who broke the game. I already mentioned the dynamic so it's really up to you as how \"core\" negativity was with regard to said buffs vs. people coming right out and saying it. And crucial to note, the latter isn't the only way people receive feedback.\n> You seem to be confusing the word &quot;hindsight&quot; with the word &quot;anachronism&quot;. We are certainly both using hindsight to evaluate the chronology of the Juggernaut Update, but you are trying to create a narrative that relies on these events being out of sequence, which makes strictly no sense.\n>You&#x27;re skipping a few steps though, and deliberately so...\n\nIt's out of sequence how exactly? I'm stuck responding to you so I'm not constantly restating it. Are you sure it's not you who is not keeping proper track of it?\n\nSkarner rework > negativity collecting > PBE feedback limited. Stonewall video reflective of discontent. Your own thread linked was used as the ending portion of that small timeline. Reddit thread used as a primary gauge for the uncertainty behind juggernauts. The only significantly visual opinion of them was that they were strong in general or in x situation. Otherwise I gauged live and how it boiled up to World's, an event that was pretty spaced out from the reworks and had plenty of time to get fixed (even in hindsight). I didn't adjust dates or even mention them, using the context with the assumption you'd correlate the reference to the specific date. Disappointingly you did not. If you were going to say I'm out of order in any regard, USE ACTUAL DATES. It should be common sense that you're not supposed to drone on about anything other than the facts if the problem is with the facts themselves.\n\nAnyway to conclude, the entire way that patch was handled was much worse vs. present day. The playerbase did not have *enough* potential to fix it at the time, nor did Riot really give that potential after Skarner. This is Akali. The situation is blatantly different. It would be superior to refer to threads about not hotfixing, not juggernaut patch which only promoted one specific hotfix and no major changes, the direct opposite of \"frequent hotfixes.\" It even had the obvious premise of being before world's \"so we can't drastically change the game.\" They shouldn't even be placed on the same level for how player feedback is/was received.

This can be an improvement for the benefit of the player, or just a movement of numbers to support a playstyle.

Sure, the nature of the complaints players made were different, but that wasn't what I discussed. Instead, I discussed how these players have been perceived, and the perception for both is the same. Many players mistakenly think the Boards advocate hotfix-buffs, just as those players believe PBE players advocated overtuning juggernauts. You yourself believed this at the start of this argument.

It doesn&#x27;t seem like you understand how burden of proof works.\n\nYou presented the claim as though there was evidence to speak for it. My argument is that you have no evidence to prove it is relevant. And in this discussion, you have proven that you are incapable of being mature enough to even present the simplest of evidence toward your claims. There is not even a single reference to something that resembles the evidence you argue that you somehow have by linking the thread you gave. Oh, sorry. There is if you make a gigantic, oversimplified generalization of it by declaring them to be \"complaints not listened to.\"\n\nI'm referring to the majority of those posts here Teridax. If you go read reddit, that very link you gave, the youtube video I gave, etc. you will find similar complaints of the same degree regardless of it being a feedback thread. By nature of the process I gave, naturally that means balance is inhibited by an unmotivated, unsatisfied community that has built up negativity and nothing really there to filter in the best possible information, especially on a public setting.\n\n> Interesting that you would try to lecture me about conciseness and relevance to the main topic of discussion in a bloated paragraph that possesses neither quality.\n\nBloated? More like loaded. It is a compilation of the mess of posts that have accumulated thus far. That is about as concise as you can get without dipping the actual value. But I can see your apathy in the face of that and it puts to question if you feign concern over any topic if you cannot see the emotional value of a post.\n> So you&#x27;ve implicitly admitted that you are wrong, and that these people exist, rendering your entire line of argumentation across this entire thread moot. QED. Trying to change the discussion on whether or not these people matter will not change this fact.\n\nFor the sake of your narrative yes. Situationally I would be wrong, except I wasn't wrong within the context you used. You always switch positions for what I'm referring to and assume it's a response to what *you* are referring to. It's like you're talking with yourself rather than me talking to you. I thought it'd be much easier to admit wrong somewhere to appease you, but it seems that you're only in this for the personal satisfaction and self-validation. And that's not in my jurisdiction to be fixing or addressing past this point.\n\n> Then why use Stonewall&#x27;s video as an example of how he felt _after_ being released on Live, or even just after his buffs? \n\nSo you're saying that you've immediately gotten over all forms of negativity in your life, and that everyone else you know has done so, and that board members even here have done so within 6 days? Within 6 months?\n\nThe point in this is about the general idea of how the complaints existed before balancing ever started. It is what allows the response I am making to you; the fact that the design choice largely motivated those complaints. Yet here you are using it as a reference to a balancing thread...it is inappropriate to say the least of it.\n\n> Why? Why does frustration on a champion&#x27;s design have to entail overtuning them? Once again, you&#x27;re trying to invent a narrative here that makes strictly no sense here.\n\nWhy does it? I'm not here to tell you that it *should* Teridax. But that's exactly how it happened. My entire point is that you're using a narrative that implies the community was actively trying to stop something like that, when their concerns were quite literally focused on everything BUT balance until World's hit. Generalizing the entire topic demeans the value of this occurrence, because both the community and Riot learned from it, though obviously we cannot say how much was learned on either side. It doesn't need to make logical sense, since it's all history now. Humans have made irrational decisions multiple times in history, and this is no different.\n> If the &quot;middle number&quot; is the actual fix, then by definition overbuffing champions is not fixing them. Your point holds no water.\n\nDo you remember the word hindsight? I was using it toward that end. Balance is sometimes not achieved from something as simple as that middle number, but sometimes it is. I am not declaring what the specific issue was, since there are nigh infinite opportunities to balance a champion based on these values.\n> Once again, all of the verbiage you&#x27;ve just dumped can resume itself to just one sentence: by your rationale, players who focused on design criticism, rather than balance criticism, are at fault for the Juggernaut Update, because Riot didn&#x27;t have many direct references to work with and overtuned champions as a result. As mentioned numerous times above, that reasoning simply does not work, as ultimately Riot made the final decision, and should not have conflated balance with design, unlike you. Repeating yourself will not make you any less wrong on the matter.\n\nThey are not at fault for the Juggernaut update, only the complaints that led to the overtuning itself. The update was plagued by numerous issues, but the key here is not just that the players were at fault for (what was at the time) an expected response. It's that they didn't have real usable feedback with regard to pre-release and even moreso didn't have suggestions to put these champions on a better level of balance. When Mordekaiser could no longer solo lane and he didn't work out as a champion, we saw complaints for this and attempts at fixes for this. But where were most of these complaints for Skarner, for Garen? For those that had functional kits but needed fine tuned numbers somewhere in their kit/character?\n\nThese kinds of statements cannot be summarized into one sentence for your own convenience. That is a put down inherently to the other person's statements.\n\nAs I stated already, the community is certainly trying here for Akali. That does not mean it was the case during the Juggernaut update for that time period even if it is reflected as a time period that players were not really listened to.\n> **and it is strange that you would conflate balance and design then, yet acknowledge the two as separate in a context where that difference is not relevant.** \n\nWhen the primary acting mechanism of my response is dependent on which word is being used and for what reason, that is a pretty huge declaration to be making.\n\nIf you make a complaint about the amount of sugar in your tea, this is an ultra-specific complaint dedicated to making yourself have good tea. The problem is with how the tea was made. If you want to make adjustments, knowing how the tea was made and knowing what affects taste allows you to figure out what is best for you. You cannot have the same tea if everything is not consistent however.\n\nIf you make a complaint because you received tea at all, then arguably no tea is good enough.\n\nA customer has the right to choose what they want to drink unless it is out of stock. But it is undeniable that these are two different arguments that only act under the same platform that \"something must be served to the customer.\"\n\nIf you make a balance complaint, you want a champion that fundamentally acts the same but is being applied in a different way. This can be an improvement for the benefit of the player, or just a movement of numbers to support a playstyle. You are not essentially asking for a different champion, but if you want to contribute significantly, you need to check the amount of information you currently possess and work under some assumptions if you change those very numbers. And like with the tea, you need consistency.\n\nIf you make a design complaint, you want a different champion essentially. Everything above has basically been tossed out the door in favor of wanting that different champion.\n\nThese ARE NOT the same kinds of complaints. Even you had to agree that design shifts were desirable for Garen, and Skarner's reception was one of the worst this game has ever seen. But what cannot be ignored is that these complaints are not like \"fixing the tea.\" There was not much given with regard to balance for the juggernauts, and the playerbase was not actively there to figure out why or how to fix it.\n\nThe Akali complaint is similar to the balancing complaints we've seen for other champions. Overbuffing before people figure out the champion in specific. This is not the same kind of complaint as the Juggernaut update, yet is the foothold of your narrative. I'm sure you haven't forgotten what you typed in the opening response to this thread.\n\nBy deeming that the difference is not relevant, you've effectively misunderstood the grand majority of these posts. You've jumped to accusing me of lying when you don't even know what lying is (which is an intentionally false statement, which literally has set the tone between you and me for months), declared posts incoherent/incorrect when you don't even truly know or understand the angle of approach, and even went so far as to say that I'm typing to conflate to topics when the ENTIRE set of responses was set on SEPARATING the two and making it known that you are in fact the one conflating it to fit your narrative.\n\nPeople make mistakes all the time Teridax. But not only are you averse to thinking you've made mistakes (which tells me from experience that you might be self-conscious about it), you also are quick to judge others. I greatly suggest that you consider setting out some time to go to group talks and boost your experience of speaking with others. God bless you and have a nice day.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-08-08T11:49:04.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirLapse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=piXb6JVU,comment-id=000300020000000100000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-08T11:08:01.783+0000)\n> \n> I repeat, YOU ARE NOT CORRECT IN USING THE JUGGERNAUT UPDATE AS AN EXAMPLE FOR A THREAD LIKE THIS.

You are doing the same here. \"Agree to disagree\" only works when one is operating on a fundamentally different set of axioms, and has no bearing on a discussion meant to revolve around facts, not to mention a linear concept of time. Used in improper context, it is but a cowardly tactic to attempt to save face when one has lost an argument, and is unwilling to admit it.

People blatantly avoid arguing with you at length because it is a waste of time and you usually do fall back to accusing them of something or another.

To see someone else as an equal when speaking to them, ignoring bygones and letting them be bygones, etc. It&#x27;s about being a genuinely good person within discussion and being tolerant, or otherwise you push the individual to do worse.

It is impressive that you would accuse me of arguing at length, be guilty of the exact same, and not see the hypocrisy in your character attacks here.

Moreover, if you conflate a champion feeling bad and them being statistically weak, that is entirely your own problem, and if Riot were to have used that as the basis for overbuffing champions, that is their own fault.

Moving on.\n> Yet again, your verbose paragraph makes strictly no point. Of course the feedback was workable,\n\nProof? I told you to read those threads for a reason. Barely any of it was strictly dedicated to using number shifts to balance Skarner (and every other juggernaut). I'm actually pretty amazed at how nobody thought to nerf Mordekaiser's dragon's health, among other possible changes. But regardless, you're acting on evidence that doesn't exist, either because you haven't noted where this supposed feedback was or simply are fabricating it for your own convenience due to blind trust in the playerbase.\n\nI explicitly told you to go look for the information, and what did you do? Attack me for somehow not doing the same. I read the posts. It's about validity over reading comprehension skills at this point and not about mentioning singular posts that commit to a narrative. Or are you blind and didn't see me repeat that a bunch of times?\n\n> It is ironic that you would accuse me of not reading your posts properly when the problem stems from you doing exactly that.

There is literally no spin you can put on your arguments here that play in your favor.\n\nIf the Riot company is to rely on the playerbase in any regard for the feedback and fine tuning of a champion, then it's quite wrong to say that they entirely held the fault. But even here you blatantly once again change perspectives by saying that you are \"not assuming the playerbase has no fault\" but directly state Riot screwed up on their own...\n\nVery nice consistency. I like it. ?XD\n\n> Once again, you are dodging the point, and once again, you are lashing out with a personal attack.\n\nYou've made more personal attacks and defended against more nonexistent attacks than anyone else I've seen on these boards. Maybe that has more to do with the fact that I'm one of the only people who actively responds to your posts with disagreements, but I still find it rare to find people as jumpy as you are on the notion of \"personal attacks.\" Once again. Unnecessary tangent focused on \"defending yourself.\"\n\nI used your very same linked thread and didn't find the balance posts relevant enough toward saying that the community was set on balancing anything properly on the champion. You have yet to really direct me (or anyone else for that matter) to where that kind of feedback was submitted and don't respect at what quantity it was ever really received in. And no, design complaints don't count (can't believe I have to explicitly say that when it should be common sense).

First you accused me of lying by saying that the PBE players were to blame for overtuning juggernauts during their update\n\nSkarner was the example, not juggernauts. Do not pick out information to your own convenience. Furthermore, lying is a strong word. I stated the entire dynamic and how I thought about it, and the fault was not 100% player-oriented if you even ATTEMPT to read over my posts. You continuously show that you let your emotions get the best of you, decreasing the actual sensibility of your posts to the point of attacking people on arguments they didn't even make.\n\n>then you tried to weasel your way out by saying they were still responsible because they didn&#x27;t focus exclusively on balance feedback,\n\nNo, that was the main emphasis and still is my emphasis. it's what makes the entire issue irrelevant to Akali's balancing dilemma i.e. this thread.\n\n> now you&#x27;re trying to save face yet again by telling me &quot;it&#x27;s not about who screwed up&quot;,\n\nHell yeah.

This is something PBE players have been asked to test for, yet it is feedback that is often completely disregarded, or in the case of the Juggernaut Update, sidestepped via inappropriate developer tuning. Once again, you are trying to shift the conversation away from the topic of how players and their opinions are perceived, while still trying to justify blaming players for League&#x27;s current balance.\n\nI really think you're oversimplifying this entire dynamic, especially with regard to the state of the game. If they're trying to release a balanced Akali, using PBE MMR means that the more skilled players at the game will automatically win more than unskilled players, regardless of champion usage. Feedback on PBE throughout threads of the last 3 years (which I wish I was joking about) have not been of high balancing value. I made an argument over Kindred that was relevant and didn't get listened to, woohoo. There are plenty of other examples for that but they're very widespread and usually on bigger, Riot-headed threads. People on the PBE are not going to get the most realistic game experience compared to live due to this MMR issue, so the idea of playing the champion is going to ALWAYS have the cloud of \"did I do well, and did it feel good to do well\" instead of \"ok this design has flaws in x, y, and z matchup despite the fact that it should be strong in them.\"\n\nAnd lastly, I'm not blaming players for anything of the current balance. You can quote me on where you'd find that, and you won't find it unless it's neatly out of context and ripe for your abuse. You are waaaaay too invested in trying to assume I'm automatically wrong at all points, making you assume these false ideas because you don't like me. Am I to take that sitting down or something? This is exactly what happened in the Ryze/Cass dilemma before, and if you're just going to go the same pattern to the point of dedicating your posts to (once again) ad hominem and readjusting narratives to your own convenience, then you should really rethink your life decisions.

When every Juggernaut Update, save for Darius's, is largely regarded as a favor?

I like it. ?XD\n\nHow so? Ultimately, if Riot are the ones making the decisions, they are the ones responsible for the decisions they make. It's not that hard to understand. I did say the playerbase isn't blameless, because you will always find people who give completely inaccurate or unworkable feedback, but that is not what the bulk of the feedback on those PBE threads was.

Unnecessary tangent focused on &quot;defending yourself.&quot;\n\nSpeaking of unnecessary tangents, this is one where you yet again focus exclusively on attacking my character and defending yourself, while accusing me of the same.

My \"narrative\" is based on simple logic and evidence here, and it is you who are trying to foist a narrative here by creating some imaginary separation between how players are perceived on here and how they were post-Juggernaut Update.
