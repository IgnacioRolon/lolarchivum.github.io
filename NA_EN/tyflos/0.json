This is both at home, on my desktop, and in my dorm on college campus, on my laptop. Both places use different ISPs, so I am curious as to what caused this (minor) increase in ping.\r\n\r\nIt's not that big of a deal, but the lower I can get it the better. I went from 14 ping to about 25 (again not that bad).\r\n\r\nI asked my friend who lives nearby, and he said his ping stayed the same. Anyone have any insight to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T02:31:06.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Latency increases are often caused by routing changes along the way to the server. It's likely both your dorm and college campus networks partner with the same backbone providers to get your connection to the servers. I'd recommend [running a traceroute log](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) and reaching out to them about this.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
