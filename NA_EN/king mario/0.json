And quit saying \"riot fix riot fix\" like they are gonna drop everything they are doing this sec and drop down to your needs and fix it and if they do fix it (Which they will) it will take more then just a few mins prob a few hours knowing riot.  In short its just a video game go get a life being off the game for a few hours or maybe the rest of the night isn't gonna KILL YOU.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WizzMcFly","date":"2014-10-28T17:39:39.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"****Same thing happened to me last night.

This sometimes happens when the server thinks you're still in a game when you aren't and is commonly referred to as a \"ghost game.\" While there isn't anything you can do personally to resolve this issue yourself, it does go away when the server updates the status of your account (which can take upwards of an hour sometimes).\n\nI would say, give the servers time to update after the issue that disconnected some players earlier and see if your match history is accurate afterwards. I can't personally guarantee that you will receive the LP you earned for that match or not since I'm not a Rioter and I don't have access to the internal tools they all use. But I can say that your account won't be stuck like this forever, just give it time to update.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shanekeen","date":"2014-10-28T04:35:00.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar issue.
