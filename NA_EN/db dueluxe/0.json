The lag I experience is only in champ select and its getting frustrating because now I'm blocked for 30 mins from que.

Everything seems to be set on my end, the issue only comes up after the queue pops and i'm put into champion select I'll get kicked from the lobby with a message \"There's been an error with the champion select, you've been put back into queue.\" at which point I receive the penalty for dodging. This can happen once a night or multiple times a night with no real pattern.\n\nE: I attached a screenshot of what happens when this glitch occurs, [as it happened once again ](http://i.imgur.com/Wds3sDg.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-01T20:16:40.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely don't want you to keep getting dodge penalties when you aren't leaving purposefully!
