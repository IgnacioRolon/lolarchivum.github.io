But what I love about masks is that they often reveal more than they obscure. The lines, the craftsmanship, the material that they're made of. A mask can be more than just a disguise or a symbol. It can be the window through which the world is perceived. Those who view the world through masks can often have very skewed views, like Guy Faux and V.\n\nI always like to think of the example of Ben Kenobi's discussion about perspective with Luke on Degobah in Return of The Jedi.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf206105905","date":"2016-01-07T12:53:33.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guy Fawkes* i think.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2016-01-07T15:34:27.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw shucks.","replies":[{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2016-01-07T17:40:15.884+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's ok...not like it is a faux pas.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2016-01-07T20:04:57.985+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see what you did there...I see what you did and I like it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2016-01-06T21:38:30.375+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reminds me of Shaco. {{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheBestWorstPlyr","date":"2016-01-07T00:20:18.642+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valaran Nara,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=pzzdnTzW,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-06T21:38:30.375+0000)\n>\n> Reminds me of Shaco. {{champion:35}}\n\nI didn't know that Shaco has a brother","replies":[{"poster":"PÃ¦an","date":"2016-01-07T01:14:24.651+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just his clone with a new disguise :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HexaDecimel","date":"2016-01-06T21:42:43.534+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope he turns out to be a somewhat psycho adc from piltover.
