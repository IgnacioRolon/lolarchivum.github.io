I'm sure most all of you. its annoying when it happens and you get that pit feeling in your gut that this game is going to be horrible. Many of the players are fussing now and no one wants to play. unfortunately you are stuck here because leaving gives you time penalties and drops your points in ranked play or even worse counts as a loss for your promos. well this is an idea to help cut back on being trapped in troll gaming. \r\n\r\nThe suggestion is that a surrender vote could be an option during champion select. Works just like the one in the game requiring a majority of the votes to end the game. This could help many players from being trapped into a miserable game due to one players sour attitude and game play. If the surrender vote is started and only 2 players vote yes then you are stuck to play or leave and take the penalties. \r\n\r\nI know this wont solve all the trolling but it is a good start to getting a better moral going with players in game and a nice nip towards some of the champion select issues occurring now.","replies":[{"poster":"Raritits","date":"2015-01-11T14:58:25.812+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if they seem to be trolls, most people would be reluctant to surrender since they still have a chance of winning even with the troll in their game. In my experience, people seldom surface as trolls/toxic players until something bad happens in game, whether it be a bad play, losing lane, etc.\n\nWith that out of the way, here's a scenario providing my above statement is horribly incorrect:\n\nLet's say we have \"less than optimal\" example of synergy in champ select. Four players just can't get along for whatever reason. The fifth player is a minority who wants to stick it out. He's willing to cooperate and be positive but the other 4 can't seem to get along so they opt to surrender. Right from the start that optimistic minority was screwed and is going to lose LP/promos simply because he was unlucky. He didn't even have a chance to play in game. There would be no way to circumvent this as removing the surrender penalty would enable such a feature to be abused when one team is in a strategic disadvantage during champ select. Forgot to ban Rek'Sai and blue team first picked her? Entire team counterpicked? Bad team composition? \"LOLSURRENDERGG\"\n\n\nOverall, I feel like this would just enable/encourage the tendency to give up early on. It's a serious optimism killer. I for one get somewhat pissed when a teammate gives up prematurely and completely demolishes team morale. What if a minority of the team attempts to surrender in champ select? We're already setting the mood right from the start. Those messages in the loading screen (\"People who don't blame their teammates win 30% more games\" or something like that) are there for a reason. Being subjected to this negativity or pessimism has drastic results on individual performance. Ideally, you want to go into the game with a clean slate with these new people you've just met and build the experience from there. First impressions are everything. Having a feature like this just sitting in front of us can so easily incite early conflict. \"THIS IDIOT LOCKED IN *insert suboptimal champ/position* GG SURRENDER\"\n\n\n\nI've been sitting here for an hour trying to organize my jumbled mess of thoughts on this topic. Let me know if I made some of my arguments confusing or unclear.","replies":[{"poster":"Devious Anarchy","date":"2015-01-11T20:27:08.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like what youre saying here and understood!","replies":[]},{"poster":"imonly4noobcakes","date":"2015-01-11T15:17:47.345+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've never had that game where the start trolling from the get go???

People seldom consider that they might be actually screwing someone else over with what seems like a harmless, good action for them.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-11T20:30:28.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Implementing an effective way to deal with pre-game trolls is important.

It would create way more fighting than it would solve, everyone thinks they know better than everyone else. \n\nI'm not sure how new you are to ranked but if you remember a season or two ago when you could ditch a ranked team in champ select with very little penalty it took 5 Queues to start a game because people would bail at the slightest hint of bad attitudes or bad team comps.  Solo Q is what it is, you're playing with a team of randoms, expect them to act like it.  If you don't wan't trolls play team 5s, you know how the game is meant to be played.","replies":[{"poster":"Devious Anarchy","date":"2015-01-11T20:33:15.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well that's why it would take a majority or otherwise take the penalties, im sure it would result is some abuse as all good things do. On the other hand most people are just as anxious as me to get into the game so not everyone would abuse the system.  to me, it would be nice to get out of the ridiculous games i get pinned into but that's got some to do with im not a hard core carrying player so without and team synergy it tends to fall apart. i do carry some games but i dont carry every game nor can i, so if i can find a way to better off my team from the start ill try too!","replies":[]}]}]}
