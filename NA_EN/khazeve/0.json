The other day, when he opened his pc and tried to play league, he couldn't connect to his rank game he was trying to play. After his team made a remake, he tried another time and yet couldn't connect to the game. He has try in custom game and it doesn't seem to work either... This is really disturbing, because we really want to keep playing with eachother. We've tried a couple of things. We know the problem does not come from his account, since he can play normaly on my pc and we know the problem is not his internet connection because I can still play normally on my pc and we live in the same house. So of course, we figured that the problem is coming from is own pc. But what can we do to fix this? he didn't change any settings on his computer, this all happened randomly when he opened it... (By the way, restarting the computer doesn't work at all)\r\n\r\np.s : I know some of you would say to uninstall/reinstall, but our download speed is really... REALLY slow. It would take like 2 days to install it back on his pc and that would limit other poeple in the house. So I'm making this post to try to fix the problem without uninstalling league.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-25T00:00:24.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your brother able to play without issue if it's just him playing?  There could very well be issues specific to his PC, and we have steps to help with that!  Go over the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help.  Hopefully that will help get him back in game, but make sure to have him test it in customs.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
