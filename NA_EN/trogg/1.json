Her Arcade skin got an awesome sound effect to match. As you can see in the linked video, there were** two sounds**, a primary and an alternate. **First blip, then bloop**. As of 5.23 (I think), however, **there is only one sound**. First blip, then...blip. \r\n\r\nHow to reproduce this bug:\r\n1. Play Arcade Miss Fortune.\r\n2. Attack something, then something else.\r\n3. Blip, bloop.\r\n\r\nPlease, reblip the bloop. Or rebloop the blip, if you prefer. I can&#039;t tell you how mellifluous the second sound was, and how demoralizing it is to only hear the current one after experiencing the skin in all of its former glory.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-29T22:10:33.959+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're working on it. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Deal With It","date":"2016-03-29T22:19:01.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I remember reading a similar reply from you about 4 months ago. \nIs this close to being fixed / something I can look forward to in the next patch or two?\n\nCan you give us the lowdown? :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-30T16:05:21.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR, this was resolved when initially brought up, but had come back.

With that being said, lets talk about (Arcade) Miss Fortune. From a marketing standpoint, she's the star of the show. She's a great champion. When we look at the way she's portrayed in promotional media, lore, and art in game we know a few things about her.\n\nShe's Sexy.\nShe's a Bounty Hunter.\nShe's Dangerous .\nShe's a good Friend.\nHer body seems to be comprised of about 95% love.\n\nAlmost all of her art reflects this. She's got cool skins: http://i.imgur.com/cMcn5X1.jpg\n\nShe's got fun poses:\nhttp://imgur.com/7g2ILVH\n\nShe's got amazing recall animations:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5uG-1ZZQI8\n\nAll of this art reinforces the great character you've built around Miss Fortune.\n\nThen out of seemingly no where we have this bug:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahP7HhoaOnI\n\nWHAT? What about this bug has anything to do with the character you're building in Miss Fortune? It's not sexy, it's not dangerous, it has nothing to do with being a bounty hunter. It just reduces Arcade Miss Fortune to another bland skin. \n\nWe aren't looking at an Azir skin here, this isn't a character who is in part defined by spaghetti code. This bug says to the player base, oh we've got all these cool diverse champions, but at any moment we are willing to reduce them to defective, bugged skins to help boost our investment game. \n\nFixing bugs in a triple A game isn't a small task, it has to go through an implementer, a team lead, a sound director, and a creative director. This is a team effort. And I believe the team is responsible for upholding the great example League of Legends can set to the rest of the industry for creating excellent skins.\n\nI have a young daughter that everyday when I wake up wants to watch the recall animation again. She knows who Miss Fortune is, and as she grows up, she can grow up alongside these champions. \n\nWhat I'm asking is that as you continue to add to the League cast and investment elements, you double down on your commitment to fixing bugged skins. You've been doing a good job so far, but shipping with a Miss Fortune bug like this undermines so much of the good you've already done.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deal With It","date":"2016-03-29T21:58:12.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Riot Team,\n\nI've seen posts for this before and this bug, unfortunately, seems to keep getting swept under the carpet. The bug exists and is confirmed. You can see it clearly in the video. \n\nAs someone who purchased the skin, it's frustrating to know that I have a defective product (that used to work fine before a patch broke it!). \n\n**Can someone from Riot at least reply to state whether the bug will be addressed or ignored indefinitely? **\n\n\nThanks in advance,\nM","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-30T16:56:41.226+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nWe have established that this was a bug in several threads. We are going to address it. However, this isn't a gamebreaking bug, which is why it isn't our highest priority in terms of resolving it. That isn't to say that it won't be fixed, because we are working on a fix, however, something like Jhin's (Q) not properly bouncing would take priority over something like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Deal With It","date":"2016-03-31T22:55:15.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As with any development, there will always be the backlog of bugs and features to work on.\nHopefully this bug can (finally) make it into one of the upcoming sprints / releases. :)\n\nThanks for the reply.
