The Arcade MIss Fortune skin initially had two sounds for Love Tap, a primary and an alternate. **Blip, bloop**. As of patch 5.23 (and every patch since), the first sound stopped playing. **Bloop, bloop**. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve posted this on the bug report forums a few times, but I&#039;m not sure if this is a bug or an intentional design choice at this point. I know it was considered a bug many months ago, but since it hasn&#039;t been fixed, I&#039;m thinking Riot changed their minds. I greatly miss blip, however, and would prefer its return.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s a video with the comparison of the original and the changed version. https://youtu.be/beHrgJYdcPs","replies":[{"poster":"RiotKarateMonkey","date":"2016-10-27T20:35:00.275+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the helpful video.  I wish all my bug reports were like this.  I found the missing blip sfx and it will be reunited with its bloop sfx SOON.  I image by the next patch.  If you have any more audio bug related issues or this doesn't get fixed please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
