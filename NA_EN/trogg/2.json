As you can see in the Skin Spotlights video, there were two sounds, a primary and an alternate. First blip, then bloop. As of 5.23 (I think), however, there is only one sound. First blip, then...blip. You can hear this here: https://youtu.be/9GuzkKp7xqs\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce this bug:\r\n\r\n1. Play Arcade Miss Fortune.\r\n2. Attack something, then something else.\r\n3. Blip, bloop.","replies":[{"poster":"iHerring","date":"2015-12-09T03:07:07.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reblip the bloop!\n\nI had noticed this as well but I figured it was part of the ongoing Arcade vs regular MF and Arcade MF vs Cait SFX bugs.\nHave these been fixed?

The bug is two blips instead of 1 blip and 1 bloop.","replies":[{"poster":"iHerring","date":"2015-12-09T03:14:35.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did consider that, but blip -> bloop sounded better in my head.","replies":[{"poster":"Deal With It","date":"2015-12-09T03:18:39.293+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But make the noise aloud.
