Clearly, that is happening on an individual basis.\n\nThe login screen, for example. I have the Elementalist Lux login \"installed\" (replaced 4 files, duh) on the legacy one, but the new client shows the...I dunno, assassin rework login?\n**How can I replace the login screen in the new client?** \nAnd can I still use the .swf-logins of old? I really want the Quinn login to work again. That one is beautiful!\n\nCustom champion splash arts. The legacy one displays what has been replaced, but the new one only shows the official ones.\n**Where are the splash arts for the new client stored?**\n\nCustom itemsets. I have the .properties file with the custom ones in the \"preferences\" folder in the legacy install folder, but what is \"ItemSets.json\" located in the config folder located just under the main install location? It clearly is the same file, but it doesn't appear be an updated one.\n**Is ItemSets.json the custom itemset file that is read by the new client? **\n_If it is, that would explain why my custom itemsets when using the new client feels like...missing something._\n\nIf the code in the itemset file was arranged properly, aka downwards, I could work with it manually. It'd be a hazzle, but one that I'd heartily take.\n\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Like so</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\nPLEASE!!\n    </body>\n</html>\n\nWith all the code sideways...\n\n{\"timeStamp\":1479639544029,\"itemSets\":[{\"sortrank\":4,\"mode\":\"any\",\"isGlobalForMaps\":true,\"type\":\"global\",\"isGlobalForChampions\":true,\"title\":\n\n...I'd be needing a lot of sanity potions. :(\n\n---------\n\nAnd is modifying game.cfg still working with the new client?
