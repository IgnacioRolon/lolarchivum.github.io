It was my first win of the day and I was supposed to get 263 but got 0. I don't think this is the first time this has happened to me but I've never been certain before. The only reason why I'm certain now is because I'm at 4715 IP and I was going to grab a 4800 champ after the game but couldn't because I didn't get any.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T01:41:32.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you leave or disconnect during that match?
