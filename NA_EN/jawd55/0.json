I had just shown my pick intent and as the timer switched over to indicate ban phase, boom. Bugsplat. When I logged back in I had a queue timer and had lost 3 lp. I get that this happens when people dodge by closing their client themselves, but because of a bugsplat? Seriously? Not only is it not in my control, what happened isn't even associated with me. It's because of the client. Really having a hard time understanding this because Riot has a way to know when someone bugsplatted, it even has the option to send in error reports. If someone bugsplats in the champion select screen they shouldn't lose lp and have a queue timer. Doesn't make sense to punish people for a client crash especially when there is a verifiable report so you know it wasn't me just dodging.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-02T01:57:43.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, the client doesn't actually have the ability to tell *why* you disconnected, only that you're no longer connected to the game/lobby. Getting a bugsplat is heckin' frustrating that's for sure, and in my experience, it's really good to start troubleshooting after the first time to try and resolve whatever caused it so you don't get any unneeded penalties. \n\nIf you saw any specific errors during that crash, please send those my way so I have more info to work with, but until then try running a repair through the client options (if you haven't yet). It'd also be a good move to double check both your graphics drivers and DirectX drivers as well.","replies":[{"poster":"jawd55","date":"2018-02-02T21:25:28.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just happened again, no specific error pop up, just a bug splat report screen asking for info about what happened, both times happened as it switched from one phase of champ select to another. First time was from pick intent to ban phase, this time was from ban phase to actual pick phase. Doing a full client repair, my drivers are all up to date.","replies":[]}]}]}
