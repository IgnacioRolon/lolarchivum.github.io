I am using a MacBook Pro to play and i live in Australia and recently i got a NA PBE account by registering. It all went well and i downloaded the game. The shops are working as usual but whenever i try to start a game, my screen just turns white and a few seconds later, it pops out something saying: my connection had an error, retry or cancel. I tried everything i could but it would not work. I know that playing NA PBE overseas is going to be really laggy but no one mentioned that it won't open the game, so if anyone can help me, i will be highly appreciated.\r\n                                    ThankYou\r\n  {{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T18:39:40.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This white screen is usually caused by a connection issue failing to download assets or reach the game server.

Oceania uses the same client as NA and other Riot supported regions.  This shouldn't impact you unless you're using an unsupported or modified client.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
