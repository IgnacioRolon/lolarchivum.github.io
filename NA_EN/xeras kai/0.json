(sorry for being a noob but I've only been playing for less than a month)\r\nis there some kind of rule where only one member can carry or something? I don't know how to carry a game because I'm not very good. I main Ashe because she has a beginner skill cap but very good map presence (plus, I liked her backstory in the comics). As far as I know, there are five players:\r\none jungle,\r\none top lane, usually melee\r\none mid (I assume top, mid and jungle gets to soak up more exp during early game)\r\nthen, there's the bottom + support duo. I usually pick bottom since I prefer ranged and I welcome anyone who shares the lane with me be it support or not. \r\n\r\nso, this one guy (with the attitude of an infant) threatened to AFK after I locked in to ashe because no one called dibs on bot lane. he carried the game in the end which was what he intended to do. I played the game by supporting the team which was what I intended to do. So is there something about LOL roles etiquette that a nood like me should be aware of? (especially during MSI a lot of players are in a very competitive mood while I just want to have fun)","replies":[{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2019-05-11T04:04:50.629+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just like in basketball, you don't expect the point guard to fight it out under the basket, or in hockey, you expect the goalie to stay back, protecting the goal, different champions favor different roles.\n\nYes, Ashe _can_ fill a support role, but most people expect her to fill the ADC.

It is not meta and it is not optimal, but it is not entirely impossible. Miss Fortune support is a better choice, in my opinion, if you want to play an ADC that is a support.\n\nHowever, you mentioned that you wanted to carry as well but are bad at it.\nThe roles in League are not entirely hard-set as Riot has really mixed things up a lot over the last year (and do so randomly as well). However, in general, if you have two players actively trying to play carries (not carry and support-carry) in bot lane, you will lose hard. CS cannot be divided evenly and thus you will not have the gold required to keep up with an enemy ADC getting all the gold.\n\nMeta is far less important at the very beginning but learning to play properly should start from the beginning. Mind, I do not mean properly in the sense that you have to pick top-tier champions. Quite the contrary, I would suggest the easier champions so you can get used to laning, trading and CSing and understand the basic matchups and such.\n\nIgnore the flaming people. If you are are flaming a new player you are just terrible anyway.\n\nI would strongly suggest to try out some champions as you can, pick up 1 or 2 and focus them as much as you can and it will help a ton.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-05-11T11:25:11.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Btw, just to let you know that there is no official thing as \"calling dibs\".
