Just a noob in his first week playing. Go easy on him.\nNone of these \"problems\" will be problems once you get out of noob-tier and learn a bit.\n\n\nPantheon:  cant block 4 attacks in a row.\nRengar: Armor pen. also you probably fed him. It is definitely not a bug.\nYasuo players: i get your point here, but you are crying just as hard as they do.\nTeemo: He is a great champ that you apparently have never seen played properly (unsurprising, given your apparent MMR and his reputation).\nGragas: Yes, he is annoying, but more than hecarim, riven, lee, zac?\nSivir: HAD a rework quite recently, but probably before you started playing.. Her winrates are fine.\nTrue damage: You got wrecked by a fed vayne, right? That happens in skill matchups, when someone tries to blame mechanics and bugs instead of their own lack of skill.\n","replies":[{"poster":"FeXUyzmL4l","date":"2016-08-01T22:50:16.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sigh, if you're an experienced league player as you clearly want to try and portray yourself to be, then you'd know these third party stats sites are mostly garbage. I'm level 20 on this account currently and i've had various level 30 accounts in the past over the years, so you can stop making assumptions. And none of these champions I mentioned win lane or do well because of 'skill', true damage needs to be removed entirely, vayne is indeed a perfect example of why. Or maybe Garen or Darius, or the various others that delete people with it.","replies":[{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-08-02T00:58:37.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon can very easily lose lane due to poor skill if he mis manages his resources against an opponent that builds to fight pantheon instead of rushing straight damage.  Plus his ult requires a veeeery good understanding of battle flow or you just end up telegraphing/hanging in the wind.\n\nGragas also requires skill.  Sure he can be mobile as hell but a bad ult will do more damage than help and using Q to the max requires practice.\n\nYou want a low skill champ?  Singed, he runs around farting and hopes you chase him while throwing giant slows and getting a speed and regen steroid.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-08-01T22:19:58.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of those are necessary...
