I've tried relogging multiple times and usually takes anywhere from 5 - 10 tries before I'm able to click play. I've tried using alternate accounts and receive the same result. The client resolution settings also get reverted back to the smallest size a few times during the log in 'ritual' I have now. \r\nIn addition to the log in problem, I get a grayed out play button after canceling a normal draft pick queue.\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/Z60N9","replies":[{"poster":"SenorElRoboto","date":"2017-02-03T15:49:56.914+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":5,"body":"1.
