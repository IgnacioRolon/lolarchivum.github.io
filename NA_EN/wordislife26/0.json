I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, where you'll find a list of steps to strengthen your connection.  I also recommend testing it out in custom games to prevent penalties.

If the guide or repair weren't able to solve this, we can still help troubleshoot and rule out possibilities.  Reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can dig into this.  The Hextech Repair Tool should have also provided a set of logs.
