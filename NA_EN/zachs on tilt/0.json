We can check this out by running some tracroute using the application [WinMTR.](http://winmtr.net/) After booting up the app, plug 104.160.131.1 into the host field and start the trace.

There is a constant loss of 1% of your packets and your latency starts spiking at 598 and hit upwards of 830ms before reaching the server. I'd recommend completing a full power cycle of your network. You can complete this with the following steps:\n\n>- Shut down all computers connected to your home network (modem/router/gateway).\n- Power down/unplug your router, if you use one.\n- Power down/unplug your modem.  Have both devices off for at least 60 seconds.\nNote: If your modem has a battery backup you will need to take the battery out for 60 seconds or use the reset button on the modem.\n- Turn on your modem and allow it to completely boot up.  Wait until the indicator lights on the device stop blinking and display a steady green connection.\n- Turn on the router (if you have one) and allow to completely boot up as well.\n- Start the computers and allow it to completely boot up and re-establish an internet connection. \n\nRun another set of traceroutes with WinMTR to check your latency and packet loss. If you still see issues, post the new results here.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"karuaan","date":"2016-09-18T04:11:15.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am getting these also!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"thanks ugly god","date":"2016-09-18T04:46:16.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
