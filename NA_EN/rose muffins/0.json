The game the proceeded poorly, as you can imagine, for more reasons than that. I&#039;ll take blame too. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZCGMiqw.png\n\nWe got put as the exact same team next match and there was much more than this to the discussion. There was a dodge and thank goodness for that. Why does the system let a team that lost get put all back together the exact same way less than a minute later?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-31T01:11:44.056+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because this game has a very healthy population. /kappa","replies":[]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-12-31T03:44:22.837+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because it puts you all at similar mmr and league area. What happened in the game before needs to be left in the past. Being put on the same team again gives you a chance to over come the mistakes and issues of last game and rise above your differences to achieve the common goal of victory.","replies":[{"poster":"Hèntaî ","date":"2018-12-31T06:26:48.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats all fine and dandy, but I dont want to be matched with someone that was being super toxic again.

It is extremely frustrating but there's no way to fix it without that fix being abused by people. Let's say the system automatically prevents you from being put into a game with someone you reported, well now all I have to do is report people that I think are bad and now I don't have to play with them again... Oh and now the reports system has been inundated with baseless reports by people who decided their support is terrible because they went 1/6 (because who cares about the 24 assists they got).\n\nYour best bet in the future is to not immediately start another game, just wait a couple minutes. It'll make it less likely for you to have any repeats in your game and will also give you a chance to stretch, grab a drink and unwind a little bit from the toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SHIN0BU","date":"2018-12-31T01:55:36.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dunno. I’ve had it happen before, just try to make the best of it you might beat the people who were toxic or prove them wrong by carrying them, if theyre toxic or harassing, that’s another story you can report that and if it’s too much , just dodge pre game if you don’t wanna play with them. Simple.","replies":[]}]}
