Though I've seen complaints about Kayle's armor looking like a skinsuit (already addressed) and some of Morgana's VFX still being outdated on some of her skins. Though I haven't seen anybody talk about Morgana's teeth.\r\n[After a failed flower picking joke](https://i.imgur.com/EDitHtf.png) her mouth stretches out and her teeth are bared. \r\n[After her taunt](https://i.imgur.com/4UTSKtI.png) she shows us those pearly whites.\r\n[And at the tail end of her ultimate](https://i.imgur.com/4zeJakt.png).\r\nThe still images do me no justice in explaining how weird and freakish her baring her teeth this way is but I hope the point comes across. I'm not sure if I'm the only one put off/very displeased with this specific part of her but I'd like to know. \r\n Her teeth look massive. You can count them and they stick out like a sore thumb. The rest of her looks so sleek and delicate and then she comes out with these giant chompers. In-motion it just gets worse. But I'm willing to accept if I'm the small minority who thinks this.","replies":[]}
