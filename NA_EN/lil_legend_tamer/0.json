Firstly, make sure your OS is up to date.  If you're on Windows 10, the freezing could be caused by the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been know to do that.  Disabling it should do the trick!\n\nI also recommend going over the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to make sure your drivers are up to date as well and not causing issues between tasks.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
