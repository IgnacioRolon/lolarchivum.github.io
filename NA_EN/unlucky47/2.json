No matter what I play, or how I play, I can&#039;t do anything. I&#039;ll get fed and lose because the enemy ads two shot me and even when I&#039;m playing tanks or bruisers i die in seconds to an adc with yommus. This is the most un fun time I&#039;ve ever had in the past year and a half playing league.\r\n\r\nSome people are going to say that I&#039;m not providing solutions. Well here&#039;s some solutions.\r\n\r\nRevert the jungle. The season six jungle was fine. There were a few overpowered champions but it wasn&#039;t nearly this bad. The jungles unplayable for more than half the champions that were designed to do it. Even if I afk farm I will still be several levels behind the solo laners and even sometimes behind bot depending on who I&#039;m playing. There was no reason to change the jungle and now you have every reason to change it back as it would solve half of the balance problems in the game.\r\n\r\nGo back to flat armor pen. It was so much better than lethality. Sure it didn&#039;t help much against tanks but there&#039;s other ways to deal with that then fucking with this bullshit mechanic.\r\n\r\nMake tanks do less damage. If they do less damage and are there for mostly utility, then you won&#039;t even need to worry about flat armor pen not being effective. And they would survive longer to provide more utility.\r\n\r\nAnd finally nerf the fucking problem champions. Seriously you keep making these huge role changes for no damn reason. &quot;Oh most of the junglers are shit but the ones that aren&#039;t are op better nerf the entire jungle&quot; or like how after 2 months of complaining about how fucked caitlyn was you decided it would be a better approach to buff nearly the ENTIRE marksmen role because one champion was over performing. Seriously?\r\n\r\nThose are my thoughts because season six wasn&#039;t that bad but it is certainly better than the current. They won&#039;t listen though because they would rather fuck up the game more like when they armor pen into lethality just to buff it into a more effective armor pen. I doubt they even fully understand what they&#039;re doing so they&#039;re not going to listen to the community.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-16T23:25:23.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lethality was nerfed.\nLethality is weaker than flat pen (basic math, do you use it???1?).\nTanks are getting a full class rework, did you not see this?\nADCs are hardly overpowered right now, tanks are just bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Unlucky47","date":"2017-02-17T02:17:52.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My post, did you read it? I talked about how they made it into lethality because armor pen was too strong. ADCS aren't overpowered? Really? I got thresh autoed and flayed and jhin autoed me twice and killed me. At level 1. Not to mention that jhin is played in every single game now. But that wasn't the point which you would know if you read the post instead of skimming it. The point was that they do this for every class where they try to change the entire role because one or two champions are out of line.\n\nGet the fuck off my thread if you're not going to read it.","replies":[]}]}]}
