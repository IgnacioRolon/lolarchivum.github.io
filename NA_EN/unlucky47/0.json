I think the leaver buster is way to hard on players. Most of the time the client closes for no reason, I just have to put up with the 5 minutes. But 30 minutes because of leagues client not working properly? I don't understand. Oh, almost forgot, since league didn't fuck me enough with a 30 minute wait time, I LOST 10 LP.  I've already contacted support before about losing a game because someone afked and we cant win a 4 v 5 without an adc, and they informed me that they can't alter LP to prevent corruption. That makes sense but why isn't there a way to repeal losses? Like not for the person that afked but for the people that had to deal with it? I think it would make more sense if the person that afked and whoever they were in a party with would lose the lp from the match (to prevent friends from leaving to save lp) and the others dont lose anything, but still get lp if they win. Back to the whole timer thing though, I know i'll never see that lp again. It wouldnt be a big deal if i wasnt using that as a cushion to survive a couple of loses, because I only had 8. NOW I'M AT -2 SO THATS JUST GREAT","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T17:57:07.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your lower priority queue will continue to escalate the more you leave games without restoring your standing with the system.
