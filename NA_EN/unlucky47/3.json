The community is clearly dissatisfied with these changes and we haven&#039;t hear anything pertaining to fixing them yet. This is a problem because we are so close to the pre season and we don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing to our favorite champion. From what i&#039;ve read, you wanted the akali changes to be tailored towards mains, and almost all the mains are speaking against the changes. Please listen to the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-10-31T05:09:32.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was pretty salty over all the changes before I had a chance to play her, but after borrowing a PBE account from a friend and actually managing to play it, I can say it's in fact even worse than I thought it was. She's just so clunky now, you keep having to proc you passives at minions instead if at the enemy so it's really hard to actually use it in trades, so her lanning phase, which was already pretty terrible to begin with, is even worse. The shroud is pretty useless unless you put points in it, so you have to max E last which really hurts her damage output and wave clearing potential. And the cooldown on the R means it's really hard to chase mobile champions AND do damage. The cherry on the cake is that the other assassins, which are her competition by default, all got MORE mobile.","replies":[]}]}
