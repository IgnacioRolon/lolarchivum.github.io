Reposting:\n\n_____________________________________________\n\n\nI want to say that Cho'Gath might be relatively close to the top, though I can't remember off of the top of my head. He's not in the top immediate 5, but maybe a bit after that. What I think the best thing about the prospect of a Cho VU is that we just got Vel'Koz out there. We have a defined look for the void due to that champion. While in the past we were sorta like.. \"Well what is the void? Just bugs and purple?\" we at least have a more refined precedent with Vel'Koz. Yes, actually, the Void is very much \"bugs and purple\", and maybe that's not really touching on what the void is in and of itself, but it's a reliable trope set we're now sorta locked into.\n\n\nI'd like us to go back and reexamine Cho now that Vel'Koz is complete. I think there's a lot of form language, color and other notes that we can incorporate. Right now Cho is preeeettty much Violator from Spawn crossed with a giant Zergling, or at least was highly inspired by back in the day. I think we need to dive back in and come up with some more unique things to work into him.\n\n\nRight now, he's a big confusion of arms and protrusions. I don't know if that'd change (I've seen a couple of concepts lying around where he has fewer than current) but I don't know if we could get away with lopping off any arms/claws. At the very least, we have to reduce some of the noise. That might come from just giving his various appendages a bit of differentiation in terms of size. We'll see. Nothing concrete yet.\nI do consider him an \"easy win\" however in that a) he's a pretty straightforward character b) he doesn't need to be thematically re-defined and c) we've got some great standards set by Kha'zix and Vel'Koz to refer to in terms of quality and style.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-03-01T09:34:24.107+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I much prefer Cho and Kog's current look over Kha, at least. Vel'Koz looks cool, I guess, but Kha is basically just a giant bug. I mean, so are Kog and Cho, but at least they don't look almost entirely like the bug they're based on (most larva, after all, do not have legs.) Then again, I have a lot of issues with Kha as a champion, but those issues are primarily with your champion design lately, and not just Kha, so I'm probably biased.","replies":[{"poster":"daft inquisitor","date":"2014-03-01T13:08:48.523+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"He does look a lot like a preying mantis, and doesn't have a lot of that Void-like \"Eugh!\" factor to him. I mean, that's pretty much what I get from the Void. They're grotesque perversions of things we're familiar with. Vel'Koz is a giant tentacle eye. Kog'Maw is a larval bug with a big gaping mouth of doom. Cho'Gath is all arms and spikes, but in a weird way, he looks like a perverse spider, with his smaller arms being kinda like mandibles. But Kha? Kha is just a straight-up Mantis. There's nothing about him that's \"wrong\", and I get that feeling from everything else about the void.\n\nThe Void is a corruption, a perversion, and that's a distinction I think it needs to have defined a bit more.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-03-01T21:12:12.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This also ties in very neatly with Vel'Koz. My suspicions are that he is the one finding the baselines for the monsters, after which 'daddy' improves them (I wonder if he would like Viktor?). This could create some pretty diverse void creatures, not only bugs. \n\nI also agree Kha'Zix looks like a whole different type of Void creature. He is also much more selfish than the rest, looking to improve himself, settle the fight with Rengar etc. So perhaps something happened interrupting his creation, leaving him in a highly adaptable stage and not feeling unified with the rest of the void?","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-03-02T04:19:11.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You see the \"Eugh!\" factor on Kha'Zix's actual model but not on his splashart.

She was basically the first champ to receive a model/visual update (anyone remember her old chicken wings?) and so she likely not on the list since shes inline with the current quality standard but just not as interesting. \n\nIf they were to change her, it would likely have to be a thematic overhaul like Trundle. She and Morgana still have their old/legacy lore and no other champs have been pulled in nor introduce from their heavenly alien origin. Their basically untouched, though not probably not forgotten. like trundle they'll be re-envisioned into another established lore. \n\nIf I were to guess, their wings are too iconic to be removed; so it'd be odd to just place them in Demacia and Noxus. I'd personally place them as from the Fae lands that Lulu disappeared into. Since we don't know much about the Fae lands, it would give the relaunch team a lot more creative freedom. Kayle and Morgana could essentially stay the same with bird/angel wings but I'd like to see them reimagined as more fairy like. Kayle could be more royal and elegant as perhaps one of the daughters of a royal line of fairy military rulers. Morgana could be of the more classical fairy myth were her mischief is more wild,evil than innocent play.\n\nI kinda went off on a tangent there but my point would be that Kayle deserves an update but the type of update would be need to be determined first and then the scope of it would likely put her last on the list of a very long list already.","replies":[{"poster":"Garentheon","date":"2014-03-02T21:52:50.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though she did already have a VU, her quality is actually not inline with the current champs/VUs that have been released recently","replies":[{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-03-03T03:11:42.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still much better than most champs in the game.
