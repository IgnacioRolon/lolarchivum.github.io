I was wondering if anyone has a solution to my problem. I am able to load the portraits but i'm unable to load into the game. My percentage can go to 100 but i still wont load into the actual game. I've turned off the Xbox game DVR but that hasn't changed anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T22:47:45.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you receiving any error messages?

I would notice that my ping would stop moving at one point then see that my percentage wasn't moving either. Thank you for replying and I will be looking at the game crash guide.","replies":[]}]}]}
