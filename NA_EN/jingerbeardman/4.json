If you don't, first your mmr will drop, then your visible rank (your lp) will follow (this makes your visible rank more accurate since it doesn't swing as much with random win/loss streaks).\n\nWhen starting a season the system gives everyone insane mmr gains/losses and then slowly lowers these after every game before stopping to do so after probably like 100 games. This is done so that the system can first make a decent guess of where you belong with a low amount of data to get by. However, after this, you can still easily climb/drop your mmr and therefore visible rank. The system never 'decides' you belong at a certain rank and get you stuck there arbitrarily for the rest of the season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-06-30T16:11:29.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Earn lp like I **deserve**\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2014-06-30T11:21:05.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"you can circumvent the system by getting into promo series (does't even have to be a promo series to the next league) and then dodge until you fail the series.\n\nThen win and get placed back into the series, raising your hidden MMR.

LP can't change unless you win or lose, so what actually changes is your LP gain/loss per game. Your LP provides a rough approximation to your MMR, and the gains and losses to your LP per win or loss is adjusted to bring your LP closer to what it \"should be\" in order to match your MMR.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is abusing the fact that the system is critically damped to slingshot yourself. Think of the coupling between MMR and LP like a spring.\n\nNow think about what would happen if you raised your MMR to extremely high levels but locked the LP in one place-- you'd stretch that spring. You release your lock and allow yourself to create LP gains, and the system will give you vast LP gains until you are where it thinks you ought to be in accordance with your MMR.\n\nIn any case the assertion: \"you could have done this without using this technique if you truly belonged where you want to be.\" is false.\n\nYou can actually overshoot by riding the LP gains, the same way a spring will resonate and dampen until eventually it comes to a stop. You just need to be able to quit when your LP gains / losses per game finally equalize, and not be greedy and keep playing otherwise you will fall since you don't actually belong in that tier.\n\nIf you do it enough you can slingshot yourself far beyond where you belong, and if you continue playing you will eventually fall back to where you actually belong.\n\nDon't assume the system can't be gamed or abused to acquire placement in a tier that you don't belong in. It can be, and there isn't anything that can be done about it. When RIOT decided to add a layer of indirection with LP and MMR, they also voluntarily made it susceptible to abuse. Its a mathematical trait of any damped proportional-integral-derivative feedback system. Any such system can only be critically damped for one set of parameters.\n\nThe best they can do is have the system make an educated guess about where you should be (hence skipping divisions) and work from there as if it were your LP before \"releasing the lock\" so that when you do slingshot, it won't cause you to overshoot quite as much.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-06-30T12:34:37.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would it overshoot you for more than one match though?

The LP system is a close approximation to your MMR if you don't force it to do unusual things. If you do force it to do unusual things (like what I stated above) then it no longer is a good approximation. The system wants it to be a good approximation, so it makes guesses about where your LP should be. It can't directly change your LP, so it changes your LP gains per win, and LP loss per loss, but ultimately it is just a scientific and educated guess. A guess is still a guess, an approximation is still an approximation. You can abuse that.\n\nYour lp gains will normalize once you peak, but why continue playing at that point? The system can't remove LP except slowly through decay from not playing. Why make it deplete faster? Why not just stop playing ranked after reaching diamond this way?","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-06-30T12:53:36.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what makes you peak significantly above your mmr?

Then he will be pulled down again and gain speed yet again, but he will cross his destination with a bit less speed due to friction. This will repeat until friction took all it's speed away, because there is no other way for the box to lose it's speed.\n\nImagine, the box attached to a spring wants to be at 150m, but is at 50m. The string will pull the box towards 150m. The moment the box is at 150m, the spring stops pulling, but the box still has speed, so the box will shoot upwards, to say 200m (friction reducing its speed). Then, the spring will push the box downwards towards 150m again, it has speed and overshoots and this will repeat until the box is steady at 150m.\n\nI'm going to use lp to describe your visible rating including league division etc.\n\nThe system however, does not have a limited amount of friction. The system can just pull your lp with an arbitrary speed to your mmr and then stop you on the spot with an arbitrary amount of friction. The system however, limits its speed relative to the distance between your lp and your mmr.\n\nImagine, your lp is 50 and your mmr is 150. The system therefore thinks you belong at 150 and starts pulling you. Assume you do belong to 150 and you manage a neat 1:1 win/loss ratio. The moment your lp is at 150, the system stops pulling. However, since lp has no speed because it's not a box, it will instantly even out at 150.\n\n\n\n\n**There** is one way the system dampens you though.\nImagine, you have 100 lp, 100 mmr and 100 mmr is your skill level. A huge win streak will significantly increase your mmr to 150 but your lp only to 120. Then the games after, you will probably go on a loss streak because you play against better players, your mmr drops down to 100 again, your lp drops to 105 because it was lower than your mmr for most of the loss streak. Now you start consistently winning and becoming better, your mmr will slowly grow to 150, but your lp will be following below this, 130.\n\n\nYour mmr is much more sensitive to win/loss streaks than your lp and  lp always follow behind it, dampened. This makes lp more accurate because it's less prone to random win/loss streaks but still accurately represents actual increases in skill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dozr","date":"2014-07-01T03:39:09.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't be doing this, but I love how smart you are. <3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-06-30T21:28:14.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, I wont cheat...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-06-30T23:11:48.977+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Basically what happened is there's two systems at play:\n\n1. Your Matchmaking Rating (MMR). For most people this is a number somewhere between, say, 0 and 2500 (Mine's in the 2000-something range and I'm in low Diamond 1). This determines what caliber of opponents you play against. This exists (separately) in Normal Games, Ranked Games, ARAM, Dominion, etc. Basically every queue permutation has one.\n2. Your League/Division/LP. This is the system you see. It does its best to follow your MMR. For example, players are 99LP Diamond 1 won't hit 100 LP and trigger a promotion into Challenger until their MMR is high enough to allow them into that League. The same applies to getting into Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc.\n\nSo what's happening is that your MMR is actually slightly lower than your LP would indicate. In order to not have the system lie to you and place you at 99LP, hitting your head against the wall until you reach the right MMR, it's guiding your LP gains down a little bit until they line up again.","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-07-01T21:34:50.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while this may be occurring right now for me, this was not the case when this started happening. I was on a winning streak and positive wins to losses when all of a sudden my gains and losses go bat shit crazy. I tried explaining this to support that there may be something wrong in the system, which I really think there is, because this suddenly started happening to many people I played matches with at that time. What aggravates me most is that this change is actually making me more toxic in game because now it takes 2 wins just to break even for one loss. That is why I feel this system is terrible as it is. If you are winning its great but the instant you hit a losing streak it punishes you so hard its nearly impossible to bounce back.\n\nHow the decision was made to make it this way baffles me. This is a leading cause to aggravation and toxicity in ranked. If I were only losing 2 points more than when I win I would not get nearly as irritated but I am losing 5+ points over what I am winning and that is complete BS. I get the system holding you back a little when you are behind but it shouldn't beat you down with a lead pipe until you are a broken mess.\n\nHere is some food for thought. Player A has good standing MMR when compared to his rank and LP in the brackets, they only have a deviation of about 3 points from the average when they win or lose. Player B however has poor standing MMR compared to his rank and LP in his bracket and has a deviation of 5+ points in his gains and losses. Both player A and player B lose their next game in which they are favored. Player A loses 19 points and averages 17 points a win, player B however loses 22 points and only seems to average 16-17 a win. Which player is going to feel less affected by their loss when they are favored compared to the other.\n\nThis is the problem with the current systems dual ratings. Since we players are 100% unaware of what MMR we have and how it actually works and correlates to our winnings, the instant something out of the ordinary that is a negative experience happens you are more likely to flip your lid over it because you don't know WTF just happened and why. There is no way to see that, Yeah my MMR does look like it is lower than where I am in regard to my current rank so I guess this result is understandable and I know what I need to do to recover it. Instead since there is NO way to figure out how the hell MMR works, how much is gained or lost with each game, and just how it determines your changes in LP we are left confused. Confusion leads to frustration, frustration leads to an irritated state resulting in anger if things escalate and ultimately toxicity toward the game that is typically vented on teammates and other players.\n\nI understand the reasoning for keeping one rating in the dark. If it were revealed, figuring out ways to cheat the system would be easier as you notice certain patterns to each of the ratings gains and losses. Truth is their are already simple and proven methods to do that anyways because of the way that you climb the ladder currently. I am not going to actually point them out but they are there, I know of them and know if I did use them I would likely get punished which is why I don't.\n\nA simple and ambiguous indicator of MMR like a colored bar under your rank in your profile that is red when you are lower than your current standing green if you are in good standing and blue if you are beyond your current standing would even be enough to alleviate so much confusion about this system.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-07-02T14:45:04.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winning streaks are actually not efficient in gaining lp. You just need a constant win/loss ratio above 1. A winstreak will boost your mmr significantly, but you will suddenly hit a point where you are put against stronger opponents and you will go on a losing streak, losing your mmr again and leaving your lp mildly higher than your mmr, meaning your lp gains will lower.\n\nIf you go on a losing streak, you get easier matches and you should be able to just climb back up with your increased win/loss ratio, leaving your lp probably a bit below your skill level.\n\nThese streaks are quite random and your skill does not significantly in- or decrease with these streaks, but your mmr does. Your lp however doesn't. If you consistently have a lower or higher than 1 win/loss ratio, your lp will follow your mmr relatively closely. This makes your lp more accurate than your mmr and random win/loss streaks ineffective.\n\nI am not sure why you say the mmr system is unclear, it seems quite clear to me. You have two ratings, an invisible mmr and a visible lp. Your lp rating is the more accurate and less swingy one and will follow your mmr rating. I'm not even sure how anyone would find new ways to cheat the system if they knew their mmr, it's just that the mmr is irrelevant to the user. They hide it to make it clear to everyone that they should be looking to the more accurate lp rating.\n\nThe only exception for this is the whole promotion series system, which I think is a terrible system anyway. It matches you with players of your mmr level to see if you should be allowed into a league/division. However, your mmr value could be higher than the mmr value of the division/league you're trying to enter, because for example your win/loss ratio is somehow a perfect 55%. This makes it incredibely luck-based, because the system tries to give you a 50% win ratio but you need either a 75% in 4 games or a 67% in 6 games. In the long run it's mainly tedious, it's just a matter of time if you belong in the higher league/division anyway.\n\nOn a sidenote, we should be talking about over 40 games to even raise suspicions about whether system is broken or not, below that there is just not enough data. Games' rating systems are very inaccurate with low amounts of games because the only valid data point we have is whether you win or lose a match, your kill/death ratio/gold advantage/minion kills are all irrelevant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OL DlRTY BASTARD","date":"2014-07-01T00:35:15.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm winning something like 65% of my games for the last 25-30 games.
