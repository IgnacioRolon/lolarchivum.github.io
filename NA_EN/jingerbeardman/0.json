You don't know how many Runaan's I've seen in Bronze V because it SEEMS to be a good item, though it really isn't in any practical situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-04-08T08:35:27.519+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yup, that thought indeed came out of the Warwick discussion. Basically, IMO there's roughly three use cases in which people might theoretically be considering grievous wounds (and I'm not sold that 3) is actually a thing)\n\n1) High burst sustain self-heal champions. This is the likes of Mundo, Swain, Warwick, Volibear etc. There is usually a single, expensive (i.e. non-spammable) event where you want to apply GW: Mundo/Swain using ult, Warwick jumping in with ult and trying to spam Qs after (something he can't do constantly as Q is STUPID expensive on live), Volibear's passive proccing etc. I believe the reason people want GW in these situations is because the effects themselves may either be overtuned or feel like there's no counterplay once the champion gets ahead. Introducing a special item to \"fix\" this feels like a design crutch to me. It's taking away those champions' high moments. \n\n2) Strong in-combat sustain healing. I don't know if this really is a thing anymore, but imagine having a support soraka, a top-lane nidalee and a mid kayle on the enemy team, and something like a jungle Xin who jumps into your team and starts being a man. In those cases it feels like you require GW to counter the enemy's setup, because the usual counterplay to Xin jumping into your team (burst him down) isn't available. Again, I don't think GW is the answer here. The problem is that there are strong offensive champions who get a big heal for free by itemizing in the most aggressive way possible (Nid, Kayle). As for support healing, whenever we push our supports away from in-combat healing, we make out-of-combat sustain (\"top up\" healing in between interactions) the stronger choice, and I think we generally find that to be the less healthy pattern (hence Soraka's armor buff on her heal, Taric's big CD chunk on basic attacks, Nami's bounce heal/hurt spell--all of these mechanics are meant to push the optimal use case of the spell to in combat rather than out of combat. I don't think they work, but the intention is there.)\n\nIMO, if the enemy wants to build a team that enables a strong deep diver to live much longer than normally, they should be paying for it in some other way. If there is a legit setup with such tradeoffs that manages to get to the point where Xin can dive and wreak havoc, cool! Your entire enemy team coordinated to do a cool thing, they should get rewarded for it. I don't think it's fair to offset coordination through the pick phase, the laning phase and inside teamfights by simply buying one item and saying \"hah! You're screwed now!\"\n\n3) End game ADC lifesteal sustain. So a lot of designers throw this one around as the reason for GW, but call me doubtful. End game ADCs, no matter what reddit and the forums say, are still absolutely insane in our game. There is no role that scales anywhere near as massively as dudes who right click you. They have access to more multiplicative stats than any other role (AD, AS, crit chance, crit dmg, procs, armor penetration) combined with the single most powerful innate tool in our game (range) and some of the sweetest deals in terms of itemization. The theory here is that if they mix in lifesteal in their build (which they can do easily enough; both BT and BotRK are great items even WITHOUT the LS on them) they can feel unkillable and as such, GW should give you a window to try and solo kill an ADC in the late game. I cannot argue with this intellectually; it makes perfect sense.\n\nThe problem is: I've never in my 1000+ games of League actually seen anyone use GW in such a way. I've never seen it on a stream, never seen it in a competitive game, I've not seen it in Silver II ranked, I've not seen it in normals--I'd love to be proven wrong here, but I don't think it's a thing!\n\nSo to back off and reassess the problem space at hand: sustain is a thing in our game, and in many cases it's totally fine to have. However, there's a handful of cases where sustain can feel so overwhelming that players want a \"NOPE\" button to turn off the enemy's sustain. That NOPE button should be GW.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Polaritie","date":"2014-03-28T18:45:35.712+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one thing I'd be worrying about though is that currently sustain lanes aren't even being run bottom - it's all poke ({{champion:1}} {{champion:117}} ) or engage ({{champion:89}} {{champion:412}} ).\n\nOf course, part of that is that the main sustain laners have been to see Morello a bit too much. {{champion:37}} is horrifically squishy and {{champion:16}} gets by on the back of her poke ability.\n\n\nEdit: Normally, the idea is that hard engage>sustain>poke>engage, but right now sustain is weak enough, and engage strong enough, that sustain champs really don't get played at all.

It isn't that Sustain is too weak, it's the opposite there is simply too much sustain present that poke is ineffective due to such heavy amounts of inherent lifesteal. Additional sustain from champions like Sona and Soraka is simply excessive and mostly wasted in this scenario. \n\nWhen sustain gets too powerful it forces opponents to rely on a 100-0 kill lane pattern as it's the only way to actually win lane and running additional sustain is largely a waste as all you need is enough sustain to mitigate or counteract poke.\n\nThat's part of the reason champs like Leona, Thresh, and Annie are so sought after atm. I'm fairly confident if there was less sustain in bot lane those champions would see a lot more play, even with no other changes.","replies":[{"poster":"YourtrueKami","date":"2014-04-05T02:31:17.541+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if this is going to be accurate, I haven't played this game for a while now do to problems with download/patching, but from the sound of it this is what I gather. Sustain supports such as Soraka and Sona aren't satisfying to play but they can't be buffed because the value of lifesteal is too high right now. To me, is seems like the best thing to do, for sustain supports but maybe not the game, is to lower lifesteal and buff sustain from champions.\n\nI'm not sure how well this could be balanced though. Just looking at what it would do now; it would give more need for sustain support (if not balanced properly it would make them required possibly) as it would lower the amount of health they get when fighting just from attacking and it would effect top lane. It seems like some lifesteal is becoming more common in top lane (either BotRK or Hydra).\n\nNot sure how this would effect the game overall, but it would at least make sustain supports more satisfying and give them more of a reason to be chosen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wertilq","date":"2014-03-30T00:13:55.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EC have potential to be nasty bruiser item to shut down ADC even further.

First things first, I realize that this stat is a tricky one.  \nI am making points on the following two bases:  \nA: why this stat isn't accompanied by a strong item, and  \nB: what would would happen if a higher end item was built out of this items' current itteration.\n\nLengthy-ish post inc:\n\n> I think the GWs on Ignite it's commonplace enough the regen on those champs has already been buffed to the accommodate for GW.\n\nIgnite is a spell that's up once every few minutes, and thus is OK to have a grievous wounds debuff with it. This is healthy, since between 2 ignites your opponent has a large time window to go aggressive on you, without the need of exceptional sustain.\nHowever, having this stat constantly up is not healthy for the game. An OK item with passive GW would be problematic since during trades or poke scenarios, at least one character will constantly be regenerating/self-restoring half the HP he should. In a way, one could say that the presence of the item in that lane lowers sustain by 50% for the opposing side. THIS would call for a raise in passive and active sustain in lane, which would then make a GW item a must buy.\n\nHow is this problem solved? There's more than one levers to adjust:  \n1. Duration of GW  \n2. Method of GW application  \n3. Power of GW  \n4. Slot efficiency of the item  \n5. Upgrade availability\n\nCurrently, the balance of the item has it gated/in check by utilizing #1, #4 and #5. The GW debuff is high power - low duration, and the item is not slot efficient. This way, it's not that the problem is non existant, but a dual approach is taken at the same time: A. Don't incentivize buying this item -> This item doesn't create balance issues and B. If the item is bought, both parties suffer from a significant stat loss.  \n\nIf the method of application however differed, the power was lower, the item was stronger and the duration was slightly higher, the person buying the item wouldn't feel like a slot is being \"placeholded\". An idea about how an item with this stat could be balanced could be an item with strong stats and a toggle mode, where you should make a stat trade for the GW active (ex. trade 20% of your AS for the GW active). I think that 20% healing reduction is strong enough, doesn't feel bad to have and doesn't make the opponent feel overwhelmed.\n\n> In terms of Marksman v Marksman I'm not sure you'd get the result you want here either. If you are simply adding a more DPS for less regen you're still ultimately net neutral (if balanced appropriately of course), the way I think about that scenario is the following overly simplified formula.  \nDmg (Player A) - Healing (Player B) vs Dmg (Player B) - Healing (PLayer A)\n\nI hadn't thought about this this way.  \nThe way I thought of it was that currently, you get to outplay your opponent or at least sustain back up after a trade by playing smart. Both parties require some smart play in order for a kill to happen. However, if this stat was (either) better (or) on a better item, the first party would hold a way stronger position once a trade was won, since he could constantly reduce the enemies sustain enough for the enemy to not have as much opportunity to sustain back up.\n\nOverall, I think Executioners Calling should receive a minor rework, (I would take the direction I proposed, a designer could favor another one) with a strong upgrade later on. I believe it's good this way since the power of the GW stat could be in check for both mid game and late game, and a player could make actually make an itemization or counteritemization choice with some sort of trade off.\n\n\nEdit: I wish you keep visiting this thread, it's nice when we players get to interact with you! believe that both parties benefit out of it plus it feels nice ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2014-03-30T04:13:01.913+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The situation with Ignite is that despite having a long cooldown it is pretty much always available when a large fight or multi-person fight occurs.

Supports don't really need the lifesteal and 250 HP doesn't trace well into the late game for junglers and top laners.  \nEx 2: The tenacity on Zephyr forces you into non-mercs boots and non-golem spirit items which lowers survivability  \nEx 3: Runaans has the highest Attack Speed in game but feels weird and doesn't boost survivability or damage esp. when compared to as zeal upgrade)","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2014-04-04T06:32:12.163+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A- Yes, though that style of item cleanup that we saw last patch (cost tuning, recipe cleanup etc) is more of a passion project of mine as it bothers me quite a bit from a kind of designer OCD standpoint. Some of it was also necessary and important groundwork for future expansion of the item system and to get the itemization system as a whole in a better spot. \n\nWhen we do this style of batch change for each grouping of items is going to vary a bit, the next largescale pass on recipe cleanup/adjustments will probably be Marksman items, followed by Fighter/Tank, followed by Mages, though some stuff will probably occur out of order when it's appropriate.  \n\nExample - Attack Speed itemization is primarily a Marksman stat but in adjusting those recipes we're already looking at Wit's End for example so despite it being more of a Fighter Item it makes a lot of sense to tackle at the same time.\n\nAnother aspect of this is to shift items more into their unique roles having clearly defined strengths and weaknesses. The Aegis/Locket changes were an example of this for last patch. We striped the armor focusing it more into an anti-magic damage role instead of a mediocre feeling just all around good item. \n\nB- Jungle itemization is a hot topic with the team right now, it's not something I am personally working on atm so I can't actually speak to it much. At this very moment I'm focusing more on Attack Speed items. \n\nC- Some of those items will certainly be updated when it is appropriate. Hurricane, Zephyr, Rageblade, and Wit's End for example are all on our radar atm for changes since it makes sense as we're touching AS itemization as a whole. Not saying we'll ultimately go through with everything but if we hit a spot we're happy with them we will absolutely update them. As general practice I would much prefer updating and improving an existing item when we can rather than creating a new one for a variety of reasons. \n\nZeke's, not really being related to the larger categories we're looking at atm, is not on our radar for the next pass, though it's something I would love to look at in the future still.","replies":[{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-04-04T07:59:12.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you say Marksman items are up next followed by tank/fighter items do you mean for these smaller scale item build changes?

What I am also curious about is why atmas impaler in particular has not been addressed at all in so long. I feel like if it had just 20 base damage added to it and a long sword added to its build components it would actually see quite a bit of use by the bruiser archetype. This would obviously need some kind of tradeoff which reducing the bonus attack damage based on health to 1%. This would make the item far more appealing as an early purchase as it would have double the AD compared to what you get now during the early game while still being close to equal the amount of damage you would get late game depending on the amount of health you get (at 3000 health you would only have an additional 5 ad compared to the bonus from 1.5% it has now, at 4000 health it would be equal). The cost would likely need to be raised an additional 200-300 gold though.\n\nthis is just some food for thought.
