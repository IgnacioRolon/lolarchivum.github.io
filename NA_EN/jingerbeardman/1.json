I checked out my network analyzer while i was in a training game mode and the network speed wasnt fluctuating much at all even during the packet loss and higher pings. im confused as to what's going on, it isnt like regular lag but would be better described as just a bunch of packet loss.\n\nAnyone with any ideas on what might be happening?","replies":[{"poster":"Ignis","date":"2017-08-07T23:15:52.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[It would be useful to consolidate these threads](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/1VluGcrg-lag-spikes-in-rankeds)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-08T02:39:31.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm packet loss can be pretty hard to deal with sometimes. Mostly due to the fact that it takes place outside of your network, and caused by how your ISP is routing your connection. Make sure to check with your ISP to make sure there aren't any current issues. If not, go ahead and reach out to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can see what's going on with those network logs!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jithong","date":"2017-08-08T01:35:44.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't been to LoL forums in 6 years but I logged in for the first time in a while to say I am having the same issues. Every other game I play is fine but I am getting constant 200-300 ms ping on League. It has been at 77ms for the last year but it suddenly changed.
