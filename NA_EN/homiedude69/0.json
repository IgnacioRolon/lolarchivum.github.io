My question how i got chat restricted yet haven&#039;t received a notice saying a recent report has been blah blah blah? And why riot keeps this players choose toxic behavior when it seems abused in my opinion.\nHere&#039;s my chat log:\nGame 1\nPre-Game\nHomiedude69: id actually love it if you played poppy\nHomiedude69: this bot lane is gonna troll so id say dodge\nHomiedude69: 2 queues in a row shes banned my champs\nHomiedude69: or taken\nHomiedude69: she took it so i couldnt have it\nHomiedude69: not to play it\nHomiedude69: shut up loser\nIn-Game\nHomiedude69: this guy banned took both of my support choices and im toxic lol\nHomiedude69: u are muted\nHomiedude69: i told you shes gonna troll\nHomiedude69: you didnt listen\nHomiedude69: report this lux\nHomiedude69: ur actually stilll try harding bot lane\nHomiedude69: lul\nHomiedude69: omegalul\nHomiedude69: not me\nHomiedude69: lux banned and took my picks\nHomiedude69: thats all i had left\nHomiedude69: ^\nHomiedude69: tbh\nHomiedude69: we still can\nHomiedude69: were winning without you camille\nHomiedude69: lmo\nHomiedude69: lmlao ur fizz bud\nHomiedude69: you cant even fight this game without ur team fizz you definitely cant 1v1\nHomiedude69: 3v1\nHomiedude69: 1v1 mme rn\nHomiedude69: thats all you get to show ur skill\nHomiedude69: if you dont\nHomiedude69: then ur scaree\nHomiedude69: scared\nHomiedude69: there e go ur the bad one lol\nHomiedude69: one more chance to accept a 1v1 before i mute you\nHomiedude69: there we have it youre scare\nHomiedude69: gg\nHomiedude69: ez\nPost-Game\nHomiedude69: k\nHomiedude69: pls\nHomiedude69: report lux and camille\nHomiedude69: not me\nHomiedude69: not me pls\nHomiedude69: i didnt do anything wrong\nHomiedude69: lux\nHomiedude69: and camille\nHomiedude69: camilee inted\nHomiedude69: lux banned and picked my champs in select\nHomiedude69: how can you say that when we 4v5d\nHomiedude69: get off your high horse\nHomiedude69: lux f you mate\nHomiedude69: youre getting reported\nHomiedude69: forsure","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-08-01T04:05:17.603+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hey there.\n\nI removed the name of the player you mentioned in this post as it violates our Universal Rules about Naming and Shaming.\n\n\"No personal attacks or witch-hunting, for any reason.

With that said you did verbally harass your teammates even though you were the victim. Riot encourages people to just mute and report. They don't want you to retaliate but if you do, they don't want you to repeatedly say \"report (insert name)\" a bunch of times or say \" f you kid\" and etc. In your case though, I can see why you're angry and I think that you shouldn't be punished.
