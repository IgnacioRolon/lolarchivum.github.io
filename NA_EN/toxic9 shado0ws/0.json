These results are pretty nuts, your ping is exceedingly high as your router attempts to leave your network and travel outside.  Basically we want to turn that 4022  on your second hop to like a 10.  This might be caused by a poor local setting or degrading router.\n\nI highly recommend running through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot your local and router settings, and help strengthen your network.  Once complete, test it in a custom game and feel free to run another traceroute to see if things improve.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ToxiC9 ShaDo0ws","date":"2017-09-16T01:44:29.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your quick response , Porocles.\n\nI don't really know but right now the lag spikes are gone and i am no more experiencing it for the first time after about 1 week and a half.\n\nThanks anyway , will try to contact again if the problem happens again.\n\nRegards","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T23:18:21.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the route, but we could get a more precise analysis of your routing with [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/).
