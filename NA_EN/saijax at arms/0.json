Please retry at a different time' (I am paraphrasing there though). This is especially infuriating because when I hit the retry button, it simply continues with the same message, over and over. I cannot get out of this without closing the client, and reconnecting doesn't help much. I've tried almost everything in the \"troubleshooting connections\" page for fixes, and nothing has worked; I've lost 80lp and been placed in a low priority queue for it. What's even worse, however, is that is that it doesn't happen in patterns; it is ENTIRELY random. The game is still playable; this glitch only occurs about twice each month, but I'm becoming increasingly angry at it each time. I don't know why it's happening, nor what I can do to fix it, and I need help. I can't get out of this frustrating loop, of getting winstreaks broken by this, ranked games lost, and I'm becoming increasingly resentful towards the \"do it yourself\" nature of Riot's troubleshooting. I love this company, but your game is breaking me.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAsenappar","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-31T03:10:39.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned that this didn't seem to happen at any kind of specific frequency, so there might be a pretty good chance that this is coincidence but let's go ahead and take a few troubleshooting steps to check up on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
