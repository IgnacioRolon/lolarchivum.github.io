I was quickly walled by a hypnosis spamming Zapdos that, after some training, leaf took down extremely easily, and could have soloed the entire viridian forest if I let em. VRM was stuck at level 3 for a little while. Despite his  mediocre moveset of, Hydro Pump, Bone Club, Psywave, and Mist,  Hydro Pump alone would make him extremely useful later on, if it hit. I also got pretty lucky and found good use for his bone club,  since a lot of trainers and mons had quite a few poison types like Skunktank, Weedle, and the nidoran line.\r\n\r\nCleaving though the Viridian Forest, Leaf came ahead of everybody else at level 15, Spoopers at 12 and VRM at 10. Brock&#039;s trainer class was replaced by a skinhead biker and a team of Tentacruel and a Weedle. I let VRM club them to death with his bone and pushed him to level 13 after all was said and done. No IMG because I forgot to take screenshots.\r\n\r\nMoving on to Route 3, I cleaved though the trainers there and cashed in on about 4000pg, I went back, bought some more balls and caught some buddies for our heroes. I completely randomed the names cept 1. \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/k1m66Kl.png[/img]\r\nGIJose joined at level 6 and is gonna be a hardcore wrestler by the time we make it to the end. He sports a movepool of,\r\nTake Down\r\nCounter\r\nConstrict\r\nBug Buzz....?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m gonna swap that last one out for Seismic Toss the first moment I can find a TM of it. If I can&#039;t, I&#039;ll just make it Mach Punch instead.\r\n\r\nJoining us next is the Mysterious Bootie.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WvJgZSD.png[/img]\r\nBooty is GIJose&#039;s infamous tag partner who rocks the following moveset.\r\nDouble Kick\r\nKarate Chop\r\nGlare\r\nTwinNeedle\r\n\r\nOur third and final member is a shitpost king, and the only real way to homage him is by making him the smelliest mon I could get.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/j8gdsvd.png[/img]\r\nZaDahaka is the skunktank with a moveset worthy of his shitposting ability.\r\n\r\nLeech Life\r\nBone Club\r\nMega Kick \r\n_Dazzling Gleam _\r\n\r\nHe leeches the life of all who read his posts with a mega kick to the brain and clubs them over the head with his E-bone. Hes just that fucking dazzling I guess.\r\n\r\nContinuing down route 3, I began to notice that the trainer classes weren&#039;t random by trainer to trainer. Whole classes were set in place of other classes. The bug catchers were all jugglers, and the lasses were all... Bruno of the Elite 4?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2cnifcI.png[/img]\r\n\r\nYup. The cute lasses are all now big burly men who give up to 1700pg when they get mopped up with. Joy to the fucking world.  Seriously though, its fucking hilarious watching Bruno of the elite 4 throw out hoppits and shit at times.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HUSsTME.png[/img]\r\nThat fucking face though.. Yeah. Let that haunt your dreams for a while. \r\n\r\nMount Moon was pretty shitty over all. Mons included a Vaporeon that wouldn&#039;t stay in the fucking ball, geodude, weedle, Aromatisse with earthquake, and Nidoqueen. I spent all 20 balls I bought at the store trying to catch one Vaporeon. Thanks capture rates.  Trainer battles were largely uneventful till I came across an Engineer who tossed out Dialga in my face.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RyUF51e.png[/img]\r\n\r\nThat thing just would not die and killed off everybody but Spoopers and Leaf. Continuing on, I found team rocket grunts are all now fisherman, I guess thats not completely wrong. One of the fisherman tossed out a Machamp and crushed poor spoopers. I was completely prepared to start over again, but a miracle happened. Leaf went and soloed the entire fucking zone.  Sustaining for fucking ever(or at least for 10 uses) with Draining Kiss, he butchered every trainer battle that came out way. We  worked our way up to the fossil room rather quickly after Spoops whent down. As long as the super nerd fight didn&#039;t have something with a fire type attack, this was gonna be easy.  Speaking of the super nerd, where as all the girls are replaced by swole as fuck men, the nerds are replaced by... Lance of the Elite 4. \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/r1uD5ow.png\r\n\r\nAgain, I guess thats not completely wrong.\r\n\r\nLance had an Arcanine that scared me for a second. Fortunately, he didn&#039;t have any fire type moves and was closed out quick. Mon 2, Nidorino and fire punch and cut Leaf down to about half and burned him. Draining Kiss put me back at full and ohko&#039;d him. Mon 3 was a weedle. Yeah. I took the helix fossil and beat feet right on out.\r\n\r\nEmerging from Mount Moon, I quick ran to the poke center and patched up. The escapade left Leaf 4 levels higher than the next two lowest and I&#039;m sure he could solo Misty without a rest at this point. \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gfenPVn.png[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis game is making me feel like i&#039;m a kid again. I don&#039;t know whats around the corner and everything feels refreshing to play. Totally need Nintendo to do this for real.","replies":[]}
