It usually takes about it day, so you should be able to buy some RP again soon!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-11-29T13:21:20.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simply wait for roughly 24-48 hours before trying again. Allow time for your previous purchases to clear. This usually occurs when someone makes multiple charges in a short time frame and continue to attempt more purchases when the previous ones haven't cleared. I would suggest not trying to make more attempts until you've waited at least 24 hours since your previous attempt. Sometimes these systems have a timer, and that timer could reset if you made another failed attempt.","replies":[{"poster":"Pater Tsouridios","date":"2017-11-29T13:23:14.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wait here 1 day","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-11-29T13:26:37.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many RP purchases have you made in the past few days? Have you checked your bank account to see if those charges have cleared or not? Sometimes it takes some charges longer to clear than others, and sometimes your bank may put a charge on hold if they notice an increase in activity, or unusual activity. I personally have waited as long as 3 days once and completely missed a sale. It sucks, but there isn't much you can do other than wait.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pater Tsouridios","date":"2017-11-29T13:23:56.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to wait for more ????","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pater Tsouridios","date":"2017-11-29T13:18:02.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"help me pls !!","replies":[]}]}
