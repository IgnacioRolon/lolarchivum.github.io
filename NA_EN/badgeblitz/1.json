You carry your weight, and then some of your teammates. Even that one guy always noobing a champ. You when matches. You get level 3 mastery and above...\n\n...\nAND THEN you run into a narcissistic \"I know everything about the game\" who just happens to main your champ, who goes \"wtf? what is that build?\"\nMe: \"A custom one\" (just about what I said)\nHim: \"He's not a magic type, he's jgl and physical\" (has no idea how effective my items are, AND is dying too much to tell me how to main my champ)\n-I main ww\nMe: I main ww, shut it. (Lvl 5 mastery) It's DESIGNED to not be the \"I know how to counter that build\" , that YOU use. (my gameplay was near-solid until THE WHOLE TEAM started dying.)\nAnother teammate: Caitlyn: Yep, ww has the worst build (has over twice as many deaths than kills, and more deaths than me for that matter.\n\nOr something along these lines? Anyway, our entire team was losing because of a FED Ashe, and one of our team was using Twitch in \"dangerous ways\", as in it-would-be-inting-if-he-missed-2-kills dangerous. His build was legit. He died more than me, and they IGNORED THAT to harass me; 3 of them. I jgl'd with ww properly, I got the herald, I backed them up... but they were just adhesive and dropped it on me.\n\nI spent so much time developing a COUNTER-PROOF build, that they didn't even know what to tell me to remove. It was MADE for when someone couldn't get \"blade of the ruined king\", or \"Black cleaver\", or \"Titanic hydra\" because of misfortune. That's how stupid it was. They couldn't call out a single thing I did wrong, because I wasn't. They just decided to harass me because they didn't want to admit that they were ALSO the reason we were losing.\nI reported everyone BUT Twitch that game.\nDoes anyone else experience this nonsense?\n\nRiot doesn't help by posting the BASIC \"This'll work\" builds online for everyone to build counters to. I had to use this build because I know everyone would counter ww, and I've SLAYNE other WW's with it.

It makes the game fun when you're dominating.\n\nThe thing is, WW has a bad moveset when it comes to crowd control. Mrs. fortune, Kayne, Ashe, Heimerdinger, Garen (to an extent) and other champs can target numerous champs at once and get an edge, but I have to selectively focus on one target as ww. No long ranged attacks that don't endanger ww to getting shut down, and having such a slow speed doesn't help. This means that in the latter part of the game I WILL die if I try ulting or pushing. I can only stun and even then, half of my HP would dissapear because they'd pile attacks and stuns on me. To avoid this, as well as to deal with superminions, I sell the jgl'ing item and switch to the vampiric scepter, which heals me against EVERYTHING, including the minions (more problematic at end game). I upgrade it to the blade of the ruined king to ensure that I'm not leaving any faults in my build, but that never fixes that I can't survive or take out more than 1 champ at a time because it endangers me. Especially against Nasus or Garen, and all I can do is distract by pushing other lanes, putting my team at a disadvantage in mid. THAT's why I have so many deaths, and my build was made to work against the awkward position riot put ww in.\n\nI spent up to this point trying several different builds and this is the one I developed. I think I'll switch to the black cleaver or blood thirster if this doesn't work out. Unless riot gives him a long ranged howl, or some non physical attack, he's not all that much of the mixed champion riot labelled him as.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2019-06-25T02:06:34.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW is more meant to be a early/mid game skrimishing Jungler.
