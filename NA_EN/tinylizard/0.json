I looked into what was going on, and it turns out that he is now locked (again) and I had to re-buy him to play him... Here's a picture. If you notice, Ezreal was purchased twice, as well as the skin... I hope this is a fixable error because otherwise I just lost a lot of my money (it was a gift but still...).","replies":[{"poster":"tinylizard","date":"2013-10-02T20:45:42.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much, it all worked great! :-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-10-02T05:06:06.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello tinylizard!\n\nAfter reviewing your message, it appears that you experienced an EXTREMELY rare bug regarding the League of Legends store.  To this end, I went ahead and performed an in-depth audit of your account.  From this audit, I was able to confirm that Ezreal was purchased twice due to this bug, and have gone ahead and refunded one of the Ezreal purchases back to you.  I also made sure to refresh the Pulsefire Ezreal skin on your account, and it should be able to be selected in Champion Selection!\n\nI hope this resolves your issues with League of Legends!  :)","replies":[]}]}
