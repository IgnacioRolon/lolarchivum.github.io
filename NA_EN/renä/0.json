Many of the responses that people are pushing are that's it's a Windows 10 update related problem, but how is that so?  All of the people experiencing this problem, including me, can use our side buttons in every other application/game. The side buttons even work while in the League Client (which I realize when I tried rebinding mouse buttons 4 &amp; 5), but once in game, the League of Legends application doesn't detect these two buttons.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T18:31:39.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The specific issue seems to be that the creator update was forcing the keys to work as OS inputs and not for in-game.  There could also be software being used for the mouse that can serve as the culprit.

Had to remap them to keyboard keys but because the LoL directly keeps changing, SteelSeries Engine won't consistently remap for just League so I've had to make that the standard.\n\nVery frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Milutin","date":"2017-07-19T23:26:02.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly!
