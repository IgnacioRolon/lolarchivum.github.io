Presumably, his account was hacked and his password was changed; the problem however, is that he can't remember the email he signed up with. \r\nWe've tried scourging the internet, but can't find a way for him to get his account back without the email he signed up with (which again, he has NO idea what it is)\r\nAre there options for account recovery in this situation? \r\n\r\nP.S. He does have knowledge of what skin/champions he did/didn't have, as well as what recent purchases were, account creation date, etc. if those things help at all. \r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-16T22:02:16.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While the original sign-up email is an important piece of info to help get your account back, it isn't 100% required.
