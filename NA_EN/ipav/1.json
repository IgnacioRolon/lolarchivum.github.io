Riot said they didn't want Akali's W to be countered by pink wards and changed it with the stealth update; however, now Teemo's own ult can be disabled by the control wards. Yes, everyone hates Teemo shrooms; however, it's come to the point where Teemo can no longer rely on his own ult. Imo, he needs some quality of life changes or at least an Alistar rework so he can at least contribute more to his team as right now, he's being countered by so many vision tools.\n\nImo, they should shift the power from his shrooms to other parts of his kit as it's indeed difficult to balance Teemo due to the nature of his traps. Perhaps a mushroom hopping technique where he can detonate mushrooms for his own mobility so he can actually live up to the title of the SWIFT SCOUT as right now, his W is laughable as an escape tool. He's considered immobile and  with his shrooms getting hits from duration cuts/damage nerfs/vision tools, he's just in general becoming less and less reliable.\n\nIf Riot really wants to preserve Teemo's kit, then I think they should focus on making Teemo play more like a true marksman with the kiting since the on-hit build is the one that is truly keep Teemo rather relevant in higher elos. AP Teemo is easily countered with the new tools as so much of his damage is concentrated in his shrooms and again, it's difficult to balance such an ult if it comes to the point where Riot had to add an item that can even disable his shrooms.  What I'd like to see for Teemo is for him to become a better pick for any team comp as his aggressive kit is punished due to how immobile and squishy his most popular build (AP) makes him to be. \n\nThanks for making this post iPav. Teemo in nature is a difficult champion to balance as his kit can easily dominate if it's too strong; however, as a result - he's forced to be kept weak due to the power of his shrooms. However, a potential mini rework at least could give him some quality of life changes so he can at least keep relevant to any team at this point of time. This isn't a time where Teemo shrooms would last for nearly a whole duration of a game, they only last for 5 minutes and can even be disabled as well - Teemo needs some quality of life changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-11-19T16:49:35.824+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the main issue is that his shrooms can get disabled in teramfights.\nHaveing tools to deal with his minefields is very important, and all direct the nerfs to his shrooms were perfectly justifyed(they also recived some buffs, bith direct and indirect aswell), but haveing that new throw and bounce mechanic to enable shrooms in direct fights just to see them getting disabled by serveral items is wrong.\nIt would be nice if shrooms in a certain are around teemo or for the first ~10sec after placeing couldn't be disabled, so he can actually use them properly duering fights.\n\nAlso, i wouldn't exactly say he's weak in high elo, his plat+winrate is a solid 50% even with the shrrom detection on duskblade, and the winrate for expereienced teemos is well above average, same for his lategame winrate.\nIf you reffer to master+,  there are A LOT of chammps that struggle at that elo, that's not a proper reason for buffs, just how the average struggle of Azir or Ryze is no reason to buff them. \nRiots delcard balanceing philosophy is balanceing around plat+, where teemo is fine, and dealing with outliners that dominate either low elo or highelo/proplay.\n\n**Teemo certainly needs changes**, and **not **straight buffs. He's not exactly weak and he remains one of the worst play-against cases in league.( I prefer faceing yasuo and pre nerf tank-ekko over faceing teemo any day)","replies":[]},{"poster":"hahahahaha xddd","date":"2016-11-24T22:23:50.667+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a plat teemo main.
