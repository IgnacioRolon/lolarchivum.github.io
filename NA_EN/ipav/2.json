So, if you blind someone who is already starting his attack animation (or the projectile is in flight for example) - you will still get hit (it also means that if enemy starts attacking while blinded and the blind runs out - the attack will still miss).\n- Buffered attacks also seem to go through blind. By that I mean - if you use ability while getting blinded the AA following that ability will hit. I am not 100% sure of that, as I didn't get to test it extensively (but that's the general feeling I get, especially from Yasuo Q->AA and Vayne Q->AA).

Teemo was able to blind her stun before. I done so in Pro king before & I still remember that game because I still lost...  Such a overloaded champ.. This blind for her stun much needed anyways because of that. \n\n& yeah it is. I tested it enough in bot games to know champs Like Xin still do damage though there Buffered attacks & it's annoying.

One is an ability that empowers a basic attack, the other's a straight-out ability that has nothing to do with an attack.\n\nThe range is completely irrelevant. Otherwise, Teemo would be useless against marksmen despite typically being called a counter to them, because his blind wouldn't affect them - after all, they're all ranged, and a lot of them have pretty high range, too.\n\nIt might help you to treat League as, y'know, a game. Hell, I'd compare it more with a TCG like Magic: The Gathering than something like a Mario game, because like MtG you have various rules created by various abilities that all interact in ways that may not make realistic sense in the slightest. On the flipside, you can generally know what to expect in a Mario game and it won't really change that on you, unless a very gimmicky gimmick is involved; it's only when you encounter glitches that the fact that the game is ultimately based on very specific rules that make not actually make sense comes to light.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2016-07-09T22:22:15.660+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo Blind Dart still Blinds Lee Sin and probably wont get fixed","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-07-10T03:39:56.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"according to chat in a hexakill game a jhin was shooting teemo through the blind too.","replies":[{"poster":"aLawfulFalafel","date":"2016-07-10T21:58:58.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can confirm this, have had jhin shoot me while blinded a few times, SO annoying when u blind on the 3rd shot forcing him to wait to take his 4th or flat out miss it just to have him 4th shot pop your head off through the blind and look at deathrecap to see jhin just did 1600 dmg from AAs to you while blinded","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talonted Noxian","date":"2016-07-10T21:57:34.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, this is a good post, and it needs to be clarified by Riot, hopefully. The last few seasons, Riot has taken the approach of making the game more understandable by all, and more \"clear\" what is happening in the game. Things like this, that are described on the Wiki as \"blocks some, but not all\" and then later \"most effects go through blind\" are very unclear, and a clarification would be a great addition to the game, as well as bug fixes (if those results are unintended).\n\nPerhaps a \"why\" would be helpful for more transparency as well. For example, WHY is renekton's W stun blocked by Teemo's blind, but Udyr's E stun is not? They're essentially the same things (a hit that applies a stun), but the result/outcome is 100% different.\n\nIf this is a bug, it'd be great to have it fixed.
