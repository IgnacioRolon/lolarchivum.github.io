With the way his kit works now, he gets:\nQ: Makes two blobs if he hits two separate targets with the second target being a Champion.\nR: Zac roots in place, becoming 300 units wide and scooping up units that enter... well, him. He then carries these units to a new position.\n\nI&#039;ve been pretty upset by the Zac changes, and it&#039;s mostly because his damage nerfs and his overall sustain / tankiness has taken a massive hit so he can&#039;t &quot;go in&quot; to a teamfight anymore. That being said, is he a tanky support for bot-lane now?\n\nLet me explain - he doesn&#039;t have healing or shielding for his ADC laning buddy, true, but he does have a huge zone-denial through his R that prevents enemies from wanting to dive his carry because he can pool in place, body-blocking a lot of skillshots, and then if the enemy tries to go in he can just scoop them to a bad position. If they don&#039;t go in, he can use the R to jump on them dealing some damage (but no CC) and then can snapcast his E in their face for a little more damage and knockback. Combine that with a point blank Q and he can pull an enemy ADC towards the minion line if he dove past it, and through his W he can generally generate some blobs off of minions to sustain himself and stay in lane.\n\nIn short, he&#039;s like a Braum who has an immobile &quot;shield&quot; tied to his ultimate but has a pseudo-pull on his Q and a short stun on his E. With his reduced damage output he&#039;s terrible everywhere, but as a Support he can stay in lane pretty well, doesn&#039;t need a ton of items to be tanky (Could build Face of the Mountain / Eye of the Equinox, Locket of the Iron Solari, Knight&#039;s Vow, etc.) and would be a good unit for peel if the enemy tried to dive his team.\n\nOn the other hand, he has trouble initiating on his own with the reduced E duration anymore, and using the R offensively has met with lots of lackluster results, but using it defensively seems like the way to go. With the reduced damage output he&#039;s not exactly intimidating in the least, so having a Bruiser / Tank / Assassin in the jungle that can actually have more of an impact when its dueling would probably be better for the rest of the lanes.\n\nHe honestly would be fine with Runing for botlane, too. He could take Marks of Armor, Seals of Health / Health Regeneration, Glyphs of Cooldown / Scaling Cooldown or Magic Resist / Scaling Magic Resist, and Quintessences of Health / Health Regeneration / Armor / Etc. Since he has no damage he could just build pure support-y tank and be fine. He&#039;s definitely not tanky enough anymore to be the &quot;main frontline tank&quot; with his decreased blob (and therefore health) generation and limited movement to pick up the blobs, but in botlane it would be less of an issue and his blob generation could actually be used as a way to bait some of the laners out of position as they try to punish Zac for his own health regeneration by stepping out to poke him or to try and crush his blobs. The &quot;contestable range&quot; for Zac&#039;s blobs landing between him and his enemy is 1,000 units, so since most of the botlane units tend to &quot;stay away&quot; from each other this would give him a better chance to actually sustain and stay alive or bait the enemy into getting close, which is what he obviously would like to set up his carry.\n\nObviously using the &quot;E&quot; to initiate on its own is a bad idea - it never is good to use it when the enemy can anticipate and plan it - especially in botlane where counterpicks like Janna exist and could make Zac worthless, but combined with a Jungler gank or following his R it could be quite reliable in setting up his ADC partner for success. His E used in conjunction after his ADC partner lands a slow / root could also help him to set up without the aide of a Jungler (thanks to Yung Hulu for pointing this out.)\n\nWhat are your guys&#039; thoughts? Have they done a patch similar to Graves where they tried to update the &quot;theme&quot; of a champ and totally switched their position on the map?","replies":[{"poster":"Nymzo","date":"2017-05-07T14:23:15.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, no.\n\nAs much as he has good cc, his e duration got nerfed and his q, while good in 2 vs 2, won't help too much in teamfight. And while his ult is good for peeling, you also bring yourself with the enemy. Making you an easy target to kill.\n\nWhich bring me to my next point, you see because tank supports have to spend gold and up to 2 item slot on support items while also having a budget, they are very likely to be less tanky then other tanks. However, most tank supports have an ability that make them tanky for a few seconds, countering that huge weakness for some time. There's Leona's w, Braum's e, Ali's ultimate or Tahm's e for example.\n\nBut because {{champion:154}} was not designed to be a tank support, he doesn't have such a spell, he's (ironically) squishy than them. And of course because right now, every support is forced to buy {{item:3107}} and{{item:3190}}, he's even less tanky because Redemption gives nothing to him but health and an active.","replies":[]},{"poster":"muted team chat","date":"2017-05-07T18:36:35.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's nothing now","replies":[]},{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-05-08T01:18:15.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac rework is a JOKE. You can't do anything; inane impractical Q and R, rest of his kit is dragged down into obsolescence.

I was questioning this about him and Maokia last night. Plus think about any adc with a snare or maybe slow can combo with Zac for his ULT.","replies":[{"poster":"Rogue of Time","date":"2017-05-07T12:42:50.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly. His kit is too unreliable on his own but with a little bit of help he can perform more consistently. Being in a lane with a partner that has slows and/or roots would be great for him, and the possibility of having Zac possibly get a jungler to help **him** in his lane would also allow him an easier time to set up for his team.\n\nIt's weird that he's lost his identity as the \"main initiator\" from extreme distances for his team, but I honestly think he's a more \"defensive\" champion now that has the option to initiate if he wants to attempt to.","replies":[]}]}]}
