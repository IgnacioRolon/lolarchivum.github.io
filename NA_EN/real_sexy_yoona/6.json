Playing defensively would give them a free win in lane so we went all in and destroyed them. After lowering caitlyn&#039;s health bar from previous trades where i auto and shield myself while dodging brand spells, I took 2 points on W level 3 and flash W, ignite and autoed the enemy ad. Cait died wasting both her sums, I got first blood, didn&#039;t die, snowballed and won. Other lanes were loosing, which meant they four man roamed us bot, but Viktor and I actually carried the game. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know about yall, but I kinda like how non-marksmen champions can fill in the ADC role and come off as viable without bringing back the &quot;ADC in 2017 LUL&quot; meme. I&#039;m seeing more creative games, comps, skirmishes, and team-fights due to this. Janna&#039;s passive actually enhances Viktor&#039;s ability to kite, and her shield + disengages give him more time to spam his spells. They are both champs who annoy you because they always seems to be faster than you, put them together in a lane as partners and see what happens. \r\n\r\nAfter hitting Diamond in NA, I got sick of the game and didn&#039;t play much. Currently, I&#039;m in Korea enjoying league because the games here are a lot more creative and I&#039;m exposed to new play styles. \r\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}} \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, \r\nI know everyone thinks janna is a easy shield-bot champion that&#039;s broken but I see her as a broken champion that can be beyond god-like broken if you perfect her mechanics (which imo is harder than you think, I&#039;ve flash tornadoed a predicted kaisa ult before. Janna can be obnoxious). \r\nHer early damage is good, so she can be played aggressively. When games end in a 15-20min stomp, more often than not, I do more damage than my ADC and MId. Meta slaves who play janna in a brain-dead-shield-bot manner might play her well, but please, don&#039;t group us janna mains together with them.
