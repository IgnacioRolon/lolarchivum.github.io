Mind you, I'm connected to an Ethernet cable and have 15 ping the entire time. I waited for a good 3 minutes and the client told me to restart if things didn't get better so I did. I re-opened the client and tried to log in but its stuck at authenticating for over 10 minutes now (watched pokimane's new video). It doesn't give me the \"login failed attempt 1 attempt 2...\" thing in the old client? \r\n\r\nIt's simply stuck at authenticating. My internet is fine and I already initiated full repair... what is happening?","replies":[{"poster":"SnowLizrd","date":"2017-10-07T16:09:43.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 days later and I still can't get past the login screen....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T16:36:40.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were ISP issues last night causing a disruption which should be resolved now, but I'm concerned about this bugsplat issue.  That can happen if your drivers or something else fails to render the game properly.  You should try a custom game to make sure it doesn't happen again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sanshaoye","date":"2017-10-04T11:53:23.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're not alone. it's happening to me and most other players i know","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muffles","date":"2017-10-04T08:05:35.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ISP?","replies":[]}]}
