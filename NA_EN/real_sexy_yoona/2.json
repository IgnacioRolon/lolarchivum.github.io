This was fine in the new client as well until I started playing other champs and my background art changed multiple times. When I got Lux back as the background art, it was the classic lux there and not the Elementalist lux. \r\nThis is quite important to me because although classic lux is pretty, I like her with more hair showing- which is true for elementalist lux. \r\n\r\nPlease help me. I tried looking up other forums and still don't know what to do. This problem is harder than landing a lux Q on fiddlesticks{{champion:9}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-08T21:56:12.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be a bug!

I did as you said (equipped a Elementalist Lux icon) and it worked. So I guess it was me switching around icons that caused this \"problem\". \nAnd it was intentional that a person has to have an Elementalist Lux icon on for the Elementalist Lux background art to work?\nEdit: oh... it works the same way with my DJ Sona icons. Sorry for wasting your time, it wasn't a bug or problem at all. Thank you so much!
