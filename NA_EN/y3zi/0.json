I can understand people doing bad or having fun, practice a new champion in a normals or ARAM. But what is going on with these ranked games? I have played league for 7 years, from college time till now, so much time and so much money into the game I love. And I only gets to play couple games after work now, why do my games gets ruined and my time gets wasted by those trolls. I&#039;m not talking about having a bad game, but trolls in general. (not the first time got intted, but this time got two trolls as a duo).","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-12-24T14:42:26.091+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Tis the season when people come on, play drunk and dare people to do silly things. \n\nJust the seasonal  things.","replies":[{"poster":"Muatta","date":"2018-12-24T16:04:12.772+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"That isn't a seasonal thing... it is a trash league of legends community thing.

They are clearly as pathetic as the trolls in their game.  They enjoy watching decent people dealing with the trash behavior that is exhibited way too often.  There is a 90% chance to get 3 to 4 toxic losers in matches.  I promise you these losers don't act like that in their real life.  They are probably the cowards who say yes sir to everything.  So, they come in here and direct their anger at someone who can't respond back.  They are absolutely the jokes of our society.","replies":[]}]}
