I asked him if he was able to change the Kog'Maw model to the picture below. He said I should bring it to the boards and hope a dev noticed it. He also supplied me with ability icons aswell.\r\n\r\n[New Model](https://imgur.com/jEc6Qw6)\r\n\r\n[Abilities](https://imgur.com/pielPBt)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T04:01:27.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOOOOOO I thought dem icons looked a little familiar though fam hahaha xD! \n\nGreat ideas, love the hard work!
