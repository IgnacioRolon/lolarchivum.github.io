I was playing one of my first games as yasuo. And up until the first time I said \"I've been ganked how many times now ugh\" is when our jungler started going ham and telling me im bad, and everything's my fault, and etc. Everyone else also started ganging up on me on everything I said or did, etc. That i was only good as a shield. So you can imagine your entire team and the enemy team having full on discussions about how bad you are while the yasuo on the other team is so much better. I would get random pings and \"there goes yasuo bot\", \"get him\", etc etc. It was quite confusing and annoying. To the point where I just didn't want to play anymore, the team was so toxic. but I still trumped through, and continued farming minons and pushing bot lane while everyone was mid. Where I would get another round of criticism for going bot lane, another round of your useless blah blah. The jungler then googles my stats and starts saying all these horrible things about how I only have a 22% win rate etc I suck. So then the game ends and everyone on my team reports me- convinced by the jungler. These people are actually horrible, like I have never seen such despicable people in my life with such horrible bullying attitudes. Anyways, somehow I got a perma ban. And it was only two days ago I think that I spent $20 for a new skin. I was wondering if there was any way to get that money back- cause i feel i absolutely did not deserve this.

I wish I had screenshotted stuff during the game actually cause much worse things were said. \r\n\r\nSo I'm thinking of quitting the game for good now, never looking back. But unfortunately I had just spent $20 like a day or two ago. I really wish that I hadn't. And I probably will never spend anything on this game again.

If any number of reports greater than zero are filed, the match is reviewed.\n\nYou may be seeing a pattern, but you could be misunderstanding it.","replies":[{"poster":"The 13th","date":"2019-08-13T21:41:09.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Possibly, but we won't know. I'm giving an example of what I'm seeing and what others are experiencing.

I highly doubt that is real code from the IFS too because it's way too generic.

Strictly speaking: **One report is all it takes. Multiple reports have no greater effect than one report.**\n\n> I highly doubt that is real code from the IFS too because it's way too generic.\n\nWell, as someone who's dabbled in Python coding (which very likely isn't the language used for the IFS, but it's similar enough to understand), I can tell you that that code is pretty fuckin' legit.\n\nIt's an If statement where a variable (reports) is called and checked to see if a player was reported. It takes the amount of reports (a range from 0 to 9) and returns the value as a boolean flag based on whether or not the value of reports is higher than 0.\n\nAnd a boolean value is either True or False, and so the report range would read like this:\n\n0 = False\n1 = True\n2 = True\n3 = True\n...\n7 = True\n8 = True\n9 = True\n\nIn other words; if nobody reported the player, the review() function isn't called. Any number of reports higher than 0 (I.E, 1-9), evaluate to True, meaning that how many reports are filed doesn't matter - they all resolve to a binary boolean value, so there's no benefit to having multiple reports against someone compared to a singular report.\n\nAs for the review() function, that'd be a whole 'nother mess of code defined earlier in the program, and considering that it's \"review()\" and not \"review(reports)\", I can easily assume that it doesn't factor in the amount of reports filed against a player, since that's generally how functions work - if a function call needs to use a variable or the like, it has to be passed as an argument in the parentheses.\n\n> Also, I read that Riot will place less importance on you reporting someone if you always submit reports...\n\nReport weighting isn't a thing. I can't seem to find the quote at the moment, but basically, since the IFS discards invalid reports, there's no need to lessen the value of frequent reporters - all reports have the same value, no matter if you take the machine-gun approach or report carefully and accurately.\n\n'Cause, at the end of the day, it's the review that matters when it comes to the punishment, not the reports.\n\n> ...which means if that code is real, there's some calculation within the review function that determines how much weight is placed on a report.\n\nAs I said above, the review() function doesn't pass the reports variable as an argument, so the value assigned to reports isn't considered during the review.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-08-13T21:59:27.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The 13th,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=50zH1Y3v,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-13T17:29:29.865+0000)\n>\n> Can I ask how you know this?

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player):\n\n> It only takes one report for our systems to review a game.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player):\n\n> Do not threaten or repeatedly tell a player you will report them. Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n> \n> Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.\n\nPermabans are a punishment, not a free name change.\n\nAs for the reason you were banned, you spent the whole damn match flaming your team. I'm guessing the two-week gap in your match history between 5/25 and 6/10 was a 14-day suspension, during which you were very clearly told to cut it out and behave. Instead, you decided that \"ur bad\" and \"free mid then\" and \"what a dumb idiot\" and \"suck my balls\" and \"suck it\" and \"afk\" and \"fk u g uys\" and \"nah fk this team\" and \"reported\" and \"im reporting entire team except mord\" and \"and im reporting u all\" would be good and appropriate things to say, interspersed with all your other general arguing and bickering.\n\n> So I'm thinking of quitting the game for good now, never looking back.\n\nThat's exactly what Riot wants you to do. They would rather permabanned players quit forever and never spend any more money than have those permabanned players make a new account and continue to drive away dozens or hundreds of customers.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkCaves","date":"2019-08-13T05:56:43.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you care if I copy this for a discord I'm in?
