He can connect without any issues and I can't. I was able to play a game directly before the patch. Now I get the black screen when trying to connect to a game. I'm attempting a repair atm to see if that fixes it. Anyone have any ideas for a fix?\n\nEDIT: Repairing did not fix the issue\n-Made sure I added any and all exceptions to windows firewall and defender, even tried disabling both of them and it didn't work.\n-I've restarted my computer completely and I still get the black screen.\n-It's all game modes.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T23:52:08.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black firewall screen is often the result of your connection not being stable to the servers.

I did a region change and then changed back and whatever it patched fixed the issue.\n\nEXAMPLE: Change to Latin America North or EUW and the game will patch for their location.  Close then re-open league and change back to NA. It should patch again. I'm guessing it applies the most recent patch for that region and as a result fixed whatever issue the game was having.","replies":[]}]}
