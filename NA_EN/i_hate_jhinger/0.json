If you don't maintain a stable and consistent connection, it won't know to pull up the end of game stats screen, or you may get random DC's.  In order to fix this, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#section-mac).

Thanks for taking your time to try help me out!\n\nI have read over the Connection Issues Guide. I tried to figure out what it was that was causing me to disconnect from PvP.net but I still can't seem to find out what's going on.  I noticed that even when I'm ingame and having no lag issues, when I alt + tab out and check the client it just says either that I have been disconnected from chat or the other message (I forget what exactly it is). Sometimes after the game the end game stats still show up but before that it shows that I've been disconnected. I'm still really confused what's going on, so sorry!","replies":[]}]}]}
