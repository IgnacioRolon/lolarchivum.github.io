Even if it only happens once a month.\n\nedit: Here's an example of one of my favorite \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/TKuEoFYw-ask-a-zyra-main-completed","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2018-06-23T02:01:09.139+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Welcome to: Ask a Shen main\n\nQ: So, what made you pick up Shen originally?\n\n{{champion:98}} Well, he was a champion originally about shutting down high snowball champions like Riven and Nasus early on. You needed to be ready to be walled off in the early laning phase around a Shen who used his poor pushing power and innate sustain to good use. I also really liked how he was a tank who could use his shield to redirect damage and save allies in the nick of time with his ultimate just to dash in and save the day.\n\nYou know, before Riot reworked him, taking away his scaling base damages and replacing it with a great dueling tool that is a reverse skillshot. You know, until they nerfed it. Then they took away his sustain in exchange for high base HP regen. Which they also nerfed.\n\nQ: Um...\n\n{{champion:98}} Oh yeah, let's not forget that his shield hardly lasts at all anymore, got nerfed as well despite not being on demand or controllable. Or the spirit anchor you have to drag around the map like a stubborn dog on a leash.\n\nQ: R-right, next quest-\n\n{{champion:98}} Ohoh, and how could I forget what they did to his ultimate? Hoo boy. A shield that is now useless until you use it when it's too late. The ultinate cooldown reduction that got increased again for \"balance reasons.\" Apparently the 1.75 second dodge on a 16 second cooldown that eats up a portion of my absurdly large energy bar that takes forever to replenish was too much for our darling top laners like Gnar and Fiora. Which, by the way, have like 200 more base HP than our friend Shen here, despite having far more powerful tools and faster and smoother flowing kits.\n\nQ: Why are you still filming? Shut off the camera!\n\n{{champion:98}} Oh boy, I *love* getting pushed out of top lane into the jungle. Then getting pushed out of the jungle into support. Then getting pushed out of support into being THE SHOE SHINING BITCH OF TOP LANE!\n\nQ: Hey! Ow, stop! Let go of my lapels!\n\n{{champion:98}} WHY DOES SINGED GET TO FREELY FUCK UP EVERY MELEE IN TOP LANE WHILE I GET OUT-TANKED BY JHIN AND KINDRED?!? WHY SHOULD I EVER PLAY SHEN AS A TANK IF ALL YOU DO IS FORCE HIM TO USE HIS TOOLS TO BE TANKY, THEN MAKE HIS TOOLS CLUNKY AND WEAK?!? GET OFF ME!\n\nSecurity Guard: Calm down!\n\n{{champion:98}} YOU'RE ALL INSANE! Is... is that a syringe?!? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?\n\nQ: Keep him still. He knows too much.\n\n{{champion:98}} NO! NOO! NOOOOOO-oh...\n\nQ: Dump him somewhere outside Chicago city limits. Make sure he doesn't remember anything about this.\n\n##Sadly, we will no longer be resuming our Ask a Main series.

The reasoning behind maining a champion is pretty important to players, so being able to share it with the community would be a great opportunity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-06-22T18:47:04.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ask an Ekko Main right here :).","replies":[]}]}
