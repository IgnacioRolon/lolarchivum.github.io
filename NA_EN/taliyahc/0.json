So players will spend RP and/or they add something new to the game. Although we know which one of those is the main motivation, since Riot is a company after all.\n\nKeeping that in mind - When you look at the five roles, which ones make you money?\n\n* Jungle? Sure.\n* Top? Yeah.\n* Mid? Oh hell yes.\n* ADC? It's okay.\n* Support? Not even close.\n\nAs autofill has so succinctly demonstrated, there just aren't enough support mains in League for a multitude of reasons. If you want a new champ to have a chance at making bank, you don't make it a support. Or if you **do** make it a support, you make it a support that can also solo lane {{champion:223}} or is meant to played exclusively somewhere other than bot lane {{champion:427}}.\n\nBot lane support champs just don't sell. It's like putting in eight months of work designing a champion that can only be played on Twisted Treeline, it's not going to make back enough income to justify the time and effort spent creating it.\n\nUntil the support role becomes more popular, we wouldn't expect too many new champions to be released exclusively for the role that is so unpopular it creates unhealthy queue times. The best we can hope for is a support than can also top, mid, or jungle at the same time. At least until the balance team figues out you can't have a champion with a support's kit and power curve going healthily to solo lanes so they end up getting nerfed in every role except support.\n\nSound familiar, Mr. Kench? How's the tadpoles? You should bring them by top lane one of these days, we haven't seen you around those parts for a year or more.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyahc","date":"2017-02-14T17:15:56.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally think you're wrong. For example look at bard, sure he was weak at release but when he got some buffs and people started getting used to his really cool utility kit he sold like crazy. He now has a large fan base and a lot of players have his skins too. Thresh sold well, Braum sold well. As long as the kit is new in thematics players are bound to pick up the champion and try them out.\n\nThe reason bot lane is the least exciting is because IT IS SO BORING... same matchups over and over. Only new supports we've gotten are the bs damage mage supports, maybe if Riot would just throw in a new support down in the bot lane it would spice things up and add some much needed variety that isn't cancerous and unwanted.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2017-02-14T17:43:19.243+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thresh sold well because he made being a support about as idiotproof as you can possibly get without playing Sona or Blitzcrank and he was more appealing thematically (\"I'm going to RIP OUT YOUR SOUL AND EAT IT\" vs \"look I have a string piano lol\"). Braum was another support with an awesome identity (League's manly man of manliness!).\n\nMeanwhile, let's look at the other supports. We got a mermaid that throws water, a goat with no clear theme other than stars (which heal? what?), a girl from band camp, an old guy with a clock, and Tornado Girl. Morgana has an edgy, aggressive theme but as an old champ her VO is REALLY limited. Taric was funny, but pre-update he had a pretty boring story.

He's the posterchild, the chosen one, the \"Hey look, support can be fun\" guy. He's very popular... among support mains. Which League has a significant lack of. And just like Thresh, he's not enough to carry the role on his own shoulders. People haven't started playing support just to play Bard; at least not in numbers large enough to save queue times.\n\nSpeaking of Thresh, he was on his way out before Bard came and took his spot. He was really something back in season 3 when he debuted with that overloaded kit and his jack of all trades playstyle. But as other champs debuted or got reworked to have more and more tools in their kits as well, he began to be less and less special. He's not really that big of a deal anymore.\n\nBraum _seems_ like he's popular, but players like the **idea** of Braum rather than actually playing **as** him. People love Braum... but when's the last time you saw someone actually play him? I saw one (attempt to) go top lane a few months ago; before that... I honestly can't remember. Players want his upbeat attitude, his manly punching, his love of poros, and his godly facial hair. They also want him **not** to be a support so they can play him in roles they enjoy. That's why when he first debuted he was like Kench; played top, mid, and jungle in addition to support. After he was nerfed to keep him in bot lane, his playrate fell off dramatically.\n\nSame with Taric, his rework made him popular for a month or so, then people realized that \"Oh crap, if I want to play this guy I have to support\" and then he settled at the bottom of the popularity list. (That's not completely true as I do enjoy taking Taric top lane, but I would never claim it's standard play)\n\nIt's a pretty clear message: It doesn't matter how cool a support we construct, the hype will die down quickly as long as the support role is in the shape it's in. We can extend this hype and artificially increase sales by releasing the champion overtuned enough that they can go to more popular roles; but once those sales start to slip those champs receive a beating from the nerf bat.

Players refusing to play support is a symptom of the support role being the way it is. Those things are inherently connected because they cause each other. The vast majority of players just do not enjoy the playstyle of being a support; and that's their right if they refuse. If you boot up a video game primarily for enjoyment purposes, it's not asking too much to be placed in a situation you find enjoyable much of the time.\n\nRiot knows that most of their playerbase are kill hungry bastards. As long as they continue to mold the game to be conducive to that they can expect a high turnover rate from month to month. This is why \"support\" champs like Zyra and Brand continue to be allowed to go bot; because those are the champs you take bot lane if you're a kill hungry bastard.\n\nHowever, that is not a long term solution. Riot can either make the support role more popular with game mechanics and updates, or they can force their players into it with autofill. One of those is a much better solution than the other, but takes much more effort in return. We can only hope one day that the support role is updated so that kill hungry bastards won't mind going there, thus removing the bottleneck the lack of support mains have on ranked, and allowing Riot to disable autofill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2017-02-15T07:06:46.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly this. \n\nSupport isn't the issue, selfish players who can't stand not being the center of attention in a 5 man team game are the problem.
