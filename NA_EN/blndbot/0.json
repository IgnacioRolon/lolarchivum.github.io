The bonus skins were supposed to roll out today, August 17. I had purchased at least 12+ mystery skins during the time there were available, and only got 1 Bonus Skin, even though I should have at least gotten 2, since I bought at least 12+ during the promotional period.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-18T01:06:54.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GraveLordBlndbot,\n\nWe're [still distributing](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/tXjcpYAU-act-3-questions-about-the-bilgewater-event-we-got-you-covered-reward-distribution-on-going) the free mystery skins, hang tight!","replies":[]}]}
