Silver 2+ (NO EXCEPTIONS).","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Player Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello people my name is Nick also known as xxxgunz4nickxxx (Getting Name Change Soon 11.3k ip) and I am creating a fairly serious ranked team. I currently am gold 4 in my promos 1-1. I main jungle and love gragas/voli the most. I have a fairly small champion pool but I can get by just fine. Now for this ranked team I plan on making it fairly serious with 3 practice days a week (Possible more). Now I am looking for younger people that do not have jobs, college or anything in the way. I Admit I do not have a life but looking for people almost on the same boat. Some days I understand missing a practice but give a 3 day+ notice if possible. We will take vacations off like the 4th of July and other stuff. This team will participate in lower elo tournaments for golds/plats. There is a application and rules you will have to follow to stay on the team.\r\n\r\nOP.GG Guide:\r\nThis is for if you do not know what op.gg is. It it tells stats of players so I want it in your application so I do not have to go through each one and type it in. Helps when going through countless applications. So go to http://na.op.gg/ and type your name in. Then just copy the link and put it under the op.gg part in the application.\r\n\r\nRules: btw if google docs list doesn't work please say. Will fix.\r\n- Be Able to attend ALL times in EST and I am not converting over other timezones. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWh5jqt80ejeN745MYelrqibfJGINuImAoz6rb7ORsQ/pubhtml \r\n- Do not rage. Rager's bring down the attitude of the game. Also try not to be silent during a bad game.\r\n- If you can not make a practice please tell me 3 days beforehand and rarely miss them.\r\n- Have CURSE AND RAIDCALL available. We will be using curse at the start but will move over to raidcall possibly.\r\n- Be able to take criticism and talk with the team about theirs. Don't blame but give them advice.\r\n- Have at least 80 ranked games played this season 30+ in the role (May vary on lane)\r\n- Have internet with NO LAG (99% of the time) if you lag on the first days your automatically off the team.\r\n- Main the role. 2 roles max on the applicaiton\r\n- If you can take a loss leave now. You must be able to take a loss even if its the 2nd game. Unless there is a clear problem with a player the first 5 games will be played with the same roster and will make changes if needed after.\r\n- Silver 2+ Rank NO EXCEPTIONS\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\nRole:\r\nRank:\r\nAge:\r\nWhat you want to be called:\r\nTime Zone (Team TimeZone is EST when talking about scheduling and such):\r\nChampion Pool:\r\nStrengths:\r\nWeakness(YOU HAVE LOTS):\r\nop.gg:\r\ncurse/raidcall?(yes/no):\r\nYou can go along with the schedule 99% of the time?(yes/no):\r\nHave you read all the rules and agree to them?(yes/no):\r\nDays you are not available(Consistently):\r\n\r\nReposting from http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/YRbU6oyd-creating-serious-ranked-5s-team-silver-2-no-exceptions\r\nbut please put replies down below.","replies":[{"poster":"Gunnlaug","date":"2015-06-01T20:00:53.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Role: ADC or Support\nRank: Silver 1\nAge: 16\nWhat you want to be called: Axle, Ivy or Claw, either works.\nTime Zone (Team TimeZone is EST when talking about scheduling and such): EST\nChampion Pool: \nADC: {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} No particular order\nSupport: {{champion:412}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:267}} No particular order\nStrengths:Mechanics, game knowledge, Tracking laners, timers, positioning, catching back up if I fall behind and a good habit of muting the haters.\nWeakness(YOU HAVE LOTS): Multitasking, communication(chatwise), I have a bad habit of underestimating most of my in-game opponents and usually lose 1v1s when i could've just taken an extra minute to size them up.\nop.gg:http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=the+claw+kid\ncurse/raidcall?(yes/no): Yea, I have curse i can get raidcall if needed\nYou can go along with the schedule 99% of the time?(yes/no):Yep\nHave you read all the rules and agree to them?(yes/no):Yep\nDays you are not available(Consistently): If there's any day, it's Saturday, I have scheduled sports and meetings to go to most of the time.
