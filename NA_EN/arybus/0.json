To them League is only a well full of water and once the well is empty they'll just dig a new well somewhere else and the only concern they will ever have for the old well is the fill up the hole so no one falls and gets them in trouble. So my request for Tencent is to help your products be the best they can be and stop trying to suck as much money as you can then ditch it when your done with it.
