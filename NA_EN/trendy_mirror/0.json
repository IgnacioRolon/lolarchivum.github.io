I legit spent 15 bucks JUST to get the original icon, the contrast was SO much better and I LOVED the rainbow border. I feel like Riot basically just spit in my face and said \"thanks for the fifteen bucks, now you don't get to fully enjoy what you paid for.\" \n\nActually pretty annoyed at this. Can we a least get the _option_ for black background with rainbow border/rainbow background with no border? This one just feels so much harsher on the eyes...","replies":[]},{"poster":"JooshBox","date":"2017-09-04T02:27:01.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh shit if it gets reverted I'll definitely switch back.
