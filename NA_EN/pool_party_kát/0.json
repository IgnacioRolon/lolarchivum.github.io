And these stupid things aren't even able to be deleted **at all**. \r\nThey are just in the way and stuck there to be **mis-clicked** or for the game to **suddenly switch** to when you're trying to make **last second** changes to your rune page.\r\nI sincerely hope that either an option to delete them or Riot games removing them completely on their own would be implemented within the very near future...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-29T04:35:44.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaa we can't really make these kinds of changes here in Help & Support, but I definitely agree with wanting those hidden a bit more. They're here for newer players or those who are lower level, so we don't need to get rid of them entirely just yet. Hopefully once enough time passes or enough people talk about it we'll start to see some changes ^_^.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-28T00:37:59.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"also a plus one, even though this isn't something help and support can do :(\n\nI'd recommend sliding right over to the developers' proverbial DMs (they aren't actually direct, and they're more threads than messages) on the [Gameplay boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) and suggesting this so that way they'll hopefully do it :(","replies":[{"poster":"Pool Party K치t","date":"2017-11-28T00:40:41.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't post in any other discussion apart from help and support cause the sites messed up ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-28T00:45:31.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try now?
