'7 day ban for toxicity' \nI didn't pay attention too closely, and also I clicked something when I first re-logged after the ban, so I thought I was perma-banned(as this being the first ban that was long the previous one I just logged out and played some other game) so, I am currently re-installing the game and checking to see if it was a perma-ban or a 7 day ban(which should be cleared since it has been a month).\nhopefully I can keep my $3000 account.\nOne more thing about the game, there is zero indication for how long you will be banned for. This is the reason why I thought I was perma-banned(idk still if I am or not) no indication of the duration, the reason, nor by whom.(except for the first time you log in to the game)\nAlso, to everyone who thinks I'm toxic all the time, harassing players, being racist to others, I am pretty chill most of the time. Most times I take it as a joke you know, teenage talk. But if they keep coming at me with like 'You are trash uninstall plz' or 'why do you play this game go kys' like that I respond with fire. When they cross the line, I don't care.\nUpdate: I logged in and now it only says: 10-game chat restriction, still downloading the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ID das","date":"2018-04-06T02:36:43.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"also\nI can still purchase rp on a perma-banned account. money whores smh...\njust delete my acc pls I'm done with this game","replies":[{"poster":"YoNightmare7","date":"2018-04-06T03:15:05.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm sorry for your parents money but you deserved it :p","replies":[{"poster":"imperiorgamer","date":"2018-04-06T07:15:00.534+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thats a down vote.
