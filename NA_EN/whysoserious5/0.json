I know that most people will say that old Galileo was bad and yes in some patches he was but when it comes down to it if they reworked just the hit boxes and worked on dmg scaling he really wasn't that bad. So please rework Galileo.... thanks for listening to my TED talk.","replies":[{"poster":"BigFBear","date":"2020-02-26T06:23:50.009+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's revert Galileo and make the earth center of the universe again!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CRIMSONFKR","date":"2020-02-26T06:11:45.250+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"Seriously old Galio was a snore fest he wasn't fun to play as or play against and all he really was a glorified flash ult bot.\n\nJust leave Galio as he is now.","replies":[{"poster":"DaCurtis","date":"2020-02-26T06:51:37.833+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Old galio had the most satisfying gameplay out of the two. \nThe feeling of getting a 5 ult taunt is so much better than new galios limp dick ultimate.\nNothing will come close to old galio's shield either, it was fun as fuck watching the heals go up.\nNew galio holds nothing the old galio had, and from someone who mained him, fuck you for saying he wasn't fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2020-02-26T14:40:15.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That was literally it.

Old galio was consistently one of the least played champs in the entire game because he was so incredibly boring and his kit made absolutely no sense.

Every champ with a TP ult is abused by pros and neefed into the ground {{champion:3}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:223}} . These champs get nerfed into the ground and have insanely high CD ults anyone who isn’t a pro can’t use effectively. It’s 90% of thier power budget and its what fucks them. Look how much they nerf the spell TP. Then your champ gets a free one, so they remove all other mechanics from that champ and the pros STILL pick them lmao.","replies":[]}]}
