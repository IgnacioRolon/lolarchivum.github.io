I was first pick and i could here it ticking down but I tried hitting every imaginable set of keys to see something and clicking where i thought the ban buttons would be but nothing worked. Needless to say i was kicked for queue dodging and lost 3 LP and got a 5 minute timer. Is this being looked at being fixed? Does riot know about this? If it continues will lost LP be awarded back? Edit: It happened again right after I joined another game. Read a little and it seems collapsing the friends list works to stop it. Lost another 10 LP and a 30:00 min timer. Awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-03-04T18:41:17.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seconded, although I simply get kicked out of queue over and over; whatever they were trying\nto accomplish by making a new client when this is what we get is beyond me. \nYes, I read all the flowery blubbergush, but fact is the\ngame hates the new client and the smallest tweak seems to have the potential to make it all unplayable!\nFrom day one, it's been inferior in any and all ways from what we had before.\n\nHate to rant but this really just came to a head for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlamDunk4561","date":"2017-03-04T03:50:31.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me too 2 times in a row, now i'm on timer too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chargingspartan","date":"2017-03-04T03:29:49.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got that too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Kel","date":"2017-03-03T21:53:54.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an exactly same issue today.
