It will be organized and run by me and my staff members (mods). Planning on 1v1 tournaments/ team tournaments. I'm wondering is there any special permission to run a tournament, if so who do I talk to. I'm hoping to get more people to join and get involved and have fun. Ill write out specialized rules (No toxicity since I changed my behavior and not toxic anymore)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T20:36:04.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've actually got a special website to help with running these special events!
