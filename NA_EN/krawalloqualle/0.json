Now can't do anything...","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I was disconnected from a game and couldn't do anything to reconnect. Started lol several times but it always gave an error \"Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.\" My network connection is fine, I tried shutting down the firewall, I tried it from a different computer (also my friend is now playing lol on the computer and it works fine for him...).\r\nThis was 1 1/2 hours ago. It still says, I'm ingame and should try to reconnect when I log in (also, logging in is astonishing longer than normal) and gives an error if I try.\r\nI had this a few months ago. But back then, I could start a new game by the time the old one would have been over.\r\nWhat the hell is going on there? o.O\r\nDid the server crash and takes forever to be shut down so I am released and free to join another?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T21:52:11.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To answer your question directly, it is entirely possible that is what happened.  If the individual Game Server crashed, or if someone attempted to Drop Hack the server (very unlikely), it may take the game server a couple of hours to 'release' everyone from the game.  This is commonly called \"Ghost Games\".  Given its been about 1.5 hours, give it some extra time and you should be able to play another game soon!\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing any issues!","replies":[]}]}
