For this reason, a trend of consistently good behaviour must be seen on your account before you'll earn loot back. \n\nThere's no way to calculate or directly know how long the reform period is, as that information could be used to work around the system. I definitely recommend checking out the [Loot Restrictions Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions) we've written.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
