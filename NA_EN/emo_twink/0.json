Yasuo is one of the most banned champions in this game, and has been for years. He's not broken, but a headache to vs.\r\n\r\n-Shield on passive that recharges, on the same passive with doubling your crit chance.\r\n-Q allows him to shove waves with no costs to him, also provides him a knockup. If it crits, the whole Q procs his life steal, instead of just the onhit part (including tornado). \r\n-Windwall blocks all abilities besides lazers and a few other exceptions. You wanna play Nami? have fun having your whole kit blocked by this, including heals. \r\n-E is endless dashing with almost no CD provided theres a minion wave. Gives really good early game trading, esp if youre against immobile mage (Lux for example). Slide up, try to attack, about to get snared, just slide back. Also has dmg increase per slide for no reason? maybe to help his already amazing waveclear, havent you seen a yasuo's endgame waveclear?\r\n-Ulti gives him armor pen, suspension of target, can be AoE, also moves him out of turret range because he needs more safety.\r\n\r\nNow, Akali is about to have her shown in turret radius, and is losing her healing on Q. Irelia lost dmg to shields and her disarm. \r\n\r\nThey were finally hit, but Yasuo's been a frustration issue all these years and it's just surprising he hasnt had something removed. You cant really outpush him, and if you roam for one minute, he'll take a lot of plates. You stay in lane, you'll either end up taking a bad trade after one misplay and die/back, or run out of mana and hell do the same. If you aren't hyper aggressive and get kills against him, then he'll scale hard and feel unkillable late game.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, theres my opinion. Feel free to disagree, but for a late game hypercarry having a lot of tools feels extremely unhealthy. That and he can shove waves like nothing while many mages were nerfed for that. \r\n\r\nAs for what to change, nerf Q dmg to minions, make windwall have a braum shield effect (or healthbar) and make the healthbar scale the windwalls health/dmg reduction, not size, and remove the turret safety on his ult so he has to towerdive if hes attacking you. Even just one of these will feel more healthy going against him (Q/W especially).","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2019-02-03T04:45:46.342+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":104,"body":"You can remove all his strenghts in champ select lobby.

I feel like there are way more irritating champions than him. And at the rate that Riot keeps releasing new champions, it's just a question of adding something more broken to the list and concealing him over time.\n\nYasuo is annoying, not broken. Irelia and Akali, on the other hand, are both. Besides, if Riot actually went ahead and removed some \"annoying\" part from Yasuo's kit they would instantly compensate it by adding a new effect somewhere else on his kit, or, most likely, they would compensate it with damage. You should already know upfront that this balance team just can't nerf the shit out of champions who need it (unless it's a -5ms nerf), only buff them unnecessarily (Lucian).","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-02-03T16:06:55.276+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"his irritation comes from that he can hold the power to change the game in an instant if he gets lucky with his wind wall while he still has so many other strengths\n\nas a melee, he's not too unhealthy, but when you judge him that he's also :  A carry, a support(wind wall actually functions better than braum's shield), durable enough to be a bruiser with a shield that does not behave the same as other shields,  can suppress any airborne enemies for an additional second or more, has ranged crowd control, as many dashes as there are targets for him to hit\n\n**the earliest late game power spike ijn the game**, oh, and he counters an overwhelming majority of the mage roster to boot and the only ones that he doesn't slip through because their abilities are not counted as \"projectiles\"\n\nI'm sure I missed something, but he has enough that I had to split it into two sections to make it worth reading...","replies":[{"poster":"AntiSJW","date":"2019-02-03T20:31:41.372+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":16,"body":"He has a high skill cap, low health pool (raka has more base health lvl 13 for ex), and his durability is circumstantial. \n\nWindwall is not broken, its just annoying because its one of the best abilities in the game.

He has 523 base + 87/level, to her 529 + 78/level. His durability is circumstantial, but doesn't come at any cost. \n\n> Windwall is not broken, its just annoying because its one of the best abilities in the game.

His Ult is already extremely situational compared to others who can just click theirs off cd. \n\nWindwall isn't broken, it's just annoying because it's broken? \n\n-Not doing damage isn't relevant to the strength of an ability. An ability can be powerful without dealing damage. Ex: Hawkshot, Thresh's Lantern.\n\n-The size of the wall is hardly relevant, if the ability so much as clips the edge of the wall..poof, it's gone.\n\n-Not being able to provide to a team isn't a good excuse to have something broken exist, if anything, it argues in favor of making changes to Yasuo to accommodate. As an aside, skirmishers aren't usually the class of champion that people look towards when asking for team utility. Outside of your standard split pushing, what does Jax, Riven, or Tryndamere bring? Damage and some cc? Pretty standard stuff.\n\n-His ult is situational, agreed, but I'd argue that the extra \"features\" of it makes up for that (the armor pen &amp; passive shield reset). Additionally, knockups are quite common, the hoop to jump through to get his ult off isn't terribly large.\n\n> E is situational and doesn't even have max damage off the first dash\n\nI don't get the complaint op makes on this as far as the damage goes either. It isn't what makes the ability frustrating.\n\n> Q and auto attacks come out to relatively the same dmg later, and the cc is on a charge system. \n\nAnd it all scales down with his auto attack speed, effectively increasing the range of his autos, as well as making them aoe. One of my personal issues with Yasuo is how difficult it is to match his waveclear on a mage since I have to spend a resource to push while he doesn't.\n\n> Shield is small actually, refreshes only on movement, so usually it feels overpowered because you jumped him while it was up, then he ulted super far to another target to counter your damage. It only last for 1.5s I believe, so refreshing it with ult jump is pretty crucial to participating in any team fight. Otherwise you sit on the sidelines, getting less XP and gold.\n\nThe shield increases as he levels, and refreshing on movement isn't a drawback, it's a reward for doing something in the game that you're already doing anyways. It's not on a limited cooldown or anything, it's based on movement, which is something that he's coincidentally good at. Also, looking at the amount it absorbs is far more relevant than it's duration. The shield is also proactive while it's available, which is huge. \n\n> Also, Yas doesn't get rights to the minions in a team fight. I can't tell you how many games my mobility gets halved because all my dashable targets are blown up by allies and all of a sudden I only have flash or an enemy champ to reposition\n\nYour team's poor play isn't relevant to the balance of a champion. If my teammates don't take my Thresh lantern, it doesn't make the ability garbage. \n\n> He doesn't counter all ranged champs, he just dictates they respect his shield and wind wall cd in order to trade and farm safely\n> Is he perma pushing? Ok jump him in numbers or take the 5v4 against his team elsewhere. He's not overloaded, he just appears that way because he's annoying lol\n\nHe dictates the flow of the lane with his choices. When laning against a competent Yasuo, your choices aren't exactly irrelevant, but they don't matter nearly as much as his choices. Against other mids, he can just afk push while taking defensive/sustain runes while using his passive and mobility to dodge or mitigate your damage. You have to spend mana to push back, so he'll force you to back by virtue of outsustaining you in resource. This creates a lane where you have to be aggressive into him to attempt to prevent him from pushing (and scaling), and his kit is extremely potent from a reactionary position.\n\nAlso, the jungler argument. The moment we jump to the \"call your jungler\" argument, we have to keep in mind that the enemy team has a jungler and other lanes as well. If yours has to watch mid, theirs gets to put pressure elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Emo Twink","date":"2019-02-04T08:03:25.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi, I quickly skimmed this mid assignment break and just wanted to add that my complaint about his E increasing dmg is just. it's completely unnessasary.

I agree, regardless of the tuning on the damage numbers, it really is just bloat on the ability text. Hell, his E could do no damage, it'd still be frustrating. I agree though, if it does need to do damage, just having a flat consistent amount would be better.

Respawn timers at level one are non existent and if you didn't die to the gank you can clear the wave before backing as tower diving level 1 usually always results in death, you can walk back to mid lane before another minion wave pushes to your tower and completely dies. If you're top lane then you either should take {{summoner:12}}  or have a champion with mobility to get back to lane fast enough to not lose that much exp. \n\nYes level 1 ganks are effective and put you behind but they don't dictate a lane just off one good level 1 gank, you just need to focus on going back to lane and catching up. Sit by your tower early game, ward up the gankable positions and don't push unless you feel safe.

That crit passive gives him the option to build more defensive while doing a lot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"On My Kill List","date":"2019-02-03T05:29:22.455+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":11,"body":"he's technically did have removals.\nhis ult crit actually used to work on all attacks not just crit ones.\nhis w used to give him a percentage of his flow with each dash.\ni believe there were also some other things he's lost.\nsaying he hasn't gotten removals is kinda of a lie.\nand yasuo's more balanced around items/runes then either akali or irelia.\nand nerfing him now would be a bad idea since there's a huge crit rework looming.","replies":[{"poster":"Exin0","date":"2019-02-03T13:04:52.367+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=On My Kill List,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AHtzRAeR,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-02-03T05:29:22.455+0000)\n>\n> he&#x27;s technically did have removals.\n> his ult crit actually used to work on all attacks not just crit ones.\n> his w used to give him a percentage of his flow with each dash.\n> i believe there were also some other things he&#x27;s lost.\n> saying he hasn&#x27;t gotten removals is kinda of a lie.\n> and yasuo&#x27;s more balanced around items/runes then either akali or irelia.\n> and nerfing him now would be a bad idea since there&#x27;s a huge crit rework looming.\n\nby huge crit rework you mean another fiddling with IE? any crit buffs are buffs for him, nevertheless his absurd banrate for long time means he is unhealthy for game and due to complete rework like yesterday his problem is not in numbers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spooky Skeleton","date":"2019-02-03T19:59:54.197+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why isn't there a guy at Riot with the  sole purpose of looking at CertainlyT's abominations and slicing off half the kit.
