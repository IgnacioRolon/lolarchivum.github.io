Though many know how to do well in the meta for supports. I hope to give a mini guide to help some of the who found their support skills in a trash bag, or maybe sharpen the edge on occasional supports.\n\n\n**_<EDIT FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT SAID SPECIFICLY>_**\n\nI WILL LIST SOME EXAMPLE CHAMP ICONS, BUT THEYRE JUST EXAMPLES, IF A CHAMP ISNT IN A CATEGORY ITS BECAUSE I FORGOT TO PUT THEM IN THERE OR OR BECAUSE ITS JUST EXAMPLES. IF I MISSED A CHAMP YOU THINK SHOULD BE IN A CATEGORY MENTION IT, AND I CAN EDIT THEM IN, BUT ITS JUST GENERALIZATION, NOT A CHAMP GUIDE WITH ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF SPECIFIC CHAMPS BUT AN EXAMPLE OF A CHAMP IN A CATEGORY.\n\nHere I will bring up support types, masteries/runes, and itemization in **varying degrees**.\n\nLets look at some types of supports, and why they may be better in certain compositions.\n\nYou have about 4 main support types, they fill different roles in the laning and team-fighting phases of a match. These are:\n\nSustain\nPeel/CC\nEngage\nPoke\n\nLets look at these in order. What is a \"Sustain Support?\"\nSome champs that fit this category are champs that heal or shield allies. Champs like {{champion:201}} {{champion:432}}{{champion:40}}  {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:16}} \n\nSoraka is one of the best sustain supports in the game, her healing can help an ADC win any trade, and have them free farming while the enemy has to back multiple times to make up for chip and poke damage. Thats how a sustain support should work, you keep your ADC and you shielded/healed so they enemy slowly loses more health than you do. A lane can be won solely on the enemy being too afraid to go all in because your side always has the health advantage. Sustain supports in the mid game during team fighting can sometimes keep a carry/assassin from having to back after a fight because of shields/heals.\n\nPeel/CC Support, what is that?\nSome champs can stop an assassin cold from executing a carry, turn ganks away, chasing down slippery opponents for the kill, and make fleeing from overwhelming odds easier. Champs like {{champion:34}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:267}}{{champion:12}}  {{champion:111}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:26}} \n\nLots of champs in that category, most of them have stuns, knockups, snares, or powerful slows that can get an enemy off of a carry. The term \"sticking\" is used to refer to trying to stay close to a champion theyre trying to kill, when something is stuck to something else you \"peel\" it off. So that is where the term \"peel\" comes from in the game, i.e. peel for your ADC. Of course if these abilities can stop chasing, they can stop fleeing too. When your ADC is trying to finish off an enemy, but they are running, hit them with some CC to stop their escape. In teamfighting, its often best to keep an eye on your teams most fed person, and your marksman especially if theyre the same person. Enemy teams will target them first to avoid taking sustained damage during a team-fight. Of course you can potentially inflict your CC on the enemy assassin/marksman also so they can inflict damage. Its a judgment call that has to be felt out.\n\nEngage support, what is that?\nSome champs have the power to start fights on their terms, and set up situations where an enemy could be more easily killed by their ADC, this could lead to snowballing. Champs like {{champion:53}} {{champion:89}}  {{champion:412}}{{champion:111}}  {{champion:12}} {{champion:223}} \n\nBlitz, Thresh, Naut, and Leo all have \"hook\" skills. While Blitz and Thresh displace the person hooked closer to their starting direction, Naut and Leo travel to the champ they hook. Ali and Tham have to commit a bit more for their engage, but both can put enemy ADCs/Supports in bad situations with their ability to relocate enemy champs. Arguably Tham has the best ability to put enemies under his turret out of all of them. Supports of this type are meant to go in and directly attack the enemy carry and disrupt them from doing damage, and keep them locked down for allies to kill them. In the team fighting phase they may often try to land a key ability on an enemy, at which point the rest of the team may kill that enemy so fast with no retaliation that the other team is forced to give ground to the sudden 4v5 situation. These supports help their team by giving them good initiators to to turn sieges and objective battles into swift and losing fights for the enemy team.\n\nPoke support, what is that?\nThis one is a bit uncommon as a focus, but fits many of the off-meta supports and a few of the AP mages that can do some supporting or who are also supports. It also encompases non-supports in the support position like double ADC and Assassin supports. Champs like {{champion:268}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:74}} \n\nPoke support can be summed up by thinking about champs like Nidalee, and her spears, or Teemo and his blinding dart, or Annie and her stuns. These champs contribute mostly a lethal threat of damage to the enemy team. Often they will chunk the health of an enemy carry so badly that the all in from the ADC+{{summoner:14}} results in a kill, and can lead to snowballing and a win. This kind of support can be vulnerable to ganks from the enemy jungler because of a lack of CC, but this isnt always the case. If the strengths of this composition can be taken advantage of, then in the team fighting phase, the support may move over into a sub-carry. Another fed team member that can dish out some serious damage faster than the enemy can cope. On the other hand, if this dosnt take off, then it will fall off very hard late game. This is often seen as the support NOT supporting when they plan to just sit around hoping to be a carry late game. This has some risk, but certain champs can do a good job in the bot lane since they have enough CC and utility to offer more than just nuking 60% of a carries health. Zyra, Liss, Ziggs, Heim can all offer some utility and CC along with damage.\n\nSo now that weve cleared up some of the Support types, how does one go about the meta. Well one thing a support is expected to do a lot of is warding, this isnt a warding guide. Look up warding [here](http://leaguecraft.com/strategies/gameguide/1271-warding.xhtml) and [here](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910). Warding is everyones job, but supports are expected to do the heavy lifting on the matter. For every ward that spots an incoming gank, assume you denyed the enemy team 300+gold, and your team didnt miss out on 200+gold worth of farming. This feat of warding is generaly accomplished by rushing a {{item:2049}} sightstone. Its typical to start with the standard warding trink, then buy a sightstone asap, then trade your warding trinket in for a sweeper{{item:3341}}. This lets you have vision, and potentially disrupt the enemies vision by destroying wards. This can make them blind in the river and make it easier for your Jungler to gank.\n\nAlso part of the meta is \"feed the ADC\" this means they kill all the minions. DO NOT EVEN HIT THE MINIONS. The only time you should ever even consider hitting the minions is if you just double killed the enemy opposition and its time to push the turret, or if one of them is too hurt to fight back, but never take it upon yourself to basic attack minions in an attempt to push the lane. Most ADCs can push the lane on their own just fine and if they want your help they will tell you. More than likely you will disrupt their last hit timing, and make them lose CS (creep score/minion gold) to the other minions and thats as good as slapping gold out of your teams hands. Where do you get gold then if you cant last hit? Gold income items and masteries.\n\n{{item:3303}} {{item:3301}} These help you gain gold in lane, and can be upgraded as needed.\n**Greed, Scavenger, Wealth, and Bandit** from the utility mastery tree all help a great deal in conjunction with the aforementioned items. You can even get gold income Quints, but that may be a bit overkill, though every little bit adds up. Its possible to finish a match in second place gold income behind your ADC with a gold income build, well plied use of a Spellthief, and plenty of assist. While your putting points in the Utility tree, you may aswell spec for the Mana regen mastery Meditation (all 3 ranks), and the Alchemist and Culinary Master, AND Vampirism. These will all help your sustain in lane.\n\nAs for runes, In most cases, armor and magic resist runes will serve well, flat AP goes a long way on many. Resource regeneration and HP regen cant be overlooked. Careful positioning can make HP regen runes a tool stay in the lane longer than the enemy, and mana regeneration is a must for some supports. Runes can basically enhance a playstyle, so this will come down to preference in many cases. When in doubt go with Armor/MR or HP/Mana regen.\n\nSome things to consider also are summoner spells. I see a lot of {{summoner:4}} \nI know some people arnt aware they can choose 2 spells because theyve had flash welded to their D key for ever since they could flash... but to be honest you shouldnt need it in every case.\n\n{{summoner:7}} {{summoner:3}} are the spells that round out the kit of most supports the best. Not proclaiming Flash as the single greatest thing ever created and saying it must be picked or else is enough to get a few downvotes for this alone Im sure, but its true. There are other spells that can help you support. Flash is good for some supports, Im not saying you should never take flash. I am saying if your support champ has hard CC or escape tools, take heal instead. This helps you and your ADC sustain, and the movement boost may help them escape/chase when their own flash wasnt enough.\n\nSo how do we put this all together?\n\nLets look at Lux, she is many things Iv talked about and will make a great example.\n\nLux is a: Peel/CC, Sustain, Poke Support. She has a snare/slow for CC, and a shield for sustain. She has long range abilities, and a passive that does more damage based on the enemy having been hit by an ability of hers. She can wear down the opponent with pokes, she can snare/slow runners and chasers. In a pinch she can shield herself and her ADC.\n\nLux would do good to have {{summoner:7}} {{summoner:3}} as a support. She should land in Summoners Rift and pick up a {{item:3303}} {{item:2009}} {{item:2009}} {{item:2009}} {{item:2004}}{{item:3340}}  (those biscuts are gained from the utility tree Culinary Master mastery). Try to buy the Sightstone then exchange the {{item:3340}} for a {{item:3341}} then upgrade it to a {{item:3364}} @ level 9+ gold permitting. From there some standard Lux items {{item:3174}} {{item:3003}} {{item:3135}} , but when it comes to boots on a support, try to build {{item:1302}} {{item:1307}} {{item:1312}} {{item:1317}} {{item:1322}} {{item:1327}} {{item:1332}} . The \"Captain\" enhancement to boots means with proper positioning you can help your team escape, or get to a fight faster. Throw in a defensive item, {{item:3083}} {{item:3102}} or two and you can live long enough to deploy your CC and damage in a brawl. So our support Lux may look like this {{item:3040}} {{item:3092}}  {{item:3174}} {{item:3102}} {{item:2045}} {{item:1312}} at the end of a match possibly.\n\nIf this Lux can use her abilities to help feed her ADC then the carry will get strong, Lux can go ahead and try to snare, then slow, then Exhaust to chain CC, all while the ADC blows them up. This done well is a winning strategy that wins games.\n\nSome other behaviors to try when supporting as any type. Protect your tower, try your best to only last hit minions that will die to tower fire while the ADC is backed/respawning. Only try to clear a wave quickly if theyre chipping your tower with minion auto attacks. If the minion waves are the same size in the middle of the lane, only last hit them if the ADC on their way and between the inner and outter turrets. Pushing the wave with the ADC absent just means they will have to farm closer to the enemy turret, opening you guys up to ganks and a long way to run back to your tower if you get caught in a bad situation. Instead take the time to check your ward times, and replace them, or even gank mid or harass/poke mid.\n\nPocket your ADC, try not to get caught up in that big shinny minion wave and all the gold its worth. Your ADC may have a plan, and if your there you can help execute it. Teamwork beats selfish me me me play most days of the week.\n\nWatch your minimap, if you have no map awareness then you being in support position is bad. A good ADC is watching the minimap cause they know theyre a prime gank target. Thats why you need to keep vision on the river, and watch it with them. You both reacting asap to an incoming gank may be the difference between the enemy Jungler wasting their time and losing farm time, gank time, or getting a double kill and 2 assist to the enemy team.\n\n\nA lot of people look down on supports for some reason, like they dont do anything. I always like to think of them as the guardian to our teams carry. A bodyguard or gatekeeper to our teams late game sustained damage. You wanna gank our ADC? K, watch me stop you. Good players recognize a skilled support, and doing well as a support can help a below average ADC player stay afloat during laning where they would have fed without you. Should you go to the bottom lane with no understanding of how to support, then you will probably get outplayed by the enemy ADC/Support at every turn when they know what theyre doing. Poor vision control, inability to avoid zoning in a 2v2 lane, and fighting the carry for farm will lose your team the bottom lane and give the enemy team an advantage in gold from the destroyed turret, a point of escape or ingress to your jungle, a rout to an inner turret, fewer places for your team to escape to safety.\n\nOk, hope this gives some insight into the role for some of you, though for anyone willing to read all this youre probably smart enough to kinda support decent anyway. Still, had to write it to hope one person reads it and it helps their support game a bit. I hope some discussion that follows will also be enlightening to the community.\n\nGood luck on the fields of battle, go forth and SUPPORT YOUR ALLIES!","replies":[]}
