I believe that it still could and has a few more days to be changed like you did with Warden Nautilus&#039; W shield particle. :)\n\nI seriously LOVE the splash! ;D\nI wish that his head would have been bigger like in the splash and his hands and fingers would have textures similar to the splash&#039; more chunky and not-in-one-piece fingers, but that would probably make him stay in the PBE for another cycle, right? :P\nI think that if the stuff I mentioned above will change, the skin would be perfect :) I won&#039;t mind it staying another cycle anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-03T00:15:50.296+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey DwarvenGiant! \n\nFirst off, thanks for taking the time to leave feedback in regards to content! \n\nWe chose to keep the base particle because he was a 750 RP skin, and those generally don't receive particles, unless it's what we deem 'quality of life'. For example, Waden Nautilus would look pretty silly with his base shields when the Warden skin isn't nautical (heh) at all. Warden Sivir fell into the same category - it'd look silly if she had a new weapon in her model, but threw her old one. We felt that his base shield didn't ruin the fantasy of Debonair, which is why he's still using the base.\n\nUnfortunately, it's a bit too late to make any more changes to his guy, and he'll be shipping as is. \n\nI (as well as the other QA folks on the skins team) read all of the PBE comments left for a skin, even though we may not comment on all of them. We also relay said feedback to the team working on the skin for discussion. Although we don't make every change requested, we do try to listen to actionable feedback when possible - I think for the most part, Debonair Galio is a good example of this. \n\nAgain, I really appreciate you being active on the boards - both live and PBE - and voicing your feedback! :]","replies":[{"poster":"Final Raid Boss","date":"2015-04-03T01:13:43.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the skin itself is good for being a 750 rp tier, the splash art looks great, way better than his base one.. this isn't relevant to this skin but i think he should receive a new base splash art and ability icons, they seem really outdated, even his vfx/sfx could use an update similar to what morg has on the pbe currently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2015-04-03T09:40:21.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, fair enough. :P\nThanks for replying! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2015-04-03T19:30:15.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR: Riot legitimizes any of its decisions (popular/unpopular, good/bad, right/wrong, etc.) by saying \"we don't promise anything; here are some generalizations that we can ignore at will.

I'm all over the Reddit, each of the LoL news sites, & much more... I don't know where you took away that \"...in most cases, players were happy with what we had done...\" (if really valuing upvotes & downvotes too)?\n\nJust looking at this one source alone, it's clear that it's overwhelmingly negative on a few key-points still: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/6UK0Aorg-feedback-debonair-galio\n\nWe could go through all the other sources one-by-one but they're all majorly negative so there's no point (imo from viewing all those same sources). I just don't get where in searching for feedback among all these sources you guys thought more players were happy than not. Because, I'll be frank, from a thorough scan... it's the opposite if you truly are taking upvotes & downvotes into consideration as well, so I'm just confused.\n\nI wouldn't call that satisfactory, I don't understand why you do?

Based on that, we'll allocate resources accordingly; modelers, animators, particle artists, audio bros, etc. \n\nIf we scope out a 750 RP skin, for example, we're only allocating a modeler, since 750 RP skins have new models/textures. We'll then allocate particle artists, etc to other skins (975 RP+) where we need those resources. \n\nChanging the color of a particle isn't as simple as moving a slider, and it involves editing layers of particles, which is why it's not as quick or  easy as players had initially though. \n\nThe other reason for not changing the particles was because we didn't want to set a false precedence that we'd add particles to 750 RP skins and change the price to 975 RP whenever this kind of discussion came up. Our goal is to create skins of various tiers for champions because not everyone wants all of the bells and whistles that some skins have.
