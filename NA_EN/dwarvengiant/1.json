Maybe even in a later patch? Are you planning to fix this at all? I mean, I don&#039;t even mind if you&#039;ll change his hair back to brown (I liked all versions, basically), I just really want the splash&#039;s hair color to match the model&#039;s.\nAnd before you say it&#039;s lighting... Well, it&#039;s just too dark to be the lighting (in the splash of course). :P\n\nThanks for taking time to read my post. :)\n\n-_-\n\nIf anyone's looking for references:\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/fd68841cd0df7b5f77b920498c1d15c8.png","replies":[{"poster":"Sinister Snail","date":"2015-05-10T19:55:25.090+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a fan of the super saiyin hair, honestly, and the striped shoulders were good detail.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fowus","date":"2015-05-10T19:34:16.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear KateyKhaos and Giant,\n\nI too share concerns over the current hair color of the in-game model vs. the splash-art.

More important to me though than this particular skin is the fact that Giant's point seems to be applicable to multiple champions released recently; one example being Sweetheart Annie who has an in-game model with hair so white I can't look at it while her splash art has her hair as light blonde. I'm sure this wasn't nearly as frequent as it used to be ( I'm aware of Woad Ashe's splash art having a dagger the game model lacks ) and can't think of many older examples that have such obvious differences but I'm hoping the teams who are responsible for the in-game and splash art begin coordinating more.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my post,\nfowus2happy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Beane","date":"2015-05-10T19:11:59.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear KateyKhaos and Giant,\n\nI too share concerns over the current hair color of the in-game model vs. the splash-art.

There was some discussion around it, it's something the team does try to keep in mind when creating splash art for new skins.\n\nWith that said, we do try to keep the splash art as representative as possible to the in-game content as possible. However, there is a lot more we can do in splash as opposed to game - detail and lighting are two items that come to mind. \n\nWe can be a lot more detailed in the splash art as opposed to in game. If we have the in-game model a ton of detail, the skin itself would look muddy because at game height, all of the details wouldn't be visible. \n\nLighting is another instance where there's some variation, and that's due to the composition of the piece. The lighting in the splash will be different than the lighting in game (and it varies a tad depending on the map).\n\nUnfortunately, we do not currently have an in-game model viewer, but we do have a model available on the [announcement page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/dark-path-forsaken-jayce-does-tread) when a skin is released, to show players what the skin looks like in game.","replies":[{"poster":"PeachyBubbleStar","date":"2015-05-11T03:30:25.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey katey, i know this may be weird that i'm saying this on someone elses post, but can you check out my champion concept and tell me what you think of it? and what needs work? i would REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE IT ;W; http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/sJJIq3gb-champion-concept-zhani-the-young-talentupdate","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-10T19:38:58.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey DwarvenGiant! \n\nWe don't have plans to make any more adjustments to Ace of Spades Ezreal's hair. \n\nPlease keep in mind that the in game model will differ slightly from the splash art.
