Yes, I've tried them all.\r\nWhen did this issue start occurring? - A few days ago. I was playing just fine on this connection prior.\r\nHow often does this issue occur? - Every game starting two days ago.\r\nPlease, please, PLEASE include a tracert to the League of Legends servers.\r\nTracert:\r\n\r\n\r\nTracing route to 192.64.170.1 over a maximum of 30 hops\r\n\r\n  1     *        *        *     Request timed out.\r\n  2    20 ms    19 ms    26 ms  72-31-6-4.net.bhntampa.com [72.31.6.4] \r\n  3    20 ms    19 ms    16 ms  72-31-3-87.net.bhntampa.com [72.31.3.87] \r\n  4    14 ms    17 ms    16 ms  hun0-1-0-9-tamp20-cbr1.bhn.net [72.31.2.217] \r\n  5    15 ms    17 ms    14 ms  4.68.70.149 \r\n  6     *        *        *     Request timed out.\r\n  7    40 ms    46 ms    43 ms  4.71.14.182 \r\n  8     *        *        *     Request timed out.\r\n  9     *        *        *     Request timed out.\r\n 10    92 ms    69 ms    69 ms  104.160.131.36 \r\n 11    63 ms    67 ms    81 ms  104.160.131.46 \r\n 12    64 ms    58 ms    61 ms  104.160.131.101 \r\n 13  \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information that you'd like to provide? I've got a leaverbuster ban for this. If possible I'd like to see it reverted, I've really been trying my hardest to make a positive contribution to the community rather than a negative one. I'm afraid I'm going to get banned for something like this and I've already lost quite a bit of Elo from the disconnections. \r\n\r\nI am currently playing from a hotel while on vacation, though I was playing in this same hotel a week ago with no issue at all. I've tried everything before making a ticket. \r\n\r\nThanks for you time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T23:08:40.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens are most commonly a result of network problems failing to download assets.  Even if you have solid connection accessing other things, there can still be issues connecting specifically to the game server.  Using a hotel internet can cause issues too, especially depending on the strength and bandwidth available at that time.  You can try our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help strengthen your connection, but the issue may ultimately be in the hands of your hotel.  Hit them up if possible!","replies":[{"poster":"ToXXXiCiTy","date":"2016-09-16T03:38:45.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The weird thing is that prior to this issue occurring, I was in this same hotel one room over and I was playing just fine. It's showing the speed at 72.2 mbps. I have IPv4 connectivity but no IPv6 connectivity, not sure if that could be the issue or not as I don't know too much about networking in general. \n\nI've tried everything in the connection issues guide but to no avail. I also cannot login to Steam to play online. It's a really weird issue. \n\nI should be on a different connection back home in a few days, do you know if it's possible that I could get the leaverbuster penalty removed? As I said I've been trying my absolute best to make positive contributions to the community rather than being a drag on it. You can see the 3 games in a row where I've timed out (all as Jinx because I just got her and fell absolutely in love with her mechanics) and prior to that I hadn't left a game in quite some time. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated. I think I'll just wait until I'm back at home to see if the issue persists. \n\nAnd thanks a ton. This is my first ticket on the boards and I'm definitely pleased with Riots customer support at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T15:07:24.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm happy to help!  Just as a heads up, leaverbuster is not something that we can remove.  The only way to recover your standing with the system is by playing consistently without interruptions.  If your internet at the hotel continues to degrade, it might be best to stick to customs until you're able to get readjusted.  If possible, definitely see if the hotel can accommodate at all, because you could still suffer from packet loss or a weak signal.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"choijh0123","date":"2016-09-18T21:01:30.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a similiar problem too.\nIT was just a normal day and i played a solo normal game once.\nI tried to play another one but after champion select and game started, screen went dark \nand says unable to connect and check you network and try again.\nI tried, it failed.
