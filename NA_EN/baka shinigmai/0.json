RP codes can't be stacked under a single transaction.  It may take a little time to input it all, but it's in the best interest in case there are any issues with the transaction.  If you have any questions about purchases, our billing team is happy to help out via a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
