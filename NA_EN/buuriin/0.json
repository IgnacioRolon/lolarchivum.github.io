I really love this new skin because it stand out from most of her skins &lt;3, I have to say that the long wait is worth it to me.\r\n\r\nHowever the base model and the pink chroma have some really odd colors on them that ruined the whole skin. It would be nice if Riot can take a look at these and consider change them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the base model I would like to remove the pink color on her halo, they look very odd and doesn't fit into the gold &amp; green theme at all. Beside that all the gold stuffs she's wearing should be warmer instead of green gold.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HT0olrM.jpg\r\n\r\nThen we move to the pink chroma, the pink colors cover all over her just look gorgeous, this could be one of her best chroma but the odd pink on the halo along with orange shoulder plates just killed the whole skin, it's really difficult to look at this chroma right now\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JGF9c4R.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lexical","date":"2019-02-14T06:35:50.175+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh shoot! Just saw this now :(\n\nBecause the skin is in stores now, it would be really hard to change it. People bought it for what it look like in store. Bait and switch is not nice :P\nI think you hit some good points for the pink chroma. Might I suggest that in the future if you have great feedbacks like this to post them in the PBE feedback threads? Rioters that work on certain feature, skins and chromas actually keep a close tab on those threads. Others, not so much. \n\nMoreover, the easiest time to change something in game is during the PBE period! These types of feedbacks would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"beany","date":"2019-02-14T07:46:08.148+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense, I thought the Odyssey skins didn't go through the pbe because they were meant as a surprise.

I forgot that it was a dark launch. I think these are aimed to give everyone a delightful surprise when it hits live without PBE previews but it does come with a trade off of not being able to collect feedbacks. \n\nIn this case, it is really hard to make the changes not only because putting it in game will have to out of usual processes, but also we are changing something that people may have bought already based off of the current colors. \n\nI gave this feedback to the team so that we can be aware of color combos like this in the future. Overall, because its something in regards to design and not game breaking, we will not be retouching this chroma.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Benelovent","date":"2018-09-11T20:25:27.654+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totaly agree with this guy.

The hovering pieces on the pink chroma were exactly what my eyes went to as well! The fact that they chose a red which doesn’t match at all with chroma just ruined the whole thing for me. \nHonestly this skin and it’s other accessories, like the icon, splash and cinematic need to be gone through to fix some of the differences they all have, and adjusted accordingly to all be as cohesive as possible, because that to me has always been the Art divisions biggest weakness.","replies":[]}]}
