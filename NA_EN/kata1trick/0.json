I&#039;ve been a dedicated League player ever since the end of Season 2. This game is awesome, Riot is constantly changing things about the game while using player feedback, and it&#039;s a big reason why I&#039;ve never complained about the game (outside of the in-game community). Every season, Riot has taken it upon themselves to change up a certain &quot;genre&quot; of champs (juggernauts, marksmen, etc.). As everyone knows, this year was Assassins. I&#039;ve been a loyal Katarina main ever since I first played her back in Season 3. Although I&#039;ve favored other champions in Ranked because of Katarina inability to be played in higher elos, she was my go to pick versus any team with at least two squishies. Sometimes even in Ranked. I loved the way her kit felt. Nothing was more satisfying then Qing onto a group of champs, Shunpoing to one of the squishies and bursting them without a moment&#039;s hesitation, then continuing on to dance around the battlefield as her kit reset on kills. While she still may have very similar mechanics, she doesn&#039;t feel nearly as bursty as she used to, and she also lacks the very strong damage reduction from her Shunpo, along with the high-damage, utility W. Riot has also nerfed her Q into the ground. Hitting only 3 targets instead of 5 makes it so that she can&#039;t trade nearly as well in lane. Not to mention, she was a pretty good lane bully if you could bait out your lane opponent&#039;s cc and Q, E onto the enemy caster minions, and W the enemy for an easy thunderlord&#039;s proc doing massive damage. I would&#039;ve been happy if Riot had just nerfed her w&#039;s damage, maybe dial down her ult base damage. The new Katarina feels too clunky, and her potential to burst is lacking heavily because it&#039;s so easy to dodge the way her old W now works. I&#039;ve invested roughly 500 hours into Katarina, whether it be gameplay or looking into guides to see how everyone else is playing her. I, for one, would really like to see her reverted with some slight tweaks so she can&#039;t snowball as hard. I understand that&#039;s hard to do, being the feast or famine champion that she is, but her being reworked the way it was done has honestly made me altogether stop playing League out of pure sadness. At the very least, I would absolutely love to see her reworked in some other way that makes her just as fun and bursty as she used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyumi","date":"2016-11-18T02:51:23.421+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Katarina is fine.

As I stated previously, _it is not _ the same anymore. \n\nStating a few personal tips for the new rework: \n\n- Don't go on rambo mode, that is not her role anymore; your attacks are really time-based (Q and W) and it gives enough time for the enemy team to CC you or counter you, in any way possible.\n\n- This tip, is the one I like the least: You should only, but only, jump into the team fight if and only if you have a guaranteed kill (or more than one) and a getaway in case something goes wrong. Now, you might ask why I don't really like this tip - Simply because if you are fighting against a tanky enemy team or even counters (e.g. Yasuo (if he knows how to play)) you will not do much of a thing, and all you can do is kill steal (which is something that proves you are doing nothing useful).\n\n- Go around and search for good builds (usually, I take full AP, I don't really take Hextech Gunblade, unless they are going on a full MR mode).\n\n- _**(This tip only applies to players whose key stone is Thunderlord)**_ -  In the very beginning you should play defensive (unless the experience tells you otherwise), but that doesn't mean you can't poke (not really a poke, considering you can take nearly half of his HP with this). Throw your Q (try to hit the enemy champion), instantly E (to him!) if he is on/near the dagger - This counts as three strikes, activating Thunderlord and taking away nearly half of his HP  (unless he has Health items or MR, which is not very common, but can always happen) - Unfortunately, this not really effective on Yasuo, considering his passive blocks the Q, and if he doesn't have the shield from the passive he can always use the Wind Wall to block it along with that, he will sooner or later reset his shield and reset most of his health again.\n\nCan't say anything more or less about this - Her rework is very restrictive and blocks many things that you used to do (You can't really solo a whole enemy team anymore, unless they are all squishies and you are really fed - and even then! You can still die). After all, some part of your offensive side must be swapped with defensive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rose Muffins","date":"2016-11-18T04:22:43.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately you're suffering from a change in playstyle completely. I see most of the comments are saying \"She's not freelo\" or \"She's harder now\" and that you should \"get over it\" or \"get used to it.\" What I see in her new kit is flexibility in play and more thought being put into everything you do. Her kit isn't as simple as mark, jump, damage. Now she has to set up, think about where she is positioned and where her daggers will be or when/where to throw them. I love the new rework and decided to play many, maybe ten or fifteen matches of katarina (same with Leblanc) before her rework. i have to say the change is welcome and allows counter play while also providing a great new way to play around other champions and not be shut down by every form of CC in the game. I do believe you'll have fun with her the more you learn. In fact, I'd think you might find you'll like her more in the near future once you unlock her full potential and new ways to build her item set.
