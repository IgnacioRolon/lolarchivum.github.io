I'm so sorry for the late reply! I hardly check this lol and thought people stopped looking at it XD! For the leather strap I actually used a strap from a bag my girlfriend gave me (with her permission of course) LOL! I'll post a picture for you of a close up. The strap was meant to be comfortable to wear around all day so I didn't make it as thick as its suppose to be. I just kinda made it wearable and comfortable so it's literally just the strap. However, if you want to make it look more like his, you can add some foam to it to make it thicker :). \n\nIn addition I drilled some holes and screwed the strap into the plastic part to keep it in place. Since you're going to be walking around a lot you don't want it to fall off right :)! \n\nHope this helps! If you have any more questions let me know :)!","replies":[{"poster":"IamLordStark","date":"2015-08-15T06:10:05.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IamLordStark,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=ByAxh6Oa,comment-id=00130000,timestamp=2015-08-15T06:09:43.950+0000)\n>\n> HI!
