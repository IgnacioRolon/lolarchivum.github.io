Now, stick to it.\n\nI mean it. While there's no such thing as \"voting with your wallet\" (no matter where and when you live--even if your local economics revolve around capital and even if your local governments are democratic), there is no denying that LoL is as good (or ***terrible***) as it is because people keep giving Riot/TenCent money. (I've seen limited evidence that their big decisions are informed by something beyond their bottom line. Still, I'm not holding my breath for anything more.)\n\n**Addendum**: Nevermind that Riot is dependent on revenues from e-sports, the corresponding risk for which is mostly borne by the players themselves (Riot itself bears practically zero). This would be the case irrespective of what individual players decided to do.\n\nThat *doesn't* mean that you *shouldn't* quit League of Legends. It just means that the effect of your quitting will only contribute to the improvement of League as part of a larger trend [of people quitting League].\n\n(OTOH, I've read Rioters making the case that \"this is the lifecycle of a massively multiplayer game.\" In other words, \"as it gets older, it starts to suck, and people stop wanting to play it, and it eventually dies out gracefully [according to whatever progression earns TenCent at least as much as TenCent ever expected, if everything works as TenCent expects it to work].)","replies":[{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2019-01-07T09:02:36.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"they are just like every other business in the world then","replies":[{"poster":"dnsup","date":"2019-01-07T09:13:37.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EL HAMSTERO,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BWzot0TE,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2019-01-07T09:02:36.844+0000)\n>\n> they are just like every other business in the world then\n\nNo. Otherwise we'd call them \"just some business, they're all the same anyway.\"","replies":[{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2019-01-07T09:57:55.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"tell me which business doesnt prioritize the bottom line over everything else","replies":[{"poster":"dnsup","date":"2019-01-07T10:08:58.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EL HAMSTERO,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BWzot0TE,comment-id=0006000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-07T09:57:55.844+0000)\n>\n> tell me which business doesnt prioritize the bottom line over everything else\n\nEven if I couldn't (I can, but it doesn't matter), that has nothing to do with what I actually said.
