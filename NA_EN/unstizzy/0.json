What is the deal? I do not have a firewall on and I'm running as admin.  If I restart the client the whole download restarts as well and it's very clear it's start to throttle immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T20:29:14.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client itself isn't throttling your download speeds, it doesn't have any tools to do something like that. It might be that your network is having a hard time reaching out servers because of certain settings or possibly something to do with your ISP. Let's check for both really quick.\n\nFirst double check your network settings using the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Pay extra attention to the two points on port forwarding and how to flush/configure your DNS settings.\n\nIf that doesn't help your downloads, let's check to see how your connection is looking while it's on it's way to our servers. Grab a traceroute tool like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a trace to 104.160.131.1 then paste the results here so I can take a look!","replies":[]}]}
