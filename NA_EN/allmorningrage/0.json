So when this happens I'm forced to turn off my laptop and hurry up and try to join the match again.(which never works because people quickly remake) basically I'm just confused and  'd over this and just need a little help.\r\n\r\nNote: this has happened 8 times in a row now, some of them were custom but the others were normals.\r\nP.S. I have already repaired all the files and after that didn't work I uninstalled then reinstalled with no success.\r\nP.P.S. It is only league out of all my games that is doing this, the rest are fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2016-10-14T22:54:26.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has your laptop updated recently? That could be the issue if yes. What I would recommend doing is resetting your computer to a previous date if you know when the issues started, and obviously you need to pick a date that is before the issues started (look up how to do it, it isn't really that hard, I would tell you how to do it but I haven't done it in a while). That being said if you reset your computer to a previous date it will delete certain files, so if you have any important files you have created and/or saved after the date you will be going to, then make sure you back them up to an external hardrive/flashdrive or cloud storage.\n\nAssuming what the riot employee suggests doesnt work.","replies":[{"poster":"ALLMORNINGRAGE","date":"2016-10-18T21:51:03.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"xbox game bar\" was it, thank you for the recommendations!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T22:23:44.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This freezing may be due to a recent Windows update, if you have Windows 10.
