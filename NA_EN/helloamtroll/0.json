So how I see it is that if you win a ranked game, your LP gain goes up too because your MMR is also rising right? Well in my past two games I have won both (Btw I am in Plat 5/4 Elo atm). My first game that I won I gained 20 LP for the win makes sense right my MMR is probably low and all, but what happens to my LP gain in my next time annoys me. The next game I won again and my LP gain drops from 20 to 19! Yes that is 1 LP less think about it suppose I have a steady 20 LP gain from Plat 4 to Plat 3 promos that means I need to play 5 games but with a 19 LP gain that means I need to play an extra game of ranked to just get into my promos. In that one ranked game it can be filled with trolls, inters, or plain out people who have a bad game. I am not upset that I have to play another game honestly but why is my LP gain going down after I win a game? Is it because my stats went down? That does not seem to be the issue because my stats were higher in my second game. I really do not know what is happening and would like some feed back on this because it is quite annoying seeing my LP gain going down after winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-03T22:51:49.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that would have probably tilted me a little to see as well, but essentially your MMR and rank are trying to balance themselves out in the long run. Your MMR is probably high enough to where it's starting to match up with where you should be rank wise, which is why you got slightly less LP.","replies":[]}]}
