Zed for example being near 50% was considered overpowered because of the skill it took to use him. Now he is at 50% and its fine? Now instead of having all the easy champions at the top of the WR charts, we now have w/e is 50%+ WR and are hard champions to master instantly become hyper meta.\n\nThis problem them becomes twofold where there are people who are playing new champions when their skill level is not there yet simply because the easy ones are weak / there are a small pool of them.\n\nTo fix this Riot needs to go back to the frame of balancing and start creating more easy champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-08-18T14:04:58.604+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pyke, medium skill curve easy to master.\nNunu rework, easy, cheesy and fun to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Larriet","date":"2018-08-18T22:20:36.115+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other than the \"evolution\" mechanic (which really doesn't do much, mechanically, on 2/3 of her abilities), Kai'Sa is very simple, too.\nAatrox is slightly weird, but is he really complex?

His W is the strangest thing and it&#x27;s not hard to understand.\n\n1st off, Kai'Sa is medium in both skil and learning curve for a reason. Her spells evolve at any time in any order, so understand that part of her evolutionary passive is important. If you don't, you'll end up losinf because none of spells were evolved, or because you didn't focus on straight up evolving one spell but spread the evolving with multiple spells at knce with a little gold you had. Her W needs practise, even I still have free kills with it but miss because of minions blocking my way. Her ultimate is the most strategic spell in her kit, cast it on the wrong place and wrong time and you screw your teammates up completely. \nSo, overall: \n**_\"One Mistake is all it takes\" - Kai'Sa_**\nAatrox has a hard skill cealing but surpriaingly, easy learning curve(usually kits are easy-medium  or medium-hard), his kit provides no mediocrity. At first you won't be even able to land your Q's, not even on minioms, you'd find his W useless, but as the time passes by you'll realize than two dashes aren't enough for 3 Q's, so you'd understand and learn how to Q W Q(E) Q E passive AA and melt enemy laner in a single rotatiom, the  learn how to manage minion waves so you can sucessfully W them simce doesn't go through minions~~(which is BS since Illaoi's E can snipe you through them)~~, then you'd learn how to bit with the edges of youQ and center of you last Q since they critically strike, then learn WHEN to use your Q's, and of course, how to kite enemies out with Q E combo's and how to prolerly manage and use your ultimate. \nI'm telling you this as I'm a both {{champion:145}} and {{champion:266}} main.\n~~I can teach you how to get guarantee'd 1st 3 melee minions evsry single time too.~~","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-08-19T00:57:48.924+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having gameplay elements to consider when playing does not make a champion difficult.
