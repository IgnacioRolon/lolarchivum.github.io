The icon after the game will say application not responding and will not go away when I force quit. This is causing my Mac to not be able to turn off or restart, but allows it the go on sleep. Can anyone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T17:59:01.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird! It sounds like another copy of League is being created as a cache on the desktop. This could be caused by corrupt or missing files in the League directory. Can you complete a clean reinstall of League using  our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367)? Simply run the app, check the boxes for *Reinstall* and *Clean uninstall*, then launch League to finish patching.\n\nLet me know if this happens again after the reinstall.","replies":[]}]}
