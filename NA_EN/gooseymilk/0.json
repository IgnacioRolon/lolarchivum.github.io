After playing 2 games in preseason op.gg says I'll likely be silver 2, what does this mean?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T22:25:27.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Op.gg is likely basing it off what it thinks your mmr might be after those matches. Forewarning, op.gg is a third party site so their data is known to be inaccurate at times.\n\nThe new season will work like this, you'll first start off unranked and need to play 10 placement matches. After that, your overall performance will be evaluated and a starting rank is given based on that. If you had a previous rank last season, that can factor into the placements as well.","replies":[{"poster":"l Sky I","date":"2017-12-14T18:14:03.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Op.gg uses an algorithm that takes data from league api (match history and ladder position) And specifically uses variables such as recent win % And other, not disclosed factors, to compare you against everyone else at your rank and lp (average). Therefore, your mmr has a deviation associated with it that is based on the performance of those around your rank as well. At lower ranks this deviation is much smaller. At around gold, it is ~+/- 30 (within that range). Their output values set a standard at around 950, the common average of the lowest possible rank and lp on the ladder. This then follows a nearly consistent (almost) slope all the way to diamond 1, but then changes in behavior past master 50lp (likely due to too small a sample population). The reason they do this is because they recognize the complications in player skill estimation as a result of the demotion/promotion system in league being preferential to promotion when in the 5th division of any given rank. Even when players decline heavily down the ladder, the 5th division for a rank acts as a safety net, keeping many players who realistically shouldn't be in that rank.. in that rank. Because of this, the transition from 100 lp of one division to 0 lp of the next (promotion) is actually a DROP in mmr. Therefore they calculate it based on relativity at your current position.\n\nEdit: If you want my data backing this, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Kalebbull","date":"2018-01-07T11:15:47.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"man i never knew all this and i was pissed when i hit diamond 5 and my mmr dropped.. i tought it was a shitt bug that made my mmr go lower.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
