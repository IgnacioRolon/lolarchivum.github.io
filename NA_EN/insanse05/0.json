If you work well with your ADC, her bubble can be very, VERY powerful to isolate and take out bot lane (especially you set up a gank for your jungler in bot lane *drools* ). Not to mention if you time your heals right, she can heal, damage enemies, and then heal again. It is so satisfying to watch that chain reaction.\n\nSeriously, if you're looking for a support that can heal AND can put up a fight if she gets separated from the team, Nami is your girl... Fish? I don't know, just get Nami and have fun! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Insanse05","date":"2017-10-28T23:41:55.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx that is wat i was thinking too","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pax Romana ","date":"2017-10-27T01:05:31.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nNami is a very rewarding yet difficult champion, she primarily goes \"Bot Lane\" as a support to the ADC.\n\nNami's abilities vary from \"crowd control\" to \"healing\".\n\nShe certainly is a very fun champion. If you can master her timing and take advantage of her healing ability, she is one of the strongest supports in the game objectively of course.\n\nGood Luck\n\nCheers,\n\nAlways Persist","replies":[{"poster":"Insanse05","date":"2017-10-27T06:51:26.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thx very much","replies":[]}]}]}
