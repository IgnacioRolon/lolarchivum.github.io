We sometimes lock recalls in a particular camera angle to ensure you can see the recall. This is generally done when a champion has a prop in the recall. Pool Party Leona and Haunted Zyra are other examples where the camera is always locked to the south to see the recall animation.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"AidanWR","date":"2016-12-08T01:39:11.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same with some other animations like Gnar's dance","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-09T20:58:23.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AidanWR,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=9XPf838L,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-08T01:39:11.351+0000)\n>\n> Same with some other animations like Gnar&#x27;s dance\n\nYup! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lois Mid Lane","date":"2016-12-26T13:12:13.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
