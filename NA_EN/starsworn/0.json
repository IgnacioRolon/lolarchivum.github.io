The ult fires seemingly as normal, but there&#039;s just no damage.\n\n1. Cast ultimate that will hit an enemy\n2. Have that enemy kill you over halfway but not entirely through ult animation, your ult should go on CD.\n\nThis phenomenon of finishing the cast animation and going on CD but doing no damage is a rare scenario since it requires a precise death timing, but it has occurred every time I notice ult going on CD after dying mid cast. I have died during mid cast before but the animation doesn&#039;t finish and your ult doesn&#039;t go on CD. The champion I most recently noticed this with was Syndra, and she did not have an item such as a banshee&#039;s veil that would have entirely blocked the spell. This has happened on the Star Guardian skin and i&#039;m not sure if it applies to any other skins, I only use SG. I don&#039;t have a video, but i can describe it-\n\nfight near red side blue buff on pathway to river NOT adjacent to tribush. Syndra flashes over the wall from somewhere near tribush, Q&#039;s, W&#039;s (picking up the sphere she just made), and R&#039;s. I (Lux) Q, E1, and R at the same time Syndra is performing the aforementioned actions, but i die to syndra R while my R is casting, and the bug occurs.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2016-11-09T03:31:34.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually just how her ult works.","replies":[{"poster":"AdeBug","date":"2016-11-09T03:32:42.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It shouldn't be on cd if it went off and it should do dmg if it went off.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Memes","date":"2016-11-09T03:35:34.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the ult channels halfway and is canceled, her ult goes on cooldown and the animation will finish.
