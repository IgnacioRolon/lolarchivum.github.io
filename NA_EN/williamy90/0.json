Not sure if they made any major graphic changes but heres the run down of what happens and what i have done so far that has somewhat worked \n\nI used to play the game on High settings and would run with no issues but after the patch, when the summoners load into the game that graphic freezes and i have to restart pc which causes me a leave match and a 5 min wait for 5 games. But sometimes the game doesn't crash at start and after playing it crashes at the final graphic when it says Defeat or Victory. But that doesn't cause me the penalty because the games over. \n\nI had to download the settings file that puts everything in the lowest graphic settings in order to play and thats not to fun to play with, i can move it up to low instead of very low but i have to play on a non full screen windowed setting. \n\n\nBasically im just wondering if they did change something in the graphic part in the new patch that might of put a driver out of date for the game or what not. Any info would be awesome. I dont play to much because of time and work but when I do have time to play now I have to sit and wait for the 5 min thing to wear off. Of course I feel bad and try and log in really quick to rejoin but they have already remade the game. Bleh. But Thanks for any insight.\n\n\n\n**Fixed: Read First comment if having same issues worked 100% for me, could also be your issue. **","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-09-07T13:42:29.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem with the new Windows 10 update!\n\nif you right click the League application and select \"Test Compatibility\" it will run a diagnostic and fix the problem for you!\n\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"WilliamY90","date":"2016-09-10T01:55:12.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im giving this a shot, I think from how i read what it said its putting it into Windows 7 mode or something like that.

Disable the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to fix this up.  Let me know if you still have any issues after!","replies":[{"poster":"WilliamY90","date":"2016-09-10T02:10:02.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill give that a shot i never thought it would be the cause because i thought it loaded when you log into league not after you get past the character select screen. But ill def give it a shot and see what happens.  Thanks!\n\nEdit: After disabling the Game Bar, im 5 for 5 in not freezing back to High Settings in Custom games, about to try a league game with others and see how it holds out. Hopefully this works for me. Again Thanks  a bunch!!\n\nEdit 2: Actual game went excellent, no lag, skips, jumps, or freezing. Thanks for that info! Happy Gaming!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Declining Line","date":"2016-09-07T01:36:43.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening to me too","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-09-07T13:42:50.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem with the new Windows 10 update!\n\nif you right click the League application and select \"Test Compatibility\" it will run a diagnostic and fix the problem for you!\n\n:)","replies":[]}]}]}
