I first picked Jayce mid (I 1 trick him and the jungler preselected Gragas, an ap champ). Turns out after I lock in my champion, the support and jungler swap roles. Jungler decides to go sej instead, top went illaoi, support went janna, adc was lucian.\r\n\r\nIt was a full ad team against a Darius, and a Vi. 2 bruisers who are gonna be extremely tanky mid-late game. As long as we shut them down early then it wouldve been fine. But our top laner Illaoi fed Darius 4 times in 7 minutes. So I decided to open my lane because everybody was feeding on our team by now, so why waste time right. \r\n\r\nLong story short, I got punished for opening my lane because that game was just a waste of time. With the nerfs of Black Cleaver, thered be noway to win that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-05-08T16:51:16.809+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2017-05-08T17:03:19.348+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"What if your whole team agrees to it beforehand?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-05-08T17:07:56.597+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Raxistaicho,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=hw66Qkez,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2017-05-08T17:03:19.348+0000)\n>\n> What if your whole team agrees to it beforehand?\n\nThen you'd be unlikely to have anyone report you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-05-08T07:12:01.638+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":">So I decided to open my lane because everybody was feeding on our team by now, so why waste time right.\n\nYes, that's punishable.

Why? Because people make less mistakes in this elo with their lead unlike low elo. In low elo, you can easily shut down people. In Diamond 5, good luck trying to shut down someone when they know most the mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"Winters Dawn","date":"2017-05-09T10:12:21.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this still does not change the fact that opening your lane because YOU decide the game is over is an extremely toxic behavior.

You just get further behind until you are completely irrelevant.\n\nBut staying in lane is easier and gives everyone the feel good warm fuzzy.\n\nJust wondering what the point is? \n\nIn one game, my support fed Draven 4 times in 8 minutes and I manage not to die but get zoned out. Now I am down on CS and facing a fed Draven and Blitz with no chance of ever catching up at about 8 minutes in.  It is over completely. But I stayed.\n\nThey just run over me and take tower at 12 minutes. If I try to farm the lane they come back and zone me out. Their jungle hangs around so I spend most of the game running away.\n\n\nBut I am doing it from now on. \n\nWas climbing up before, now I am at the bottom and doesn't look like there will be any change.\n\nI have seen that roaming DOES WORK and roaming WILL offer a good chance to come back. Especially in lower ELO.\n\nWithout roaming, the slightest deficit rolls into guaranteed defeat.\n\nStaying in lane and losing is trolling, but no one can see it. LOL.\n\nI fully expect everyone to twist this around, but the ONLY change I made to my strategy was staying in the lost lane and  went from 60% win rate to 16 losses.\nI don't think the methods for gold and above apply to lower elo.  If I can't kill 3 of the enemy team alone, we lose. If I get behind for any reason and don't roam and farm, we lose. Every time.\n\n\nI also don't see any way to win as ADC without bringing your own personal support. I don't see anyone playing Plat without coms or going in solo. This is huge. So all their advice is about how to do these little things when they take the huge advantage they have for granted. Playing on a set team with inter team communication with low ping will take you to gold in short order.\n\nDisagree all you want,  but you first have to dispute each of those facts individually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MUSHROOM MIDGET","date":"2017-05-08T18:12:29.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yeah you arent doing it right.  \n\nthe way people do it nowadays is pretend to keep fighting but instead feed them a few more kills.  this helps your team make the right choice when 20 mins rolls around.  \n\nif they vote no, just get 'caught' when the teams group and force your team into a bad teamfight and they eventually end it the old fashioned way.  its not as fast as open mid but it will get job done and no punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Nubulas","date":"2017-05-11T08:32:16.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which is just stealth giving up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-05-08T07:20:28.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yeah, but if you're only doing it when you get autofilled, its unlikely you'll get punished for it.","replies":[]}]}
