They are not huge, but they are just big enough to be irritating as well as ruining the game. Sometimes what it does is that the actions and still made, but you cant see it, and you can still kill minions, but when their lifebar disapears, they are still there. Also, anything that is not on the screen in the beggining of the lag will not appear before the end of it, so you can diefomr a gank and you wont know it until the lagspike ends. Is there a reason for this? Is it the servers?","replies":[{"poster":"Cerber42","date":"2016-10-20T13:14:37.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T02:23:30.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found no record of issues with the gameservers recently. Different players may experience similar issues if the issue is along the same network routing to the servers as yours.
