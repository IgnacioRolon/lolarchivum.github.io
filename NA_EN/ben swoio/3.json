As Talon all you gotta do is use your W to get 2 passive stacks on him and then Q auto for the bleed to get him low and rinse and repeat + ignite to kill him for first blood.  Don't let him bait you with his shield or windwall otherwise he can kill you and snowball.  Once you kill him just snowball off of that kill, roam bot for more easy kills, and win the game.  Before you go in on him always bait out his windwall with W.  Making the mistake of going in on him while his windwall is up will just get you killed and lose you the lane.\n\nFor Morg just clear waves with W and keep your distance from your own minion wave so he has a hard time dashing to you.  If he lands a Q and ults to you it's basically a free kill because you can immediately Q him out of his ult, press R and W, and then do all of his health for a kill.  If you don't think you can win, then just afk farm with W and don't go for kills because a farmed up Morg that can land bindings is much scarier than a farmed up Yasuo that dies if the enemy team sneezes on him.\n\nFor Zed you wanna just poke him down and once you get him low you can all in him at level 6.  Pre 6 you wanna be careful about engaging.  If he's standing near your W at low health then you can swap shadows and auto for the passive damage + e + ignite for a kill.  Bait his windwall before all inning him or you have a good chance of losing.  Sometimes what I like to do is fight him, but hold my ult until he has his 3rd charge of Q and then ult him right as he presses Q so the knockup misses and he's screwed.  Takes good timing to do it though so it can be risky.\n\nVeigar just ignore him and use E if he ever dashes onto you.  Ask your jungler for ganks for a kill if you want.  Just afk farm and outscale him.  Don't fight him when his windwall is up.","replies":[{"poster":"Fools Hesltate","date":"2017-08-17T18:16:34.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any Yasuo that gets hit by a Morgana Q is awful at the game.

I am currently M6, he is my highest mastery score champion.\nHowever that is not saying a lot since i rarely have more than 3 games of the same champion in any 20 game set so...\n\nAnyway How to beat Yasuo:\nYasuo is an insane Mid Game bully who has the tools he needs to survive lane.\nLate game he is only a REAL threat if your team gets picked or he gets a REALLY good ult. In teamfights he just either gets CC and explodes or just flat explodes. So we will focus on the other 2.\n\nLaning Phase:\n{{champion:238}} is a skill matchup. You can easily poke out his shield with Q since it does reduced damage through minions anyway. And as long as you are landing your Shadows Qs and Ws as well as your own you will out damage him. Also try to use your shadow to stay out of range of his Q unless you are going in for the kill.\n{{champion:91}} IMO is the worst out of the 4, Talon just gets bullied really easy in most lanes. He survives off of roaming so do just that DO NOT FIGHT YASUO. Yasuos are usually more than content with farming until powerspike but they will take free kills. Just dont give him the opportunity for it. A farm-fed Yasuo is much less scary mid-late than a 7/0 farm-fed Yasuo. \nSo yeah just roam and help other lanes and just try to not let Yas take your tower.\n{{champion:45}} A lot of people hate Vei into Yas but i love it. His E makes it really hard for Yas to get a good engage on you. The most important thing is if you get hit by a tornado after 6, Flash or Barrier that shit instantly (If you have barrier) Because the second he gets done Ulting you hes gonna want to stay on you and you WILL die.\nAlso no matter how far away he dashes he cant outrun Veigar R, just MAKE 100% SURE that his windwall is down before you use it. If you dont, then it is 100% on you and not the windwall being in his kits fault.\n{{champion:25}} Pop shield with W, Ult him if he goes in and you have it. If he engages let him eat them easy Qs. If you have good enough reflexes E his tornado. He should be pretty frustrated if you do it right, and will probably fuck up and dive you.\n\nMid game: CC CC CC CC CC. Yasuo should be your main focus unless he is like 0/8. If he gets into your backline he WILL 3-4 shot your carries. Luckily Yasuo is incredoubly weak to CC being a melee carry. If he IS 0/8 he will probably try to split or farm to make up for his gold deficit use this time to secure objectives, fight 5v4, or just keep 2 man killing him. Be warned if he is 0/8 but has his crit, dont underestimate him like a lot of people do.\n\nLate game: By now Yasuo will be kinda tanky, but will lose a bit of damage because of it. He will probably 4-6 shot your carries still as well. However he can still die fairly quickly with most CCs. DO NOT 1V1 HIM EVER. Send at LEAST 3 people with 1 or 2 hard CC spells in order to stop him if hes alone. This is the same with most good duelers who are split pushing. {{champion:114}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:5}} all are weak to this too.\n\nAs for items if you are a tank {{item:3143}} {{item:3047}} will just make him cry. As well as pretty much any armor item on any squishy will make you take at least 1 extra attack to kill. If CCd properly he should only get 3 or 4 off per fight anyway.\n\nNote if Yasuo is 14/0 dont be suprised if he is raping your entire team. {{champion:119}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:202}} and any other ADC can do the same thing. Its a Carry thing.\n\nAlso for the BM try to not let it tilt you, that is quite literally a strategy that some Yasuos use. They could be the most nice/level headed people. But since everyone knows everyone hates Yasuo a lot of them know a perfectly timed Mastery Emote can tilt a lot of people off the face of the earth.\nAlso not all Yasuo players are tilted. Usually they are either toxic tryhards, yes, but also silent but good. OR they are only playing him to meme and will be friendly in the chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2017-08-16T11:47:45.403+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skorch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hH1e7cU8,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2017-08-16T08:30:53.615+0000)\n>\n DO NOT 1V1 HIM EVER.
