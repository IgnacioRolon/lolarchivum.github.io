Every time I face one, all they do is constantly shove the wave mindlessly and fish for that ONE charm that leads to me being deleted. Past 6 it's like forget it, she just clicks R and dashes to safety. That or she R's to safety then R's back in then R's back out after getting a kill. It's ridiculous. \r\n\r\n I would rather not rely on jungle ganks (which for some reason NEVER happens for me) so I'd like to know, what's a good reliable way to beat people who play this stupid champ? I'm willing to open up my champ pool to a new champ so I can beat people who play this very annoying champ.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-08-10T01:15:12.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone who can build RoA makes her suffer, in my experience.
