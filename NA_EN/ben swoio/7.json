It just seems like a hopeless lane, ESPECIALLY if you make ONE mistake and die. It&#039;s like nope, there&#039;s no coming back. Suddenly it&#039;s just AA AA AA AA W AA AA E to stick AA AA AA AA AA AA oh shit I&#039;m gonna die R AA AA AA AA AA. Not fun.\r\n\r\nAnyway, how do you counter the perma shoving RNG crit click R to live trynd? Seriously? \r\n\r\nPs: I can&#039;t rely on the team to pick cc or lock down as I&#039;m a solo Q player.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben SwoIo","date":"2018-11-20T02:09:14.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"CC with what? He sticks easily with his E and he just needs ONE crit to turn the tides of a fight. Plus the top laners I play don't have much CC at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-11-20T06:27:42.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bully him early on. He has to auto attack the wave or you to build up fury so bully him so that he can’t. that way he can’t spin on you and engage with a full rage bar and conq prepped or use q to heal your harass.\n\nSomebody like Garen, Darius, hell even AP poke nasus might work.\nThe main thing to keep in mind is that Trynd is very squishy and can be bullied hard early when he doesn’t have R or any fury built up. It’s when he has his bar full and conq prepped that you want to be kinda careful, and even more so when he is past lvl 6 too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben SwoIo","date":"2018-11-20T19:28:22.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doge2020,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FWXoEA32,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-11-20T06:27:42.669+0000)\n>\n> Bully him early on.

So besides Darius (which I've had success with), what about my other champs? {{champion:59}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:2}} \n\nNot much CC and I always seem to just get outscaled hardcore. Just becomes a free stand still and auto crit-to-win fest.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TKM Axe","date":"2018-11-20T06:40:13.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CC","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-20T01:40:20.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cc and walk away when he ults. if ur laning against him as a melee bruiser you can bring phase rush and he cant win if you play safe til 4 to avoid his cheese","replies":[]}]}
