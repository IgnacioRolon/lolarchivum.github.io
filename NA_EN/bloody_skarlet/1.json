I really need some suggestions and help on a purchasing error","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have had an error that states I cannot make any attempts to get RP for the next 24 hours, apparently because I have purchased way too much. And I made a few more attempts during the error and that might have extended the duration of the restriction. But since the skins I want will not be on sale for too long I was wondering if I can use the same credit/debit card and add RP to another account and gift the skins to myself on my main account or send RP to my main account? Anyone know if that would work? I'm open to any suggestions or tips.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-18T01:56:06.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I * think* this might have been solved already since I'm seeing a lot of purchases being made today, but if you're still having problems make sure you reach out to our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) asap. Regardless of when the sale ends, if we know you're trying to make that purchase while the sale is going, we can make sure you get that sale price when you can finally get the RP, even if the sale window has passed. Make sure you reach out to those agents just in case!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-17T17:09:43.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming your alt and main account [meet the requirements](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752964-Gifting-Guide-and-FAQ), you should be able to. Unfortunately, otherwise you'd just have to be patient and wait until it clears up. I've missed out on sales before due to the same issue. \n\nIf you think you're going to make multiple RP purchases, you might want to consider making fewer but larger purchases. Doing so, you get extra bonus RP from your purchases, and you'll run into this issue less often. For example, instead of making 5 separate $10 RP purchases, make a single $50 RP purchase (though if you're making multiple $100 purchases and run into this issue, you just have to be patient and wait until they clear).\n\nAn alternative solution would be to go out and get an RP card, as those should be redeemable even with this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Bloody Skarlet","date":"2017-12-17T17:43:09.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just never expected this issue in the first place because I have never ever had it or seen it anywhere before so I was not prepared to encounter it. So my plan for now is using another account or getting a friend to gift me the skins. Being unsure about gifting from another account because I think I read somewhere that using the same card might cause the issue to continue or something like that. But I will give it a try.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-17T17:53:58.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could check to make sure your bank isn't holding back any payments, and that all payment have cleared. If there is a hold or if something hasn't cleared, you'll have your answer as to why it happened. If everything looks like it went through, then it probably cleared some time between when you first had the issue, and now. It can also happen when you make many purchases in a short time frame, which this would then act as a security feature.\n\nAn RP card would be your safest alternative solution, as you wouldn't be sending funds through another person, and wouldn't risk the potential issue that you mentioned.","replies":[{"poster":"Bloody Skarlet","date":"2017-12-17T18:06:48.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly those are not available anywhere in my country and ordering on the internet if that's even possible would take too long. So sadly my card is the only choice I have. That or a friend gifting me the skins and later on when the suspension has been removed I will return the RP to that friend.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
