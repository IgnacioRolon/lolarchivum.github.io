Get tornado Q.\n2. Stand pretty far away from your target, so when you use Q, it travels and your Q cooldown starts dropping.\n3. Then use your ultimate when target is knocked up.\n4. Now mid ultimate animation, your Q should be ready for use again, when you slam the target down with your ult, simultanously use Q. \n5. If done fast enough, Q animation wil go off, but it won't do damage nor grant a stack of gathering storm, but it will go on cooldown.\n\nAA bug after Last Breath:\n\n1. Get tornado Q (have auto attack on and right click on target, before or after using Q)\n2. Use it on target to knock them up (try both methods, standard Q from distance and E-Q combo)\n3. Use ultimate, do not move after ult, tell your target to not move either.\n4. After Yasuo does his ultimate animation and arrives at the ground, he stands there for 1 sec, not auto attacking.\n5. When you are in the air and slam the target down or even after it, you can try to right click on target again, he still won't auto attack for 0.5-1 sec.\n\nI will make videos about these bugs if needed, but not now, later today.\n\nAlso, you didn't comment on the E-Q bug when you have a tornado Q ready. The outer part of the circle knocks targets up, but doesn't deal damage. Take a look at the caster minion in this video, gets knocked up, doesn't take damage: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DsODnzKzRs\n\nNow, which part of this is a bug, I am not sure, it is for you guys to decide based on the range of that ability combo. Either the minion shouldn't be knocked up, or if it is knocked up, it should take damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-02-28T23:41:26.726+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=GuGhiGoh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-28T13:01:59.439+0000)\n>\n> Yo,\n> \n> 1) Q being dodgeable and missable while blind is intended.\n> 2) Q3 Cooldown bug, I think I have a fix. \n> 3) Aa / Q after Last Breath: need to look into it.\n> \n> ~Exgeniar.\n\nCan Confirm The AA/Q after last Breath\n\nIn the meantime if you move a little right after you ulti everything is fine.

I can almost understand Thresh and Vel because their attacks are part of them, but then Zyra would need an exception too because her AA are her whipping her vines on her hands and drawing them back just like them.\n\nBut effects with no travel time get through consistently ...\nLee Sin cripple (Cripple is a point blank autotargeted debuff)\nlulu whimsy (a zero travel time targeted ability)\n...with a few exceptions.\n\nChampions are allowed through...\nblitz grab\ntahm tongue\n...but i guess not all parts of all champions are created equally.\n\nAt least when orianna ball interacts with windwall it always does the same thing. it stops there. except if you try to move it through windwall it stops and drops, but if you try to shield an ally and the ball hits the windwall the ball immediately returns to ori because of course it does.\n\nSpeaking of player summoned units like ori ball, olaf axe is stopped in place, while thresh lantern is destroyed. Why the difference here?\n\nThe exceptions to this ability know no bounds.\n\nMeanwhile braum shield works by its own set of rules entirely where AOE effects still hit braum and his nearby allies, projectiles are no longer projectiles for his shield...\nLux shield\nDraven axes\nLeona zenith blade\nJinx rockets (first one damage mitigation but gets full AOE anyway)\nNami bubble\nCass miasma\nMundo cleavers\n... why are these no longer projectiles?\n\nBut Braum shield does block non projectiles like...\nVelKoz Ult\nLux Ult\nCho Rupture (blocked from center of ability not from cho)\n... why? Who knows?\n\nWith your three simple rules and all these exceptions memorized you too can understand what \"projectiles\" are, but remember, they are different for different walls.\n\nEDIT: formatting + links for reference -\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Yasuo/Projectiles\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Braum\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 Stylish","date":"2016-02-28T17:44:43.242+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=GuGhiGoh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-28T13:01:59.439+0000)\n>\n> Yo,\n> \n> 1) Q being dodgeable and missable while blind is intended.\n> 2) Q3 Cooldown bug, I think I have a fix. \n> 3) Aa / Q after Last Breath: need to look into it.\n> \n> ~Exgeniar.\n\nThanks for looking into this.
