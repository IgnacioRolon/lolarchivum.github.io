I had been mystery gifted Amethyst Ashe by a guy named Regulador. The message that went with the gifted skin said \"well played\". He had also sent me a friend request.\r\n\r\nAt first I didn't know who this was, so I checked my match history to see if I'd played with this guy before. Turned out that we were in bot lane together, and I was supporting his Twitch as Annie. This confused me, because I didn't even do well that game (I went 4/9/11, and I occasionally took one of his creeps to get the stun stack). But I guess I must've done something right to deserve a random skin.\r\n\r\nI plan on adding this guy on my main account and play a few games with him at the very least.\r\n\r\nTL; DR: Played a game with a guy named Regulador yesterday, he thought I did well and mystery gifted me a skin for no reason after the game.","replies":[]}
