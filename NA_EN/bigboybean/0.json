Update your DNS settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 really quickly to see if we can get your network to take a much shorter or smoother path to our servers, but I'd also be sure to try using ethernet if at all possible. \n\nLet me know if this seems to be helping at all, if not we can dig a little further and get this straightened out if you stick with us ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"BigBoyBean","date":"2018-01-18T19:16:30.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the response! but it still seems to have the same issue. i am also connected to Ethernet!\nSad times!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T21:04:14.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Were you able to try the DNS steps as well and test those in practice/customs?","replies":[{"poster":"BigBoyBean","date":"2018-01-18T22:15:12.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was yes but my ping is perfectly fine during games so i'm unsure on why it is having a problem waiting the 20 mins","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T23:38:02.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Little known fact, the matchmaking queues and in-game servers are completely different connections. On top of that, the matchmaking queue connection can be VERY picky about small interruptions, which packet loss will cause issues with that almost every time in my experience. \n\nI'd like to try one more thing really quickly to test for packet loss. Grab [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a trace to our NA servers at 104.160.131.1.
