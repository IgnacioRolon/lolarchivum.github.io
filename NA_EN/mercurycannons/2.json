I refuse to help the lazy. \n\nRight now something like 47 % of the nation lives off Government, now if you think that 47 % of people are incapable of supporting themselves then you are an idiot.  So many people who can easily support themselves use Government programs to survive because there is no reason for them to work. Why would they? They can get a free phone, house, and food all from the Government!\n\nNow, clearly the U.S. doesn't have enough money to support every person that doesn't want to work. (although democrats are trying to make this the case)  So some uneducated liberals think the answer to this is just to tax rich people! hey, they have so much money anyways!\n\nWell guess what happens when you raise taxes on \"rich\" people? AKA business owners. YOU KILL JOBS.  Then, unemployment goes up and the people who were trying to work, no longer can and are also forced to live off Government programs. \n\n\"But people who work at minimum wage jobs can't support themselves\"  Well guess what, you are doing a job with minimum skills, so you're going to get minimum wage. You can't be paid like people who are doing a job that actually requires training. That's called communism, and we've seen time and time again that does not work. \n\n\"free healthcare!!\" All this does is lower the quality of hospitals and doctors around the U.S.  and discourage people from becoming doctors. \n \nWhy not just deregulate health care so it could be more affordable? Because liberal logic. \n\nAnyways, i imagine that this is just going to get down voted because i'm sure i hurt a liberal or two's feelings. But if you think you can come up with an argument against any of the points i made, go ahead. I'll be sure to show you how silly and awful your thought process is.","replies":[]}
