At random times, sometimes at the beginning of a match or in the middle, the client freezes.  And it doesn't just freeze League; it freezes my whole computer.  It doesn't crash when it's loading: it doesn't crash immediately on getting into the game, though it has crashed 7 or 10 seconds after getting in.  It doesn't crash on the menu screens.  It just freezes at random, with no warning, while in the game.  No sound, no mouse moving, no response whatsoever from my computer.\n\n The only fix I've found is a full system restart, which usually takes a few minutes.  I've crashed multiple times in a single match, and this instability has landed me a place in the LeaverBuster queue, an issue that salts this wound considerably.  I don't know what's causing it: I've disabled Steam, repaired the client, then uninstalled and reinstalled the client, and forced League to use my discrete card.  Any suggestions?\n\nAlso, specs.  Running Windows 10 on an Intel i7-5500U and a Nvidia GTX 850M.  Both Windows and League should be fully updated, and   I have a HP Envy laptop, a few years old.  I think my graphics drivers are updated, I'm on Version 368.81.  No signs of issue in other places.  \n\nIf you have any ideas on things that can help, or you need any more information, please let me know.\n\nEdit: Turning off the Xbox DVR seems to have fixed things.  The only other issue would be if this only happens when I'm partied with someone, which is how I usually play League.  But for the most part, it's all looking good.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T23:08:58.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for providing very detailed context on the nature of your PC freezes. Due to the fact you're on Windows 10, I suspect this may be caused by the Anniversary update that enabled the Game DVR feature inside the Xbox app. I recommend [disabling the game bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if anything changes.\n\nLet me know the results of that change.","replies":[{"poster":"Archtofen","date":"2016-09-02T05:29:39.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do believe your fix worked!
