It's not always an install issue. And I highly doubt it has necessarily found some major issue in my files. You guys have repair mode going off during a game I'm supposed to enter, and now I'm stuck with a loss despite likely being able to make it back in time for the game to begin if allowed. Stop locking me out unless the system actually has a way to fix this supposed \"problem\" that somehow showed up in a time that kills the possibility of re-entering the game. The manual repair button works just fine, as would a popup window asking whether repairs are needed, or something more like 2--3 consecutive crashes.

If the repair hasn't seemed to work yet, let's take a step back and try fixing this before you jump back into the queue's and risk getting penalties for leaving games due to crashes. \n\nIt's not a guaranteed fix, but using this [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) is a good starting point. Make sure you run it with the option **force repatch** turned on, and let me know how that goes.

In which way did it not work as intended? Was it the automatic repair function that sprung up in the new client?\n\nMy point is that the automatic repair function, which appears to be intended, is a detrimental function to the game. If this is not intended, ignore the rest of my post, and let me know that I actually do need a repair to fix that. If it is intended, that's my problem.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nThe repair tool is not a good starting point when I'm literally holding up the game from several other players, and ultimately taking the loss. Anything can cause a crash, often background program interference. The repair tool should be a backup solution, not the mandatory fix, as sometimes problems *are* fixable by fixing that background issue. I'm fairly comfortable in guessing that the repair was not necessary, as was the case a couple other times this season, due to having played multiple games immediately beforehand, with minor internet browsing done between games.\n\nMandatory repairs while a game is in session is **not** a helpful feature. Please leave it at having a repair button, or as I said:\n\n>The manual repair button works just fine, as would a popup window asking whether repairs are needed, or something more like 2--3 consecutive crashes. Just stop locking me out for a certain loss.\n\nSometimes it's a simple user error that the user can fix more efficiently than the fix-it can do, and at a time that's more crucial. At very least, leave me the comfort in knowing I can't fix the problem myself before you shove me aside and say you'll make everything better. I'm losing my game here.","replies":[]}]}]}
