Cats aren't as in your face with their affection as dogs are, but that doesn't mean they aren't affectionate. Sometimes cats just leave you alone and sometimes they want to spend time with you, just like a human would. I kinda love them for that, they are pretty low maintenance. \n\nI love dogs too. But I have had many cats and been close to family members' cats, and all of them have unique personalities are really loving, just like a dog would be. If a cat is scratching and biting unprovoked, then there is something wrong or they are flat out a wild cat. Which isn't the case if you are sheltering them and giving them love.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-03-05T21:04:38.716+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"I've had to live with dogs and cats before, and dogs are much more of a pain in the ass.

Dogs are also more socialized with strangers (read: need to be walked daily), which creates more situations in which they might act out. I would also suggest that the only reason they are \"more dangerous\" than cats is purely due to size. a small dog is no more dangerous than a cat. \n\nOf course this is all personal opinion, I just really dislike the whole \"which one is better\" debate.
