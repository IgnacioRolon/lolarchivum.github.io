If you check a website that shows win rate by game length, you can watch his win rate plummet over time, the opposite of a &quot;hyper carry&quot; like jax. That is part of the reason he is resourceless.  Almost all resourceless champions are meant to be mid or early focused champions (Garen, reksai, lee sin, etc). The only champion I can think of that breaks this rule is riven, but she&#039;s a bit of an unique case. This is because, eventually when most champions don&#039;t have to worry about mana, their use of mana allows them to better access certain items (imagine riven with muramana). His wind wall, shield, and dashes are there to protect him in the early game to compensate him for his awful base stats. And before anyone says his base stats are comparable to mages, understand melees are balanced around the inherent range disadvantage and tend to have more damage and natural tankiness (compare yi to an adc). Lastly, his double crit chance forces him to build pure damage items and not bruiser ones early because he is compensated with bad damage without it. Due to this, he spikes with the classic shiv and another crit item (hello mid game). This also happens to make him worse late game, because when so much crit chance stops becoming a factor, his Crits do 90% of everyone else&#039;s.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T14:50:27.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Come end game, you've either built more AD than the carries or you've built tank items because the previous idea is suboptimal given how easily you die.

His concept's cool, his interactions are cool, his gamestyle's cool, but he's too strong. \nAnd Yasuo has good damage even withouth double crit as I demonstrated in another thread, double crit is only to make him more appealing and give his passive some kinde of fighting potential (the shield doesn't give him any once the fight starts).\nAnd it's not as you said: double crit isn't there to compensate his \"awful bad\" stats, it's the total opposite, he's got average stats BECAUSE he has double crit, with no double crit he would have quite better stats.\nAnd btw, thanks to Warlord's bloodlust (even if nerfed) he still has access to lifesteal without building any, so he doesn't get punished for building only crit items.\nYasuo is broken, and all I ask is to remove double crit and give him compensatory buffs if needed (just reverting the nerfs would be enough to make him a lot stronger) or if you want the nonsensical double crit (since it doesn't come from anything, it doesn't make sense lore-wise) at least remove the shield, so that people can punish his bad engages.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T17:48:22.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you take Yasuo's cirt and give him compensation buffs, then he'll be running around with stats like a bruiser and a really strong laning phase that'll let him bully almost everything. The fact that he can get blown up easily is one of the things that keeps him balanced, yo.\n\nJust consider the fact that his damage steroid does very little until you've got your first full item. That creates a power gate keeps his damage from being too outrageous in the earliest phases of the game. Please do not tell me that you want to remove these things, because that's what taking away his crit passive leads to.","replies":[{"poster":"Valexfor","date":"2015-11-26T18:16:23.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't get blown up easily. He is supposed to be played like renekton, but while renekton can get punished for a bad e, Yasuo can't, his shield will save him. Also compensatory buffs arent' just stats buffs, he would still get 3-4 extra ad, some more AR/MR and maybe health, but the actual buffs would be on his shield, it would be up more often and would be stronger overall, more range on ult, you name it, they can give him a lot of things, not just raw stats, he would also be able to build more freely, and it would actually be a good thing, since forced builds are one of the worst things in a game.\nLike I said: Yasuo doesn't need double crits, it's there only to make people feel good when winning thanks to a crit. I've proven it to you: he gets nerfed because he retains double crit, if he didn't have double crit he would be fine, strong but totally balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T18:29:02.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all, of course Yasuo can get punished for a bad E. He can even be stopped mid-E. His shield can be easily popped. There are a lot of things at work to keep Yasuo alive, but they don't suddenly make him able to survive high burst or sustained harass. The low defenses and hp are still there.\n\nSecond, while we could argue about exactly what sort of buffs he'd get to compensate for the loss of his crit passive, how can you suggest that it's only there as a feel-good element? Crits don't feel good as yasuo beyond the laning phase; they're just a thing you do. They're guaranteed to you as your passive damage steroid. And need I remind you, it's your only steroid before level 6, and even then your bonus arpen doesn't do anything against some champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Valexfor","date":"2015-11-26T18:45:55.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First: he gets punished only for REALLY bad mistakes thanks to the shield, and also he can just dash to another minion before you punish him since punishment. I punished a lot of Yasuos only to see the shield pop up and do nothing to them.\n\nSecond: You can just see how he was at release, that's just the sort of buffs (reverts) he would need to compensate loss of double crit (1% flow every 40 units, bonus flow generation on e, more range on ult, stronger 2 sec shield versus the 1 sec live, more HP, 4 stacks on e, 5 more MS) but he's an assassin, so MAYBE some other buffs (maybe give ult passive ArPen that gets doubled when activated instead of just the active buff, 2-3 base ad) could be acceptable. But yep, crits are there just as a feel-good element usually since they are STRONGER, FANCIER versions of normal attacks you do and are usually fairly rare unless you're ahead or the game has gone on for long, so they feel cool and make you feel better. In EVERY game crits are there just for this reason, and I'm an rpg player, so I know what I'm talking about, I have played lots of games where a crit saved my ass and made me feel incredibly good since they're there just for that.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-26T19:07:32.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's why you pop the shield or throw out CC. Don't just unload spells on a shielded Yasuo.\n\nTwo things for your other points though. Yasuo is a fighter/assassin, just like Tryn, FIora, and Jax (not Yi because he's primary assassin, secondary fighter). None of them have that secondary role because they're diving in, killing one target, and getting away. They're not assassins. What they are, is a class of character that lacks the stats of fighter and has dps high enough to resemble burst damage. They're melee carries.\n\nAnyway, crit chance isn't just to feel good. It can serve a great deal of possible purposes, and in League of legends, the very fact that you can get hit by crits as often as you dish them out more or less relegates the feelgood feeling to a secondary purpose, which the primary is to create variance in the moment to moment play of autoattackers. And the thing about yasuo is that he bypasses both of those things entirely. His damage is very, very consistent and crits lose their charm as treats since you're dealing them all the time.\n\nBrother, playing role playing games doesn't make anyone an expert on the subject of game mechanics. Neither you, nor I, nor the countless other people on the forums are anything other than \"familiar\" with those mechanics thanks to playing games. Delving deep and actually studying the how and why of game mechanics is what makes you more knowledgable.","replies":[{"poster":"Valexfor","date":"2015-11-26T20:11:05.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Nope, you don't just pop his shield or throw out cc when your only cc has melee range. He is broken from a melee opoint of view, you have 1 (2 at max) skills that can hit a medium distance, but guess what? he's got a windwall and a passive shield, so he can block the poke with the wall and soak your damage when he all-ins on you with the shield since most melee champs don't have too many ranged skills and they usually tend to cost a lot. And even when you're ranged, he can just place a wall in front of you when you try to harrass him and punish you after charging his q since every stack can last up to 10 sec (meaning he has up to 20 sec to charge it and another 10 to use it and that's a lot when you just need 4 sec to both charge and unleash it mid-game) also, you can't poke while he's got his q stacked, or you will just get hit by it and ulted, and if you play is safem unless you are aa a fair range away from minions, he can e + q on you.\n\n2)Whatever anyone wants to say: crits are there to make you feel good. They are an healthy mechanic, but the reason they are there is mainly for making you feel good. Remember: games are made to make you feel good about the game, so everything in it it's for that very purpose (and I am not saying this is bad, just a fact). I am following the creation of a MMORPG, my dream is to program games and I am studying to make that dream come true, so I kind of understand what a mechanic can be for. In league, unless you are ahead or are Yasuo/Trynd, you will almost never do a crit early game, by mid game 1/3 of your attacks are crits and by late-game 2/3 of your attack are crits (unless you want to go 100%)... they become less about the good feeling as the game progresses, like in any other game.\nThe variance between autoattackers is actually one of the reasons crits exist in MOBAs (and other games), but you said it: Yasuo bypasses balance reasons thanks to his passive that makes them constant (they should be balancing out auto attackers, but sncehe can almost only crit by mid game, they just make him stronger than what he should be). And nope: critical strikes are appealing no matter what to a player, be it with 0.001% or 100% crit chance, hitting one is always pleasant.\n\n3)Assassin's aren't assassins because they dive you... they are assassins since they either burst you down or have to back and wait for the right moment to all-in again, they become useless in a head-on fight. And yes, both fiora, jax and trynd are pretty well known for their \"dive then get out with 10 hp after ignite\" (every champ with both Assassin and Fighter is a problematic one since he can both get you bursted down and fight head-on with you if he fails), only difference is they are more fighter oriented than assassins, so while they do dive on you, they hit you mostly with aa (making them good duelers), while an assassin would have to burn his skills then back.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-11-26T17:01:33.442+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait why is he forced to build pure damage lol?\n\nDouble crit means he can afford to build only 2 damage items and still be an extreme damage threat.\n\n{{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} is already huge, then all he needs to do is stack up on items like \n{{item:3156}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3143}} and be pretty tanky while still outputting high damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2015-11-26T17:05:03.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BluePolarizer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=F7AeEEt0,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-11-26T17:01:33.442+0000)\n>\n> Wait why is he forced to build pure damage lol?\n> \n> Double crit means he can afford to build only 2 damage items and still be an extreme damage threat.\n> \n> {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} is already huge, then all he needs to do is stack up on items like \n> {{item:3156}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3143}} and be pretty tanky while still outputting high damage.\n\nHow do check people's rankings?","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-11-26T17:42:15.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"na.op.gg.\n\nI'm plat 2. you are bronze 1. wanna keep talking about rankings?","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2015-11-27T20:28:26.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BluePolarizer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=F7AeEEt0,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-11-26T17:42:15.637+0000)\n>\n> na.op.gg.\n> \n> I'm plat 2. you are bronze 1. wanna keep talking about rankings?\n\n...what? ~~I am legit confused ~~\n\nI wanted to check TheFluffyMuffin's ranking... not yours...
