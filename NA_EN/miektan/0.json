My download starts at a decent 2mbps but over the next few minutes it steadily decreases until it is at 150 kbps than will slowly increase to 200 and hold steady. When I updated the patcher it sustained the 2mbps just fine and in the past patches have always downloaded at 2mbps.  Now my 10 minute patch says it will take 83 minutes (900MB to go). =|","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-23T21:18:45.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every PC is different so patching can vary in not just downloading updates but also writing them into your game files.  You can use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your network to see if that might help.
