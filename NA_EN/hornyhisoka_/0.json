People say oh ashe winrate to low, oh she is so bad, but i think with her ult she can easily outplay and with her slow you cant really run and it is REALLY annoying. I just think that she without her ult she can easily die like no mobility 0 and xayah on the other hand if you max e then you can 1 shot basically but remember im not someone that is like gold or something im just finding an adc to climb so i may be wrong, but this is my opinion. Ashe Or Xayah?","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-02-03T02:45:10.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe is like the Garen of bot lane. She's not flashy but playing her will teach you the fundamentals of ADC.\n\nXayah however will reward you far more for investing in mastery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ka√¨ju","date":"2018-02-03T06:30:04.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe really isn't as good as she seems. She is very basic, and that's great to learn but unless you devote way too much time to her, you won't get enough value out of the pick to justify it.\n\nAshe does very little damage unless ahead, and she can't get ahead unless her team babies her. But soloQ players generally play for themselves, so you won't be spoon fed kills. Her R is nice yeah, but even then unless you know how to do it, you won't be getting actually game changing cross map stuns.\n\nXayah is tricky but does far better as a carry. She has a safe enough lane phase with good if mana hungry clear, nice zone control, and she shreds multiple enemies at once, rather than needing several seconds on one target.\n\nNot to mention. Even with her slow, unless you have a lot of crit Ashe can't actually outrun most people. She simply has too low of move speed. A Lee Sin at level one is still faster than Ashe even with the 10% slow. And with how many champions have mobility these days she isn't as overwhelming. Slows don't do anything against hap closers and dashes and blinks and jumps. Almost every modern champion has some sort of mobility that she can't deal with outside of stay the fuck away out of range and poke with W.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-02-03T04:25:26.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xayah is how you obliterate teams.\n\nAshe is how you obliterate targets","replies":[]}]}
