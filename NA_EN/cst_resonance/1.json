Duos are like two of the same person. They're either really nice and work with the team, or incredibly toxic and unwilling to work with your team. If you want to surrender and move on to another game, you can't because two of them won't surrender and they think trolling is the funniest thing in the world.

There should be a game type for totally random, single team selection. This does give you a better chance at creating a supposedly equal field of play for all players, while increasing the chance that you will have very contradictory skill sets and levels, thus making the game a little more interesting. It's sort of like a \"DeathMatch\" on CoD or \"Lone Wolves\" on Halo.\nWith this point, I need to mention, that the original team selection needs to be kept, as I, as well as many others, enjoy the challenge of trying to win with a supposedly shit \"Duo Bot\", or entire team. lol","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2015-03-17T08:49:05.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=smallestTroll,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BR4V199E,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2015-03-16T18:49:47.967+0000)\n>\n> I agree with this entirely, however, it needs to be tied back in to OP's original point.

Even normal games tend to match you with players of similar skill level (which sucks if you are unranked and constantly have to deal with smurfs, but that's a new thread entirely). Yet the duo doesn't seem to be quite so restricted.\nHaving a solo-que round robin that really selects randomly, rank or skill completely ignored, would be awesome.
