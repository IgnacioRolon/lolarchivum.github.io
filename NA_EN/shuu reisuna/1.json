Sometimes you may also need to repair certain game files if the patch didn't work 100%, so it'd be worth the time to try a quick repair as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GanEagla","date":"2018-01-24T23:43:52.170+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having this problem. I lock frames to 60, my monitor doesn't go past that, game seems to start at 55-60, drops to the 40-45 range when csing and about 25 when fighting.
