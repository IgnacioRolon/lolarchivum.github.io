So I'm here stuck wondering why on earth is this game not running so I decided that I may as well ask here to see if I can get an answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Thou Mighty One","date":"2015-02-06T04:50:06.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea me and my friend are having the same problem different networks n pc and still wont work","replies":[]},{"poster":"lostminer","date":"2015-02-15T19:25:07.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"after around 12 hours of waiting it finally launched (: thanks again","replies":[{"poster":"lostminer","date":"2015-02-15T19:25:43.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lostminer,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=a1nT13NK,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-02-15T19:25:07.256+0000)\n>\n> after around 12 hours of waiting it finally launched (: thanks again\n\nI was sleeping most of the time though","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lostminer","date":"2015-02-15T19:09:32.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bty thank you all for the help when and if the patcher shows up ill make sure to run  the patcher every day I can (that doesn't mean play the  game every day though)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Trent","date":"2015-02-06T02:32:27.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It took like a whole day before I could play league after taking a 3 month break from it cus of all the patching","replies":[]},{"poster":"lostminer","date":"2015-02-06T01:20:36.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tried it, it doesn't seem like it's working.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-02-06T01:33:05.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lostminer,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=a1nT13NK,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-06T01:20:36.380+0000)\n>\n> I just tried it, it doesn't seem like it's working.\n\nSince you haven't launched the game in a while, it may take a little while for the patcher to complete it's patch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-02-06T00:59:45.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lostminer,\n\nIt sounds like the game is having trouble patching the patcher!
