The idea, mechanically, is understandable; however, as many people have pointed out, his ultimate just doesn&#039;t _feel_ right. So, I thought this could help out:\n\nInstead of having it as a cone shaped attack, why not sacrafice the long range for an AoE push back? I know, long range is his thing, but I feel that it'd fit his character much better. With a short charge up time that halts Aurelion in place, some fancy effects and charging up pose (perhaps a star growing in his chest), followed by a large &#039;BOOM&#039; with the area around him exploding in light and pushing enemies back (perhaps still doing damage to those nearby, maybe not to the outer orbit but about half-way) would feel a lot more satisfying thematically. It&#039;d be like a discharge of energy, a show of his power, forcing back the enemies because it&#039;s just too much to handle.\n\nStats wise, you would have to remove some damage to the attack along with range to keep it balanced; however I feel that it&#039;d be much better for him overall. I know, I probably posted this in the completely wrong place, but oh well! An idea is an idea.\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-03-21T15:01:16.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But...its not a cone shape. It's a linear long ranges skillshot with a knockback.\n\n\"why not sacrafice the long range for an AoE push back? I know, long range is his thing\"\n\nHe needs at least one skill with some decent range, also its already an aoe push back (anything near him gets pushed to his stars, on top everything is heavily slowed).   \n\nAlso long range is not his thing.  Lux is long range, xerath is long range, ziggs is long range.  Sol is medium range like swain.  Most of his damage is from his q which blows up past his stars and his stars damage (which his ulti blows anyone near him back to which sets them up nicely for follow up stun to the face and more passive damage).\n\nIf he had a charge up time then he would be unplayable as a medium ranged mage.  Everyone would just jump on him as he would have zero options to stop them.  Swain has sustain cc and slows, vlad has sustain, kennen has cc.  they all work as medium range mages because of this.  He is going to be the same (cc from passive with rylias and if he gets caught then ulti them back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SheikaRei","date":"2016-03-21T15:06:14.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got it in the right place. This section is for concepts. By definition, a concept is an abstract idea or a general notion. Basically an idea that is being explained. So, no, you did not get this in the wrong place. \nNow, to the meat of your post. Thematically it would work. But I think keep the damage the same while severely limiting the range on it would be the better way to go.\nWith this much thought put into a single ability (thematically), I wonder what you would do for a whole kit. Keep up the work.","replies":[]}]}
