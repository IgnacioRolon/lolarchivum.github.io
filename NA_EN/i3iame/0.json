Secondary tree was irrelevant.\r\n\r\nI went for TP and just hard push waves 'till I get 1100 to get a catalyst and TP back into lane.\r\n\r\nAnd it's OP. Really, really, really OP. Fleet of footwork, along with her shield + taste of blood gives her insane regen and resistance in laning phase. Rod of Ages as a first item coupled with triumph makes you really strong in skirmishes or 1v2s... Nashor's Tooth second item and you're blowing so many auto attacks that Fleet of footwork activates even more often. + the movement speed from fleet of footwork means you can dodge skillshots + stick to your enemies to do even more autos. It's basically bruiser Diana. You're doing more DPS damage, and your resistance is strong enough to catch all your opponents off guard. + you have insane lane pressure because you can push like crazy while also regenerating HP, meaning you can be an insane bully.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend all Diana mains to give it a try. It's literally freelo.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-19T04:43:03.780+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coming soon to YouTube: \"NEW DIANA OFF-META BUILD!

They need to mini-rework her and do more with Moonlight and swap E and R (with a lot of other things being done). Bring the poor lass back to her true design: The first AP Fighter.","replies":[{"poster":"I3Iame","date":"2019-06-20T10:26:45.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I mean, she also lacks decent trading (if the target survives her burst, they win)\n\nThis is probably the reason why health regen on her seems to be working out. The only problem afterwards is that we're losing Electrocute + ap items and getting mana to go along with the health sustain. That works, I'm not gonna lie, but I'll have to keep seeing what fleet of footwork has to offer by trying out different builds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I3Iame","date":"2019-06-20T10:19:33.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right.
