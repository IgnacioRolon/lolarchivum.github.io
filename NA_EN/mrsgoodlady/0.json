Any tips or fixes?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-29T15:28:07.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This early in the patching process, the patching is trying to read your game files to prep for an update but is getting blocked.  Go through the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that League is added as an exception.  That should get things moving again!","replies":[{"poster":"Ratard","date":"2017-04-29T16:19:52.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this same issue, it will reach around 300 files scanned and pops up every time with the 004 Error for me.  I have made no changes to my computer and I was just playing the day before and now all of a sudden this. I've gone through the permissions and have ran the Hex Tech Tool and that thing even doesn't manage to do anything. I've tried the Force repatch option and it always crashes the Hex Tech saying, \"Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) Client Application has stopped working\".  When the 004 Error pops up it just goes right back to scanning and getting the error again, so when I click the gear and select Initiate Full Repair, all it does it close the launcher and it never relaunches and repairs on its own.  I'm not sure if the endless loop is stopping the Repair command or what.  \n\nI am avoiding a full uninstall and reinstall right now because I've seen quite a few other people with this same issue and they've already tried to reinstall the game 3-5 times and still the same issue. I have slow internet and it would take me hours upon hours to reinstall just one time ....\n\nI feel like you guys may have \"forced\" this new client upon people a little bit prematurely.  Would be nice if you could bring the old client out of retirement until issues like this are ironed out.  Playing the game perfectly fine one day and the next unable to even produce a play button to click is a bit unacceptable in my opinion.  Especially for the people who do actually have a lot of money and time tied up in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-29T16:26:12.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The error 004 error is the client's way of saying that something is blocking game files from getting scanned or downloaded.  Re-configuring OS or software permissions to add league as an exception usually helps, but it can be a [connection issue](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) too.  The updated client is a new application, so it needs to be allowed to run like any other software that's installed.\n\nSince you've already gone through quite a few steps already, we'd like to continue working with you individually to figure this out!  Grab the logs from your HRT scan, and attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Our tech guys will work with you until we get you back in game.  See you there!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrsGoodLady","date":"2017-05-03T15:11:24.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback everyone!
