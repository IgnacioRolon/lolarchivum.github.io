This FPS would increase as the game went on.\r\n\r\nSpecs: (I know its not a beast, but it used to run this game well)\r\nWindows 10\r\nI5 2500k @3.3 GHZ\r\nNvidia Geforce 760\r\n14GB Ram\r\n\r\nStart each game at ~280 FPS\r\nMeet opponent in lane ~160 FPS\r\nMid Game ~120 FPS\r\nLate Game ~ 80 FPS\r\n*roughly 200 FPS drop throughout game*\r\n\r\nI used to start the game at ~300 FPS and play all game around 180.\r\n\r\nThings I have tried/tested.\r\n\r\n1. Disable Xbox DVR\r\n2. Check GPU temp -never exceeds 70 degrees- No hot air felt\r\n3. Clean install of Nvidia drivers.  Tried the last 3 drivers all clean install, all the same issue.\r\n4. Clean install of League of Legends (Also tried repair prior)\r\n5. Clean registry with CCleaner\r\n6. Run Malwarebytes - No infections, Run Anti-virus-No infections\r\n7. Windows up to date\r\n8. Tested War Thunder - Not experiencing FPS drop during the game\r\n\r\nThings of note:\r\n1. I don't know if its helpful, but about 3 weeks ago my pvp.net kernel stopped working, I can only run the game as admin.  I have used the \"permissions\" guide, has not changed anything.\r\n2. Game loads properly as administrator, but I never used to have to do this.\r\n\r\nReally at my wits end.  To me I thought for sure it would be the GPU overheating... but I test it with CAM and as I got the drops my temps never exceeded 70 degrees, which should be in the safe range.\r\n\r\nRead all the guides, all the suggestions.  Simply nothing has worked for me.  Please help... anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T02:18:43.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CAM has actually caused issues in the past with League, so I recommend disabling it, then ensuring you've checked up on your [Windows power settings](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq6). I'd also recommend capping your FPS to match the refresh rate of your display, as uncapped frames can cause inconsistencies in your FPS and *screen tearing*. \n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Phelixx","date":"2016-10-20T04:45:49.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have uninstalled CAM, did not seem to have any change.\n\nWorked with the windows power settings, no apparent change.\n\nI used to run this game at 144 FPS capped and it never dropped below there.  Now by mid game I am fairly consistently under FPS cap.\n\nThanks for the advice, frustrating that I am unable to solve this.  It just happened one day out of no where and I guess now I am stuck with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T20:59:41.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm confident we can resolve this if you reach out to our tech team.
