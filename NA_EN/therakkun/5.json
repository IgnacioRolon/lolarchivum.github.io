I know that sounds bad but its the truth. You will never climb as support at this elo because you cannot carry and your team will not use you to your full tactical advantage. I mean think about it. Climbing means you are doing better than your peers at your division. Which means you should be carrying aka doing better than your peers in your game.

Its not only quick, its a rather fun way to get the IP you need.\nYou could also look up a guide or two if you need some extra help. Solomid.net and even Lolking have some pretty decent guides. Forewarned, Solomid isn't that prominent as it used to be and a ton of the guides are out of date, and Lolking is pretty haphazard with who makes the guides. Take everything with a grain of salt. \nAlso, play normal draft if you wanna practice. Nobody likes it when you're trying new heroes for the first time in ranked. \nI'd personally recommend AVOIDING ranked all together unless you got at least a loose grip on how to play every role.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-04-11T01:15:36.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any viable male midlaners other than zed?\nTalon?\nVelkoz?\nViktor?\nXerath?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Godhri","date":"2015-04-11T00:10:52.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just keep trying.
