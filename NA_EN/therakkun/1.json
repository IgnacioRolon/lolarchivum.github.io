T1 runes are 5 ip for regulars, 15 for quints. Meanwhile t2 quints are 100 ip... and the regular ones are 35... are you really that cheap? Like... srs? t2 runes USED to be a scam and a noob trap But not anymore. For example... t3 quints for cool downs are 2.5%, while t2 are 1.95%.... are they still a scam?\n> \n> Edit: they are good enough until you can replace them\n\nYes, they're absolutely a scam. Considering that you buy them and it delays you from getting the only ones that actually matter, and the ones that actually matter are so expensive, they're a grand scam. The whole rune system is a scam.","replies":[{"poster":"ShaftyMegee","date":"2015-05-11T05:34:26.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heh, you gave me a pretty good laugh. Go on strIke then!

If you feel so strongly about it then why bother playing this or any other game that has a system similar to this that you can buy something to help you. Do you seriously expect us to believe you don't play any other game that does this?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-05-11T20:17:48.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if runes get a price reduction or get made free...\n\nfuck that man I'd want a massive refund, and I promise you that aint happening. so may as well leave it as it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ComannderShepard","date":"2015-05-11T20:16:05.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don;t want runes free (I'm prepared for the flak) as someone who owns every champ and 18 rune pages (all bought with IP) I like to have stuff to buy.
