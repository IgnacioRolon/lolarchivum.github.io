For all you know the kid could just be having a bad game, and pushing him over the edge isn't going to help. If you speak at all, say neutral things like \"group 5 mid\" or \"Dragon in 30\".\n\n2. If this happens, focus towers exclusively. And by that I mean your only goal - laser focus - needs to be towers. A couple downed towers can really set the game on a different coarse, and Super Minions work better than other players 65% of the time. \n\n3. If there is an opportunity to compliment anyone at all, do it. You're goal is to inject positivity into the game. Don't go over the top, just \"Nice work, Cho\" or \"Smart positioning, Lux\"\n\nThe only other thing you can do is play to the best of your ability. But never, never give up.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-16T02:41:14.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair is someone said \"Smart positioning\" I would probably think they are trying to be a smart ass....

If you have vision and are actualy ahead then its much harder to throw. Most throwing is just people going off alone because they think they can 1vs5 now because you won the last teamfight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Desired Name","date":"2015-04-15T21:08:24.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If their team is stronger than your team, avoid teamfights and split push if you have the chance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-04-15T18:35:06.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't call out a single player if you're going to say anything.\n\nTry phrases like \"**We're** throwing guys, let's group and fight as 5\"\n\nNote use of the word \"we.\"  It includes you, even if you don't think you're part of the cause.  People are more likely to listen if you're willing to equally shoulder the blame for failure.\n\nAlso try not to make statements like this right after a player makes a mistake so that they don't feel it is directed at them.  Take a moment, let them respawn, get out of the base, and THEN mention it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2015-04-15T18:08:33.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to make calls, but don't be a douche about it. Ping objectives, ward up, and try to get your team to follow you. It's really all you can do. If they still have no interest in listening, splitpush is always an option if the champion you're playing can manage it well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dateline NBC","date":"2015-04-15T18:04:33.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a team starts to throw, I normally begin to focus more on drag/baron and more defensive play. Every dragon you pick up helps in a teamfight and baron allows for a quick push. If your champ allows, split pushing gives your team gold and forces the enemy to play more defensive, helping your team.\n\nSource- Person who has carried at least .5 games","replies":[]},{"poster":"arcinex","date":"2015-04-15T19:51:59.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem is that quinn can't carry games.
