Miss Fortune is extremely strong though I feel like her passive or W could be slightly edited just to make her not necessarily stronger but more updated for this season.\n\nIn terms of other ADCs, Ashe, Tristana, and Vayne are in a good spot.  Though Lucian, Ezreal, and Draven do far too much damage and can easily out trade anyone as an ADC for an ADC. I however have to defend Ezreal due to him having all skillshots and Draven also not being the easiest champion to play. Lucian is really counter fun to play against and can poke you far behind minion waves with a dash and just simply isn't fun to play against, same for Ezreal and Draven. It makes the lane feel like farming and dodging annoying poke.\n\nI think simply by decreasing Ezreal's Q damage, Draven's damage with his axes, and Lucian's ability to poke you so easily behind minions will balance those 3. It's just because they can do so much damage while auto attacking basically immediately after, each of those abilities doing considerable damage to squishy ADCs.\n\nI know the Ezreal, Draven, and Lucian mains will hate me for saying that and use biased information to describe how their ADC isn't broken at all though I think it's pretty accurate.\n\n{{champion:96}} : Needs better early game damage\n\n{{champion:110}} : Just needs rework for his entire kit in general ,he doesn't even feel like an archer\n\n{{champion:29}} : Needs his Q and W looked at, and maybe like 3 damage increase on his passive\n\n{{champion:133}} : She's really powerful and doesn't need a buff, but her bugs prevent her from literally being overpowered","replies":[]},{"poster":"Painted Celt","date":"2015-03-25T00:55:09.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MasterCorgi,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eFmm1GXi,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-24T20:05:34.091+0000)\n>\n> Now that jungle diversity has improved, I'd like to call our attention to the next least diverse role: ADC's.

I don't think he should be nerfed.\n{{champion:222}} I think Jinx is very close to balance but could maybe use some little nudges to weaken her laning considering how strong her teamfighting is.  A really slight nerf (increase mana cost by 10 or so at all levels?) on Zap! would probably put her in a good place.\n{{champion:429}} I feel like Riot should task a developer with continually experimenting with Kalista's kit until the community can agree that she isn't as frustrating anymore... I feel like the community isn't going to like her even if she is balanced or even underpowered number-wise...\n{{champion:15}} I think Sivir is in the same boat as Graves and will likely shift out of the meta fairly soon.  I feel like she has well defined weaknesses and does not need any nerfs.\n\n\n> {{champion:119}} \n> {{champion:67}} \n> {{champion:18}} \n> {{champion:81}} \n> {{champion:22}} \n> {{champion:236}} \n> Are fine, mostly, little tweaks here and there, but their problem is mostly a case of being outclassed by the quad.\n \nI agree that these are fine.  I expect Vayne will become top tier as health stacking tanks become more common.  Ashe could maybe use some utility buffs to make sure that she stays as *THE* utility ADC (Kalista feels like she is currently infringing on that turf).  I am a fan of Ashe support though, so I may be biased in that regard.\n\n> {{champion:96}} \n> {{champion:6}} (Fills in a Bruiser role, but his ADC needs buffing)\n> {{champion:110}} \n> {{champion:29}} (Dear god twitch, poor Twitch, a shadow of your former self.)\n> {{champion:133}} (Fills In a Bruiser role, but her ADC needs buffing)\n> {{champion:21}} (Yes, I feel she needs some buffs here and there, but less so than the others.)\n> Need buffs, some more than others.\n\nMaybe some of these could be slightly buffed.  \nI think Riot should closely watch {{champion:96}} Kog'Maw and {{champion:110}} Varus.  Those two should be doing well in a tank meta so if they don't start to rise in popularity, it should be taken as a sign that they may be undertuned.  \n{{champion:29}} Twitch just needs some nerfs reversed...  I felt like he was balanced before his last round of nerfs...\n{{champion:133}} I heard that Riot is making fixing Quinn's many bugs a priority.  Hopefully, that should help put her in a good spot.  Balancing her is tricky though since she can be a really dominant top-laner; the same goes for {{champion:6}} Urgot.  I'm not sure those two can/should be safely balanced around their performance as bot lane marksmen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enkidusmurf","date":"2015-03-25T00:42:50.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I think {{champion:104}} {{champion:15}} are in an okay spot right now.

His recent buff helps him there, but it also makes him more playable top.\n\n{{champion:133}} has the *potential* to be really strong, but she's just so buggy. If they'd clean her up a bit, she'd see a good bit of play. (And we finally see some movement on that front! THANK YOU RITO 5.6!) Maybe give Valor a passive, and she's fine.\n\n{{champion:67}} might actually be OP. Her W is kinda ridiculous. I mean, it does true damage. That's fine. You stack health, right? NO! It does %health true damage! Literally impossible to itemize against.

Kalista pays little to nothing for her mobility, which in turn hurts champions like Varus/Ashe/MF/Twitch.
