You and OP must understand why we still have unresolved stories, no? \n\nCould you not imagine the kind of backlash had resolving loose ends been attempted before those that still remain without any canon lore? Hyperthetical: had your fav region or champ still gone without any update over these last 3 years but say another had been re-visited more the once already. We would all be whining to Riot about favoritism instead.","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2017-04-16T06:05:23.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Favoritism exist on the boards now.
