Seriously i never had a problem with the new skin neither i had any bugs so why the hell you decided to disable it when there was no problem ? i don&#039;t think it was because of the skin actually the reason is the people with the fps drops were people without a decent pc that can handle the game i haven&#039;t meet a person with this &quot;game issues&quot; so why should we be struggling for 2 weeks because of people who think the skin has a bug or something? this pisses me off and we still don&#039;t have any updates about the current situation of the problem . Did you found the problem , Have you tough about a resolution , Is there any problem at all to start with . Don&#039;t put this as an insult to your team i just want answers about the item i bought with money i could&#039;ve used till you actually release it .\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry if you think of this as an not respectful or ungrateful post to your team keep going and do what you have to but give us the current status of the work since we deserve it or almost i think we deserve to know what happened to the skin we couldn&#039;t sleep till it releases !!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-22T16:30:49.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's back on!
