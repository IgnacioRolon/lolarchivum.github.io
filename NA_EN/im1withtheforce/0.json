Because Netflix's servers aren't located in the exact same geolocation as ours, it's still very likely that there's an issue along the way between your PC and our servers. As your first step, I recommend power cycling your network (unplug, leave it for 60 sec, then plug it back in). If that causes no change, then I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all local network settings are compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Im1WithTheForce","date":"2016-11-22T05:02:36.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!!
