I don't want to pick the wrong lane and completely screw up a match because of it.\n\nAny help would be nice.\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-26T22:29:21.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tech Solo made a great rundown that should be a helpful read, but we also recently changed how the champion filters at the top of champion select work to make this a little easier to figure out as well!

There are very few champions that can -only- be played in one specific lane, but you will understand that as you play the game more.\n\nThe general rule is like this:\n\n**Tanky or Melee Bruiser Type**: Top Lane\n**AP Mages or AD Assassins**: Mid Lane\n**Utility/AP/AD/Melee or Mages**: Jungle\n**AD Range**: Bot Lane\n**Support**: Bot Lane\n\n**Support**\n\nSupport characters exist to assist in Bot Lane, but there are some support characters that can be played in solo lanes (usually as AP Mage Mid Lane or AD/Tank Top Lane.) Support characters usually have healing or shielding abilities (but, not always) and they usually bring some sort of utility in the form of a stun, silence or grab.\n\nTypical Support Champions: Alistar, Braum, Sona, Janna, Soraka, Thresh, Blitzcrank, Tahm Kench, Nami, etc.\nTypical Support Champions that are Played in Solo Lanes: Morgana, Karma, Zyra, Lulu, etc.\n\n**AD Ranged/Carries** \n\nAD Ranged characters are proto-typical ranged AD characters. They are not relied upon for melee damage or tanking. They are called \"AD Carry\" because they should be outputting the most amount of damage of anyone on your team, therefore, carrying your team (to victory.) Sort of a glass-cannon situation, like any other fantasy game. They build purely damage items and their job is to kill. However, as mentioned, they are usually frail and should not be tanking or absorbing high amounts of damage. Most have movement utilities built into their kits. If they don't, it's because they trade that movement for something interesting that another AD Carry doesn't bring to the table. E.g. Jinx has no movement utility, but she has a rocket launcher/mini-gun on her Q and an ultimate that shoots a rocket that can reach anywhere on the map. \n\nTypical AD Carries: Ashe, Jinx, Jhin, Kog'maw, Lucian, Caitlyn, etc.\nTypical AD Carries Played in Other Lanes: Ezreal (Jungle), Vayne (Top), Graves (Jungle), Corki (Mid), etc.\n\n**Jungle**\n\nJungle is a very unique position, because it seems to be constantly evolving every season. There is no \"one\" determining factor that qualifies a champion as a \"jungler,\" but mostly, they share the same qualities: priority placed on utility (movement/stuns/ability to surprise) and the ability to escape or fight 1v1. If a jungler does not travel at a high rate of movement, they probably have a devastating stun (Amumu.) Conversely, they might be well equipped to sustain themselves in the jungle and get around very quickly (Nidalee, Lee Sin, etc.) Even the most frail types of champions (Twitch, Fiddlesticks, etc.) have the capability of being incredible junglers due to their high damage and the element of surprise that they bring to a lane. \n\nTypical Jungle Champions: Lee Sin, Warwick, Udyr, Sejuani, Nocturne, Jarvan, Syvana, Master Yi, etc.\nTypical Jungle Champions Played in Other Lanes: Cho'gath, Xin Zhao, Trundle, Twitch, Quinn, Jax, etc.\n\n**AP Mages or AP/AD Assassins**\n\nAP Mages are the real glass cannons. They have a very high level of damage output (like AD Carries) in the form of AP. These are prototypical \"mages,\" sometimes very literally, as is the case with champions like Lux or Brand. Assassins play a lot like their name--quick, cunning and devastating if not thwarted fast enough. Not all Assassins are AD (See: Fizz, Leblanc), but most are. Assassins have excellent movement utility built into their kit that allow them to quickly dash and dodge to and from enemy champions. Like AP Mages, their role is to kill you as fast as possible. Stuns, snares, silences, walls and high damage spells are common in mages and assassins. A 1v1 in Mid Lane can take any shape: ranged vs. ranged AP mages, melee vs. melee AD assassins, or any combination therein. Mid lane mages and assassins exist to disorient, confuse and kill you in a 1v1.\n\nTypical AP Mage Champions: Kassadin, Annie, Veigar, Lissandra, Brand, Orianna, Ahri, etc.\nTypical Assassins: Zed, Talon, Akali, Fizz, Leblanc, Katarina, etc.\nTypical AP Mage Champions Played in Other Lanes: Lux (Support), Galio (Top), Fiddlesticks (Jungle), Diana (Jungle), etc.\n\n**Tanky or Melee Bruiser Types**\n\nThe ToplLane is generally reserved for champions that can sustain themselves without a lot of interdiction. They exist as a persistent and imposing threat to all of the towers in the lane. They also want to be on-hand to provide assistance to their team when major team fights break out or major objectives need to be taken. To do this, they utilize global abilities (ultimates that allow you to appear across the map) and the teleport spell. They are usually tanks or have very high sustain. They can be AP/AD/Melee or Ranged, as long as they're generally a brawler with some form of utility by way of global cooldowns or stuns. Top laners do not concentrate on outputting the highest amount of damage for the team.\n\nTypical Tanky/Melee Bruiser Champions: Singed, Riven, Shen, Renekton, Nasus, Gnar, Darius, Irelia, etc.\nTypical Tanky/Melee Bruiser Champions Played in Other Lanes: Rengar (Jungle), Pantheon (Jungle), Kennen (Mid), Ryze (Mid), etc. \n\n**All-Around Champions**\n\nThe following are some champions that can be played across multiple different lanes in different roles. \n\nChampions Played Across Top, Jungle or Support: Nidalee (Jungle, Support, Mid), Maokai (Jungle, Top, Support), Malphite (Top, Jungle, Support), Ornn (Top, Jungle, Support), etc.\n\n\n\nSo, I hope this was helpful. If you find yourself in a position where you want to play a specific champ, but you're not sure where they'd fit, go ahead and message me in-game and I'd be happy to point you in the right direction.\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicTrees1","date":"2017-11-26T22:27:16.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, this definitely helps.
