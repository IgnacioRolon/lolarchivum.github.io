If you're better at just trying to kill the enemy go Rumble, if you're better at team playing and staying in the middle of the fight longer to help your team win fights pick Mao","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-01-04T04:04:29.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are looking for a top-lane tank, your best options are probably Nautilus, Maokai and Poppy. \n\nPersonally, I would recommend Nautilus due to his ability to engage fights and lock down targets.","replies":[]}]}
