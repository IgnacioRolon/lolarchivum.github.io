I play adc/supp/jungle so I have limited experience with this.\r\n\r\nIt depends on what you&#039;re playing, but lately I&#039;ve been getting the impression that there are many pics with almost as frustrating mechanics but more, and more effective ways to beat you that will result in more tilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:74}} has almost as much poke and zone-ing to tilt you as Teemo does but can also punish any mistakes with a stun and has far more burst. I&#039;ve seen ppl say they&#039;re gonna &#039;kms&#039; cuz they have to lane vs him.\r\n\r\n{{champion:420}} {{champion:122}}  There may be counterplay but they are hyper lane bullies by design. In an match up of players of equal skill (the enemy is as skilled at using their abilities as you are at counterplaying them) then you will likely lose by design. Not op but many ppl hate facing them.\r\n\r\n{{champion:126}} Ranged harass for ages, can burst you for half your health, and is overloaded. Makes Hashinshin afk lol.\r\n\r\n{{champion:80}} So much raw damage and lack of counterplay that in most matchups you just gotta not feed him and farm it out to outscale.\r\n\r\n{{champion:68}} Can shove you under tower and harass you endlessly with no mana costs. His Q can probably do a 1/3 of your health if you&#039;re not careful, and he can use it all the time. Then his E and R can slow you so much that you just have to watch yourself get roasted like bbq meat. \r\n\r\n{{champion:23}} People love how much counterplay there is to his ult. Plus if he gets any gold whatsoever his damage is nuts.\r\n\r\n{{champion:8}} Harass for ages and regen that makes you lose if you trade back; plus his Q can&#039;t be dodged. His weak early few lvls can&#039;t be punished much by melee champions. He has a {{item:3157}} for a basic ability, ult heals him tons so you can&#039;t win all ins. I could be wrong but based on what I&#039;ve seen you can&#039;t beat him in lane unless your champion is good vs him. He&#039;s not the best at killing you if you play passive, which balances him, but people often find being forced to play passive tilting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese champs may not be OP per se, but I always see youtubers or ppl in my games tilting vs them.\r\nCan anyone who plays top and has to deal with these let me know what they think?","replies":[{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2018-04-14T17:19:12.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot Lethality Wukong and J4, Quinn, Vayne and Lucien wannabe ADC toplaners and the no mana source dudes like constantly spamming Riven and Mundo. yw","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-04-14T17:38:31.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember when mundo actually had to watch his health bar while spamming abilities early so he wouldn't kill himself.

Now, it doesn't even seem like abilities cost him any health when he does this. Does that make sense and make it a bit more clear what I'm trying to say? Cuz I agree with you that currently hp costs are next-to-nothing... at all phases of the game. They SHOULD only be that way after you get item(s).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2018-04-14T19:37:15.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really fun to tilt people is playing fiddle top.  People don't know how to handle it becuase it is so rare, and he outpokes almost anybody.  Best part is he destroys Teemo in top lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JJI744","date":"2018-04-14T17:49:21.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimer is closer to boring than frustrating. At least the Q max type. A matter of not being able to engage onto him near any turrets, but his poke damage being low enough you can usually sustain. Kinda an uninteractive lane-phase.\n\nDarius, oddly, is fine. Illioi has a bit of an issue where you can be well ahead of her, and still die real fast if you get hit by E>R.  Also, her waveclear may be just a tad too effective when you can't clear her passive. Which kinda leads to an annoying cycle where you don't get a chance to kill her passive tentacles because she clears the wave so fast while her passive is around.\n\nJayce: Really oppressive when he's strong. Like exceedingly frustrating when hes strong. Actually a little less annoying since caster minions had their value reduced. Shockblasting from afar became less effective of a farming ability.\n\nPanth: Yep. Still annoying as all hell. Still a matter of playing passive to outscale and praying your teammates know to back off and not get caught by ults. Also a toplaner that can often take ignite without worry, further encouraging you to play passively.\n\nRumble: Eh, haven't seen any since the latest buffs. Was never too bad previous.\n\nTyrnd: fuck that sustain, seriously. Still got bullshit crit-chance too. Main frustration is that there is very little room to outplay. He rightclicks you, either he does enough damage to kill you, or he doesn't. And thats about it, you run away and try to stall out the ult.\n\nVlad: yep. Yep yep. \n\nTeemo still holds supreme IMO. He has the rare mixture of high  consistant point-click magic damage and multiple abilities that punish you for trying to engage. (blind, shrooms) And imma be blunt: randomly walking over a shroom and getting slowed for ages is infuriating.\n\nThere are a few others, most ADCs toplane can be annoying, but tend to fall flat a lot of the time. (Possible exception of Quinn lately)","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonDawn77","date":"2018-04-14T19:10:25.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is {{champion:68}} really not that tilting?\nEveryone here says he's not but I've seen many tops tilt hard vs him in youtube and my games; some died early a few times and then got little cs, and lots went 0/6 or worse. Maybe he's just not tilting unless he's really strong and he hasn't been strong in ages? Maybe there just aren't many good Rumbles around?\n\nIn theory he should be exceptionally tilting to face provided the Rumble manages his heat and cooldowns. He outranges you and can harass you almost constantly with his q and e, as he has no mana and two low cooldown ranged abilities. He has two large slows on his e. If you get slowed or minion blocked his Q will do TONS of damage to you. His shield can make him outtrade you often. It also speeds him up which in combination with his e should make him impossible to catch. He can shove you in and harass you under tower endlessly. Then he can kite or engage on you with his ult which slows you and forces you to sit there watching yourself get fried. If you somehow manage to get on top of him in a favorable situation he's an off-tank/bruiser so he may just walk away and live. Plus he's ap so he can build  {{item:3157}} {{item:3116}}  to survive. \n\nHe may be vulnerable to ganks and leaves himself vulnerable if he misspositions while on cooldown but these are things that a good Rumble should be able to manage in most games. He also scales well and is good in teamfights unlike most other annoying ranged picks. It seems like his main weakness is his lack of mobility and only moderate tankyness in a long lane, but often junglers won't/will be forced not to camp top.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-04-14T17:16:51.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:67}} {{champion:133}} \nthese 2 are the worst top laners to play against","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonDawn77","date":"2018-04-14T17:24:02.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What goes through your mind when you see the enemy top laner lock them in?","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-04-14T18:02:48.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrimsonDawn77,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aHtZEPxg,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-04-14T17:24:02.468+0000)\n>\n> What goes through your mind when you see the enemy top laner lock them in?\n\nIf I havent picked yet I will just go someone like {{champion:54}}, but I main Morde so if I picked him already I know I will lose lane unless jg camps top which almost never happens when you pick Morde.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonDawn77","date":"2018-04-14T18:49:44.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

You get some durability/resistances, you look to take down his towers w/o taking too much harass, and you avoid being stunned by him. You whittle down his mana pool, and chunk him when you can. Then, you go for the all-in and just kill him. Much like teemo. He's honestly not that bad to play against, and after laning is over, he offers less in fights and splitpush than other champs unless he's super fed.\n\nIllaoi is probably one of the most tilting because she can have half a sterak's gage and output the same damage via her ult that other champs can only hope to achieve via cleaver and then some. She can smash you off one mistake while being a full level and half an item behind. And her e will take about 70% of your hp bar while zoning you off minions as you deal with being made a vessel. Her tentacle hitbox is absurd. Like - before morg q hitbox got nerfed, THAT would look puny compared with illaoi tentacle hitbox. And sure - dealing with one isn't a problem, but when you have 3 or so in an area smashing via q and then immediately smashing again via her w while simultaneously trying to make sure she can't land an e on you... it gets stupid. She needs to be reworked to be less reliant on e and ult, be less oppressive with those two spells, but also more reliable/useful in teamfights and lane w/o those two things being broken.\n\nJayce is only really oppressive if he goes bork. If not, you can again look to outlast his mana bar and then abuse him.\n\nPantheon - just look to run him out of mana and be willing to give up a bit of cs early to soak xp w/o dying. Then as long as other lanes respect his ult and the fact that you probably can't follow him early game, you will outscale and be more useful in both 1v1 and teamfights.\n\nRumble - not a problem. Very reasonable champ by and large.\n\nTrynd - can be oppressive if snowballs. Is a ticking time bomb which makes teams need to have pressure and force him to be accountable mid/late. If you can't pressure more/faster/harder 5v4 or 4v4, he will split  you to death. The same can be said for... jax, fiora, nasus. So while he can be a pain, he's not unbeatable nor is he alone in his splitpush 1v2 potential.\n\nVlad - he's like a better scaling version of heimer or teemo with more to offer in teamfights. The thing is that he's probably a bit too safe. His cd on pool should be longer and/or the cd on his q considering the damage and healing he gets on a RANGED point-n-click. He does a ton of damage while building tanky too - more than a lot (though not all) of other champions. Overall, he's on the stronger side, but I wouldn't say he's completely broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2018-04-14T17:15:36.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play vs new Irelia and tell me if you'd like to play vs 10 Teemos or 1 Irelia with a slight lead lol","replies":[]}]}
