Tons of damage. And more fun skillshots. She also feels very smooth to play with her abilities that can be cast while moving.\r\nShould I pick up Viktor for fun at some point? or will he feel like a less fun, and possibly less powerful, Syndra?","replies":[{"poster":"Ast√¥lfo","date":"2016-11-19T22:55:29.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor is fairly strong, and I'd say just as strong as Syndra, it's just Syndra's currently more \"popular\" due to more recent LCS play.\nViktor's better at waveclear and AoE control/damage while Syndra nukes just about any one single target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SGT Dingle Berry","date":"2016-11-20T00:14:54.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a Viktor fan, only second to Ziggs as he's always been my baby. Viktor does require more mechanics both in E placement and his ult but both skills have amazing damage output and wave clear potential.
