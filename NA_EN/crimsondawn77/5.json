Ranged laners have a fundamental advantage against melee laners.   Kennen, a utility teamfighter, must be useful later.  He needs weaknesses.\n\nFor example, his splitpushing could be nerfed by reducing the scaling of his lightning ball form’s movement speed and damage reduction.  Kennen could still splitpush during the late game, but only with cleaner execution.  Scaling splitpushers like Jax, Fiora, or Tryndamere could therefore counterpick him.\n\nKennen’s counterplay to these counterpicks would be to use his range advantage to gain enough of an early lead to splitpush against them regardless, or to use his waveclear to find opportunities to join fights.  If he failed the counterplay, the scaling splitpusher would eventually just run him over. \n\nConsequently, Kennen would no longer be a safe blind pick, reducing his pick-rate and the frustration it brings to players drafting champions he can bully.  It would also open their ban slots somewhat to let them ban a bad or frustrating matchup, further relieving them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-06T00:39:52.235+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"this PoS with glacial: {{champion:518}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2019-06-05T17:58:07.585+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Nasus:\n\nLissandra used to be my least favorite ranged to fight, but I haven't gone against her in top since she lost her innate.

But he still will obliterate you at any chance so it's not fun. His melee E seems unfair to me still.\nGnar does what kennen does essentially but has an actual drawback with his E cd early (22 seconds, compared to Kennen's 10 second cooldown). Still pure evil whenever he is strong.\n\n{{champion:67}} {{champion:236}} Vayne and Lucian are honorable mentions.

Of the three Kennen is the worst because of his massive self-peel so he's harder to punish when he tries to poke you. \nHowever, skill expression on those champs is pretty limited so once you figure out how to endure vs them in lane you can do it pretty consistently. For me the tilt comes from weird picks or things that a skill player can abuse to be an absolute monstrosity. \n\n{{champion:41}} 95% of the time Gangplank is not tilting at all to face. I'd never say he's an OP toplaner. But sometimes you get unlucky and face one who is actually a god at the champion. Effectively unavoidable barrels, can't interact with him in lane, and a kit that is designed to net him a bunch of extra gold from smacking you, ulting your dying allies on the other side of the map, and killing your minions. He just gets a big sack of gold and beats your teeth in with it. If the GP player is good, it is very difficult to stop them from become extremely useful by 25 minutes. \n\n{{champion:126}} The definition of faceroll. You pretty much can only interact with this guy on his terms, and his terms are that you die unless you're strong enough to just statcheck him. If you can survive lane he's pretty fine but if he gets ahead in lane you don't get to play at all. \n\n {{champion:68}} Haven't faced an actually good Rumble in ages but he also denies you the ability to do much. High uptime damage combined with massive teamfight presence means you have to overcome the hurdle of laning vs him in order to stop him from just crushing your team with Equalizer every fight. The tilt comes from the fact that you need to put a stop to him because he'll take his lead and roll over your whole team, but his kit makes it very very difficult to interact with him. \n\n {{champion:112}} Poke with a free shield and movement speed bonus and he scales really well. Like Jayce you pretty much need to get a lead and just keep jumping on him and statchecking him or he will poke you out of the game.
