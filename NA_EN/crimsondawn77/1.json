Are you actually one tricking to masters?\nWill doing this be kind of niche and feast or famine like playing other champs out of their lane? (such as Garen adc, Jhin mid, Morg top) \nI like Taliyah and really want a top mage but I'm wondering if it's worth putting the time into getting very good with Taliyah mechanics and her in this role to the point where she could be my secondary pick for top.","replies":[{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-01-04T23:46:43.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taliyah is not the strongest mage to be played tanky though.

Put enough effort into any champ and it will pay off. Yes, Taliyah can be constistently good.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonDawn77","date":"2017-01-05T02:32:24.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.

She would need to rush rylais to be able to kite. She will die whenever someone gets close to her.\nMidlane are squishies, she is very good early game, deals lot of damage in early, which is why midlane is the best lane for her.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-04T20:49:29.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this ever a thing?","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonDawn77","date":"2017-01-04T21:04:47.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently ya, it was.
