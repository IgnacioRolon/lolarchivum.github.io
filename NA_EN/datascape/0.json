So i submitted a ticket with all the logs it told me to add, waited for about 4 days then it finally said it was \"Solved\" so i went on and im still getting bug splated. Sent in another ticket, comes back as \"Solved\" still doesn't work. So Riot Support like wtf? you made me wait for 4 days to see you have done nothing to help me. For those wondering i installed a new CPU and got a new HD monitor. if any of you have suggestions it would be much appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-01T23:20:58.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you had a few tickets open that were answered by Blitzbot, which is automated.
