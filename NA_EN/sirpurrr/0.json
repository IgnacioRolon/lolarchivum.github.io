He has an over 60% win rate early and unlike J4, Rek'Sai, Pantheon, Olaf etc., his win rate is still fantastic even late game. He's hovering 54% past 40 minutes and his mid game win rate is good too. There is no part of his power curve where he's actually doing poorly (unlike say Amumu who starts with a terrible early win rate). This is even more impressive considering how varied his builds and runes are.  He's performing this well despite a lot of people picking suboptimal stuff at a fairly high frequency. This champion is actually amazing and I'd argue overtuned in a SQ environment (perhaps underestimated in competitive). He has had the highest or near highest win rate almost every patch this season.\n\nIn fact, he is more oppressive vs weaker early game junglers than anything else I've faced and doesn't even really get outscaled. Yes, his teamfighting may be bad but he can create a lot of disruption, split, take objectives solo and is a menace in skirmishing. I don't know why he's still \"sleeper\" or why no one talks about him. \n\nHis ganks may not be the most powerful but there's always going to be someone overextended in SQ and he can chase them down for a basically guaranteed kill. Even if the lanes play super safe, that means their jungler has no priority and can't safely invade or farm his own camps. They will be isolated vs Udyr because lanes can't roam to help when their wave is almost at turret. Many junglers can't even run if Udyr  sees them and apart from maybe a level 2 Pantheon, I'm not sure if anyone can actually duel him.\n\nFor people saying that he's bad in high ELO, the current rank 7 (PantsAreDragon) has more Udyr games than any other champion and with an insane 68% win rate. Udyr is not fine and needs slight early game nerfs if he's going to still be pretty solid late game. Even something like -3 AD may do something.\n\nBTW: I realize that Vi is statistically doing just as well and has virtually no losing matchups. She even has twice the play rate. The reason I'm so annoyed by Udyr is due to his insane level 2. He can shut me out of the game on weaker picks. Vi at least needs level 3 to be relevant and a lot of her win rate is due to the utiltiy from her R, Q and even the shred on W. She's not usually walking into your jungle early and forcing you out and she'd be taking a serious risk doing it. Udyr is so fast that he doesn't even get punished for it. I think Udyr is much stronger than Vi in the hands of an expert jungler who knows how to abuse him.","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2019-04-29T06:12:34.027+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"tl;dr, but here's my take on Udyr.\nUdyr is currently only strong because counter jungleing is incredibly powerful at the moment, and no one can duel Udyr.\nHe can just walk into enemy jungle at level 2 and beats any other jungler, therefor getting both scuttle crabs early game and potentially a kill+the enemy's 2nd buff.\nThe only reason why he isn't op is because he cannot gank botlane.\nIt's literally impossible, if he gets hit with a single cc he can't gank it, and bot is the most important lane in the game.\nUdyr will win most games where his bot goes even, and almost all games where his bot wins, however he will never win if his bot loses.\nAny jungler with half a brain will just camp botlane and stay away from Udyr with wards, however most people don't understand this.\nThis is why I never ban Udyr and I never had trouble with him.\nMy current strategy is to hover Hecarim (my main) and leave Udyr open, Hecarim is OP but Udyr hard counters him if the Heca player is just a dumb fotm player.","replies":[{"poster":"Lo4ding","date":"2019-04-29T06:58:40.892+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some champions that can kill udyr even in early game. {{champion:56}} {{champion:80}} comes to my mind.

Counterjungling is a fantastic way below plat to grab the game by the balls and solo carry because you not only put yourself ahead but tilt the likely mentally unstable enemy jungler and set them behind. I'd say that around plat though, it becomes very hard to counter jungle nowadays without getting collapsed on by 3, even with lane priority. I don't know what it is, but I think the scuttle changes showed everyone how important early skirmishes can decide games so everyone hyper rotates nowadays, even if it means losing waves. On the other hand, perma ganking is completely out of control. Camps don't give enough xp or gold to justify just power farming so the goal for 90% of junglers right now is get level 2/3 and get into as many lanes as possible before 10 minutes, even if it means sacrificing camps. Levels as a jungler mean near nothing anymore because junglers have lost so much ability to solocarry games so the idea is that you play a second support that effects the entire map.

However, camping bot isn't always possible and sometimes they lose even before that. If they overextend and Udyr shows up at the right time, they still die. He can just flash CC and stun to kill fast. He can even wait till his bot trades and CC is blown before going in (perhaps lane ganking).  Good luck camping for your Ezreal - Janna vs a safe and smart bot lane. Meanwhile, Udyr takes Rift, cycles your jungle, probably kills your top and mid... gg.  This isn't a reliable strategy. It works some games and fails in many others. It's a matchup and game dependent strategy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son0fNone","date":"2019-04-29T23:50:38.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Myrmiron,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EEiJjTI1,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-04-29T06:12:34.027+0000)\n>\n> tl;dr, but here's my take on Udyr.\n> Udyr is currently only strong because counter jungleing is incredibly powerful at the moment, and no one can duel Udyr.\n> He can just walk into enemy jungle at level 2 and beats any other jungler, therefor getting both scuttle crabs early game and potentially a kill+the enemy's 2nd buff.\n> The only reason why he isn't op is because he cannot gank botlane.\n> It's literally impossible, if he gets hit with a single cc he can't gank it, and bot is the most important lane in the game.\n> Udyr will win most games where his bot goes even, and almost all games where his bot wins, however he will never win if his bot loses.\n> Any jungler with half a brain will just camp botlane and stay away from Udyr with wards, however most people don't understand this.\n> This is why I never ban Udyr and I never had trouble with him.\n> My current strategy is to hover Hecarim (my main) and leave Udyr open, Hecarim is OP but Udyr hard counters him if the Heca player is just a dumb fotm player.\n\nThe counter jungling is exactly why I started playing Ivern.

So I don't think he is a sleeper in the competitive scene maybe just not as useful as your sej, skarner, j4, reksai etc..\n\nThat's not really true. Udyr's play style is extremely different from the normal junglers they play (especially in macro). It's not just about his kit. I think he requires quite a bit of specific game knowledge to play well. Moreover, they'd almost never have had practice on him and are probably not even testing him just due to bias as well as the fact that he's not that popular even in SQ. Pro teams have certainly been slow to adapt to strong picks occasionally. \n\nPro teams can have weaknesses in itemization, theorycrafting and drafting. This was even more obvious when we had the old rune system and some combinations were just clearly suboptimal mathematically. It wouldn't be a surprise to me if they glossed over Udyr or simply consider the massive strategic and comp adaptions required as being too difficult for what is probably not objectively stronger than their current picks.\n\nAnyway, perhaps the delaying of the Scuttler spawn will make Udyr less annoying. The jungle meta is REALLY ideal for him and event he jungle XP nerfs indirectly help him because of how strong his early is relative to other junglers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2019-04-29T15:14:13.454+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let’s remember though that winrate is not the only metric to which we should be attempting to explain a champions power. \n\nI agree with your general sentiment, Udyr is absolutely not weak currently. Statistics show him as performing well all season. But we have to be careful because a champions winrate is not only a result of that champions power directly. There are several things to which contribute to this:\n\nMeta - what are the popular junglers, what items are good and bad and what is in demand right now. We are in a meta where skirmishing junglers seem to be the norm, and Udyr fits that bill to a tee. Practically any jungle item is good on Udyr, and his build path is incredibly flexible. More on this in a second. What are the common picks in the jungle and throughout the game? Well, this is a little unstable but generally Udyr performs well against most junglers and always has so this isn’t really new. More on this in a second as well. \n\nGame mechanics - jungle XP is atrocious right now. It should be no wonder that a fast clearing counter jungler would be performing well. This makes his capacity to solo objectives even more desirable because if he’s not ganking or clearing, he’s taking objectivess. This is also doubled by the fact that he can practically build anything, so it makes him pretty stable throughout the game regardless of how he’s performing as a jungler. \n\nPast statistical analysis and onto observation and intuition:\n\nAs much as we’d like to think observation and intuition don’t play a role in balancing, they do. And they should. Stats do not explain every aspect of performance because individual performance in this game varies so heavily that unless you’re controlling for these things hardcore (which you can’t), you can rarely explain it all with stats. This is where professional experience matters. And you can question riots experience as players balancing the game, that’s fine, but I simply want to point out that it does matter.\n\nSo let’s ask the question of observation based on one fact: \n\nWe know Udyr almost always performs well against every jungler. I mean really, who can deal with him early? He is the classic counter jungler and that has always been his niche. In exchange, he’s a weak team fighter and focuses more on objectives, small skirmishes, and split pushing. \n\nThe observable question: \n\nIs he doing things he’s not normally supposed to be doing?\n\nHonestly, no. He’s doing exactly what he’s always done. When I watch jungler streams, especially Trick (when he’s actually playing on his high elo account); when I play games even in mid plat range; I don’t see Udyr doing anything he’s not supposed to do. He’s not teamfighting well. He’s not snowballing disproportionately, meaning he needs to gank and help his team get ahead because he can’t rely on clearing, counterjungling and objectives alone to solidify his scaling. In other words, he’s currently working as intended. \n\nCould it be that he’s doing his job too well currently? Stats say that may be true but are those things explained better by other elements of the game or is it a result of his power directly? Well, it’s likely both but I’d say the meta, game physics and items in particular (this is a big one) explain his presence much more than anything. I don’t think this warrants a nerf...yet. I think at the very least, he should have significant scrutiny placed upon him. And then once riot gets a better taste for him, they can make a decision. But I wouldn’t rush to nerfs, that mindset is how entire classes of champions get power creeped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TsundereNatsumi","date":"2019-04-29T10:50:58.552+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Udyr is early cheese, but do you know who trashes udyr while outperforming him early?{{champion:421}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:64}}  {{champion:60}} Even fucking {{champion:80}} Trashes him, the only thing that leads him to win if the laners die to his early ganks (which happen pretty often) but why would you want udyr when you have his upgrade {{champion:59}}","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2019-04-29T10:55:21.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TsundereNatsumi,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EEiJjTI1,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2019-04-29T10:50:58.552+0000)\n>\n> Udyr is early cheese, but do you know who trashes udyr while outperforming him early?{{champion:421}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:64}}  {{champion:60}} Even fucking {{champion:80}} Trashes him, the only thing that leads him to win if the laners die to his early ganks (which happen pretty often) but why would you want udyr when you have his upgrade {{champion:59}}\n\nNah, J4 loses too hard to Udyr in a 1v1, I'd say Udyr's high winrate is also due thanks to J4's popularity.\nThe others except Rek'sai I half agree, if Udyr gets the jump on them they die, if they're not braindead they outpace Udyr and make him useless.\nUdyr's biggest strength is idiots trying to 1v1 him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirPurrr","date":"2019-04-29T21:48:59.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TsundereNatsumi,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EEiJjTI1,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2019-04-29T10:50:58.552+0000)\n>\n> Udyr is early cheese, but do you know who trashes udyr while outperforming him early?{{champion:421}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:64}}  {{champion:60}} Even fucking {{champion:80}} Trashes him, the only thing that leads him to win if the laners die to his early ganks (which happen pretty often) but why would you want udyr when you have his upgrade {{champion:59}}\n\nI haven't tried the others you list but I play quite a bit of Kindred and never found the matchup easy.

I think my biggest frustration with Udyr is that he can make me irrelevant early. Yi for example has a similar win rate and again almost no matchups with terrible win rates but I feel like I have a chance to get some levels, farm and make an impact. With Udyr, I often feel like I'm at the mercy of my team.\n\nSince one of your recommendations is drafting a teamfight team, how's Amumu as a pick into him? I tried it once this patch and got stomped because I have no escape whenever he finds me and he just sits in my jungle with wards all game. I think he literally went Blue->Red->my jungle. I started bot side with a leash because I thought he would start Red since that's the common buff for jungers. I basically never got out of early game and it didn't help that my lanes weren't strong either so couldn't help me (probably wouldn't catch him anyway). \n\nWhat do you personally find hardest to win vs?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1800NICECLIENT","date":"2019-04-29T19:25:55.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Udyr is a lot like Asol where he has a low play rate, but the mains are very good with him.
