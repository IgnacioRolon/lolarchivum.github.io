You just have to find which process is using bugsplat and then kill it. You can do that with your task manager or with process explorer. I suggest using process explorer because its easier to locate which process is using what dll.\n\n**Steps:**\n1) Download Process Explorer: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx\n2) Install Process Explorer and Launch it\n3) Go to **Find --> Find Handle or DLL** (or you can press Ctrl + F)\n4) Enter: **bugsplat.dll** and click on **Search**.\n5) You should see a list of applications that have bugsplat.dll open. You can then go back to the process list and kill whichever process is using bugsplat.\n6) Launch patcher and patch up :)\n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orannis","date":"2014-10-03T07:53:51.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same issue i get to about 30% and it just fails please help us","replies":[]},{"poster":"LuderSpilMAN","date":"2014-10-03T07:43:02.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got this bug now.
