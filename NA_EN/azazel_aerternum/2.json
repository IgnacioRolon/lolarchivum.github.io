At this rate I'll have to play another 10-15 games just to get one more fragment, if at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T20:36:14.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might just be bad luck, but it does sound like you might have gotten more keys typically by now. Have you refreshed your client at all? Those key fragments can now pop up anytime while on the client or after logging in, so give that a try really quick!","replies":[{"poster":"Azazel Aerternum","date":"2017-10-03T05:23:53.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like someone debugged the system for me or something, I just got 4 fragments upon logging in.

As I mentioned in the first reply, that is just how key fragments work now. You won't always get them right after a match ends so it's always a good idea to close the client every once and awhile. A simple refresh could make those fragments appear.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
