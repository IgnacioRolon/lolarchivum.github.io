They wouldn't run back the old program because it already failed. Why would they bring back something that doesn't work? I mean unless you have some sort of suggestion to help reform people a topic like this really isn't eloping mainly because you are basically asking for more chances. You had them and still failed to reform, so why would another one help you if they didn't work the other times?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"duckarp","date":"2017-02-24T11:41:17.155+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean \"second\"?
