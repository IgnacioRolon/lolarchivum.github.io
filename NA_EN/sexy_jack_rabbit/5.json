Thanks gang! Twas my pleasure! I owe the thanks to you tbh, as I was unaware that Taliyah's W efforts were missing, so that visibility helped immensely.\n\nYou see, much like finding one gummy worm at the bottom of a box of sour patch kids, every champion in Runeterra is a rare and beautiful snowflake, and we audio folk want to do our part to make sure they are sounding their absolute best. If you happen to notice anything else amiss in game that you feel might be a little off, please don't hesistate to hit me up directly on the ol' Twitter and I gotchu, fam!\n\nSeriously though this is a super nice message.

You are absolutely correct. I had no idea, and we didn't have that issue bugged, but I found a broken hook for those exact lines. Fear not, bud, they are 100% fixed and back in action. Once 7.13 goes live, LB will once again be BMing with the best of us. Good ears! LB mains across the globe will sing thy praises. <3","replies":[{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2017-06-17T21:12:56.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg now I can finally double-gank botlane with my clone and tilt the enemy botlane through BMing quotes and mastery emote. \n\nThat's beautiful. ;_; Thank you!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-06-16T20:01:53.504+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zimber! Not too long ago, Riot Ranger helped me restore some old sound effects of Quinn's that had been lost after her champion update. One of them still remains lost though, and that is Phoenix Quinn's unique Skystrike sound effect, which also mysteriously disappeared with the rework. Is there any way we could get that sound back? \n\nFor reference, here is a video that compares what the current Phoenix Quinn's Skystrike sounds like (it is using the default sound ATM), with the original sound that was unique to the skin only.
