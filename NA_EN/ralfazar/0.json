Then just double click the \"League Client\" application (above)\n\n\nI have also been experiencing a lot of delays in the client though. Like I try to make a Ranked Solo/Duo lobby, it takes like 10-15 seconds to make it and half the time it just says \"something unexpected happened while trying to create your lobby\"","replies":[]}]}
