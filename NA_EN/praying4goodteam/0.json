For instance, say you're running away from an enemy jungler. You have to run to the other side of the blast cone first before you explode it. If the hitbox is too big, you might end up clicking on it by accident as you attempt to run around it and exploding it prematurely, sending you right into the arms of that Warwick.","replies":[{"poster":"Shrek Luigi","date":"2017-08-17T00:11:32.167+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I always hit it by accident Q_Q","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aria Storm","date":"2017-08-16T17:29:22.483+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo I think it should be removed.
