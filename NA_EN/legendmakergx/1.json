I personally had no idea that the devs would even keep Urgot in his current niche, yet the kit seems to preserve his jugger-marksman hybrid nature and make it work. The VGU process feels closer to Sion's than to Warwick's, as he definitely received some pretty drastic work (all of his abilities got changed pretty heavily), yet much of his core characteristics, including his lock-on, personal shield, crab legs, position swap, etc. still remain. I was worried after Galio's rework that VGUs would stop caring as much about a champion's previous identity, but this proved me wrong entirely.\n\nOne of the things I like the most about Urgot's new kit, besides his meaty ult, is his innate. Not only does it kick major thematic ass (S H O T G U N K N E E S), but it's one of those passives that really frames how a champion plays. Personally, I think a champion's innate is/should be the most important part of their kit, since it's available to them from the start and is therefore always on, and is the perfect opportunity to really set the foundation for a completely unique playstyle via a cool or unusual mechanic. In this case, I really feel it's going to force Urgot to play in a manner completely unique to him, and the fact that his entire basic ability set complements his innate means it's also likely going to feel organic to him (Urganic? Or, at least as organic as Urgot can get...), rather than a \"minigame\", as was the case for a few other additions to previous champion kits.","replies":[]}]}
