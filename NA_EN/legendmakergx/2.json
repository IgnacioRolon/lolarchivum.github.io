My bad I thought experimental time was done after it took 1 year for Dynamic duo to be over and secretly renamed to flex LOL.\n\nYa I understand reset but when players like me get 7-8/3-2 you usually suspect we get automatic gold which is like Solo Q and that is what happen if you even start off new in rank, you get gold with those scores so you don't usually think after placement for flex you get platinum and by 1 trash game even though you win you end up getting silver LOL.","replies":[{"poster":"Tactical Poro","date":"2016-11-16T10:25:17.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It may be a rebrand of Dynamic Queue, but that doesn't mean it's the same. It's a separate queue from solo/duo they made clear about that. I think there should be some parallel in mmr but that doesn't seem to be the case. Especially with how wonky it was shipped as. \n\nAlso assuming you'll get placed in gold from simple win/loss ratio is silly. I went 7/3 on this account and started in silver 2. There's a lot more to it that that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-16T11:08:46.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless they ban duos from solo queue, flex is bound to fail.

The problem is that Riot should consider our Solo/Duo MMR when placing us in Flex but they are not doing it.\n\nI think you need to go back and check bro, the one i played with bronze was because riot stupid match making when I already finish placement. Check the ones that were for placement, they were diamond,master,platinum players.","replies":[{"poster":"l not Faker l","date":"2016-11-16T10:50:40.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you sure you are not looking to season 6 solo/duo?
