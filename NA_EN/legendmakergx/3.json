Toxic people I don&#039;t mind should get the suspension then to perma ban but people who intentionally ruin the game for others over 1 SIMPLE ping should not have a chance.\r\n\r\nFunny part is I saw a streamer name Shaclone get suspended recently for 14 days for intentionally feeding while another streamer Therainman had all 3 of his account banned for feeding 1 time, the dude had to beg Riot to get him unban and make it a suspension so why was Shaclone case different? I really don&#039;t care about streamer but if they intentional feed like any other player then they should be permanent ban.","replies":[{"poster":"zacktootall","date":"2016-10-13T04:30:48.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but then too many good people would get perma banned cuz they got suckered in by trolls or just get straight up reported cuz of a bad game or from jackass that wanted to report them for no reason then to do so","replies":[{"poster":"LegendmakerGX","date":"2016-10-13T04:58:11.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zacktootall,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sM5Xk7jM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-13T04:30:48.364+0000)\n>\n> but then too many good people would get perma banned cuz they got suckered in by trolls or just get straight up reported cuz of a bad game or from jackass that wanted to report them for no reason then to do so\n\nthey get suckered into trolling? wait what? Then they do deserve the ban, definitely sure if the the person in feeding and your whole team/enemy report him at least 1 enemy then this would go on to be a trend and the report system should see that this guy is a red flag.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2016-10-13T05:28:50.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shenanigans.\n\nInt feeding is hard to prove.\n\nI ONCE went 0/14 on toplane yi.
