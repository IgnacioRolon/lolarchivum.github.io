It was obvious Riot did this on purpose to make people buy RP if they want to be up to date with over loaded champion kits, now basic champions rarely are a match with the new champions and all their 2nd &quot;active/effect&quot; ability.\r\n\r\nYes this is free to play but it has clearly become a pay to win situation.\r\n\r\nPeople can say that this is free to play and you can still earn BE so stop &quot;Whining&quot;.I wonder if you ever played a Nexon game like Combat Arm, they did the exact same thing where 1 game gives little to non gold while buying a guns take over 10 hours of play to even rent out a gun for 1 day. Tell you the truth Combat Arm is even faster at making gold to buy guns then league right now which is funny as F**K when it&#039;s Nexon.","replies":[{"poster":"Shreddermen57","date":"2018-05-18T20:09:41.319+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The concept of this post is flawed completely.\n\nThere is no feasible way that League can be pay-to-win in its current state.

They destroy champion that were made before 2014, they are stronger and they usually have a active or passive that comes with them.\n\nIf you are using Yi for a example then that's pure bad, Yi place 44th on top lane 27 in jungle. Only way that you usually win is if you are a one trick and yes if you are clearly vsing Bronze - gold<< Using these elo as example is bad because bronze to silver rarely know how to work together or know that all they have to do to kill yi is CC him even when he is fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2018-05-18T20:37:34.255+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know why one tricks can beat newer champions, even with weird kits or lackluster damage?\n\nIt's because they took the time to gain experience and learn to play well","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-05-18T20:39:27.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick, jax, and xin xhao kits arent mechanically intensive, and all 3 are top tier junglers atm.\n\nSoraka and janna are both practically braindead in terms of mechanics.

With that said though - you should only have 3 champions per roll that you are playing in ranked.  Even the best players in the world are only bringing 20 - 40 champions to ranked.  Yet, I see many of my bronze and silver friends who have played 60 - 80 different champions in ranked... and understand why they are bronze and silver.\n\nWhile I agree BE comes too slow - If you want to win ... learn to play 3 champions in your main role - and 3 champions in your secondary role.","replies":[]}]}
