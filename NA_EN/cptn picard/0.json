The ONLY person on the team not feeding and trolling. Top lane got 0/9/0. Mid got 0/6/0. Bot lane was lost after 10 min. \r\n\r\nNobody got shit done. I try my best and got 5/5/10 and ALL MY TEAM DID WAS FEEDING AND I GET BANNED???????????\r\n\r\nwhat the fuck is wrong with riot? the company is run by total morons, thats for sure and nothing new. But this is just ridiculous. \r\n\r\nI get a 14 days ban without any warning cause my fuckin premate troll team convinced the enemy team into reporting me. Is there nobody anymore to check the reports? do ppl just get banned by system cause pre mates troll now?\r\n\r\nwhat the fuck riot? how fuckin sad is this game? THE ONLY PLAYER THAT CARES AND TRYS TO WIN A GAME GETS BANNED????????","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-05-01T01:46:30.130+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"What was your punishment for?

It seems like it could either be as a result of a behavioral transgression, if you raged at your team a bit for their trolling, or perhaps if the enemy team blanket reported your entire team for trolling and you were somehow, however unlikely, accidentally included in the ban.  Accidental bans are extremely rare, but they do happen, and punishments for trolling/intentional feeding start with the 14 day suspension.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-01T01:58:45.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you got incredibly toxic, guessing from your attitude. So yes, you got banned.\n\n\n14 days also sounds like you have a record of being toxic and getting restrictions. Next time it will be permban, start checking **your** behavior instead of blaming, unless you want that tasty perm.\n\nGet control or get out.","replies":[{"poster":"CrimsonReaps","date":"2017-05-01T14:09:40.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or he probably used homophobic slurs and told them kys would be my assumption","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-05-01T02:32:52.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I get a team full of 0/6 players and I'm the only one doing well, I usually just internally sigh and say alright guys, can we surrender?
