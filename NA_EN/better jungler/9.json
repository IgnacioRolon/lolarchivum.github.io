You already have the skin unlocked so you can't unlock it again XP!","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-11-22T03:35:44.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not possible :P I unlocked Zoe with BE.\n\nEDit: looking at my purchase history it shows I got the bundle.. But I really didnt. haha\n\nThere may be a bug to look into here. I bought Zoe with BE, Then bought RP, then Bought Chests, which had the shard in it. \n\nI don't mind, because I was going to buy it anyways, but there is something strange here. Might be worth looking into. \n","replies":[]}]}]}
