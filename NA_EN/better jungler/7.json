All our apps go through Riot Games approval in order to get an access to their API. If the app is not compliant, the access is not granted and the app can not work/be published. \n\nIt is also a top priority for us to be and remain compliant with any game's terms of service and to ensure that every app we publish is aligned with their 3rd party policies. If one of our apps was to not be compliant anymore or if Riot Games was to change their stances, they would contact us first and would not start banning players using Overwolf. We'd also make sure to fix whatever needs to be fixed.\n\nYou can read more about it on our blog: http://www.overwolf.com/blog/overwolf_not_bannable/\n\nTLDR: Overwolf will not get you banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-11-02T19:04:14.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is awesome. Thanks for replying! I love OW so far, the post game stats screen is incredible. Shows my apm, the places I tend to hover around the map, and abilities I use most.

But please clarify. \n\nSargonas says its ok to use RIGHT NOW, but then you say its iffy. \n\nI've played 2 ARAMs with it, and have no problem uninstalling if it's going to jeopardize my account in any way. The post isnt very clear. Can I use this app without getting banned in its current form?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-01T23:49:33.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't personally say what's okay to use and what's not, since I'm not a part of the team that makes those calls. I say it's iffy because we don't control Overwolf and can't prevent it from making changes that *would* be bannable. I can say that Sargonas has specifically said that Overwolf is okay to use for the time being, as Riot investigated it's current apps and think they're okay.\n\nGenerally, the stance is \"No software should interfere directly with the in-game player experience, from when you press “Play” to the end-of-game screen\". If you're worried about its safety, I'd have to suggest just not using it. You can also refer to the [**Third Party App FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848) for the full rundown on how Riot views those programs.","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-11-02T03:17:17.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok. thank you for the input. I like the after-game summary it gives. So with the post-Sargonas made screenshotted, I am going to continue using it. When it updates, I will not use it until I get the ok from riot again.\n\nThank you for the input.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
