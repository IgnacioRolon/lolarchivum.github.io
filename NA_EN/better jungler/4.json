Unfortunately, on my team was two people that were under level 14. (they didnt have keystones) and were new players to the game.  My team treated them well, despite them struggling really bad. I don't usually complain much, Im just curious how this could happen. It was normals queue, but that still has to have some form of matchmaking structure? \n\nI'd rather wait 10 minutes in queue for 9 other silver/gold players than play with new players. \n\n(no negativity in this post, they were new, we've all been there. I just want to know why they were in my game:P) \n\nEdit: They were not in a premade, we asked.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-03T01:27:56.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals tries to find a group of people with similar MMR, and then sorts those people into the most even overall team MMR possible. Essentially, the team you were placed with was the closest to an even match that the system could find at that time without having to make you wait an ungodly long time.","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-10-03T03:08:23.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry but Im still a bit confused. How can a level 14 have the same mmr as me at gold 5? Without a keystone, or any significant game experience they have no chance at success. \n\nI mean no disrespect, its just an honest question.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Helarion92","date":"2017-10-03T21:46:28.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just a rly sad joke. 70% of my recent games looks like, diamond player beat 20 lvl player (without runes and masteries) 10-1. Other lane teammate gets 0-10, because of enemy diamond player. I ve never even try to imagine that u will make such a ****** updates xD. Shame on you.","replies":[]}]}]}
