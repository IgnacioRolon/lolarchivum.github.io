It says \"You've been disconnected check your internet connection.\" \n\nMeanwhile Im uploading youtube videos, streaming twitch, playing music and writing this. My internet is fine. This is the third time I've been the reason for a remake. I better not get punished for this since its Leagues client messing up. (I uninstalled, then reinstalled yesterday trying to fix this same issue) \n\nVery frustrating. Please help.\n\nEdit: On this occasion I had a lot open,  the previous times this has happened, League was the only major program open (maybe spotify but thats pretty lightweight) ","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-06T03:54:26.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first thought, if you were uploading to youtube and streaming twitch and music all while playing League.....you're gonna have a bad time. If that's true, your connection probably couldn't handle all that traffic at once which is why you couldn't connect. I'd try running League without so much activity in the background.\n\nIf you're just getting dc'd in League without all that stuff eating up your bandwidth, it's most likely an issue with improper network settings or something blocking your connection with our servers. Reinstalling isn't really going to affect your connection whatsoever so let's take a different approach. Double check your network settings using [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) while paying extra attention to port forwarding and how to configure your DNS. Those two specifically can smooth out your connection with our servers but do make sure to hit the other steps as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-10-06T03:58:55.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"those things were just on this occasion. This was happening yesterday as well, and my only thing open was league.  \n\nAll other times i've solved this by closing the window completely, closing all league of legends processes via task manager, opening it back up, signing back in, and hitting reconnect. (This would take 2-3 cycles before it finally let me into the loading screen) \n\nIll try those steps you gave me. thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
