Anytime I play I always play on the same place and suddenly both me and my friends have a massive lagg and a constant of 900 ms (minimal). there hasn't been a game where I can have a steady ms of at least 100. I have tried every place in my house and always the same. I cant play the same because of this and there is always at least 3 people in each team claiming the same. I dont know if its the NA servers or my internet. I want to know if anyone has been having the same issue because I have stopped playing because f this and its really frustrating that every time I try to play I cant because of the massive lagg. If it is the NA servers it could be great if RIOT could do something about it, and I know that its not easy but still I cant play because of lagg and that is really frustrating knowing that there is nothing you can do about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T19:27:55.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are your friends playing in the same location/network?
