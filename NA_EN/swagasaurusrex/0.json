I bought 3 boxes with keys and got 3 different skins. Bilgewater Swain, Snow Day Bard, and Scorched Earth Renekton. Neither of these skins interested me so I rerolled them into a random skin. What the outcome was really surprised me, it was ANOTHER  Scorched Earth Renekton..\n\nAccording to the ingame tooltip the reroll feature SUPPOSED to give you a random item of same type that you do not own. I feel as if this is a bug and misinformed.

Please correct/complete if I'm wrong.\n\n* If I re-roll 3 champion shards, I get a champion permanent, guaranteed to be for a champ i don't own and automatically redeemed (unless I already own all champs). I can't keep the permanent into my inventory.\n* If I re-roll 3 skin shards, I get a skin permanent that I don't already own, but potentially for a champ I don't own. If I don't own the champ, the permanent remains in my inventory.\n* There is no influence of the shards used over the permanent obtained. Re-rolling 3 Legacy or 3 Epic shards won't guarantee anything better than re-rolling 3 cheap and common shards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
