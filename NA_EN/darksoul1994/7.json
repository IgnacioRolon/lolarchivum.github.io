Instead, games have far less action because everyone is playing risk-averse, and the teams that are taking risks are being punished for it.\n\nThe Banner of Command + Baron interaction has a direct impact on how passively this week's games have been played out because teams simply refuse to take risks before 20 minutes because they know the second baron spawns the enemy team will leverage any advantage they have to take it, and that the Enemy Top Laner already has Banner in their inventory waiting to be cast on a Baron Cannon Minion.\n\nNot to mention, Banner of Command in terms of raw stats is pretty damn efficient for a Tank and nobody else. So Top Lane's champion pool pretty much immediately stagnated because Jungle and Support don't have the gold income to rush it.

If that's the case, then perhaps it speaks to there being too few valuable things to do on the map before Baron spawns.","replies":[{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2018-03-05T04:30:55.285+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-05T04:55:11.549+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agreed.

Baron's value is so out of line with almost every other objective in the game, it makes perfect sense for it to be a major contest.\n\nI think Bannon minions are just symptomatic of this, in that they are getting max value out of an already extremely valuable objective. I can think of a couple ways to stop that:  \n\nA) Making Rift Herald maybe respawn, or stay spawned later, and pushing Baron to be the late-game closer it is maybe intended to be. Or \nB) you need to nerf some other aspect of its reward or it will be so hotly contested it will warp the rest of play around the 20 min mark like we're seeing. Or\nC) make Baron at 20 min statistically difficult to defeat, so that it's a bigger risk to fight it if you know it can be contested, i.e. if you start it and they contest you'll be at a large disadvantage.\n\nIf it's meant to help early teams ahead by midgame to close out, then it's as it should be. I think the increased pressure for baron fights is good for the game, as it prevents turtling, and also means that the incentive to get baron is at or close to the right place.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2018-03-05T04:18:14.533+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"And how can you say that Banner isn't already having a significant effect when, in NA at least, in games that 1 team built Banner and 1 team didn't the team with Banner won 100% of those games?\n\nIn fact, if I am recalling correctly, Banner was built in something like 18/20 games between NA and EU this week.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-05T04:56:36.759+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> And how can you say that Banner isn't already having a significant effect when, in NA at least, in games that 1 team built Banner and 1 team didn't the team with Banner won 100% of those games?\n\nI didn't say it isn't having a significant effect.

Banner if currently being used for a high chance win win situation for the team that gets baron. If one team gets ahead, or believe they can secure baron by superior objective control or mid game teamfighting, they will get banner. However if a team was planning on it but didnt get a lead, sometimes they will just sit on aegis and build a more teamfight item to boost the odds of actually getting baron. Some teams were able to get baron and break base regardless of banner, and sometimes banner had a meaningful impact on its own in the game. While early regions went banner crazy, eventually players realized the minion dematerializer can just delete banner minions and a really strange game was being played during siege not really seen before. This lead to things like back and forth barons or multiple barons needed to be obtained for teams because either their strat got countered, their strat was too narrowminded, or they were playing a relatively similar game to what was happening before. This shows adaptation and brings to question the true impact of banner. At the end of the day, banner isn't an effective strategy in most elos because it requires coordination, one of the strongest power swings in the game, and the ability to execute the push with it. What is way more important is if it is decided as a low interaction, unhealthy, and unfun strategy and way to play league of legends at the top side, and if that is the case is the item need of adjustments, rework, removal etc. I hope people appreciate how much effort is put into understanding and comprehending the change and I wish the best for the balance team! <3 Love these posts keep it up!","replies":[{"poster":"Zhugan","date":"2018-03-05T05:22:28.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Except banner was, I think, quite nearly undefeated across all regions when one team built it and the other didn't; including here in NA where it was undefeated in one sided match-ups.
