(waiting out SOME of the shields block amount before bursting.) \n\nThis also has a secondary effect of negating 'shield stacking' which your method does not, as each shield could have its own 'decay' effect, so stacking multiple shields on a single target causes the decay speed to effectively 'double'. \n\nTHIRDLY, and where I think the idea really shines is that it adds a new lever to balance around.

Not to win all-ins, not to survive more than a second during a teamfight.\n\nIn what game did I ever have Ardent by 10 minutes? Because I can guarantee you that if I ever had Ardent by 10 minutes then it was a stompfest. That does not happen in matches where we go even or even fall behind.\nAssuming a Spellthief's, Control ward, Health pot start (standard for me), rushing {{item:3092}}, {{item:3504}}, and {{item:3107}} for +30% CDR, would cost a total of 6,325 gold.\nFrostfang, Ionian boots, and Grail (cheapest possible 45% CDR build) would cost 3,975.\nFrostfang + Ardent alone would cost 3,275.\n\nI don't get 3,275 gold until 12-15 minutes in, and that's victorious matches only. Obviously if i'm getting beaten in lane it'll take even longer. So no, I don't _literally_ have Ardent by 10 minutes, _literally_ ever. Even if I rush it.\n\nI typically make 3,975 gold by 13-20 minutes, also victorious matches only.\nI don't make 6,325 gold until 19-25 minutes in, still victorious matches only.\nAccording to League of Graphs, the average silver ranked game is 27:30, and it only goes down from there with increasing ELO. So during an average length game, I could achieve 45% CDR for 7-14 minutes of the late game, if I _really_ rushed CDR. And then I would be short on AP and tankiness.\n\nIf we're talking about a support with both Ardent and Redemption by 15 minutes, we **are** talking about a fed support.\n\nYes a Janna or Lulu can shield often, and yes, Janna's shield is too long. But playing from all the way in the back is not effective Janna-ing or Lulu-ing. With Janna, she can only effectively use half her kit from the back. Her Q and W are useless from back there. Laning against a passive Janna is like laning against 1.5 champions instead of 2. Easy.\nWith Lulu on the other hand, she could theoretically drop her entire kit (minus autos) on you from maximum range behind her ADC. If any champion's ability to support from complete safety is too strong, it's Lulu. But that's assuming a Lulu one-trick. Not an average Lulu.\n\nShields are very counterplay-able. You can bait them out, you can overpower them, you can run out the support's mana so she can't cast them. If the enemy support's shield is lasting too long for you to pop the enemy adc before they pop you, then you either need more tankiness, more firepower, smarter tactics, or a better support.\n\nJanna and Lulu are the two most shielding oriented supports in the game. Of course their shields are stupid strong. Try looking at {{champion:201}}{{champion:99}}{{champion:44}}{{champion:497}}{{champion:98}}{{champion:25}} and {{champion:61}}'s shields, and tell me again that shields in general are so strong that we need a new counterplay item to beat them.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2018-04-29T06:04:27.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can look at your own match history to find it, one of the games you lost you have a ardent by 10:29, meaning it is possible to get by the 10 mins. And I am talking shields in general are a problem, the laning phase is not the only phase in which shields are useful no?  The laning phase isnt the only time you shield ppl no? \n\nSo then there is no real counter-play for shields, baiting out depends on the persons incompetence and even if you do you have to lose a significant part of your kit to  bait out a shield, again depends on incompetence of the support which isnt real counterplay. That is like saying Garens ult has counter-play all you have to do is pray he uses it to early.  By the time you eventually over power it you are most likely dead, most kits are not strong enough to shred through a shield fully even with the burst. \n\nBraums shield does not count as it doesnt add an extra health bar to them. Also I dont counter morg as a problem as it only block magic dmg, I am talking about shields which block all sources of dmg, if you have a ori and a Janna on there team and they both for some reason have ardent, and they decide to defend one champion, adc probably, nothing is getting through with just their kit.\n\nAlso the only tactic as of then would be to kill the support first which is what I am finding in most cases, but that isnt even real counterplay, at least with soraka the fact that you can specifically counter her with an item makes sense, she also cant heal herself, Janna and lulu can so focusing them does not prove as a solution. \n\nI want real counter-play, the same counter-play that Kat has with having telegraphed daggers, or Dodging one of Talons abilities to not receive the bleed, Using Zhonyas for Zeds ult or dodging his shurikins to avoid most of his dmg. Being with your team so you dont receive Isolation dmg from KHa's Q. Or having a warning sign over your head when rengar ults, or the fact that he is camo when he gets close. Real counter-play the one that adc's demanded for from assassins. All this is counter-play why is it that utility is some how exempt from this idea? Because it doesnt cause people to have perma grey screens, It doesnt prove that it is not over-tuned.","replies":[{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2018-04-29T06:27:26.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shablagoo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EneiL83y,comment-id=0005000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-29T06:04:27.353+0000)\n>\n> You can look at your own match history to find it, one of the games you lost you have a ardent by 10:29, meaning it is possible to get by the 10 mins.

You're right that I got Ardent by 10 minutes. Once.\nI had First Blood, 3 more kills, and 3 assists by then. I was even keeping up with their KleptoPlank top at that point... so I was fed.\nObviously this isn't the sort of thing that happens regularly. The support should not get kills, much less 4 of them before 10 minutes.\nIt couldn't have happened at all if I were playing a passive support and standing behind my ADC.\n\nMy point still stands that Ardent and Redemption by 15 minutes is not normally possible. But that's not my main point.\n\nYou want to know why i'm focused on the laning phase? Because shields are practically useless in a teamfight. A Janna with level 16, Ardent, Remnant of the Ascended, Ionion Boots, and Mikael's gets +30% HSP, 45% CDR and... 100 AP. **Including** the extra AP she gets from exceeding the CDR cap. With those stats, her shield is worth 364 damage. That's like one auto in the lategame.\n_Theoretically_ Janna and Lulu can achieve nearly constant shields. But in practice, by the time they can do it, the shield will be useless.\n\nMy main point is that rushing CDR for the 100% uptime shields is _possible_, but not viable, so people should stop trying to use it to prove that shields can't be outplayed by whatever class the complainer mains. Shields can always be counterplayed unless the shielder is ridiculously fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2018-04-30T01:05:14.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shields are the reason Janna is as op as she is.

You see the enemy support lock in Blitzcrank. What do you do? You pick tanky. That's strategic counterplay. But it's also the worst kind of strategic outplay: the kind that relies on pick order RNG.\nBlitzcrank is one of the most irritating supports to play against, and that's because counterpicking used to be his only counterplay: if you didn't pick tanky, all you could do in game is dodge hooks and wait for the inevitable. But then Riot nerfed the healing power, then the gold generation on Relic Shield. Now you can poke down his carry over time (tactical counterplay), and you can patiently wait, playing safe until the late game where his power drops off due to low gold income (strategic counterplay). Where before with Blitzcrank your only viable form of counterplay was strategic and relied on getting to pick after him (RNG), now he has multiple forms of counterplay, two of which do not rely on being lucky. That is a step in the right direction and good work from the balance team.\n\nYour definition of counterplay seems to focus exclusively on _strategic_ counterplay, like counter-picks and itemization, and completely ignore _tactical_ counterplay like dodging their skillshots, exploiting cooldowns and resources. You're claiming that shields in general are so strong that you need Riot to create a new form of strategic counterplay, an item or ability, which you can use to hard counter them. I'm claiming that they're not really that strong and you can beat them with existing counterplay, both strategic and tactical. I've already given you several different forms of tactical counterplay, so i'll not bother to re-iterate them here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2018-04-28T21:14:17.634+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That looks more like a case of being outdated.
