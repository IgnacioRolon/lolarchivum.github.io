But putting Star Guardian Champions in their own Star Guardian onesies isn't nearly as rewarding as it could have been.\r\n\r\nAlternative Options:\r\n\r\n1. Put Champions in onesies of other Characters. I've been wanting to see Vi in a Blitz hoodie with yellow Blitzcrank Gauntlets for years.\r\n2. Put the Star Guardian onesies to other Characters. People have been begging for Star Guardian Gragas/Urgot/Taric FOR YEARS. This could have been a nice nod to that.\r\n3. Put non-LoL onesies on Characters like you've done in the past (Meowkai, Dino Gnar, Reverse Annie, Moow Cow Alistar, etc).\r\n\r\nI'll chalk this Pajama skin line up to good idea, poor execution.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, the spelling of Pajama is Pyjama in Australia/UK. (Also, Irelia's passive should be spelled Fervour instead of Fervor in Australia/UK).","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-07T03:57:41.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would take actual work. Phoning it in with slight model tweaks is a lot easier and cheaper, and people are eating it up anyway. I don't understand why these players don't care about originality or quality or not being the target of a blatant lazy cash grab, but that's the reality of the situation, and we're gonna see a lot more of it now that Riot knows they can get away with it.","replies":[]}]}
