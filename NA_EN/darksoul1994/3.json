It's how they work with the rest of their kit, and the small differences they have between them that make abilities unique to that champion. \nHaving similar abilities to other champions also makes a new champion easier to pick up, as you already have some idea how to use their abilities without having to relearn something completely new.\nWe're also at a point where most thing have been done to one degree or another, so reusing basic things that are already on several champions is going to happen. Players would complain even more than they already do if a player had 4 completely unique, never before seen mechanics, as it would be substantially more difficult to balance. New champions usually only have 1 or 2 unique abilities, and that alone makes them balance nightmares.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox9T","date":"2019-01-16T10:23:31.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Neeko E is similar to **zyra**","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-01-16T11:33:19.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually mixed up her q and e when I was typing this to be honest, but both are pretty similar to lux, morg, and zyra's abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox9T","date":"2019-01-16T12:05:57.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"these 2 skills work in completly different ways,morg Q punish you for not staying behind an unit,neeko's E instead punish you for staying behind a unit\n\nanyway i got your point,even though i think there is a limit towhat you said\nthey released 3 champions with similar concepts \"stealing something from the enemy champions\",on top of that the other abilities are everything but original/creative so in this case it's fair saying that it's a lazy design","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-01-16T09:23:16.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">most things have been done\n\nnot even close","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2019-01-16T08:11:07.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"If we had something like trinity force for AP, he would be broken with it into tank items.
