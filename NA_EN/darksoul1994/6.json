I do agree, the different forms has very little differences between them, they could of at least change her hair style instead of just color like the lux skin. The only noticeable difference is small particle changes and ult stances. Not to mention the some of the animations are too similar to the base model and even some legendary can offer more unique animations. There's many more reasons put you must of seen the posts already.\n\nLike riot said, the skin is not to up to par to an true ultimate and people rather have it as an actual ultimate not pay for a sub par one compared to the previous skins. And I can't help to agree with *some* of them. Maybe the NAME **Chroma** is too harsh of a word for you. But the skin's forms are barely different at all compared to the previous skins. It's kind of a slap to the face to the community and betrays their own ultimate model for selling it as it now for a slightly lower price. \n\nIn short, people just want a true ultimate skin and as I see from many posts. they feel cheated on this year.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uw4LZIxd,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-09T04:25:49.456+0000)\n>\n> Category 7 circlejerk drawing near.\n\nThere are complaints that give justifiable feedback on why they don't agree with riot's decision on this Ultimate skin and not just mindless banter.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-03-09T07:12:48.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, my main point of this thread wasn't that her 3 other forms were basically chromas.

She throws bubbles in her water form, she has leaves particles in her nature form, she spits supa hot fire in her magma form. they are actually pretty beautiful to look at. And her dress changes! She wears skirts, leggings, thigh highs and more with matching hair. Lux also has special recall animations with each form!  GGMF in the other hand, her guns changes and abilities look different. No spacial recall animation like Lux, no uniform change, just chroma swaps, and the hair stays the same AND she has only 4 forms to choose.
