I'd recommend taking the following steps in order to reset these files. First, **log into the League Client** then navigate to your config folder, which should be in this directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nOnce in this folder, delete the following files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nAfter deleting those files, hop into a custom match and confirm if your combat text is displaying properly now.
