I began getting this error a couple days ago and I can seem to bypass it by restarting my computer, but if I close the client or if the client or if the client closes, I have to restart my computer again. Another thing that I notice is that the alpha client still works, so it seems to being something with just the adobe air client.\r\n\r\nI've tried repairing the client, deleting the files and reinstalling them, and I've also reinstalled it on both of my storage drives. The error also happens on the PBE client, again hinting that there's something happening with my adobe air client.\r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions would be welcome, or other people having the same problem as me.\r\n\r\nIf they matter, my system specs are:\r\nWindows 10-64 Bit\r\nIntel i7 4770k\r\n16GB DDR3 @ 1600MHz\r\nNvidia GTX 970\r\n1TB HDD\r\n128 GB SSD","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T03:12:06.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maestro errors indicate that there's an issue with your connection reaching our servers.
