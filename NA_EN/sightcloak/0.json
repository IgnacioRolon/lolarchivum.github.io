I am as engrossed in the stories of Progress Day and Mount Targon as any novel I&#039;ve ever read.  The art is incredible and everything brings the story to life.  Any game can be fun with point and click, but its the characters,  the hatred the love and joy that makes League of Legends something beautiful.  The worlds this game creates fuels our passion to do the stories of our champions justice in game.  \r\nIn this thread share your love of League Lore and if any Riot devs are listening... MORE LORE!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2017-01-31T18:57:35.089+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"[SPOILER] I voted yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-01-31T19:15:22.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=J7u1uYck,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-31T18:57:35.089+0000)\n>\n> [SPOILER] I voted yes.\n\nI think the best story you guys ever released is Burning Tides. Event was awesome, but I liked the story more. It was so good I read like 4-5 times from beginning to end. \n\nBloodline slightly loses against Burning Tides because It was shorter than I expected and It shows less development than Burning Tides. Maybe because Shurima is a key faction and story wise much more effective, so It requires sequel, which makes it to end in somewhere, otherwise you go full book.","replies":[]}]}]}
