I worked really hard for that gold before season reset, and literally I start my last game, and I win. I think I&#039;m gold, then I notice the season got reset and only 1 win in my placement games. I somehow got so unlucky that the season literally reset while I was winning my last game to gold... That was the MOST disappointing thing ever.. Please Rito, hear my plea!!\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time,\r\nBrandon\r\n\r\n(I also posted this in the bugs section because I had no idea where to post this. Sorry if that was not the place to do so)","replies":[]}
