Certainly a viable use if you run them with AD reds.\n\nI know some tank junglers take them to help w/ early clears. You also see them on certain top lane fighters, particularly those that care about on-hit effects. Irelia and Fizz are two that jump to mind. And then if you don't have AD quints, other AA-heavy fighters (Aatrox, Jax, Trundle) can make use of them as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Remnant ","date":"2015-03-18T18:01:55.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay!!

Try out {{champion:21}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} \n---\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:39}}\nTryndamere/Volibear/Yasuo I'm unsure if that would be optimal. Trynd I'm almost sure you're better off with AD or armor pen, he gets nothing *extra* from attack speed. So you're better off hitting less times, but just hitting harder when you do hit. Yasuo, maybe, cause of Q cooldown? Though with his passive, crit's probably going to win out, or just flat AD still and just hit harder when you do hit. If you wanna spam them whirlwinds and zone with it, it might be worthwhile.\n\nWhich lane are you talking about for this? Cause that does change a lot. Junglers in general favor attack speed over damage, cause they'll almost always be attacking at max speed while farming. While laners will generally not get to attack at max speeds, more poke and last hit, so AS is mostly going to be wasted in the laning phase (which is generally what runes are for anyway.) Unless you can get a quick triple hit off with {{champion:67}}/{{champion:110}} for some heavy poke.\n\nI put {{champion:57}} in there as kind of a special case. His passive only requires a single auto, but I remember Phreak running AS red's on him because when you need to get that auto off to get some health back, you want to do it as fast as possible so you have less time to take return damage/wasting the point of triggering passive to get health back, I tried it, and really like it. Just makes the auto timing feel so much better.\n**~disclaimer**, unsure if Phreak or anyone 'pro' still considers that a good/viable option. I still like it though.\n\nSome I listed simply because they do have a scaling with attack speed like {{champion:51}} (with her headshot,) though her AD scaling is so high, I can't see it winning out unless you're brush hugging a -lot- and getting headshots pokes on enemy adc continually (unlikely to do that and not miss out on some CS)\n\nSmaller list to work with {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}}\n\nAnother thing to think about, especially bot lane, is who you're laning against. If you outrange them, you can sometimes get free hits without them even getting reply damage off. So AS could win out. Where if they have a ranged support/their adc outranges you, sustain (lifesteal) or ar.pen/flat AD probably win out cause it'll make your trades hit harder, and you'll be forced to trade damage mostly and not get free/unreplied damage.\nAlso, if you have support {{champion:201}} AS suddenly gains utility(yay free stuns,) even on adcs that have no AS utility, so makes it viable on some champs that might not normally run it. {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:15}}","replies":[{"poster":"windwolf777","date":"2015-03-18T07:51:39.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EvilMerodach,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tlkdXdZ0,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-03-18T07:36:50.864+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:119}}\n\nJust curious, why him?

He's good at all-in's, and Braum getting his passive to connect could mean a real fast kill if Draven does AA+E+AAx2 on them, knock aside, then stun. There's a good chance they'll die before they could even flash out. AS quints just makes it more likely you'll land the stun before they react. And yeh, it's pretty much all for the 1st blood potential. Get that and you can go buy an early pickaxe to make up for less AD on runes. I'd say AS quints on any adc with a good level 1-3 all-in would be worthwhile with Braum. Even if you fail the 1st blood, you have a lot of potential to force them to b early and kinda auto-win lane by being a level up/bully them out of farming.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LoRdJeSuS6969420","date":"2015-03-19T03:54:54.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The general rule is that they are good on champions whose abilities amplify their auto attacks rather than being nukes themselves.
