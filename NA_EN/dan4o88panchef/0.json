You only get that warning when you've had a spike in reports against you, so it's likely not just that one match where you've been getting reports. If you've not actually done anything wrong the reports won't hurt you, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Dan4o88PancheF","date":"2016-03-03T01:41:13.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me and a BOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-03T01:43:38.623+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The warning came from a previous game then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-03-03T12:45:22.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"repro steps\n\n1) play a game with you\n2) idle in the post game screen\n3) AFK\n4) you go start your bot game\n5) Return from AFK\n6) RAPOOOOORRRRTTT ME TEAM MATEEEEE (or enemy)\n7) you finish your bot game\n8) viola, you now have a delayed notification !!\n\nit works with honors as well, so you can make it look like that a bot gave you an \"honorable opponent\" notification !","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"No flash no life","date":"2016-03-03T01:38:29.798+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That bot you were playing with turns out to be this AI, it goes by the name Yui, dad is kirito and mom is asuna.","replies":[{"poster":"PROJECT Fizz","date":"2016-03-03T17:58:44.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annnnnnnnnd up vote for Sao reference","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-03T01:41:49.719+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you mean you got a warning in a custom game?","replies":[{"poster":"Dan4o88PancheF","date":"2016-03-03T01:51:35.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"10-15 min after the custom game a message poped that says  WARNING : duo to a negative activite or something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-03-03T02:37:01.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dan4o88PancheF,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jRsF7bHL,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-03-03T01:51:35.011+0000)\n>\n> 10-15 min after the custom game a message poped that says  WARNING : duo to a negative activite or something like that.\n\nWas this what you saw?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3iOLfjL.png\n\nThat is actually for when a past report you made resulted in a punishment being issued.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-03-03T02:06:13.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that happens all the time when you get reported more often than usual. doesnt say that you did something wrong, just that ppl reported you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-03-03T01:37:29.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't have been one of the other four people in the game...","replies":[{"poster":"Dan4o88PancheF","date":"2016-03-03T01:38:25.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrCyanide,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jRsF7bHL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-03T01:37:29.323+0000)\n>\n> Couldn't have been one of the other four people in the game...\n\nme and a bot :) , i guess he reported me :D","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-03-03T01:39:09.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you got into your custom game before the player from the previous game reported you.","replies":[{"poster":"Dan4o88PancheF","date":"2016-03-03T01:42:35.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"new acc on eune","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2016-03-03T01:45:54.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bots have feelings too\n\nBut seriously, just because you got the warning after a bot game doesn't mean you were punished for THAT game.
