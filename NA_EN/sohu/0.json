After it reconnects (around 15 seconds) I can switch them without an issue. Sometimes it drops me out of a champion select and causes a time penalty. Game itself works fine, I have no connection problems at all and normal ping. It does not matter what client I use (old or new one) - it still happens. I don't have ipv6 connection, but I heard disabling ipv6 helper and using Microsoft Easyfixes helped some people. It did not help me tho. I currently use Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and used Windows 10 64-bit when it firstly happened.\r\n\r\nThings I've done so far:\r\n-reinstalled Windows two times;\r\n-disabled ipv6 helper;\r\n-changing dns;\r\n-used hextech repair tool;\r\n-reinstalled league;\r\n-autorepaired league;\r\n-used easyfixes to prefer ipv4 over ipv6 and disable ipv6;\r\n-disabled ipv6 in windows network interface.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T03:00:28.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have a general poor connection to the servers, which causes the PvP.net disconnections.
