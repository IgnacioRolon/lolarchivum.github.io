Firstly, it&#039;s so hard to kill tanks even with vayne&#039;s percentage true damage. Besides that, adcs always die with some unknow aoes and even die before the fights start becasue of thoes assassins no matter how hard your people peels for you. I just hope I can play adc again {{champion:67}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3147}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheAzeban","date":"2017-02-20T17:02:48.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Step 1- Don't go in without support (crazy concept haha)\n\nStep 2- If ahead and the support goes in ( gets a good stun or hook, or what have you), you should put farming on the back burner and get a double kill instead.\n\nStep 3- If behind, stop fighting and farm under turret (Don't say you don't, as a support main it happens far more often than just getting tower dove).\n\nStep 4- Recognize you are not Doublelift, Don't 1v2, or 1v3, or 1v4, or 1v5. \n\nStep 5- Revisit Step 1.\n\nStep 6- Buying a defensive item and not getting 0-100 is better than losing a little dmg.\n\nStep 7- Stay in the back. I see alot of ADCs get too excited and push passed their front line to hit 1-3 autos, then end up taking 2-5 ults, then blame everyone for not peeling. \n\nStep 8- Have fun. If you are too tense, every little mistake will tilt you. Yes, be aware of the mistakes you make, then fix them with a smile as you outplay the enemy who expects you to make the same mistake over again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A1kaid","date":"2017-03-08T04:27:43.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now i realize no one can play adc in s7 riot pls just delete this position adc cant even fight the supp","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-02-20T17:39:40.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2017-02-20T17:36:29.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't play auto attack based ADCs anymore in S7 simple as that.

Right now, if you don't have a good early game, you won't have a good mid game, and if you don't have those, you won't make it to late game really.  This is at high elo (where I am not), so low elo is different.  Basically, ADC is the highest mechanical role out there since your positioning is just so important because you need to provide sustained damage, and to do that your position is paramount.  A burst mage and run in throw a combo and run out I think","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-20T16:52:01.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're playing a crit adc, you have to safely farm into the late game when you are useful, if you are a lethality adc... more or less try to get an advantage and snowball off it.\n\n\nBut yea, you seem to be a vayne player from your post, so it's a safe farm, hope your team doesn't fall behind, and become useful at like.... 30 mins in the game? depending how things are going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YokoNomi","date":"2017-02-20T16:50:31.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I do ok with surviving as an ADC.
