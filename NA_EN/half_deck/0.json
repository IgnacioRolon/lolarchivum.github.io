Why? Don&#039;t give me a mouthful of garbage about that is how I am supposed to get better -  that is utter BS. So I look them up on op.gg or whatever and they are getting crushed in rank or at their own level. Why is it okay that they go into norms and crush those lower than them and that is fine. I&#039;m not learning anything by being totally outclassed and neither are they. It&#039;s cheap and it sucks. So if you are a big enough boy (or girl) to get such and such a rank (and a nice little border around your champ) then you should have no problem taking a significant nerf when you play norms vs. at your intended level of play ... like 30% or more. How about levelling the field a little bit. Do you have any idea how many people are playing way below their appropriate level so that they can feel better about the fact that they suck against their peers? Do you have any idea how negative it is to start playing league right now? Get you azz handed to you repeatedly by players who have been here for years? Got a plan? Even aware? Even care? I feel that is not the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-05T11:05:38.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time they aren't not playing ranked because they are losing.
