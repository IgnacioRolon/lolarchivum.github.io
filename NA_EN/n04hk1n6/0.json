First let me start off by saying I'm playing on family member's computer, that I've played on before this started happening. The first time I installed League on this computer I had no problems at all. Since then, said family member uninstalled League. A few months after I first played on the computer I go to reinstall it, which went very smoothly, nothing out of the ordinary. Then when I try opening it after the install, nothing happens. Just my blank desktop staring back at me. I investigate the Task Manager to see if it was even running, and to my surprise it was. After a few tries of opening it and nothing happening I decide to look towards the forums for help. I've tried every possible thing I've seen. I've tried running League as an Admin, I've tried running it in compatibility mode on sever different OS, I've gone into the RADS and deleted things that we're listed in the forums and at one point I got the patcher to finally show up but it was like a super outdated patcher and I couldn't log in. So I'm asking for help. If anyone knows a way to fix my problem I would greatly appreciate the help. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T18:14:12.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have an outdated or corrupt patcher that is failing to launch properly.
