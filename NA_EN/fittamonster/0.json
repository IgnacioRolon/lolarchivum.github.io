But when it stops, nothing happens. It just sits there and never opens the game... I've fixed it multiple times but it keeps happening!\r\n\r\nI've done the whole copying of UserKernel thing which worked the first time. But once I closed the game and reopend it again, bang, same problem.\r\n\r\nAlso not trying to constantly re-download the whole darn game everytime I want to play... So any idea on how to PERMANENTLY fix this issue?\r\n\r\nmacOS Sierra\r\nVersion 10.12.4\r\n15 inch early 2011\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-06T20:53:56.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a fan of the copying and modifying files here, it's likely to end up causing you more issues and crashing later on.  The issue you're having is likely caused by a security setting preventing league from being launched.  You'll want to specifically go over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to help fix this up by allowing League as an exception permanently.
