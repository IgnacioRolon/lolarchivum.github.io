The disable for Cutpurse Twisted Fate was due to an error with the change. :c \n\n**TL;DR** - darker cards when they're not the highlighted card, and the hues were changed to the true value - i.e. yellow, as opposed to yellow-gold. \n\nFor Soraka, it may be a hue difference. For example - Underworld Twisted Fate and Kalista share similar colors, but Kalista has brighter coloring (it's hotter in terms of color), so there isn't an issue for most people. Like you've mentioned, the glow and outline also usually help in cases where colors may affect readability in colorblind scenarios. \n\nThat said, we're totally working on adjustments for Underworld Twisted Fate, too, 'cause the cards aren't easy to see, whether you're colorblind or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Hencho101","date":"2016-03-11T20:04:24.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can see underworld TF's Q/W fine cuz that greenish color can stick out in lane (but then again i play with that skin) but the only thing is you can't see the cards in the jg/river the green color blends in to well.
