I caught him with no MR as ahri, had a full combo, 2 full ult hits and he just ate the damage. I caught him completely blind and he just RAPED me and I was fed. I hit every ability and ignited and he walked out with 1/4 HP. Hes fucking broken as fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-07-03T20:18:12.269+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"reason you died:  assassin versus a mage...  all he needs is to get into range and you die\n\nyi is a very strong hypercarry, but he is also very vulnerable to crowd control and very situational","replies":[]},{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-07-03T19:45:50.969+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"hes specifically made to kill noobs who falsely think they have \"caught him\"\n\ntho some very strong duelists can actually beat him 1v1, like nocturne and shyvana. tho yes, a master yi is not a champion you should fight 1on1 if you play a weak to medium duelist like ahri.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-07-03T20:47:20.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, the only champion that I think it is able to 1x1 Yi is Jax, even Shyvana would have problems taking Yi's sustained damage for long, and Nocturne definitively has problems.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-07-03T20:57:48.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"nocturne owns him easy, shyvana wins barely, jax has no chance.","replies":[{"poster":"G1Radiobot","date":"2015-07-03T22:29:17.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax would slaughter Yi.
