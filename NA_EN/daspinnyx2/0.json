How the fuck are you supposed to deal with that bullshit? Its literally impossible to get through. Something needs to give. Either tanks need to be nerfed or they need to give damage some help. In a 5v5 team fight it was impossible for us to win because of their tanks. NOT FUCKING POSSIBLE. Fucking fix something.","replies":[{"poster":"Pupel","date":"2015-10-31T06:40:45.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i dont undestand complaining about tanks being hard to kill. Your not supose to kill the tanks first. If you are a briuser you try to get around them.

How is it possible to beat that set up? Is it possible or should every team just run tanks and win every game? I don't think its fucking fair that it is so impossible to kill them that you can't win. We got a 5 man Yasuo ult off of my Wukong ult and it barely tickled their team as a whole. They were impossible to kill and just ran around as 5 because they knew they were impossible to kill. There has to be balance to that otherwise what is the point of this fucking game?","replies":[{"poster":"guguy123","date":"2015-10-31T06:21:19.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So all 5 of them were Maokai and Gragas with 6 tank items? Well, I wish them good luck scratching your towers. Or you. Or your minions. OR ANYTHING ELSE. Seriously, a Maokai with ROA and 5 tank items does about as much damage as 2 caster creeps. Two very durable caster creeps. If you really did get a 5 man Yasuo ult on an actual team, the squishies would have been fucked for sure. The Wukong ult + Yas ult damage alone is more than enough to kill them.

They teamed up mid lane to push the turret and I flanked in from top side by birds with my W, got middle of the team, ulted. Yas ulted, Didn't even pop the GA on the ashe. They killed Yas and I then stormed right down mid lane and won the game.","replies":[{"poster":"guguy123","date":"2015-10-31T06:34:09.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you guys got that amazing of an engage, that Ahri and Ashe should have been dead before they hit the ground.
