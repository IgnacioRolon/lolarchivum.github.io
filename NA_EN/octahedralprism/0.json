Riot&#039;s animations, whether in cinematics, in-game, in-client, or the login screens, their visualization of magic/energy is intriguing to me. It appears as whispy and colorful sand-like particles that flow around in streams and sparkle.\n\nExample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1C8SCO2RG4\n\nSee the whispy sand?\n\nIt&#039;s a nice art style, and I really like it. It&#039;s actually influenced the way magic works and looks in a book I recently published (not trying to advertise, just making connections). I like the originality of it (of what I know, at least. Never seen anyone else use a similar style).\n\nBut what I&#039;m trying to get at here is why use this style? Is it original by Riot? Who came up with it? What does it symbolize that most magic appears in this way? Do you want to say anything, Riot?\n\nWhat do you think, summoners?\n\nCool Beans,\n\nLegend1060","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-07-01T22:39:44.238+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wonderful question my friend! Most of the blue whispy magic that you see floating around the new client, champ select, Hextech crafting, and the corners of Summoner's Rift is the naturally occurring blue magic that flows through Runeterra. It's easily identified by it's characteristic sparkly, chimey, windy ambient sound. It can also be harnessed to power certain forms of Hextech technology. We've worked to define the visual aesthetic and sound of this magic as something distinctly Runeterran, that exists as a wild, organic, and naturally occuring force on Valoran, so I'm glad you're noticing it! I like nerding out about this stuff any excuse I get <3","replies":[{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2017-07-02T00:59:48.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why does the box and keys etc. doesnt have animation on hextech crafting??? they dont move while in the old client it does","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-07-02T18:48:37.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Killaburn,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=NNQQFFG1,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-07-02T00:59:48.107+0000)\n>\n> why does the box and keys etc. doesnt have animation on hextech crafting??? they dont move while in the old client it does\n\nIn the new client, we wanted loot to be a more efficient, fast-paced and exciting experience. Players were telling us that they had a lot of loot boxes to open, and the long animations were simply too much to sit through when you wanted to open 10+ loot boxes, so when redesigning for the new client, we wanted to keep take that responsiveness into consideration. That being said, every patch we're bringing a lot of bug fixes, performance improvements, and animation/sound/polish to the new client, and Hextech crafting is an ever changing beast that may get further visual enhancements.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2017-07-01T18:50:12.539+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its largely a fantasy inspired game with a lot of thematics, wisps and magic have always been a nice filling animation and style to accompany games and stories when a symbol or character is meant to be magical.
