I've done the registration on the uLoL website (without getting a confirmation email, it just shows the information i put in previously whenever i go to the register page) and so far on the uLoL website i haven't seen any information about registering for the collegiate series, nor have I found anything on official tournaments other than the Campus Series. The Facebook page only allows us to like the page, or click the sign up button which only redirects to the main page of the website. I'm not sure if this is a technical problem or not but these issues have been going on since September last year. I was looking through the forums before submitting a ticket since there is nothing covering this on the FAQ and in my experience submitting tickets has rarely fixed any of the problems (last time when i reported a bug and asked for a work around i got leavebustered and told it was my fault for playing)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-09T04:53:05.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you already [**submit a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)?
