They don't help the situation, and all they really do is tilt the whole team. Apart from that, you were arguing and bickering pretty much the entire time.\n\nA replay isn't necessary, because you're being punished for things you said in chat, which won't show up in a replay. The behavior of other players isn't relevant here, because you're punished only for your own actions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arctic Dragon","date":"2019-01-13T05:46:10.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Share a screenshot of the log if you can","replies":[]}]}
