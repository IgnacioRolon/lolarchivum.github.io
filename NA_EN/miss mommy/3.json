In case you weren&#039;t aware of it yet, Riot Gradius has started up a Discord server for GD.  For those that already know what Discord is and why you should use it, the link is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://discord.gg/0hBfK46tbjpemFJf\r\n\r\nFor those who don&#039;t, I&#039;ve prepared a very brief introduction with a list of frequently asked questions below.\r\n\r\nDiscord is, put simply, a giant group messaging program (with 1-on-1 messaging available, but not a friend list, yet) that also does calls like Teamspeak.  The difference here is that, while TeamSpeak costs money to host a server, Discord does not, and is COMPLETELY free to use.  You can use it from your browser, phone (android and iOS both have an app), and your computer (Windows, Mac, AND Linux all supported).\r\n\r\nYou can check the website here:\r\n\r\nhttp://discord.gg\r\n\r\nRegistering there will allow you to have an account, which will allow you to get in on this chat.\r\n\r\nNow, I know what you&#039;re thinking.  &quot;Why should I use this when Boards are here?&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd to that, I have to answer that a good portion of our relatively small community has already huddled up over there.  And it is a GREAT way to stay in contact with people whom you would rather not add on other personal messaging programs, such as Skype.   It&#039;s quicker than waiting on posts on Boards because it&#039;s all IM.\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\n**Do I have to pay anything?**:  Nope, as mentioned earlier, everything is completely free.\r\n\r\n**Who is moderating this?**:  Currently, there are only two moderators.  Riot Gradius himself, and Windows OS.\r\n\r\n**Can I be a mod?**:  Probably not.  You&#039;re better off NOT asking as it makes that more likely for you to NOT be a mod.  Don&#039;t get your hopes up.\r\n\r\n**Is the moderation as strict as Boards?**:  Case and point, no, from what I&#039;ve seen so far.  We&#039;re a lot more lenient, but this should go without saying that it doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll get off acting like a douche to everyone or posting too-suggestive images.  Basically, if you wouldn&#039;t want your boss to catch you looking at it, then it probably isn&#039;t safe to post in the Discord chat.  Use some self-moderation here, please.\r\n\r\n**Is the chat a shithole?**:  This is honestly up to your personal opinion.  But from everything I&#039;ve seen so far, the chat is RELATIVELY chill.  Sorta well-behaved too.  I don&#039;t think there are any bans as of yet.  Just a very small amount of posts removed (and I may even be wrong on that).\r\n\r\n**Will the chat die?**:  Not if we don&#039;t let it.  The more, the merrier.\r\n\r\n**Why are you doing this thread when Gradius and Windows OS already made threads?**:  Because I wanted something more introductory to people who don&#039;t even know what the hell Discord is.  Gradius&#039; original thread started as asking if anyone had made one yet, and it transitioned into him making one himself.  Windows OS&#039; thread simply states that we have a lot of GDers in here (which is sorta true, actually.  We have 90+ people in here mixed between online and offline with 31 online as of the moment).  Hopefully this can effectively guide people to help draw more people in.\r\n\r\n**Did you make these FAQs up?**:  Maybe.  \\*Runs off to eat cookies.*\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope this helps those who don&#039;t know what Discord is, or have been on the fence about whether or not to join the GD Discord server.  We really do appreciate all of you, and everyone is welcome, whether you&#039;ve been banned from Boards in the past, or are even permabanned right now (We have a perma&#039;ed user currently, won&#039;t give a name).  So yeah, come one and come all!  You&#039;re more than welcome here!","replies":[]}
