This almost never happens as I live in Chicago, and the servers are here too. I get a constant 17 ping but I get a \"attempting to reconnect.\" But the main problem is when I close out the game I **CANT** reconnect. No option, no anything. I just get sent back to the normal home screen. As of right now this has happened twice and when I try to start a queue it goes through like nothing happened. I don't know if something happened to the league servers, nut I hope this problem gets solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-23T16:44:08.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't recommend queuing up for anymore games until this get resolved, so you don't run into any penalties.  Start off with our steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, there might be a local issue or block getting in the way and cutting you off from the game server.  You'll be able to test this out in a custom game without penalties.  Let me know how it goes.","replies":[]}]}
