If anyone out there agrees then plz post ideas here.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2014-09-14T18:21:53.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly Lissandra is fine where she is at the moment, she brings huge teamfight to the team as well as good cc. Their are very few mages out there who have to actually get into people's faces to be efficient. Changing her would change her identity.\n\nYou don't need a initiation mage, and if you really want one you can just build her tanky. Lissandra is one of the few who can actually get into the backline","replies":[]},{"poster":"KAAAAAAAYN DO","date":"2014-09-15T23:21:41.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Lissandra's passive could be improved somehow, but I feel she does have some very specific strengths, namely early game mana advantages and her lack of targeted spells except her ult which she can also self cast. Why is that helpful?\nWHERE DID TEEMO GO?!?!?!?\nIt is very, VERY satisfying killing a scared teemo when he doesn't want to move. Just W-Q-E-ALT+R(self cast ult) and he's dead... I swear it was so funny seeing him rage at me. But also she has great ability as a peeler for your ADC, and sometimes it feels good seeing an enemy run away from something that popped out of nowhere and just shattered them before...\nExcuse the pun\nBut anyways, the passive could be changed, but I don't have any good suggestions sadly. Mana restore AA proc already exists on Xerath, but I feel the part about reducing the CD on Liss's passive whenever she impairs an enemy's MS is part of her identity as a CC goddess.\nBut Rito plz, add puns for buying items for her\nFrozen Mallet (why buy, idk, but as a joke like the Primetime Draven AP item) - \"Another tool for my victory\"\nIceborn Gauntlet - \"They will fall beneath my fist!\"\nFrozen Heart - \"Oh! A tribute to my personality\"\nForst Queen's Claim - \"I remember when my mother gave me this as a gift...

I claw into three people ult then spam q and i'll get a trip 70% of the time. I like her nuking, she is sooo good in team fights with zonyas.

There are very, very few initiator mages out there (Fiddlesticks and Swain are the main ones), so it's a very underutilised niche that Lissandra can fit right into. However, in order to do so, initiators need either tankiness or sustain to survive the first volley of cooldowns. Since sustain is common in the other initiator mages, I feel that making her tanky would be the best choice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2014-09-14T14:32:24.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she moves very slowly and can't really secure a kill without relying on her ultimate. Her passive is nice, but it isn't where she needs to change. Ever since they nerfed the damage output on her W, its been increasingly hard to land kills. She's cripplingly short ranged, and can't effectively chase fleeing targets due to the slow speed of her E and her general lack of movement speed. Even adding something as simple as her Q applying slow to any hit target, and not just the first, would help her out tremendously.","replies":[]}]}
