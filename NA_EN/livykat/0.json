I installed the app but it won't open the launcher at all. I've reinstalled and tried to switch out my UserKernel, however, it will only let me \"replace\" the file instead of adding another one to create a League of Legends (2).

The game requires at least OSX 10.7.5 to function. You can find out the OS you are running by following these steps:\n\n- Click the Apple Icon at the top-left hand corner of the screen\n\n- Click 'About this Mac'\n\nIt will show up right under the Apple Logo.","replies":[{"poster":"Baby Chaeng","date":"2015-01-06T01:08:25.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Digital, \nMine is 10.9.5 and have the same problem.\nWhile LoL is patching it suddenly closes and when I open it again, I have to start it from the beginning.\nCan you help me please?{{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"scouteralex","date":"2015-01-06T15:49:48.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this problem as well, running 10.10.1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"shaebeanza","date":"2015-10-30T02:16:27.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you know how to fix this????","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ItsDargonOP","date":"2015-12-01T05:52:34.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well for me, it actually takes time, i have a 10.8.5 imac and it did happen exactly like youre telling. just wait for a while, trust me and when youre waiting it fianlly pops up, but now as u see in the ICON theres like a line and a tiny bit of white, that means its taking time to like install it :)) hope this help you. basically just wait :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sniffelzilla","date":"2015-07-18T21:07:57.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi.
