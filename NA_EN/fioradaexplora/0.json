After opening the replay system, without actually recording any thing, my client began to say it was unable to connect to the internet, after I closed the replay. So I closed my client and opened my launcher, same pop-up appeared.  I went through the normal troubleshooting, and even did the extra stuff that I normally don't do that is posted by Riot to attempt, nothing worked. I don't have much experience with reading logs, but I have been able to use the logs to help locate an issue in the past, and these logs seemed a lot different than I previously have seen. I see this line roughly 60-80+ times, in group sizes varying from 5 to 20 lines in a row.\r\n\r\nWARN| %cprovider-proxy:warn %cThe function `provider` has been deprecated, please use `getProvider`%c +3ms (https://127.0.0.1:58091/fe/lol-uikit/init.js:1)\r\n\r\nWhile I was actually working on posting this, my launcher was finally able to connect, after having it open/trying for 20 minutes+ straight. I can notice the spot in the logs where they are different ( one log I only had the launcher open for under 5 minutes, and another over 20 minutes ). I didn't do any thing different in this time, except give it time to see if it fixed itself, and it did.\r\n\r\nBut I continued on this post only because I wanted to see if the problem kept going if I used the replay again. I opened the same replay ( from match history ) and things worked fine, so I downloaded and watched a previous game, and I got the could not connect pop-up again. I'll wait another 20 minutes and I am sure it will fix itself ( ALL my launcher problems have fixed themselves with time given. ) But I thought I would still post this here to provide information, and if any one runs into this problem, waiting it out works.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T16:57:34.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were[ tracking service problems](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/yjteaUkU-login-issues-all-regions-127) last night that preventing players from logging in.

I've noticed it started about a week ago. \nHowever, in my case, it doesn't seem to be brought on by anything in particular. Note: i have not used the replay function and still have this problem.\n\nDuring random times throughout the day I will randomly lose connection to the client, and only the client. My first reaction was to check server status and known issues. This was not mentioned on the website and led me to believe it was on my end. However, by contacting my ISP and also verifying that it wasn't my equipment, i am led to believe this is an unknown issue on Riots end involving the Beta client. This is actually happening right now....\n\nhttp://s1043.photobucket.com/user/john_paul29/media/Error_zpsypixffyy.png.html","replies":[]}]}
