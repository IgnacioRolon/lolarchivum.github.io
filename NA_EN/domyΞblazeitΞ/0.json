What the hell?\r\nI can/HAVE to count other people as how much better they are then Annie.\r\n&quot;Ah. a teemo shroom, daz about 1.2Tibbers&quot; (THAT. IS FUCKED. UP. think about that for a second. a trap does more damage then the champ that used to 1shot sh*t. BECAUSE SHE HAD TO. OR SHE&#039;D DIE.)\r\n&quot;oh, a full combo of this champ gives me 3x tibbers&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is not just just a main ranting about his favorite character being nerfed into oblivion, It&#039;s someone who has grown to understand the delicate balance between how a character is designed, and what her/his capacities are/should be.\r\n\r\n-That&#039;s not even addressing the &quot;rework&quot; they gave her that (tbh) rekked Tibbers. ***SURE*** it&#039;s easier for a noob to not care about Tibbers now, but when you are playing some &#039;high level&#039; Annie the AI of tibbers very regulary screws up your plays.\r\n-They completely ruined Molten shield; that sh*t got me 10% of my kills vs ADC&#039;s. It was alot better then people guessed; so they rekked it.\r\n-OR the funfact that when i launch a stun, and then die; It *won&#039;t* land.\r\n-OR the hylariouz funfact that i launched a Stun with my &#039;instant&quot; W, saw the animation go off, died a MS later and NOBODY in the TF got stunned.\r\n\r\nIf you want to thrash a character, just f*ckin&#039; remove them.\r\nYES, annie was OP. but that was her f*ckin&#039; POINT.\r\nBurn my flash &amp; i&#039;m an EZ gank-target. In the past at least I had amazing damage to counter all of her horrible **horrible **traits..\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to discuss how I might be wrong, or how my points have merit.\r\nPlease refrain from the obvious &quot;lol annie noob&quot; comments ^^\r\nIt&#039;s a game that&#039;s played for ***fun*** , not just for try-harding in rankeds ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2016-12-21T06:12:23.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie > Shaco","replies":[]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2016-12-21T07:52:28.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, if Annie bot can do it why can't you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-21T05:38:07.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie does exactly what she is intended to, and does it with a skill ceiling of roughly 0.0073 Aurelion Sols.

To start off, she can now go either full burst and rely on the damage reduction, or into a ap/bruiser mage still do good burst, and be hard as shit to take down too because of 3k health 40% damage reduction shenanigans.","replies":[{"poster":"DomyΞBlazeItΞ","date":"2016-12-21T06:59:17.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have not one shotted anyone in over a year.. legit.\nalso, reliable?\n> 've gotten off a tibbers stun last month, and i died miliseconds after throwing it:\nIt's stun did NOT go off.\nReliable you say... ?\n\nAnd i've learnt to run nearly FULL Magic Pen runes so i can atleast TRY. (lowhp targets don't count, full HP, no afks, only 'fair game' counts)\nTibbers has been rekked, as any decent Annie player will tell you.\nWhen I have Tibbers running around, i try to keep as close to my original 'clicks per second' for Annie ALONE, and try to get half that for tibbers, increasing my total clicks per second by 50%.\nthat used to be more then enough cuz the Tibbers AI didn't have resets, didn't glitch, didn't want to stand still FORCIBLY for no reason or wasn't Fixed on some opponent i don't care about. They introduced a whole bunch of new rules in his AI that make his overwrite MY commands, forcing me to increase my clicks per second to counter his BUGS. ***that is a horrible problem, you can't deny that***\nAnd her E is not better :| I will give you that it is better on the Damage reduction part, yes.. But not even I care(d) that much about that part, it was the Thornmail effect that made it hylariously effective as a support.\ngranted, the E is a minor issue, not really something on the same scale as her other issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2016-12-21T05:25:43.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All your options are bad, why create a troll poll?","replies":[]}]}
