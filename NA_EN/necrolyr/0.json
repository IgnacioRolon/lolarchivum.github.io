I have an I5-4690k o.c.ed at 4.3 GHz and MSI R9 390 and recently I'm struggling to hit 120 fps bot lane at 5-10 minutes in. This is on max settings at 1920x1080 with a 144hz monitor. I thought at first it was because I had it capped at 144, but when I uncapped that game I get 220+ leaving base and it still drops below 144 fps before lane phase starts. I have not seen League consume more than 45% on task manager, even when it's the only process open where my task manager isn't even hitting 70% total. It's not a thermal issue either as my cpu is running at a stable 48 Celsius when league is open.","replies":[{"poster":"Oloferno","date":"2017-05-10T12:41:56.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hud and minions are troublesome, minions cost me around 50 and hud 30fps it's stright bs that hud eats fps at all.\nThe current screenshots are taken in practice mode.\nhttp://imgur.com/V1haX7J\nhttp://imgur.com/VSUdozZ\nhttp://imgur.com/JqlrpwL","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrampledByWeed","date":"2017-05-10T10:45:56.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same with me and many others i've talked to or play with. i have a 6700k 1070 with 3200 memory and just like always its after they do a patch. they fucked shit up, but it's a driver that must be causing it according to riot lol. typical league response, it's your problem figure it out because it's never our fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoJa","date":"2017-05-09T07:20:46.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What mode are you using, Fullscreen, Borderless, or Windowed?

There might be some damaged game files somewhere, and when they are used is when you see those FPS drops. It could also be something incredibly simple like a missed driver update somewhere. \n\nLet's make sure to cover all our bases by going through all the steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting).
