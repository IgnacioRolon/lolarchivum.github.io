It happens more than once daily and to be honest takes away from anything positive I may get out of the game.\r\n\r\nCase in point...\r\n\r\nI go 7/12/8 with Lucian and have 106 cs for entire game cause I couldn't farm against an aggressive bot lane Ashe.\r\n\r\nThe {{champion:92}}  in the game proceed to tell everyone to report me for being useless.\r\n\r\nThis is an everyday occurrance and is something that Riot as a whole needs to be aware of as it skews the reporting system into thinking someone was doing something on purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"SuNnYl3oNe","date":"2015-10-27T19:58:42.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The community in League overall is toxic.  Its sad that such a great game is populated by such wastes of DNA.  Few if any ever get banned just try to keep your head above the grime and don't get tilted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-27T18:24:53.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dartwolf 5664, \n\nI wouldn't worry about it to much unless you are intentionally feeding, or not helping. (Which seems to not be the case) We can't be perfect at this game, and some games will be better than others. Try to keep your head up and don't let toxic people ruin the game for you. Instead focus on becoming better with each game and if you have to mute the toxic players do it. You don't need to deal with people flaming you because you're having an off game. Do your best and keep up the awesome work :) \n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
