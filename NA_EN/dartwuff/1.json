This is the 3rd time overall that I've gotten placed in queues like this cause LeaverBuster fails to understand that I have no control over what my laptop does.\r\n\r\nI will also be submitting a ticket on this as I think I should be cut some slack over technical difficulties and that you guys should really take into consideration that people will have problems that are beyond the control of them and that they SHOULD NOT be punished for,","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-21T23:55:53.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with your sentiment on how we have no control over what our electronics do, but at the same time I also feel that if you are to go into a normal or ranked game its unfair to the team. You already know that the issue is your computer and if a team is relying you in a game and you go AFK because your computer has overheated your team loses. We have all been in on a 4 on 5 battle and the outcome isn't always the greatest. You have to think would you want Leaverbuster to activate if one of your teammates disappeared in the middle of the game on you?  {{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Surindael","date":"2015-10-26T03:04:45.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should do it for ranked, but for normals, a 4v5 isn't such a big deal. I'd take a 2 day ban after leaving a large number of times over having to wait 20 minutes before every game. At the end of the day, it's just a game. I don't want to waste any more time on it than i want to. If anything, all it does is send me into a game with an incredibly negative attitude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dartwuff","date":"2015-10-22T05:11:25.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I wouldn't GPK (sorry for abbreviation as typing your name would take a bit) \n\nI'll take my punishment but it still seems a bit shady","replies":[]}]}]}
