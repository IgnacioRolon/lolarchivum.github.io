I played League of Legends for a while and finally quit the game not because of the quality of play but because I wanted to improve my own life outside of video games. I curiously went on the site to see if there was a new champ. To my surprise riot workers are back at it again meddling with something that needs no change. For the most part I agree with Riots changes, however when I saw that Urgot was gonna be changed I had to chime in. Urgot was given to me by my brother and he told me to work on that champion. He was one of my first and one of my favorite champs of all time. The dude is a beast. Give him 1 or 2 kills above your opponent and you can be sure that the game is yours depending on teamwork. Hes extremely fun for the people that actually use him and we wouldnt want him changed a bit. Hes perfect the way he is. He&#039;s very strategic so you gotta know how to use his R, it can even be used to throw a weak enemy behind you for your teammates to kill while you chase and close distance on the other enemy trying to go back to home base. His q is devastating when fed, his w has saved my life plenty of times and his e is a skill to hone and master. With all due respect Riot, please leave Urgot alone. The cult followers of Urgot, (the ones who are actually good with him &quot;i once almost won a 3v5 with Urgot as my main carrying that whole game supported by a miss fortune and zilean and was one kill away from a penta kill in that game in a 1v5 came down to a one shot by jhin i only got the quadra... so yeah I think hes a good champ) as well as me being one of those cult followers of Urgot were good with him and love to play him. Please dont change him. Do yall agree? {{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2016-07-06T17:29:28.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot is one of the least picked champions in the game for a multitude of reasons.\n\nHis visuals are god awful (even though it's intentional), his kit is rather straightforward and it doesn't mesh or synergize well with him or his theme\n\nJust about everybody has been calling for a rework for ages, because he needs one. He's an outdated and massively under-played champion. He really needs a full rework to bring him back into the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tract","date":"2016-07-06T17:38:23.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot is special and the butt of more jokes than anyone but Teemo and maybe Irelia. His kit is outdated and pretty unhealthy however. I'm sure Riot will do well by his rework and he will still feel like Urgot, if not even better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-07-06T17:36:18.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you compare Urgot to most other champions, he is as old and undying as his lore states. people want to play him, but no one does because his kit is old and doesn't work well vs most champions with any kind of utility. (poor {{champion:22}} ) Every player I've met who has ever played Urgot complains that he needed a rework bad. Sorry for your feelings, but they don't seem to line up with the majority of the playerbase I've seen or heard. Hopefully, after this rework the old warrior will be competent on the battlefield once more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-07-06T17:33:45.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^What that guy said. \nOld kits can technically work, but that doesn't necessarily make them viable or engaging. Technically, all AP Sion worked prior to his rework, and technically, so did a full Lifesteal Sion. However, his kit was just atrocious and dated, and he was ugly. When he was updated, his kit was actually fun and engaging, and offered something more than shoot-stun-run and hope they died. Urgot is in the same boat, and could seriously benefit from modernization.","replies":[]}]}
