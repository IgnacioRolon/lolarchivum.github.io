For a while, I thought that the rewards had yet to be given out, until I saw some people with the icon, while I still have yet to receive my rewards. Can I get some help with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T16:15:25.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should receive an email with a code for the icon through the address used at [Omaze](https://www.omaze.com/login).

It seems that my card was declined when I attempted the donation, so I attempted again to much greater success. Thanks for the help!","replies":[]}]}]}
