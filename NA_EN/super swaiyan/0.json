Because there's no way for the server to determine why you've disconnected or crashed, as it simply sees you leave the champion select, it will be counted as a *dodge*.\n\nThis type of freeze will happen if your computer has a poor connection to the matchmaking servers. Most of the time, the network configuration steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) can resolve these types of issues, so I definitely recommend giving it a go.\n\nLet me know if this issue occurs again.","replies":[]}]}
