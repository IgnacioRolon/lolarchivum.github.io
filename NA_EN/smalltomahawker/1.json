This not my main account so I just ignore it but holy hell if this doesn&#039;t show how greedy Riot is at what a true shit system this mastery system is. I do find it funny as I have already spent thousands on your game and know you hate giving out free handouts. Just thought others should know really how 1 sided this shit is.\r\n\r\nKids. Stop freaken out about chests. Its just a system wanting you to spend your hard earned money on skins. They just try to hide it. I guess for those of us who never want to spend money on this game you will get a few free things. But the amount of effort and time to get random items is just hilariously sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Ayvyh","date":"2017-07-11T22:03:15.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got 8 key fragments only from honors.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-07-11T22:01:12.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah Riot is so greedy offering free content.

If you want to actually see a \"free system\" look at other games like Heroes of the Storm. That's a free system. This system is just a joke.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-07-11T22:38:47.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok?? and i have TWENTY FIVE COMPLETED KEYS and ZERO chests.

You realize how mental that sounds right? Just assuming I am getting my chest from queueing with others. Sorry bro... I am not a OTP nor do I need others to get me joke S ranking in this game. Nice try though. You know what would help you get more chests?

Great...... make our shit tied to some new system you just implemented even though some of us have played from release. That's just fucking great.... so happy my good standing accounts have the exact same starting honor as the most toxic shitters in all of League. And has someone who honored people for years and got nothing in return you think I am super excited to honor people now? Fuck no. People just need to play the game at not be dicks. It easiest enough.

Maybe if they didn't just write any past years and seasons off as meaningless it would mean something. But since they did Riot and their system can piss right off. I guess if it makes some kids not rage in game as much so they have a chance to get a joke chest and key then it's a positive but to any adults who have played this game for awhile its just another joke of a system added to the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-07-11T22:27:56.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you act like this in-game?
