Its such a huge middle finger to any player who spends their time actually grinding the ranked ladder. It doesn&#039;t even matter what rank you are. Having someone reach a higher rank than someone else just because their boosted is wrong. After your post about solo queue never coming back I decided to try and cope with dynamic queue. I have even spammed on the boards why I don&#039;t think dynamic queue vs solo is a big deal at lower elo. But honestly I was wrong. Between friends being boosted and playing with boosted players this just needs to stop. There is no point in grinding the ladder when ranks mean nothing. You shouldn&#039;t have to be challenger or master for your rank to mean something. That is just an unrealistic goal for most of the players who play this game.\r\n\r\nPlease restore ranked integrity at all ranks I beg you. Ranking up the ladder should mean the growth in a summoner. For the average summoner they reach many walls on their climb up the ladder. To surpass these walls means a growth in ones mechanics and game knowledge. When players skip this process by being boosted they not only ruin the game for others but themselves as well. These players are also toxic as they believe they know the game better than their peers but they do not have the skills and game knowledge to play at that level and therefore don&#039;t understand their mistakes and become frustrated. Which in turn frustrates their teammates and creates a toxic environment and unevenly matched games.\r\n\r\nPlease do what is right. Restore ranked integrity not only at the top , but all ranks as well.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-03T15:22:57.840+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":6,"body":"boosting will stop when people get out of the mindset that if you dont have a high rank you arent worth shit on the game. people put too much stocking into rank. people focus and get good or get lucky and achieve a rank then they go and play a game vs lower level players pubstomp them and then flame them that those players are bad they should uninstall ect. it happens. so what does that lower level player see and wanna do ? well if i get to so and so rank then i can be like that rank elitist assclown and i can talk down to and belittle others too. then i feel good about me and my ego. its just like bullying and anything else. \npeople in general need to stop taking the game so damn seriously , its a game. play have fun, your gonna win , your gonna lose. but dont let the process of playing a game turn everything into a pissing contest","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-09-03T16:10:37.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> boosting will stop when people get out of the mindset that if you dont have a high rank you arent worth shit on the game. \n\nDamn that i just wanna silver border and Victorious skin...

My dislike for play borders has only to do with its aesthetic appeal, which, to me and many others is the ugliest of all the borders. As a player who can achieve ANY border, I would prefer to have one that I think looks cool. Never, anywhere, in ANY of this reasoning for my dislike of the plat borders can any portion of these statements be misconstrued as an insult to plat players, or any other low level player. The statement I made doesn't refer to players in any way shape or form. It doesn't invalidate any accomplishments of any one else, ever. My statement merely says what it says, I have a choice of any border I want for any account I make. I will not choose the border I think is ugliest as my choice. I will choose one that i think looks cool. And depending on how much time and effort I am willing to invest in that account my choices of the \"cool\" borders might be limited.\n\nCan you figure out now why everyone thinks you've acted like a child?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TFBaam","date":"2016-09-03T17:41:22.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"get plat or diamond then","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MonkeyMadness","date":"2016-09-03T22:35:27.185+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked should mean something, and IMO it used to.

just cuz i dont rank? rank is a choice not the deciding factor of be all on this game. part of the reason why i dont rank is due to nerve damge in my left shoulder/neck and back from being hit by a drunk driver on a interstate at highspeed. i know i dont have the same reaction time or dexterity that others due. also why i dont play champs that have intense mechanical play. i play to enjoy the game cuz i have nothing else going on or nothing on tv. majority of the time im playing i have pain and numbness in my left arm/hand. im not saying feel sorry for me. but just cuz my reaction time and reflexes are slightly disabled and you may be able to push buttons faster dont mean i dont know anything about the game.  \n\nhell for that matter in 2 of the 3 games i played last night i was top lane vs a plat riven and then a plat fiora. i got behind to riven due to her roaming and making plays in the river then getting camped top by a jungler and her. life was hell in that game. i played bad too. we ended up winning the game and i knew if i didnt anything too stupid my champ would be useful when i scale. as the game vs fiora who was plat was a good player but i got  the best of her in lane getting a 2-0 lead. but when it came to game we lost as a team because i was stuck with a premade who decided to only to camp and help each other. mid/jungle premade. full ap lulu mid with her hp at 100% ult off cd and having a GA would not attack or engage until the enemy team blew everything on me , support or adc. and then i get flamed and bitched at by the duo and their whole argument is that they are gold 5 and better then me so they know more. when it was clear by the way they played that instead of playing to win or lose they were playing for a grade. i got accused of being on tilt, not helping team, not doing damage, ect it never ended. \nfunny thing was even though that gold 5 full ap lulu who didnt lane against a plat player and had duo jungler camp his mid who had a far better kda then i did, i out damage her. and this is what i referring to when it comes to the elitist attitude.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-09-03T18:00:37.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Boosting will stop if Dynamic Q goes... thats the only way","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-03T19:01:04.467+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope\npeople had people boost their rank before dynamic Q , people would \"pay \" people to get them to a certain rank \n\nthat is what the guy from LCK did Apdo who got banned. he was a pro player. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikotdxFig8o","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-09-03T19:40:07.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes but those Directly boosted players would all get banned in waves\n\nSo none cared","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-03T19:42:18.931+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"banned in waves just like all the toxic people riot keeps out of the community","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2016-09-05T03:24:47.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sub HeroCro,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z1T6pZV3,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2016-09-03T18:00:37.788+0000)\n>\n> Boosting will stop if Dynamic Q goes... thats the only way\n\nim sure no one ever got boosted in duo queue or having someone else play for them too *sarcasm*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-09-03T17:45:25.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So doping would stop if other sportsmen just stop being better than them.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-03T18:56:55.192+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"apparently you dont get context. it isnt about being better but the elitist attitude that people get cuz they obtain a certain rank and how they treat other people on the game and in the community based off of rank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troiann","date":"2016-09-04T06:09:19.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z1T6pZV3,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-03T15:22:57.840+0000)\n>\n> boosting will stop when people get out of the mindset that if you dont have a high rank you arent worth shit on the game. people put too much stocking into rank. people focus and get good or get lucky and achieve a rank then they go and play a game vs lower level players pubstomp them and then flame them that those players are bad they should uninstall ect. it happens. so what does that lower level player see and wanna do ?

I play in low diamond on my main and pretty much everyone I meet calls themselves boosted garbage.\n\n2. If you're lower rank than someone else you're worse than them.  This is a competitive game with a competitive scene, and there is a competitive ladder.  It is not meant to be your funhouse, and you have zero right to tell other people they can't treat the game like a competition.  And telling someone that they're not as good at the game because they're lower elo isn't \"bullying\".  If you play the game for fun you shouldn't even be bothered by people who say that.  \n\n3. Most people who get boosted are the ones who like to talk shit to other people to inflate their egos.  They are the ones that want to be elitists and belittle lower ranks.

While there certainly are people who are mean and treat others like garbage because of their rank it's very rare.  People don't want to get boosted because they are getting bullied.  In my experience these people get boosted because they want to bully other people but don't have the rank to do it yet.  If there is a competitive ladder some people will want a way to rise to the top without putting the effort in.  I doubt the key motive behind getting boosted is due to rank trashing.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-04T07:01:32.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so through that grind did you enjoy it at all? did you enjoy the game? playing? was it impossible to do so why trying to focus so hard to  improve?","replies":[{"poster":"Troiann","date":"2016-09-04T07:07:23.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z1T6pZV3,comment-id=00010005000000000001,timestamp=2016-09-04T07:01:32.904+0000)\n>\n> so through that grind did you enjoy it at all? did you enjoy the game? playing? was it impossible to do so why trying to focus so hard to  improve?\n\nI enjoyed playing when I won.
