I'd like to set up something that will post into a chat room of mine so anyone who joins will be informed of what the chat room is and what is going on with today's events. I have no idea if I would need a program or if it even possible but what I have in mind is something that would copy/paste/enter a message into the chat room under my name every certain allotted amount of time as long as I was in the chat room and had League Open. Does anyone know if this is even possible or even aloud?","replies":[{"poster":"cautomaton","date":"2014-05-09T00:09:48.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great question.\n\nThe example you mention sounds like it's in-line with the recently announced [policy on third party apps](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4491087); however, we currently don't have a proper API for the chat servers. We use Jabber/XMPP but we have some special sauce mixed in that mean regular jabber clients may have issues connecting and working properly.\n\nI have no idea where a Chat API is on our backlog, but I'll ping the chat team about it. In the meantime, sign up for a [developer account](http://developer.riotgames.com/) and bring up your idea in the forums there.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mormonator","date":"2014-05-09T11:39:13.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do.
