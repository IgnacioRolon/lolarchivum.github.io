(No need to list reasons, I&#039;m sure everyone can think of their own)\r\n\r\nAdmitting if miscommunication or a misclick resulted in a play failing.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that you are tilted due to some action or series of events that has occurred in the game.\r\n\r\nAdmitting you might not have faith in a team-mate or team-mates for one reason or another. (Once again, no need to list reasons for the same as mentioned above)\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;ve been able to say these things or any other similar things that I didn&#039;t list, then congratulations! You too are human like me and all the other players of League and are just as susceptible to mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, when you do admit these things, with as little bias or harmful intent as possible, your team-mates may become a bit more sympathetic and willing to aid you in times of need.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are differences between admitting failures as a result of mistakes or unfavorable circumstances, and intentional failures or mistakes to ruin the experience for fellow players. Those kinds of actions are what bring on the shame.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-12-03T18:33:49.739+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an interesting topic that I mostly agree with - I think the distinction I would make is that admitting your own mistakes is a good idea. \n\n'Mb, shouldn't have engaged' or 'Fair warning guys, I'm practicing Bard but I'm not very good with him yet' etc.\n\nThe only thing I don't find helpful to admit is losing faith in a teammate. I play bot lane and while I definitely can lose faith my lane partner, I don't think its ever been helpful to the game for me to actually say that. I will play differently for sure (I will switch my hat friend for Knights Vow for instance >_>) but I don't think it actually benefits the rest of the team to call someone out when you lose faith in them.\n\nIn my personal opinion, that's not really admitting a mistake you made like the other examples, it's trying to admit someone else's mistakes, if that makes sense. Trying to call out others mistakes in the guise of admitting your own is never received well. However, letting your teammates know you know that you recognize your own misplays is much better than making them without saying anything I think. \n\nAlso thanks for this topic, it really made me think","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2017-12-04T04:08:23.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While we're on the subject of admitting mistakes, would you like to comment on {{champion:142}} 's damage?","replies":[]},{"poster":"EbonyBladeJ88","date":"2017-12-03T20:17:05.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wowza.

Thanks.\" _Caution pings just to be on the safe side_\n\nThen the Lissandra proceeds to, as I said above, Ignore your warnings and is ganked and killed by the Kayn. \n\nThen a bit later:\n\n\"Hey, I saw him again, just letting you know!\" _Caution pings again_\n\nBut the same result as before occurs.\n\nBecause in this hypothetical situation, the Lissandra is ignoring their ally's warnings, this ally might lose faith and think, \"If they won't listen to me now, they won't listen to me ever.\" And so, they might no longer bother to say anything to this team-mate, or even others if they react in a similar fashion. I fully realize that's NOT the best way of going about things, I'm just saying it's a possibility. THAT'S what I meant, I hope that gets it in a clearer light.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salson","date":"2017-12-03T18:42:51.759+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"So, can you nerf Twitch now?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snowplosion","date":"2017-12-02T22:27:14.762+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes a real man to admit his mistakes.

Are you writing it because you are prone to receivving criticism but then like to blame the person who gives criticism and try to claim they too are humans, making mistakes? (seems to be the context due to the last few lines being about sympathetic plights and harmful intent)\n\nOr, is it because you are someone who generally criticizes those who are imperfect and make mistakes, and want people to just own up to the mistakes to reduce the toxic reactions when they deny faults and make excuses and lie? (Unlikely due to the last portion).\n\nI'm prone to make judgments and tell people what they're doing wrong. However, I won't do that when I myself make mistakes. I absolutely will when a team absolutely refuses to own their mistakes and do what it takes to win, and I'm playing correctly.\n\nFor example, just had a game with Karma Support.\n\nMy Jhin level 1 face tanked a Lulu and Jinx. Not just auto fought them. Like literally got within 300 range and stood there taking it all. Furthermore, he did it while I was in the top bush harassing them with Spellthief and Q while there was a wave between us. Now. If he didn't do that, The minions between me and Jinx/Lulu would have been correct positioning. However, Jinx has a passive which increases her move speed and attack speed. Since this was level 1, Even with a Flash and exhaust, once Jhin did this, I had no escape. Should I have predicted Jhin face tank feeding Jinx a first blood? Was that a mistake? Or was the mistake Jhin face tanking? Who was out of position? Who wasn't? He had nothing between them and him. I had about 12 minions between me and them, a flash, and an exhaust.\n\nPersonally, I take no blame for the double they receive, because Jhin did that even though he should know Jinx's passive and the duo's early game.\n\nFurthermore, Their team had a Sejuani, a Corki, and a Lulu. Guess what no one built? No Magic resist. No Armor Penetration. No Magic penetration. Guess what happened in team fights? Corki would package, Sejuani would Bola in and take to the front with her over 800-900 defense passive, and then Gangplank /Corki/Jinx would just hide behind Sejuani while chipping away at a team with no escapes, cc'd, and no armor penetration, no magic penetration, while Sejuani soaked it all.\n\nEven though early game my team was winning, once the team fight was in, we died in 4 seconds, because everyone refused to build Armor pen, Mag resist. They didn't kill Gangplank barrels. They just focused on that good ole Sejuani who was front lining. Even when Sejuani was LOW HP, Jhin reserved his ult for High HP targets, not low, like he didn't even know the majority of his ult's damage comes from missing HP damage. i literally watched in horror 3 times as Sejuani had 5-7% HP, and Jhin shot right past her toward the 100% hp back line while Sejuani chased and cc'd our carries.\n\nBut you know what they say when you tell them to get Armor pen/Lethality/Magic Resist/hit the low HP?\n\n\"You're not doing so hot yourself. STFU and stop harassing.\"\n\nThey don't admit they are doing something wrong.  They don't take accountability. They just care about not being blamed.","replies":[{"poster":"EbonyBladeJ88","date":"2017-12-03T17:45:44.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I DID have a game somewhat recently where I was Garen Top, and I was winning, but I Bugsplatted so hard at about the 12:00 Minute mark, that it forced me to restart my compy and essentially forfeit my lead.\nWhen I got back in, we were unsurprisingly losing, and so I simply came clean, told my team-mates I bugsplatted and said I'd take full responsibility for the loss.
