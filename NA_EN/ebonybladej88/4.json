There is none! Yay! Wait... maybe people would actually respect supports more in that case.... or just flame them more... could be fun! Nami, Soraka, Sona, Nid, Kayle.... other healers... forgot where I'm going with this nevermind...\n\nI queue support/fill every game (which gives me Jungle 99% of the time somehow -.- ) and when I actually get support... literally can feed our ADC 5 kills before I go back for the first time to upgrade support item.... and every single time I do, if they dont recall with me... they die... no expections, every time... which I guess is the point of this thread... do bee dooo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kurjao","date":"2019-02-12T01:54:01.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple of games ago, team wanted to do elder, I warned them that it was entirely warded, even had the scuttle and that twitch was invisible nearby.
