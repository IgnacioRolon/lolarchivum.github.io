If he simply used his ultimate and nothing else you might have a case for most of your arguments.\n\nCait still gets away because now she has room to lay down a trap immediately after using net to back off (which is almost Garen-teed to hit Garen). Garen cannot just refresh his Q cooldown to get back on top of her and even then he still has to avoid the fresh trap while being slowed.\n\nDraven would not only need to use Stand Aside, but he'd likely need to at least catch one more Axe for enough duration on Rush to get far enough away.\n\nDue to Garen not having momentum from DMP or Q movespeed, dashes from Lucian, Ezreal, Corki and Tristana are more than enough.\n\nQuinn can Vault off him and also blind him, making it harder for him to actually catch her.\n\nSince \"his combo\" includes using his W Tenacity to make sure he can even get to the champions, CC reliant Xayah and Varus still have a chance. Xayah addtionally so due to her ultimate.\n\nAshe doesn't have enough CC to properly get away from Garen, since her stun would be far too short in duration and her slow is a rather weak effect.

It wouldn't be affect by tenacity but it's not long in the first place, and if Garen is already on him then it would be exceedingly hard to push garen of in a good direction and control axes at the same time.\n\nLucian and corki's dashes are short, very short.\n\nThey only help for dealing with skillshots or gaining a tiny bit of distance, it would not be enough.\n\nSame with Ezreal for the most part.\n\n\nHonestly, if i were Garen i´d just run up, E on them and save Q and W until they run.

He can't be expected to just walk up because the ADC isn't gonna stand still and let Garen do that. Especially if they're the villain or low enough his R is an immediate threat.\n\nThe short answer is that he can't save Q without burning summoners, and at that point you have to assume the ADC have summoners and warning as well. You can't just say \"well save the Q\" because he needs it to get onto them for the combo in the first place. Additionally, if he does not Q the ADC they will dash away before he's striking them even once with his E due to the fact DMP won't be slowing them and they will be free to cast spells.\n\nIf Garen is going to have Tenacity without using his W, he will need to buy generic Mercury Treads, which most ADC will have matched with their own T2 boots.

A single dash/jump is enough distance (except Vayne's Tumble) and those with movement steroids will still be getting away. Vayne, on the other hand, could possibly use her stealth tumble to set him up for being stunned while putting even more distance between them.\n\nAdditionally, his W tenacity means jack against Varus' E and Xayah's W. Varus' E is (basically) unaffected by Tenacity and Xayah's W, typically maxed second, will be up a second time before his Q and she can additionally use her ultimate as defense before he can get to her while setting up another group of feathers for W.\n\nI didn't just toss out names here. I've played Garen myself and you will almost never be able to just run up to an ADC without Q to help you, even with DMP.
