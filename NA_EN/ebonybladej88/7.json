To be honest I would have preferred him to just be afk, at least I would get more xp during my 1v2.\n\nAnd don't get me started on supports who focus the enemy tank-support when you get dived.

Like yeah no shit the enemy adc free farms because you don’t poke and I get chunked out by the sona every time I walk up to get a cs. \n\nThe best supports I’ve got we’re mid laners who got autofilled who at least know how to be more aggressive and actually use abilities to poke and help me cs under tower because they know how much damage minions take. I once had a soraka that kept using q on the minions every time she had it up, I asked her why she kept wasting her abilities on the minions and her response was “I’m poking”","replies":[{"poster":"Lemexis","date":"2019-07-05T19:13:38.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's why in SoloQ I tend to play other roles, I mainly play ADC and support when I play with a friend. I'll still occasionnally play it in SoloQ, sup too, because they're still part of the game and enjoyable, but it really limits the fun to know you just can't rely on the other botlaner to do his job :/\n\nAnd damn I never had a Soraka like that but that must have sucked.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MikeJ122O","date":"2019-07-05T05:11:16.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The jungler just looks at your crazy supporting ass and the adc at the current state","replies":[]},{"poster":"MyName IsKendall","date":"2019-07-04T15:42:19.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Holy stars these comments are ignorant asf.","replies":[{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-07-04T21:36:34.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"its not ignorant even tho my comment was mostly a joke thats how high elo adcs play as well they go hyper aggresiive and whoever wins the trades wins the lane , stop thinking ur adc is something u need to babysit and u'll improve","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-07-04T21:55:15.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"its funny and all but why is it always seemingly the adcs fault? supports fuck up just as much tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-07-04T02:01:27.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"why would u try to \"save\" them just follow in with ur adc and get a double kill (triple if jungle or mid is around) 9head","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janúary","date":"2019-07-04T02:37:13.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":16,"body":"Have you ever considered maybe you're playing non meta supports and getting out-laned because you have no pressure ?","replies":[]}]}
