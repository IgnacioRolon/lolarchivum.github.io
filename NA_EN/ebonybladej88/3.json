One could also include the Void, but since the most recent Champion Roadmap says we&#039;re getting a new ADC from there, we probably shouldn&#039;t expect a new one from that region any time soon.\r\n\r\nSo this is basically just a brainstorming session for ideas that could be used for Juggernauts that might come from the two above named regions, which currently lack one in their existing champion pools.\r\n\r\nSome ideas I had for Targon, were as follows:\r\n\r\nMount Targon is basically Mount Olympus, Runeterra style. So I was thinking that a Juggernaut from that region would probably have to take some cues from Greek mythology, legends and so on.\r\nOne thing they could do is take things like the Epic Odyssey, or the story of Theseus or any other number of Greek legends, stories or myths and spin their usual LOL style on it.\r\nRiot could take inspirations from characters based around that idea, like for example Sophitia or Cassandra from the Soulcalibur series, who use short swords and small shields and are from Greece in that game series.\r\nAncient Greek Military often focused around combat between individuals, which lines up very well with the &quot;Duelist&quot; or &quot;strong in 1V1 fights&quot; theme that the Juggernauts often portray. They used spears and shields (Though {{champion:80}} already takes the shield and spear part) as well as short swords. Javelins, bows and other similar weapons formed their ranged capabilities. But since Juggernauts are mainly melee (With the exception of {{champion:6}} since his rework) let&#039;s try to keep this hypothetical Targon Juggernaut melee-ranged.\r\n\r\nA sword, aside from the commonly seen Gladius or other similar short swords that Greeks used were known as Kopis. They were similar to the Roman-based Falcatas, or very akin to Kukris of modern-day. They looked something like the following two images.\r\n\r\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Iron_machaira_%28sword%29_MET_SF2001346.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Falcata_%C3%ADbera_%28M.A.N._Madrid%29_01_vertical.jpg\r\n\r\n(If these pictures aren&#039;t showing, let me know and I&#039;ll try to fix the link or find alternate images)\r\n\r\nSince Pantheon has the spear-wielder spot occupied, perhaps our hypothetical Targonian Juggernaut could wield this style of sword, or perhaps the more commonly seen Gladius. Either one could work.\r\n\r\nFor Piltover, SatomiKun had the following basic idea for a Piltover Juggernaut in another thread of mine: &quot;Piltover could have some form of battle machine.... Maybe a hextech vehicle with heavy armor and weaponry, or someone wearing a heavy battle suit.&quot; -SatomiKun\r\n\r\nIt would obviously have to involve some type of technological aspect, considering Piltover&#039;s pseudo-futuristic nature. Perhaps it could be Hex-Tech related, perhaps not. I&#039;m really pulling a blank with Piltover, unfortunately. Rumble (Although he&#039;s not affiliated with Piltover, rather he&#039;s Bandle City) kind of already takes the &quot;Battle-Suit&quot; spot with his machine Tristy, at least in my opinion. So it would probably have to be something else. Jayce also takes the &quot;Huge Weapon&quot; idea with his Mercury Hammer/Cannon.  Vi also kind of does with her huge gauntlets/fists. This is the one that really needs more help. Targon has countless forms of inspiration with the wide array of things to take from Greek mythology, legends and so on.\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;d like to see what ideas my fellow community members can come up with, for both Targon and Piltover.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-02-15T04:43:27.256+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice that you made this to an own discussion. ^^\n\n_______________________\n\nWhile I see where you are coming from with the Gladius idea for Targon, it doesn't really fit the \"gigantic fighter who let's the earth tremble\" idea you had in your last thread.\nYou mentioned Sophitia and Cassandra, they both look way more like swift and mobile fighters, than a big unstoppable, yet immobile force.\n\nRegarding Greek mythology, what about.... reworking a champion into Targons juggernaut?\nMalphite could be a Targonian champion, he needs a new lore anyway.

I was just trying to keep to the theme that Mount Targon is inspired by. I also was trying to make sure existing weapons weren't recycled. I mean, considering this is made up anyways, they don't HAVE to keep EXACTLY to the inspirational material. They could make the Targon Juggernaut wield some other weapon that might not have been affiliated with Greek mythology, but like I said, just trying to make sure existing weapon tropes weren't recycled. That still doesn't mean they can't. But just for the sake of clarity, let's look at some...\n \n{{champion:122}} : Uses a Axe, basically like an executioner's guillotine. He's even got Guillotine in his ult's name.\n\n{{champion:82}} : Uses a huge mace.\n\n{{champion:36}} : Uses a Meat Cleaver, kind of as a parody of Horror movie tropes. (Just my take on his style)\n\n{{champion:86}} : Uses a big, two-handed sword, akin to a Longsword or a Zweihander.\n\n{{champion:420}} : Uses the idol as a bludgeoning device.\n\n{{champion:48}} : Uses a Club or Cudgel. \n\n{{champion:83}} : He basically turned his Shovel into his weapon.\n\n{{champion:6}} : Uses an arm-cannon, I kind of think of it as a \"Corrupted/Mutated\" version of Mega Man.\n\n{{champion:75}} : Uses his staff/axe.\n\nVoli, Shyvana and Udyr use their bare hands. So I was just trying to think of a new weapon this hypothetical Targonian Juggernaut could use. They could use a similar weapon to one's they've had before, I was just trying to be new and creative since that's something they often try to be when creating new champs, whether they are Juggernauts or not.\n\n> \n> Regarding Greek mythology, what about.... reworking a champion into Targons juggernaut?\n> Malphite could be a Targonian champion, he needs a new lore anyway.

That's just my take on it, sorry if I'm bursting your bubble with the old Reality card.\n\nThe idea of a Titan-esque being as a Juggernaut could work, though. It really is a good idea.\n\n> \n> _______________________\n> \n> Piltover is extremely hard to think of anything.... either the trope is already taken (like you mentioned, Rumble and Jayce for example) or the design would naturally fit better into Zaun....\n> \n> Let&#x27;s try another approach.

A chainsaw can bring forth some of the brutality Juggernauts are known for too. His CC could even be a fear to match with that terrifying notion. Darius and Urgot have fear-CC with their Ults, so the Piltover Juggy could do the same. Darius even has a chainsaw-like theme to his axe in his Dreadnova skin, and Urgot does with his deadly grinders in both his base and other skins. The idea has been established, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-02-15T21:22:17.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have said this before on different threads.  Taric is the Targonian juggernaut.  If he builds something along the lines of {{item:3025}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3075}}  he plays exactly like a juggernaut.  There are very few champions who can 1v1 him, he has durability and damage, he lacks mobility, and he wants to pound your face in with his passive.","replies":[{"poster":"EbonyBladeJ88","date":"2018-02-16T00:17:14.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He PLAYS that way when you BUILD him that way perhaps. He's not DESIGNED to function as a Juggernaut. Before you get into the \"X Champion could also function as a Juggernaut when you build them X way\" argument, I already know that one champion people often put forward as part of that argument is {{champion:31}} , especially after his small-scale rework that gave him scaling damage with his ult, which also deals TRUE damage, a component part of a number of Juggernaut's kits ({{champion:122}} ult, {{champion:86}} Villain passive and so on). But, yes, there's always a BUT, according to the Subclass listings, Neither Cho or Taric fall under the Juggernaut label. As of this time of writing, Cho'Gath is a \"Specialist\", and Taric is a \"Enchanter\".\n\nThe descriptions for these classes are as follows; first, the Specialists:\n\nSpecialists are a diverse group of champions who do not \"fit into a neat little box\" in regards to other class/subclass specifications.The majority of these champions were once part of other sub-classes but were reclassified in the V7.10 update, including a large number of champions from the former Zoner subclass of Controller. As a consequence, many Specialists exhibit \"zone control\" either as a dominant or secondary attribute, including many of the pre-7.10 Specialists.\n\nA Zone Controller is a champion whose influence is limited either to telegraphed zones—such as Arise! Azir's Soldiers and Time Bomb—or a persistent threat that is dependent on cooldown knowledge—such as Feast, Chronoshift or Crowstorm. The latter type of Zone Controller is comparable in their psychological threat to a Juggernaut, except that this threat largely diminishes once the problematic ability is known to be on cooldown.\n\nSo in that regard, Cho can have traits comparable to a Juggernaut, but does not OFFICIALLY count as a Juggernaut. Perhaps his VGU (Whenever that is in the future, if at all) will OFFICIALLY place him with the Juggernauts. But as of this time of writing, he is NOT.\n\nNow let's move on to Taric. The descriptions for Enchanters are as follows:\n\nEnchanters focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.\n\nThis means that Taric is not intended to be a front-line fighter based on this description. Most Juggernauts are meant to focus as the front-line, and, if the opportunity presents itself, they can potentially break through the enemy front-line with their own innate attack power. Taric really only has two damaging parts to his current kit. His E, and the AA damage boost his passive gives him after using an ability.\n\nI hope I'm not coming across as snotty, or refusing to hear the other side of the argument, because that is NOT my intention.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-02-16T00:35:18.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/Xs8thEW.gifv\nhttps://plays.tv/video/5a18a09ab9580642f8/i-nut","replies":[{"poster":"EbonyBladeJ88","date":"2018-02-16T00:48:51.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, I'm not disagreeing or saying the strategy isn't viable, because it can be, if the situation lines up favorably for it.\n\n(Yes, I watched the clips before responding.

Just thought it was funny.)\n\nTo function as a Juggernaut, Combat needs to be the champion's PRIMARY or OPTIMAL focus.\n\nYou and others might not agree with that, but as the saying goes, Beggars can't be Choosers.

Also rumble feels too wonky for a piltover champ.( not disrespect i main him.)   Honestly a second mech pilot champ would be cool. This time with a more clean mech ala sg rumble.\n\nFor the targon juggernaunt what if it took more of a mid ranged champ with whips.  No thresh is a whip based champ.  And currently no champion uses an actual whip.  I know its not a real combat weapon but neither are quite a few champs.","replies":[{"poster":"EbonyBladeJ88","date":"2018-02-15T19:02:19.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never said that the Piltover Juggernaut COULDN'T be a Mech, I just thought that Rumble already filled that niche with Tristy.\n\nI actually uploaded a champion concept of that ideal here. Called him Morgenstern, and he used a whip with interchangeable balls or tips every time he visited the shop. Each time he changed the ball, he couldn't change it again for a couple of minutes. I took inspiration from Viktor's upgradable item, as well as video game characters that have wielded whips, like the Belmonts from Castlevania, mainly. He wasn't from Targon, per se in his lore, but the idea could work there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-02-15T11:34:22.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, new juggernauts for those two regions would be nice.\nNew assassins from those two regions as well.","replies":[{"poster":"EbonyBladeJ88","date":"2018-02-15T18:58:09.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just noticed the lack and figured, why not bring it up?","replies":[]}]}]}
