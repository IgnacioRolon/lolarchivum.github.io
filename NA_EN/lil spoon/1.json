How can i disable this. If not, i believe u should be able to because u can disable screen switch when recall. this new feature is very annoying because sometimes i want to ult right away or am aiming a global ult, and when the screen switches, it gives me less time and i have to re aim, or i lose vision of the enemy. and also Some people like to view around the map uninhibited to keep their awareness up even while backing.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-04T23:37:11.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did some digging with our in-game options, and for right now it doesn't look like we have a way to turn that feature off. There is an option to turn off the camera movement whenever you respawn, but recalling will always move the camera back to the fountain.","replies":[]}]}
