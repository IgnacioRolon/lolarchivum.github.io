A few months ago, I created a new account (actually it's the account on which I'm log on to write this), had Evelynn (my favorite champion) and Twitch, and then, the hextech patch came (or whatever, I don&#039;t remember the timeline), and so I opened the free premium chest and got masquerade Evelynn, a legacy skin. I was so happy, got her to mastery 7, but I eventually got banned due to my behavior.\nI thought back then that the skins we got from chests (even premium) were pure random, and that I had just got super lucky.\n\nSo I decided to create a new account, bought singed because I felt like it, and got a singed skin from the premium chest. Then I knew it couldn&#039;t really be random, and did my research and found that it is common knowledge that the premium chest gives you a skin of a champion you own.\n\nSo then I decided to create another account so that I could buy Evelynn so that I could have a skin of her again..... I happened to unlock the chest feature right before I bought Evelynn, then I opened the chest and boom, a damn Varus skin (which I didn&#039;t own)........ It got me mad as Evelynn was the only champ I owned when I opened the chest, but I convinced myself that it must have been because I bought Evelynn after acquiring the premium chest (still before opening it).\n\nSo then I decided to create ANOTHER account so that I would buy Evelynn BEFORE reaching lvl 5, so that the chest would give me an Evelynn skin. But my account glitched or whatever (I don&#039;t recall reaching lvl 5 but when I log on one day I was lvl 5 with 0 exp), but still bought Evelynn even though I had already acquired the chest, I then opened the chest and BOOM, an Hecarim skin (no, I did not own him).\n\nSo then I yet decided to create ANOTHERRR account on which I would definitely buy Evelynn before reaching lvl 5 (did I tell you Evelynn is my favorite champ?). And I succeeded! I played 1 game per day for first wins, and got Evelynn at lvl 4 (that was yesterday). I then reached lvl 5 today, and when I went to open the chest BOOM, there&#039;s an error on rito&#039;s side that makes me unable to open it. I passed all day trying to open the damn chest and it wasn&#039;t opening. Then, when I came back from restaurant a few hours ago, I tried to open the chest.... And it worked!!! And guess what? I got a Mordekaiser skin, wooooo, exactly what I was NOT aiming for.\n\n\nSo all that story for one thing. DOES THE DAMN PREMIUM CHEST REALLY GIVE YOU A SKIN FOR A CHAMP YOU OWN!??!? EVERY source I found on the internet says so. But 3 times in a row it doesn&#039;t. The only actual rito staff member that said anything about it talked about that skin being &quot;semi-random&quot; (his words), I dont remember where. What the hell does that mean??? I haven&#039;t seen a single person with my problem, everyone I read about said they succeeded into getting a skin of the champion they own.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong!?!!?!??!!?!?!?!??? Can someone from riot say clearly if THE PREMIUM CHEST REALLY GIVES A SKIN OF A CHAMPION YOU OWN 100% OF THE TIME???\n\nI&#039;m running out of summoner name ideas, and goddamn e-mail addresses.\nThe first account of my story is actually my 6th account btw, and I'm sick and tired of creating new smurfs.\n\nThank you for reading the story of my life.\nYes, {{champion:28}} is my life, rito give me my damn Eve skins.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-23T04:27:38.273+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could have bought every eve skin with the value of the glorious amount of time you wasted..","replies":[{"poster":"Swifti","date":"2017-04-23T04:37:31.299+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's what I thought, though I want my Masquerade skin back, which is unbuyable but lootable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-23T04:08:19.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's a bug with those chests right now, you'll need to submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have them assist you manually for the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Swifti","date":"2017-04-23T04:27:34.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's a bug right now?

They have pretty much phased out the Legacy client so anything that happens on the new client affecting in-game systems (such as Hextech) still does have a backlash towards the Legacy version.\n\nSo again, the chest is bugged in the system that's all.  They used to also give out a chest that was supposed to give us Garen & Ashe plus enough essence to make them and one skin but it doesn't send that out anymore on either client.  I know this cause I leveled a smurf to 5 and got 1 chest with random content.","replies":[{"poster":"Swifti","date":"2017-04-23T04:41:34.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did get Garen & Ashe and all that stuff in a second chest, on all my accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-04-23T04:42:58.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I didn't on 2 of them that I did, so it's all very buggy :P  Once the legacy is shut down completely though in a few days I'm sure they will focus more on fixing those things.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NoSummonerName1","date":"2017-11-13T12:07:09.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not random..
