It makes it nearly impossible to trade in lane or dodge/land skillshots when the enemy is freezing in a place and reappearing in another. It's not my connection, I've verified it with my ISP and nothing else gives me latency issues, it's only in game on here. Please fix this riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Grendel","date":"2017-04-16T22:14:28.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing here ever since 7.4 there was some kind of massage about people being dced and some other problems with server  just after that pop-ed up i got in the game it was aram that i played as the last game of the day my ping just kept rising checked every option beign on support page nothing helped as well 80 TCP (HTTP Connections) doesn`t work and stops www.microsoft.com doesn`t respond to me and my whole internet just stops l i was trying to fix it played max 10 games same thing is going on with my friends i would realy like to play league again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Piwah","date":"2017-04-08T21:52:50.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been getting the same thing also.. good game","replies":[]},{"poster":"bootlegfireworkz","date":"2017-04-08T19:01:19.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here.

Maybe something like packet loss or a degrading connection that's causing this kind of spike.  Your ISP might be okay, but you can still have local problems, and you can run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for proof.\n\nMy suggestion would be to go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and get this fixed up.
