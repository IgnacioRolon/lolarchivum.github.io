Leblanc was unplayed for nearly a year, then someone was like I can take my dash instead of q and clear an entire minion wave with a single skill?\n\nOh SNAP now she is played to death. \n\nIt's the CS guys; it gives people a huge advantage when you have a champ that even a cat walking across a keyboard can clear a wave with versus a champ like lux who can barely clear a wave with a single skill with a max build. \n\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"freepointzs","date":"2015-06-18T20:58:09.879+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your mixing up overloaded and overpowered.

He is being played in multiple roles at the same time, and excelling at them precisely because his kit has so much in it.

I, for example, don't mind that Ekko can do multiple roles if he's built for them. Current overtuned damage aside, that's actually pretty cool to be either a tank or an assassin. That versatility could potentially allow him to be a nice wildcard pick that doesn't reveal your team's strategy immediately and I like that, as I do for a lot of versatile picks. But on the other hand, I can easily see how other people might see that he can do two seemingly contradictory roles as being a little overbearing since even as an assassin he's going to retain that same utility and cc, even if it's used in a different manner. \n\nKind of like how some people absolutely hate Lulu top but don't mind her as a support, or how others absolutely hated Soraka, Sona or Janna mid but didn't hate them as supports. They used their strengths and went into a solo lane with them despite their fairly large downsides, until that secondary role was nerfed (Soraka couldn't Infuse herself with mana and lost Starcall damage, Janna lost tornado damage, Sona lost.. well, Sona just plain lost) and they were forced back into their primary because of it. When you look at cases like that, and a few others I'm certain that I'm forgetting, it's kind of easy to believe Riot has a set place or two that they planned for a champion to go, and if they deviate from that then they receive nerfs until they step back in line.

Does that justify him being overloaded? Not really, but all I wanted to do was say that it's not uncommon for melee champions to have different ways to build.","replies":[{"poster":"Meeks011","date":"2015-06-19T08:02:48.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> (in her defense, she doesn't have a W active, so she does trade something for that passive)\n\nWhat about Gnar?

You give anyone too much of course they're going to seem powerful. I think lowering his base damages might help benefit that? As he has a lot of base damage to use, which is why tank-ekko is so rewarding.","replies":[]}]}
