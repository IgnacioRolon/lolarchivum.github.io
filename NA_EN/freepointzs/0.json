ADC's are in need of defense not because assassins are eviscerating them with ease, but because they are now taking the lanes of the champions that traditionally offered them protection. I never see the classic single-ADC comp buying Steraks because they simply don't need it, they get more than enough defense from the 4 other champions on their team. It's only the solo lane ADC's like Graves/Quinn/Kindred who buy it because they have no one to protect them. They are just abusing Steraks in an attempt to overcome the intended weakness of their class. An isolated ADC **SHOULD NOT** stand a chance in hell against assassins, that's just the cold truth about how League works and was hardly a problem until people decided that 3 ADC's can each somehow carry all at the same time, and that solo lane ADC's are a safe and reliable pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2016-02-12T21:35:25.792+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":33,"body":"Assassins are supposed to burst you down.
