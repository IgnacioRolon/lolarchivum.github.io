That's actually a pretty notable nerf for a champ that loses the majority of the time as it is. Her win rate is going to go down the shitter just from the R being nerfed like that, count on it. I don't like it because it doesn't address the problem of her zoning and being incredibly annoying in general, yet it manages to throw her chances to win down the toilet. LB players will feel shafted and those facing her will still feel annoyed.\n\nIf her spell ranges get reduced she'd become super worthless. LB needs a rework and likely will have to be converted to a skillshot champ. There's no way she can be both strong enough to have a decent win rate and not perma-banned due to being too annoying if her kit is left as it is.","replies":[{"poster":"JunkÎ¿","date":"2015-03-17T19:31:35.778+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you do the math, at 1k AP she loses 50 damage.\n\nlol","replies":[{"poster":"Earthlord Jazz","date":"2015-03-17T21:17:51.771+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Bearslop","date":"2015-03-19T10:51:13.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Earthlord Jazz,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=JEyu9mdk,comment-id=00000001000000010000,timestamp=2015-03-17T21:17:51.771+0000)\n>\n> 1000(.65+.975+.65)=2275    (Pre-nerf Damage)\n> 1000(.6+.9+.66)=2100          (Post-nerf Damage)\n> 2275-2100=175                       (Total damage loss)\n> \n> Not exactly, she loses 175, but you are on the mark.
