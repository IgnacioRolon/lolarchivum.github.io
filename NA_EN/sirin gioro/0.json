I find Cho'Gath and Sion's teamfighting presence really existing, so yeah. Which champion is better at teamfighting and soaking damage?

Cho can be frustrating to play and he isn't as universally strong in lane as Sion.  Take a look at this guide: http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/reworked-sion-win-lane-win-game-400155\n\nI think it's the best way to play Sion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"turtlecoon","date":"2015-03-02T11:48:22.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Challenger Cho'Gath main here.\n\nPick Sion.\n\nCho is better suited for mid-lane at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-03-02T07:08:42.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll give my vote to sion on solo queue. Cho'gath is actually good and a pain to lane against but he has no gap closer and no way to engage other than a max range Q (that can be dodged easily) if you team has other champion capable to initiate cho gath would do more for the team. Sion ultimate lets you initiate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-02T07:02:49.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I like Sion due to his long range skill shot poke, his scaling toughness, and excellent escape ability with R if you get ganked. That said, Cho has awesome sustain, the ult is so nice for grabbing jungle creeps in between waves and building up HP. and he has the flexibility of multiple build paths.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mahautsukai","date":"2015-03-02T06:56:36.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SION!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toa of Death","date":"2015-03-01T05:30:24.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you like amazing lane sustain and an ult that tells you when it can kill an enemy champ go Cho'Gath.\nIf you like having the chance to make up for a death by coming back to life for a few more seconds go Sion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Provengreil","date":"2015-02-28T19:40:59.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another for sion. There's nothing actually wrong with cho, I've seen him carry very hard, but sion has a feel to controlling him which is very impactful and rewarding, plus you can farm from safety with E if your lane goes sour so you don't feed harder and get your teammates raging","replies":[]},{"poster":"DestructoDave","date":"2015-02-28T07:18:34.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion is def. more fun than Cho-gath, but cho-gath has options. You can go AP and 2 shot ppl, can go attack speed, can go full tank, etc. But, I think Sion is just a blast of a champ to play. I think Sion is better than Cho, too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWT12345","date":"2015-02-28T05:15:25.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would say sion with his devestating rqw combo and his infinite health.
