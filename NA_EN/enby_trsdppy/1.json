This resets roughly every 30 days after your first key fragment. When you hit the reset point you'll start getting more again. This is basically so that farming them is pointless after a certain amount, and people have an equal chance to get a standard amount even if they don't play daily.\n\nYou can read more on Hextech Crafting here; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-07T01:07:03.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It does feel extremely uncommon though.  I'll get like 2-4 the first 2-3 days of the cycle, then get 1-2 more for the entire rest of the 30 days.  It'd feel a bit better if it was slightly more linear.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-06-07T01:11:03.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"From the numerous posts I've seen, I'd guess that 4 is about what you should expect while the drop rate is high.\n\nIf the drop rate decline was more gradual/linear, then people would have to play more games to get the average amount. Having a high drop rate at first then dropping off a steep curve means you can play just a handful of games each month and get the ~4 you're expected to. I personally agree with this system, though I know others feel the same way you do.","replies":[{"poster":"Enby Trsdppy","date":"2016-06-07T22:47:28.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"this encourages moderate players to play their hearts out once in a while, then abandon the game for a long period of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-06-07T22:50:19.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few weeks isn't really a \"long period of time\", and how is that a problem?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
