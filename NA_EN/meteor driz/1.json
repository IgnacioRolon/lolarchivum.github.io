I used to say elo hell wasnt real. That you just had to get better and you would make it out. I said this for years while i sat in plat comfortably enjoying the game. \n\nI now realize that i was wrong. Elo hell does exist and i fully admit that now. I realize now that the two years i spent in plat, I was never a better player  than anyone in gold, silver, or bronze. I was just lucky to have made it out on a winstreak in a place that had slightly more committed and sane players. \n\n5000 ranked games over the course of my 5 years playing the game. I'm stuck in silver and I have no hope of getting out. I got placed silver 3 after going 1-9 in placements and now over 200 ranked games later, i'm in silver 4. At no point, have I felt like i could contribute to my climb out. \n\nI maintained a 60% win ratio on my main champs back in the day, even when i play them and i get super fed it doesnt matter. its completely random who wins. i had no idea there were so many afks in this elo. i had no idea there were so many people feeding out of control that the game ends in 15 mins before mid game ever starts. \n\nSo to all of you - I'm sorry. I didnt know it was so bad. And i'm sorry for ever telling you all you had to do was get better. I was wrong, you were right. You cant win here, its just luck who gets out and who doesnt, i finally can admit that. \n\nHope you win the elo lotto,\n\nDriz\n\n**Edit:** I just wanted to say thanks to everyone on this post. If you are feeling  frustrated about your climb, I hope knowing that you aren't alone makes it a little easier on you - as it does for me. \n\n**Edit: ** Over 5,000 views wow!

Heavy players just don't climb.\n\nIf you don't take personal responsibility for your MMR, you're going to fixate on the games you did well and blame your heavy teammates for your loss, and you're going to disregard the games were you did poorly and blame your teammates for your shortcomings.","replies":[{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2017-02-06T17:48:18.723+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree\n\nI've been silver 2 every season since 4, and this year i got placed bronze 1 and one tricked Katarina and within 3 weeks of playing only about 100 games I'm already in my promos to silver 2 with almost every game I had on Kat I was capable of carrying almost every single game maintaining a 73% win rate across about 25 games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ad Vitam Aeterna","date":"2017-02-06T20:23:50.182+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":11,"body":"No one can deny it?

Let's assume you're Silver 1 and you're constantly matched with Silver 4 players. Let's also assume that you all belong in your respective tiers. You want to improve and climb, but you're finding it really hard. Why? Because while you may not play at a gold level yet, it's drastically harder to improve your own gameplay when you're playing in an elo lower than your own because chances are there aren't very many players who will punish your mistakes the way that a gold 5+ player would. \nYou don't have to do anything special to do well vs a lower elo player, that's why you're where you are. But at the same time, you're not high enough skill level to actively carry your team, much less if you're on a team that refuses to work together or makes the game unnecessarily harder (int, afk, *highly* toxic to the point where they tilt others, etc). But **how can you improve when you're only going against players who are worse than you?**\"\n\nThat's what elo hell is. It's being \"too good\" to get a meaningful challenge from your games, but not good enough to compensate for the disadvantages you're queued into (high death ally lanes, int, afk, etc). \n\nThat isn't to say that you can't improve in this \"rut zone\" so to speak. You can work on cs'ing, roaming, grouping, objective control, managing your own lane (a bit harder bot lane as solo), etc. But at the same time, you won't be able to improve in the same capacity as if you were constantly playing against people at your own skill level or higher.\n\nSpeaking personally, the largest magnitude of improvement to my gameplay was in late season 3 when I started Ranked and early season 4 when I took it seriously. I climbed straight from bronze to gold and maintained a relatively nice win rate. Most games were either against other golds or plats lanes where I was actively punished for mistakes like overextending or not itemizing against the enemy comp to the point where I took it to heart, and learned from my mistakes. From there I spent the next two and half seasons playing mostly normals with my bronze and silver friends. Had good times, but also racked up a bunch of terrible habits because there was no one to punish me. I could do these things and get away with them, so I eventually starting doing them more often. Fast forward to season 7 where they reintroduced solo/duo Q and I decided I wanted to start actively climbing again but it feels almost impossible because of the awkward area I'm in. I go 8-2 in placements, place Silver 3. Dominate my games and skip S2 going straight to Silver 1 after series. From there it was hell. My games leading up to promos are mildly engaging at best, a dirt stomp (easy) at worse. Soon as I get into promos the teams go from low-high silver to gold/plat/diamond and I'm heavily punished for every little move to the point where I get flat out shitted on. I 0-3 my placements, and the games go right back to being really easy until I get to promos and lose them again. Some were to afk/ints, but the majority were just me flat out sucking in comparison. My winrate tanks from 87*-90% to like 51-67% and my MMR tanks to a point of stagnation (into the rut zone), and I just kinda shoot craps until I'm lucky enough to break into gold where I'm actively challenged enough to begin improving at a decent pace again. I finally hit gold in Flex (cause I wanted the double Gold +rewards), and now I'm going through the exact same thing in Solo/Duo. \n\nIt feels like shit from start to finish. At some point I was Gold 1 in plat promos (games 4 and 5 both had at least one afk), but now I'm struggling through Silver 1, wondering if I was ever really better than this.\n\nEDITED: for typos","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2017-02-06T09:55:21.398+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moraru Maurice,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zWHEfq0A,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-02-06T09:30:36.257+0000)\n>\n> Elo hell exists, and noone can deny that.

In the beginning of the season I was playing my mains and getting super fed as always and then consistently being unable to translate those leads into victories. Even being really strong I've never felt so powerless to contributing toward winning on those champions before. So I began to look for answers elsewhere within different champions. \n\nThe deaths is definitely something to work on. I try to stay proactive when we are losing games and still try to trade objectives and win other ways to win rather than forcing team fights or simply relying on picks.
