Even if you shut down someone strong (karthus vs yasuo for example), he will still come back and just dominate no matter how hard he failed in the beginning. Meanwhile it doesn't matter how fed you get on non-hyper champs, you just chances of winning will always remain 50/50 based entirely on how many hyper carries your team has vs the enemies.\n\nSorry to all of you that I discredited in the past, elo hell really does exist.\n\nEdit:\n\nFor reference, I play mid mages such as Xerath, Vel'koz, and Viktor","replies":[{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2018-10-17T01:26:58.368+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":6,"body":"There's 3 ways to be good at the game.\n\n1.

I'm in Plat 5 at the moment.\n\nThat's the problem nowadays. You don't know what to expect. You can be facing a silver 2 player who is legit bad and crush them, or they can actually be decent and just not play a lot of games to climb higher. You can't know how to adjust your playstyle to gain advantages over them. Since League is a race, you have to be quick and fast with what you need to do. I will give you an example.\n\nLet's assume I am a mid laner and I play against a silver 2  player. Let's say that I can easily beat them, even though I don't know that yet. If my bottom lane feeds, what do I do? I have to try and keep up the tempo and try to gain similar advantages in my lane. But I can't always do that, because I don't know to which extent my enemy mid laner is bad. Therefore, if they aren't as bad as my bottom lane, I can't possible gain enough adv to battle the enemies. At the same time, what if my enemy mid laner isn't that bad of a player and I can't get a lot out of them? \n\nThis example leads me to be doing risky plays sometimes in order to try and stay ahead of the race, ahead of the curve to try and always have the upper hand over the enemies. The problem is that I can't always identify the risk/reward because I don't know what kind of enemy I'm facing. Sure, I can op.gg their division, I can even check KDAs, cs/min, that's good and all, but that still doesn't mean much. I can play against a silver 2 guy and be able to hard cheese them and all my risks paying off, and then having a comfortable lead and possible win OR I can play against another silver 2 guy, who won't fall for my tricks, my risks might even lead to me dying, and then what happens if my team also feeds?\n\nThat's the problem I've had recently when I tried to climb above Plat 5. I don't know how to min/max risk/reward. You can tell me that I can play risk-free, do the basics, laning pressure, wave control, good warding etc. but when it comes to outpacing your opponent, sometimes, the slow and steady risk-free beatdown on my enemy mid laner is just not good enough, when my bottom lane loses first tower in 7 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"IOffMeta GtOvrIt","date":"2018-10-18T21:01:08.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you notice a hard snowball/shove in the bottom lane, I would advise you to try roaming more, it won't always work but you could definitely give it a shot, plus coordinating with a jungle gank is always nice :)","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-10-30T19:28:33.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply.

I played like 12 games of ADC, 9 of them as Sivir. Won all as Sivir, and did like 2/3 as Cait. In some games, team was doing fine, in others, team was doing poorly. What I got out of all of those games, esepcially the Sivir ones, is that I always had agency over the game. My lane was a safe farming lane, with good opportunities to trade some damage. After I got my Stormrazor, it just felt the game was over. I had all the options to keep the game stalled out if we were losing and then just pump out insane damage to carry fights later.\n\nSivir is my #1 pick at the moment, honestly. Not even Viktor can match her waveclear and agency she has over the game. I feel like I'm 1 division bracket higher when I play this empowering champion. I managed to have an average of 9.5 cs/minute over 9 games, while always outdamaging anyone else.\n\nFor a champion that is supposed to be in the bottom lane and supposed to be scaling later in the game, it feels like I can impact the game so much faster by just taking bottom tower by perma shoving the lane, while also being safe (bot is safer than mid), and then I'm able to rotate around and snowball leads or balance the game if we're losing. I'm not saying that every champion should be able to do this, but especially Viktor who can't really fight early (apart from this Q max bs), he should be able to at least control a lane without having to worry getting all-ined or going oom.\n\nI'm replying now because I was waiting for the 8.22 changes to go through. It seems like they fucked up Viktor even harder. Now, his early game is hit once again, because of this Q max bullshit, and now has to wait until he gets his fourth item in order to get the same damage he had before. Traditional AP mid Viktor might as well be dead as fuck now. His Q trading tool at levels 9-13 feels dead, his R might feel even more lackluster.\n\nThey could have instead have his Q cooldown scale with levels, rather than Q ranks, or his shield being based on more AP and less mana. Or maybe they could have the slow zone of Iceborn Gauntlet being less potent from ranged champions. Or they could buff Rylai's slow, so that there is more incentive to get it.\n\nI guess it's the end of the season and we should see more changes once preseason goes through, but it feels like Riot doesn't understand what's going on. It reminds me of tank Ekko top back in season 6 (?). They reduced his base damages and increased his AP ratios to remove the tank Ekko thing. The thing is, AP Ekko was always viable throughout this whole time. Right now, AP Viktor is not really viable, when he can get destroyed by most mid laners, especially things like Akali, Irelia etc. Again, Riot could hit the Q shield's mana scaling and have it have more AP scaling. \n\nAnyway, I don't wanna bore you anymore with these. I have so many things I can say, but I guess I'll have to settle for the moment and wait for preseason to see what's up. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to comment around here when that time comes and have a conversation with you again once it happens.","replies":[{"poster":"IOffMeta GtOvrIt","date":"2018-11-07T19:37:55.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly man, if you could find synergy with a support you could take both our strategies and put them together, hard shove their bot lane and make a dash towards mid with a support that works well with sivir (pyke may do well considering his stealth) or you could disrupt the jungle and take their farm, harass them out of your side or just continue to shove your lane, I guess it depends on the team/matchup right?

You don't need to towerdive someone who is 30 cs down. \n\nThat's really it with laning. Bjerg said it best, \"you don't really need that many kills in lane, just get one and abuse it to start roaming.\" Really. You pop a 30 cs lead on most champions you can roam on them and use those for your kills. Telling yourself you have to hurry up and make a play, especially if you don't know how to min/max and look for the best opportunities, will only lead to risky stuff you normally wouldn't do because you aren't feeling the strain of a stacked game.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-10-30T19:26:52.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply. \nI see what you say, I've even thought of it myself, and I wasn't really referring to tower dives in lane.

It could be that everyone got better and you stayed the same.  More likely is that if there are less players than last year that more \"bad\" players did not continue.

Without enough bad players, you still need 60% of the player base to be bronze and silver.  \n\nIt's possible that the meta changed to something that is not your strength.

It's a good thing game wise, but it completely throws my cs farming which is not good to begin with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-10-16T23:55:32.309+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":13,"body":"If a 47% winrate through 500+ games in mid Silver isn't evidence enough, I don't know what is.","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-10-17T06:23:53.284+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"It is, but the Braindead Boards will blame everyone except themselfs for their rank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lenn","date":"2018-10-17T00:18:05.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meteor Driz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0uGjJELj,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-10-16T23:53:49.534+0000)\n>\n> I find it hard to believe that I suddenly became two tiers worse of a player instantly when the new season hit, but I guess it could happen.\n\nto be honest, it's possible, because players do actually get better every season. if you can climb to plat every single season you are actually becoming a better player every time, because the general skill level of players is improving all the time. it's possible you've stagnated in learning, or picked up bad habits, or plat/gold players have picked up on gameplay skills that you're outright missing.\n\ni believe in elo hell to extent, but you have 500 games in silver with a sub 50 winrate. you can only say bad luck for so long. if you're really leaps and bounds beyond silver's skill level, you would get out eventually even while playing off-meta champions.","replies":[{"poster":"SangreDeNoche","date":"2018-10-17T03:57:59.561+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lenn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0uGjJELj,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2018-10-17T00:18:05.077+0000)\n>\n> to be honest, it's possible, because players do actually get better every season. if you can climb to plat every single season you are actually becoming a better player every time, because the general skill level of players is improving all the time. it's possible you've stagnated in learning, or picked up bad habits, or plat/gold players have picked up on gameplay skills that you're outright missing.\n> \n> i believe in elo hell to extent, but you have 500 games in silver with a sub 50 winrate. you can only say bad luck for so long. if you're really leaps and bounds beyond silver's skill level, you would get out eventually even while playing off-meta champions.\n\nI was Bronze 2 most of the season. Literally 1 good 3 days and I skyrocketed to Silver 1. I changed nothing at all, but my allies stopped being gutter trash long enough for that climb.
