I can&#039;t cast either abilities or summoner spells.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know what causes this bug or how to replicate it.\r\n\r\nIn my experience the only thing that works is reloading the game, though sometimes even that won&#039;t work. Recently I had a game where I tried to reload the client three times and it had no effect. To get my game to function properly, I needed to restart my entire computer and then reload the client.\r\n\r\nThis is getting extremely irritating.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-11-12T06:35:13.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"used to happen to me quite often. had to exit out of league altogether to fix it","replies":[]}]}
