Got a small problem here about a missing Hextech chest. So yesterday I'm here playing Twisted Treeline normals with a friend and and decided to play Tahm Kench for the first time after a long while of not playing him since his release. Got an S- on the first game and S on the second but didnt get the Hextech chest graphic to pop up afterwards. I definitely have 1 available chest left to get with the next one being 3 days from now to unlock. I looked at my champ roster and the chest border appears on Tahm Kench but at my summoner page it says I still need to get one chest. It may have bugged out.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T23:35:18.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the chest border appears, it means you've already earned a chest for Tahm Kench for this season and won't be able to earn more until the season ends. You can only earn one chest per champion per season. For complete details on this system, check out our [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"NIGHT ROGUE NW","date":"2016-08-08T23:41:18.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Targons Blade. I do realize that the Box border does mean that I've gotten a chest with said champ in the past but I don't think I've ever gotten a chest with Tahm Kench before. I always try to write down what champ I got a chest with. I guess I could be wrong though since I did play alot of aram before. Thanks for taking your time to reply to this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2016-08-08T23:38:17.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Basically once you get S on the champions you play regularly then you basically forget hextech crafting exists.","replies":[]}]}
