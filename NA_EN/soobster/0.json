(Unable to view friends list, messages, or game invites). This issue has never been a problem for me in the past, so it is quite unusual that it is occurring all of a sudden. \r\n\r\n\r\nWanted to know if there is anyone else having this odd issue at the moment? (I do believe there was a server outage a few hours ago, but the servers were promptly fixed &amp; online soon after) \r\n\r\nMost of my friends all say their clients are fine now &amp; can view their friends list / messages / etc. \r\nAny quick fix to this solution? or is it recommended I simply wait until it reconnects itself. \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-17T03:16:08.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you just need to update your port forwarding to make sure the chat connection is able to get through successfully.
