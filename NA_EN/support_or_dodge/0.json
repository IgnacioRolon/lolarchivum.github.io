I started playing Veigar yesterday and I was shocked when I look at my AP page, I had lost my greater mark of ap and had them replaced with a greater mark of magic penetration-- I've had that page for almost seven months now, I'm not crazy I swear, but it's a little odd that this has occured.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-19T20:48:14.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did a quick check on your account and I don't see that you ever purchased greater marks of ability power.  I see Greater Seals, Glyphs, and Quints of AP, but no marks.  Also based on another comment I don't see any strange logins from your account.   Sorry to say, but I think this may just be a case of mistaken memory :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"One Angry Yordle","date":"2016-05-19T19:25:26.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Hitical Crit,\n\nIt sounds like someone else may have changed that rune page. If you haven't already you should update your passwords and run a virus and malware scan. I don't recall ever seeing a thread where a rune on someone's rune page magically changed due to something Riot did.","replies":[]}]}
