As members of an official school team, League athletes will receive the same benefits as other RMU athletes, such as coaching, staff support, tutoring, and scholarships.  \n\nSo, why is RMU making a varsity League team? Well, Kurt Melcher, the university’s Associate Athletic Director, is a gamer at heart who’s played his fair share of competitive PC games. After he learned about League’s collegiate scene and the teamwork involved in competitive play, he realized League shared many of the same attributes as a traditional college sport. \n\nRMU has already started recruiting for its star lineup, so check out their [official announcement](http://www.rmueagles.com/article/907.php) for more info.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Sprinkles","date":"2014-06-19T00:29:51.727+0000","up_votes":1430,"down_votes":20,"body":"So it's official, playing video games can benefit my education now T.T....HAHA MOM SUCK ON THAT.","replies":[{"poster":"KidDizaster","date":"2014-06-19T00:53:19.092+0000","up_votes":241,"down_votes":34,"body":"Finally vindicated after all these years.

But I never can or never will be. And in band, we never got any glory, the football team always got the cheers and the praise. I always wanted to be there and FINALLY have people applauding for me.
