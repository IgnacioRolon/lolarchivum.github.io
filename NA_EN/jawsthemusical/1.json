The pro scene should not impact our games whatsoever.  Something is strong in the LCS while being in an okay spot in our filthy pleb games?  Why the fuck would it get nerfed?  If they pros think it's too strong in the LCS, then tough shit, ban it.  Why are we punished for the pro scene, and more importantly, how doesn't Riot see what they're doing?\n\nFlashy playmakers are constantly being sheltered from the nerf bat, and it's glaringly obvious who the balance team wants to see in games.  They balance on a whim regardless of what they claim.  When they don't like something, it's nerfed so it isn't played anymore.  How am I supposed to believe anything Riot says in regard to balance?  Phreak in his infinite contradictions waltzed into a thread a while back to defend Lee Sin (being a good little shoutcaster protecting the posterchild for playmaking) and insisted that pros don't pick what's broken, they pick what's fun.  In that same thread, said they picked Soraka and Janna mid because they were bullshit... ???????  So...they're not fun for you guys, so they're bullshit.  Aaaalllrighty then. \n\nThere are so many problems that need addressed and haven't been for the sake of the balance of professional matches.  That's disgusting.  Riot knows damn well what the problems are, and have done next to nothing about them because they want each huge balance patch to bring something fresh and exciting to the LCS.   And if the balance team doesn't feel something is fresh or exciting anymore, they're gutted to oblivion.\n\nWe saw that with tanks this season.  When Cinderhulk was released, yes, it was too strong, but after it was nerfed a bit and some of the outliers like Sej and Gragas got hit, what happened?  We saw the most viable champions and the most healthy meta we've had in years! Almost every game was different, YORICK   of all champions was picked in the LCS.  The issue?  The balance team didn't like tanks ruining the potential of LCS Big Plays and they were shafted with further nerfs and buffs to certain playmakers to keep them down.  Then Sated Bullshit was brought about to further hinder tanks, and finally, after suffering through all of that, we have a glimmer of hope that they'll be back, but nope, juggernauts happened and armor was nerfed.  Thanks a lot.\n\nThey pay far too much attention to the pros when they balance, and it's much more than they'd like to believe.  You can be a white knight and say \"Uh but it's their game, they can balance how they want,\"  but that is a cheap excuse for defending rampant lies and contradicting reasoning.  These last few patches they have all but admitted to balancing to the pro scene with these balance changes, and in a player focused company, that should never ever happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Riftl0lWalker","date":"2015-09-14T02:13:25.941+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This. This is exactly what RITO needs to friggen read...wait they probably did, then ignored it, big surprise. Because if it doesn't change the pro scene, eff it. I never EVER watch the LCS, and why should I? Why would I wanna watch what is Rito's motivation for bringing \"balance\" changes to the game that are way off the radar of what people want!? Listen: MOST OF THE PLAYER BASE IS NOT PRO, OR NEAR PRO, SO STOP PAYING SO MUCH GOD DAMN ATTENTION TO THE PRO SCENE. The pro players could still make plenty of big plays despite champions in LoL being balanced for the non-competitive scene.\n\nI'm not sure how they should balance it for the non-competitive scene, but they should start doing it because it's the only reason that I get mad as hell whenever I see a champ that is likely too strong. Is Darius broken? Nah, he's just quite strong right now and reks nearly anyone and everyone in the early game due to the Q heal, among other things. But it's a problem because in the bronze scene, no one asks for help because they're either feeling toxic or depressed or just don't want to play the game anymore because they know that due to the game's mechanics, Darius will snowball and probably kill the jungler/mid laners when they come to help.\n\nWhile I can never make these posts about unfair patches to lower ELO players express how I feel exactly because I can't think of everything, I think EVERYONE should encourage Riot games to stop ALWAYS looking at the higher ELO and pro scene, because they sure as hell are RARELY, if AT ALL, looking at the bronze to gold scene. I'm not assuming everyone in those ELO's are bad, because people above and below gold ELO are bad and sometimes make you wonder how they even got to the ELO they're currently in.\n\nAlso Riot should nerf SUPER snowbally champs because they're bullsh** in lower ELO's, nerf them so they're FAIR, not UNPLAYABLE.\n\nUnfortunately, we'll just have to wait and see what Riot does, because they obviously refuse to listen to the communities ask for smart/good changes.\n\nTL;DR Riot MUST pay attention to the lower ELO scene, less they risk losing players, and it's easily possible, because while people (me included) are stupid, most will eventually wise up and change.\n\nEdit: Oh and white knights, rito laughs at you while they count your money your spent on this game, I KNOW they do.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KhaoticKhymera","date":"2015-09-13T04:28:38.682+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I completely agree with you Keev. \"focused for professional play\" is not a phrase that needs to come out of any riot employees mouth.

You don't see the NFL changing rules so that people who play backyard football are happier. Pros are incredibly skilled at the game, which means if they're overusing certain things, they probably are overpowered. And unlike in pro games, where it can be easily outplayed, in lower ELO it can be game breaking.

It does help that often the overlap between what non-pro play find too strong are very often the same things that pro-players find most powerful. There are situations though where this isn't possible. When this is the case what option should we choose? This isn't always an either or scenario, but in a few rare situations it is. \n\nGenerally speaking we have some patches leaning towards the non-professional ecosystem and some - such as now before Worlds, where we  look at professional play more heavily. We try to find a good balance between doing adjustments for both groups and I feel it'd be pretty detrimental overall to cater to one camp entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Xalvian","date":"2015-09-13T19:43:00.937+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, here's the thing riot...\nI understand 100% and agree that nerfs around this time (I actually think most of the time but whatever) should be geared towards pros. If something is exploitable, it needs a nerf.\nHOWEVER: buffs should come from general community feedback. Do not buff a champ that pros enjoy using  simply because it isn't getting enough use in pro play. That's dumb. Perhaps their lack of performance is the fact that they are indeed a weak champion and need a buff, but most likely it is simply because of the state of the meta (counterpicks/general team comps) or there being a more effective champ of the same style. Buffs should originate from community usage and success rates across several levels of casual play. If a champ is not used often/not effective in casual play, look at it, see whats up, PLAY SOME OF YOUR OWN GAMES AS THEM, and see what they need. Stop letting the pros dominate the buffs, let them worry about nerfs. I will say, there are some nerfs that the pros need that kill champs for casual play (azir im looking at you), but when it comes to something as unhealthy as some champs (azir) when played mechanically well, yeah, don't let that exist in a highly competitive place. \n\nOn a kinda unrelated note, I HATE the juggernaut patch with a burning passion. Never before have my games been so dominated by the state of a single patch that brought so much toxic gameplay. I won't go deep into this, but Skarner and Garen have no place doing that much damage if they get that tanky. Yeah, villain thing is alright for Garen, but oh my god when all you build is tank items and you can still do as much damage as most full ad top laners, there is a SERIOUS problem. And I don't just hate bruisers, in fact, I love the IDEA behind the juggernaut patch, give a little love to some bruisers that were doing subpar damage and didn't have great buildpaths to really BE a bruiser, either going tank or damage. But you took this too far. When I can go shaco, build titanic hydra, cinderhaulk, black plate, and any other tanky item that gives health and be as-or-more tanky than an average tank while doing just as much damage as I would going full ad, THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ITEMS. Ive seen several champs do similar things with similar items, I just mentioned shaco because I main shaco, and I only really have good insight on him. Skarner is just dumb: more natural damage than a large majority of junglers, even outside of his spires, plus innate tankiness AND good cc AND MOBILITY. This guy, in his current state, is a noob players wet dream, with easy mechanics, high damage, control, and mobility that is unmatched all around by anyone I have ever experienced in the game personally.\n\n\nThat's it for my rant.
