Either going bruiser like or going full ad.\n\nno, maxing q should usually be done last, although if you prefer you can max it after W. Maxing W gives you sustain, true damage, and dueling potential. Its just amazing in lane and does wonders vs any matchup. The only other option is maxing e for the stun duration vs champions that are hard to auto attack","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teemo Carry 420","date":"2016-05-11T11:55:08.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would only start q of their top laner is ranged but never max it first","replies":[{"poster":"Teemo Carry 420","date":"2016-05-11T11:55:35.492+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait this is the wrong ask a main page.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dr sexy rengar","date":"2016-05-12T03:11:14.415+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"OceansAteAlaska","date":"2016-05-12T19:49:10.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"every champion takes some understanding, then there's Warwick","replies":[{"poster":"PresidentShrek","date":"2016-05-13T23:20:03.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and then there's {{champion:13}} and {{champion:23}} lmfao","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Misses Old Talon","date":"2016-05-10T21:36:25.357+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":14,"body":"Ah yes.

I'd start Q lvl 1 vs ranged champions, E lvl 1 vs melee champions and then get W last, so Q>E>W or E>Q>W for the first 3 lvls, i max W vs most things and E vs stuff like leblanc if i am mid lane, generally anything that is difficult to auto\n2. best time to roam is when you complete trinity force regardless of how fed/behind you are, it allows you to gank through lane relatively easily\n3. 4/5/7/9/13 and when you complete trinity are her most important spikes, assuming you max W, if you max E it is 7/9/11+, so tl;dr when your e or w are maxed or both\n4. vs a ranged opponent you can actually start at lvl 1, i take q and jump on them get a few autos and walk in the brush to drop creep agro, otherwise its fairly easy to all in them after lvl 4 if you max w, if u max e you might need to wait till lvl 7\n5. hes actually fairly easy, a lot of people get mercs but tabi is very good vs him as hes mostly physical damage and hes easy to soften up and all in, though its easiest to kill him pre 6 and snowball the lane from there and roam around while he stacks up, since he forces his team to play a 4v5 while he ramps up pretty much\n6. pantheon is very strong pre 6 but after 6 you should have the advantage since his ult doesnt really do anything for him in an all in, so id suggest fighting him post 6\n7. its just reliant on you having tp, if you dont have tp you should be with your team, if you have tp feel free to split push\n8. you can build damage after trinity if you think that you can get away with it, i personally prefer to get the CDR defensive items when im ahead (randuins if i am behind, anything with hp is great if you are behind) but if u feel like the game will be won anyway feel free to build dmg after trinity\n9. i prefer starting dorans blade because its great sustain with her w","replies":[]},{"poster":"PotatoBytes","date":"2016-05-10T19:53:37.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"1. max Q 2nd if it is most important (against ranged champs) depends on their team!\n3. anytime she gets a point in W I think, is considered a power spike\n5. watch how to deal with nasus by dong huap on youtube\n9.

So yes, apparently you can dodge every poor matchup.\n\nPregame lobby is part of the game. An enemy picking/banning your main is supposed to be rewarded by having a much easier game due to you not getting your pick. Thats part of why bans even exist. If you dodge because of this, then they do not receive the reward they should have gotten for banning properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Red Onion King","date":"2016-05-21T19:00:18.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't believe you read the other discussion and in exchange for dodging you're losing LP, consecutive dodges increases the LP loss and the timer to a point that you're not even going to get to play that day.  If I get a Blitzcrank mid pick, I'm probably going to dodge, or a Yasuo support.  We are allowed to dodge, and so dodging becomes a tool.  I haven't dodged, but I've been in some situations that I probably should have, and the more I look at it, the more I think I will.  You've also avoided every question I've directed at you and you just keep recycling your ideology rather than making an actual argument.

And i answered your questions perfectly fine; dodging every single game they dont get irelia is, by definition, dodging every single unfavorable matchup. People with a history of dodging often or a pattern of dodging certain scenarios (such as their one trick being picked/banned) *should* be punished more severely for their dodges. If you get a blitz mid or a yasuo support, deal with it like everyone else in the game. Chances are theyll carry you. Not that it matters, because its not even remotely close to the same issue (a one trick dodging every single unfavorable matchup and not giving the enemy team LP they deserve)","replies":[{"poster":"Red Onion King","date":"2016-05-24T00:25:38.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can play Irelia into an unfavorable match up, he never said he dodged those.  Here's a question you ignored.\n\n\"Let me add that you need to state what you believe the point of ranked queue is. In the rawest form the point would be to advance, would it not? To see how high you can get.\"\n\nYou did not answer it.  Since you're obviously not going to read the other thread here's a copy paste for you.  It's literally right above this one.\n\n\"I've never dodged a ranked game, but I don't have a problem with people dodging because they're one-trick ponies and they didn't get their champ. In fact, if I'm on the team of a one-trick pony and their champ gets banned, I WANT them to dodge. That way I'm not at a huge disadvantage because of a player that doesn't know how to play whatever champ they picked. I would rather wait an extra 30 seconds then have an ally that doesn't know what they're doing and lose a match as a result. If I already showed my pick to the enemy team, I'll probably back out of queue after they dodge and immediately re queue, so that the enemy team doesn't know my preferred pick. It's also not against the rules. There is a penalty for doing it, but you're allowed to do it. In exchange for some LP loss you can dodge, wait 3 minutes, and then re queue. The penalties are there to prevent from it happening on a mass scale, but I doubt riot minds it happening at the rate that it currently does.\"\n\nMy counterpoint is that it creates a more toxic environment for me to have a player on my team with no idea how to play the champ they picked, and then have the entire team start flaming and blaming him for how the game goes than it is to have someone dodge and wait an extra 30 seconds.\"\n\nThe enemy doesn't deserve a boon if someone dodges.  That's ridiculous.  They didn't do anything to deserve it.  And for your point of properly banning, no one bands properly in solo queue anyway.  They ban OP's or champs they don't want to see, not champs that would be negative for their planned comp/comps.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2016-05-25T07:00:31.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irrelevant. Champion select is irrefutably part of ranked. It is designed and meant to be part of the gameplay experience. A team banning a champ that a one trick uses *should* be rewarded. Thus, yes, it is a boon, and they *deserve* that boon. Else the pick/ban phase shouldnt exist in ranked, and you should just get random roles every game. Clearly that is not the case.\n\nThe dodge denies the opposing team the boon they rightfully deserve.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
