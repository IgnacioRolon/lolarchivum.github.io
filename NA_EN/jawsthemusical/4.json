We had lost the team fight at baron, 4 kills to their 5. The only remaining member of their team was a Nasus with about 1K stacks. he starts pushing into our base easily shredding our inhibitor tower and inhibitor. He proceeds to demolishing our Nexus turrets. With about 15 seconds left before I come back and about 25 before any of my teammates can join me I know I have to act fast trading my boots enchantment to homeguard, I'm poised and ready to strike both turrets down and with an army of minions Nasus begins to make short work of our nexus, with each blow another nail in our coffin. He begins to circle around to the back of our nexus. Far from the ruins of our fallen tower, far from his minions and closer to our fountain. I spawn, and in an instant I'm out and jumping over his head, another q lands the nexus only has about 150 health left and with super minions now rolling in I know there is no chance for us... unless, ulting Nasus, he flies into the fountain where he is quickly dispatched by my now spawning allies and the fountain. now to turn my attention towards the growing wave of minions on our doorstep. The nexus health ticks away slowly... 112... 87... 53... there is only one  minion left now... 21... I deal the final blow but not before his last ditch auto attack is loosed 21..... 1HP.... Quickly I seize the opportunity with Nasus dead for another 50 seconds, I react in an instant, charging down the lane I have my eyes set on their exposed Nexus. Miss Fortune blocks my path, but none will stand in the way of my victory. I blow her and her petty Sona to pieces and push onward towards their Nexus. something isn't right however where is Master Yi, The enemies jungler? Signaling for my allies to make a hasty retreat I press forward. Placing my faith into my team I trust that they will end Yi before he can end the game. I surge down the lane, My body kicks into overdrive as adrenaline pulses in and out of my fingertips. I can see the enemies inhibitor, its within my grasp. I'm standing at the threshold of victory and my cannon is pumping round after round into the tower. Morgana comes flying out of the fountain with me in her sights. Her dark binding shoots forth from her tormented hands. Without the slightest hesitation I flash around it and end her suffering. The now exposed inhibitor is now crumbling before me. With Master Yi failed attempt at backdooring, the only thing that stands before me and victory is 2 towers and Nasus whos spawn timer ticks away. I melt the first tower, my team is now midway down the map following my path of destruction. The second goes down. and Nasus comes at me with revenge on his mind and rage in his heart. I begin pumping rounds into the Nexus, I can't even see Nasus now, my eyes are trained on the Nexus. The wither goes up and Nasus is closing, I jump over the Nexus relentless in my assault, with each shot my heart skips a beat. The end is nigh and it couldn't be sweeter. All eyes, as if they weren't already, are drawn towards the enemies Nexus. With a mighty explosion victory is ours. The day is won.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahovzz","date":"2015-11-06T06:06:27.676+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The craziest way I won a game, happened like this.\n\n-Score was 20-3 in a ranked game (my team losing)\n-Enemy team knocked down every turrent, and inhib\n- They are dropping the nexus health WHEN\n\n\"Enemy team agreed to surrender with 4 votes for and 1 against\"\n\nGG Bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePurplePancake","date":"2015-11-05T23:05:53.634+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Setup:  So this one game, I was playing Kog'Maw and another guy on my team was Zed and we were about 20 kills behind and the enemy team was doing baron.

We only had out nexus left, and at this point they were just toying with us. The enemy team didn't use a pink ward for baron, so I charged in, stole baron and flashed out. Our Kayle proceeded to get a pentakill. So we shoved mid hard, and got the inhibitor. The enemy team showed up and killed Xin, myself, and the other two. Before Kayle got a pentakill again. After that she recalled and defended our nexus while we were respawning. She noticed they were going for baron (who was about to spawn again) and so she abandoned the nexus and charged in the baron pit. Using her ulting herself and then getting a quadra, before their Shaco managed to kill her. Then her Guardian Angel brought her back to life and she killed him. Getting ANOTHER pentakill. By now the inhibitor had respawned so all five of us pushed mid again, this time after the inhibitor pushing other lanes back and getting all inhibs. (For some reason they didn't try to backdoor.) They tried for one last time to stop us from pushing, but of course the 4 of us died and Kayle got yet ANOTHER pentakill, before pushing and winning us the game. \n  \n   I did not make this story up.

I'm dating myself a bit, but that was a few months before Season 1 started.  I was in the computer lab watching five of my friends play.  They were slowly loosing with outer towers down, and the mid second tower gone.  Now I have to tell you that the computer lab we were in had a shutdown feature to restart all the computers at 1 am so they could do maintenance for 30 min.  You get a notification 5 min before the shutdown happens.  So suddenly the notification pops up on all the screens.  My friends start to panic, then one guy comes up with a fiendish plan.  He had everyone immediately recall, buy what they could, and charge mid.  The other team didn't realize what was going on; they were pushing both outer lanes with no opposition.  The poor guy in mid didn't know what happened.  Suddenly he was facing a 5v1 with no warning.  My friends cut through both  lane turrets, the inhibitor turret, and the inhibitor before the other team rallied.  They had been doing so well and suddenly, they could loose.  We finished one nexus turret, then there was a last ditch fight at the enemy nexus. Somehow my team came out on top with 2 champs left, who finished the turret and nexus to win.\n\nAfter the game, we waited to see how much time we had left before the computers shut down.  It turned out the entire end of the game, from shutdown notification to win, had only taken 3 min out of the 5 we had.
