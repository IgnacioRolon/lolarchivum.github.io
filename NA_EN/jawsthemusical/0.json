Our team is primarily responsible for approving accounts going into the PBE, so I can speak to how we determine who gets through. \n\nThe history of approvals had been on a need basis. If there was testing needed around a core feature or game mode, we'd look for more PBE players. For example, if a game mode was trying to cater to Silver and below, the team would approve accounts that met that criteria.\n\nIn the recent months, we've been seeing a need for more PBE players in general and have attempted to approve applicants in waves anywhere from 2-4 weeks. If your LIVE account is in good standing over the last 6 months, there is a good chance for approval. That being said, there still remains a deep pool of applicants. \n\nMoreover, recently, our team discovered a bug with the script identifying who to approve. Now that we know of the issue, we hope to resolve it soon and continue the approval waves.\n\nI hope that helps clear up some confusion.","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-09-26T02:22:31.909+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been applied for 3 years :c","replies":[{"poster":"hermeneutist","date":"2015-09-26T07:03:06.925+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 years is just cruel. they should just close PBE registrations, then open them only when they need testers.\n\nalso, rito should just tell us what kind of tester criteria they're looking for.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magmaboy1","date":"2015-09-26T01:32:46.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I was accepted in about a day when i applies o.o so was i just super lucky","replies":[{"poster":"Abecedarian","date":"2015-09-26T02:36:01.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been applied for almost a year :( I don't they accept many people anymore {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Magmaboy1","date":"2015-10-02T21:28:10.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wish you the best of luck my friend, may the rito gods be kind.
