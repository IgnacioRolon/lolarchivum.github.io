(Please Staff look at this)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in a game, when i started to take blue camp (top). My League was lagging really hard even tho i had 15 ping.\nThe lagg continued and then my league crashed in an instant. Tried to reconnect but League of Legends didn't show the reconnect button.\nWhen i tried to start a game it said i was already in a game but i could acces shop etc. I tried to get in the game as fast as possible that's why i couldnt make any screenshots.\n\nNow i have 5 leaverbusters. Can they be removed? if not i guess i have to play them all. But i would really appreciate it if Riot can do something about it.\n\nI hope to see a answer as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your time. &lt;3\n\nAll the best,\n\nMike","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T19:22:08.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some connection problems reaching our game servers, and even with a solid ping you can suffer from factors like packet loss.  You should run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to get an overview of your specific case.  The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty only occurs after multiple leaves and regardless of intent, because leaving still causes a negative experience for other players.  Meaning, the only way to remove it is by continuing to play without leaving.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"YoProBackooo","date":"2017-02-07T18:44:46.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi.","replies":[]}]}
