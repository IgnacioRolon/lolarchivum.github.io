Admittedly, I haven't even seen him in any games since his nerfs after the rework, but he used to be really popular.\n\nStand at a 90 degree angle to your minion wave so he has to pick between farming or harassing.  If he chooses to harass he won't get as big a shield.  Poke and run before he finishes 3 hit combo.  Probably take ignite because of how important early game is in this lane.  If you lose early game or give him a kill, you pretty much have to build defensively and just waveclear and hope you can outscale him late game since he's kitable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zach Sandwhich","date":"2016-11-06T05:00:13.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As with any Juggernaut, Kite, Kite, Kite.\n\nIf your Melee Build some MR, or try and get some support.\n\nDon't try and fight him without MR/Support/Kite.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2016-11-06T04:51:21.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont just walk into him.
