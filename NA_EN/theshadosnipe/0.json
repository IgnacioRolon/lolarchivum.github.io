I usually have anywhere from 150-200 fps, but during ganks and team fights it drops to the teens and occasionally the single digits. This often times means that my screen almost completely freezes until enough champs die or retreat, and by the time it catches up I'm already dead. This has never (to my memory) happened before that patch. Any idea what caused it or when it might be fixed?","replies":[{"poster":"50ShadesOfPlay","date":"2016-12-09T22:53:58.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For anyone still having problems with FPS issues I have solved mine. I downloaded and used Display Driver Uninstaller in safe mode to remove my nvidia drivers. I then downloaded Nvidia Driver version 375.70 and ONLY installed the Driver and Physx and unchecked all other boxes. After performing a clean install I had to set tune 2 settings in my Nvidia control panel. I made sure Single Display and Maximum performance were being used. \n\nAfter this process I was able to finally play LoL again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poluact","date":"2016-12-09T01:02:20.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm experiencing heavy fps drops too. Mostly game is running fine but sometimes fps can drop to 10-15 or screen can completely freeze for a fraction of seconds. Usually it happens when a new object appears on screen: a plant, enemy champions come out of fog of war, etc. Today I have game freezed for about 3 seconds and it never happened before. I already tried updating drivers and even tried to do clean install of the game but it still happens. I have Windows 7 x64, Geforce GTX 650, 4 Gb RAM and AMD FX-6100, all settings set to highest (without inking). It doesn't seem to be related to new client cause it happens with old client too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T03:21:35.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of factors that could be at play here, and it really depends on your OS and what programs you run in the background.

If there is a team fight or even just a solo fight in these areas on the map the game ALWAYS drops to around 5-10 fps. This only started occurring since patch 6.23 and I have never had **_THIS _**problem before. \n\nI have repaired, uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail. The same issue is still occurs and LoL is pretty unplayable for me this patch. \n\nI also play BF1 and Paragon and these games run like butter with no stutters or crashes, so I am always confused why my league client has issues. LoL does not seem like it is as graphically intensive as other games I play yet I always seem to have some sort of issue with LoL. This current issue I am having tho makes the game really unplayable.\n\nLooking for solutions.

And I've followed your guys' entire list of possible remedies (including the common \"disabling the GAME BAR\" with Windows 10's last update along with some other advices from players) and nothing worked.  It's definitely something with that last patch , cuz I have zero issues on all my other games.  And all my drives are up to date working fine.

The areas on the map that seem to be causing the FPS drop for me at least are Krugs and Raptors. If you check out Scarra's broadcast from yesterday he is having the same issue I am.
