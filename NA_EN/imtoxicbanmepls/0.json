Certain kinds of toxicity can cause you to skip levels, including all the way to the perma ban. Do you have the chat logs that were sent to you? Without them we can only guess, and with them we may be able to help you identify the cause.\n\n**Edit:** Saw the logs. DEFINITELY punishment worthy (and ultimately ban worthy), although given some of the stuff I've seen I'm a little puzzled about the immediate escalation to a permanent ban -- I'd have assumed this would get you a chat restriction or 14 day ban first. Have you ever been punished in the past?","replies":[{"poster":"ImToxicBanMePls","date":"2017-03-22T15:10:40.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"as you can see in my original post ive never been punished before....","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-03-22T15:14:05.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ImToxicBanMePls,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=cMQA0isJ,comment-id=000700010000,timestamp=2017-03-22T15:10:40.301+0000)\n>\n> as you can see in my original post ive never been punished before....\n\nHm. Interesting. I'd consider putting a ticket in to Support to see if you can find out more details. You're unlikely to be able to contest the ban (given that chat history is DEFINITELY toxic), but you might be able to find out why you were escalated immediately to a permanent ban.\n\nA tip if you do that though -- if you want ANY chance of getting somewhere, try to be as polite and friendly as possible. Remember that the guy on the other end isn't the one who banned you, and most Rioters (all, in my personal experience) DO actually want to help the playerbase when possible. If you're polite and understanding you're more likely to get someone willing to do a big of digging and see what's up with this case.","replies":[{"poster":"ImToxicBanMePls","date":"2017-03-22T15:26:14.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"ya right those chinese money hungry fucks dont give a damn about the average player. the only response im gonna get from riot is the same bullshit they tell everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-03-22T15:29:01.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ImToxicBanMePls,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=cMQA0isJ,comment-id=00070001000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-22T15:26:14.556+0000)\n>\n> ya right those chinese money hungry fucks dont give a damn about the average player. the only response im gonna get from riot is the same bullshit they tell everyone.\n\nHaving talked to many Riot employees personally for a variety of reasons? This is pretty flatly incorrect. Basically every employee there is actually SUPER devoted to trying to make the best player experience possible.

This whole \"my feelings got hurt, i need protected and avenged\" thing though, that's pretty new. Take note that humanity has existed for hundreds of thousands of years, if not millions, and yet within the last century both our species and the world is going to shit at an exponential rate. I place most (not all as everyone plays a part in this bullshit) of the blame on those people who can't handle the fact that the world isn't always nice to them so they play on humanity as a mass in order to be protected from the \"mean\" things.

Here's a thought, a cruel, truthful, honest thought, those people who get offended and cry about it and throw temper tantrums and shit like that when they don't get their way or when people are \"mean\" to them. Those are the people that natural selection was going to take. Since we as a species have found a way to deny natural selection those individuals have survived along with the rest of us. If we didn't prevent natural selection from taking those that are naturally weaker mentally and physically (thanks to technology and industry the physically weak don't negatively impact our species near as much so they're not so bad) then we'd probably be a lot better off.
