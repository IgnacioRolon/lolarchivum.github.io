Doesn't mean much, though.  Any number of things could happen from now until they release or scrap the project. such as:\n\n* Riot decides another champion is a higher priority.\n* Progress isn't being made fast enough on Yorick and Riot decides to \"icebox\" him.\n* Solcrushed or any of the other primaries on Yorick might go insane and delay the project.\n* Any other silly reason I can't think of at the moment.\n\nRemember that Fiora's rework was \"iceboxed\" for nearly a year before last year's surprise release.\n\nAlso, since we're seeing much more conversation about the Mage update, it's likely that they will be done in the expected time frame.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-03-15T16:36:55.700+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, yes it does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-03-15T19:18:49.457+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric is next.
