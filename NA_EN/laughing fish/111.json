I DON'T THINK SO.\n\nBut... if you ever feel like making poor decisions, you might as well make EDUCATED poor decisions. So here's some advice from a pro Vlad support (I'm like... the best Vlad supp out there right now. Heck, I might be the only one!)\n\nPRO TIPS: Vlad's laning phase is usually a war of attrition against melee targets. He's not a big sudden burster, and he really needs fairly lengthy respites between trades to q-heal up. Unfortunately, for a ranged champ, he's actually at the low end of ranged, which is a problem in botlane when you're against a double ranged duo often.\n\nBasically every time you try to poke botlane, you're gonna lose half your health. How to make it worth? DON'T KEEP DOING IT... ... i.e. don't buy spellthief, 'cause then you'll keep doing it. Get relic. \"But I don't get the melee passive waaaah\". Big whoop. Your q is great for last hitting anyway, and is maxed first as a standard rule. Plus, it's really satisfying getting a relic heal on an ability that heals. It also means the respite between pokes will be less, since you have an additional ranged relic heal! And besides, you build ap off of health, so Face of the Mountain aint a bad choice. Meanwhile, spellthief mana regen? You can't flaunt that, and Vlad is all about flaunting.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-01-17T08:02:42.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this but i would argue that you would get hit less as enemies adcs arent likely to turn on you and miss farm  also you have your w as a get away","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Century Child","date":"2016-01-15T14:18:36.890+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me playing Leona every god damn day of my life.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2016-01-15T15:46:05.839+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I jumped the first time I watched that movie.
