They arent going to choose a \"well balanced\" champion unless they are forced to.  \n\nAnd a lot of times the champion is/was always strong.

Its different if he is in half of them. On the flipside, some champions are in the limelight due to their popularity and strength, whether or not the pros use them - Riven, Zed and Yasuo come to mind. There will always be complaints about these champions until they get dumpstered. Then there are champions that are strong, arent played too much, and not used in the pros (Eve, Pantheon, Fiddle).

Varus is one of the best siege/poke champions in the game, especially midgame at 3 items - pair him with a Cait, Ezreal, or Jhin and you have a really nice poke comp. In competitive you dont have the problem of \"We have 2 sieging champions but no disengage\" or \"We have 2 poke champs but Malphite keeps initating before we get any poke off\". Vlad is probably more about the current Meta - he does well into Syndra by rushing early MR, and on top of that you can mitigate a lot of her ult damage with your pool (plus he does well again 2-3 AP comps cause he itemizes Spirit Visage and Abyssal so easily and early in he game). \n\nThose two champions fall into a category i didnt mention - they are situationally strong. But because they really arent that strong outside of an well organized team, the complaints are rare. People just dont face enough good Varus or Vlad players, and when they do, they dont face them when they are surrounded by a team thats on the same page. In the rare cases that the champion's strengths are showcased in solo queue, the complaints do come in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Romtheguy","date":"2016-10-13T01:57:58.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let us not forget Karma, who was powerful for bloody ages and was buffed at least twice before Lulu got nerfed, which forced Karma to be picked up for a similar niche.\nI'd say that she was in the last category you wrote down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2016-10-12T23:22:09.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:134}}","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-10-13T14:53:58.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny how nobody gave a fuck about Syndra for the past 4 years, until she was picked in the LCS.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-10-13T07:31:58.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont you just hate it when your meme thread starts up a serious discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-10-13T10:47:09.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/le-miiverse-resource/images/b/ba/I_know_right.gif/revision/latest?cb=20160116024439","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"F1eshandB1ood","date":"2016-10-12T23:38:49.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but Alistar","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlntReaper","date":"2016-10-12T22:47:50.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When people say they will main Talon because he looks like an AC char.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2016-10-13T12:15:20.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got dragonblade skin since it's release yeh i only play him for the skin hehe","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-10-12T20:02:56.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember when the juggernauts were broken and were played in the LCS?
