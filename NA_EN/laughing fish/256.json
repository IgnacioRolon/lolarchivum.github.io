GD's sexism.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":29,"body":"Dear GD,\n\nWe all love it here in GD. It is a kind and caring community. But there is a problem that we all would like to pretend doesn&#039;t exist: GD is sexist. This is **proven** by the daily weeb threads that are posted, as well as posters having names that objectify women in a manner most weeb-like. GD needs to either post weeb threads with sexualized pics of Singed and Gragas, or stop weebifying their &quot;waifus&quot;. I know this post is likely to be ignored, but I feel strongly on the subject and could not sit idly by. \n\nThat is all.","replies":[]}
