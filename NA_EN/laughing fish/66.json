But I realized that being an intelligent and independent thinker that I should follow in the footsteps of countless other independent thinkers and choose to see the negative side. Yes this is just a game and I could leave any time I want, but I choose to keep playing to be &quot;ironic&quot;. I dislike league for I am enlightened. I am not like the sheep who plays a video game just because they enjoy it. People like that sicken me.  They are just fools going with the crowd. But I choose to choose to go against the grain and spend my time with those who feel the same. I choose to stand alone against the happiness, and I am not alone in this! Stand with me losers! Stand with me and fight!","replies":[]}
