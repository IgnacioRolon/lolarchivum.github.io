First: He was not good enough at punishing the enemies of Demacia. They are villainous scum who deserve no mercy. Second: He was not good enough at surviving the attacks of said villainous scum. While one should always be willing to give one&#039;s life for the Glory of Demacia, it is far better to make the enemy give *their* life for Demacia instead. \r\n\r\nWell, while subtle, the buffs to judgement are appreciated. I usually like to build a hybrid of tank and damage on Garen, with {{item:3071}} being essential, and {{item:3026}} and {{item:3812}} being preferred in most games unless I fall behind. And the buffs to his passive combined with health regain masteries really give him wonderful levels of sustain. He only needs to recall if he is dead or has too much gold. One can not bully him out of lane anymore!\r\n\r\nBut the biggest and most appreciated buff is definitely the buff to courage. It is one of the most satisfying things in the game when the enemy tosses all their CC at you, but Garen shrugs it off like the righteous badass he is. Plus the counter that shows how much damage was reduced is surprisingly nice. I didn&#039;t think it would matter, but it makes the ability more satisfying to use. \r\n\r\nSo in conclusions, \r\n#DEMACIA!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/W0wVY4c.gif[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2017-07-13T19:11:18.969+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"laughing fish posting outside of memes and games fish out of water i repeat fish out of water!","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-07-13T19:17:55.353+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://m.popkey.co/a51ba1/4QKQX.gif","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2017-07-14T01:23:42.829+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laughing Fish,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XfVHkhEU,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-07-13T19:17:55.353+0000)\n>\n> https://m.popkey.co/a51ba1/4QKQX.gif\n\nThat's me when a fed Garen runs at me.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-07-14T12:41:51.387+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm more like \"How in the world did Garen get fed to begin with?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lyndris","date":"2017-07-14T05:22:14.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel more like\nhttps://i.giphy.com/media/a9xhxAxaqOfQs/giphy.gif","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-07-13T19:34:10.632+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet they're still holding out on the most important buff of all: making his JUSTICE! yell global when he executes the villain.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-07-13T19:54:28.167+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

{{item:3147}} \n\njust think of how lane trades would look like. you walk into a bush to get the passive, look for a short and hard trade with duskblades added damage to your q, then with the stormraider proc speed back into a bush to reactivate duskblades passive. if your enemy follows you to extend the trade, he eats the damage twice.\n\npossibly more depending how you can kite out of vision through the 3 bushes in top lane.\n\nif he doesnt follow you, you look to trade again asap.\n\nand midgame and lategame its pretty much the same. you deal a lot of burst and should be able to proc stormraider reliably on squishies. its a great anti kite tool. something garen cant have enough of.\n\ni remember there was a moment, when i got caught between 3 people a couple month ago. and i ulted the enemy hecarim who was the villain and managed to kill him. with the stormraider surge and my q, i was able to run out so fast, that the other 2 guys lost track of me around corners and i got out of range alive before they could catch up.\n\nreally undervalued keystone.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-16T01:44:51.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is. it's

thunderlords than you can dodge. and the travel time is fixed, so its not going to be faster in melee range.\n\nthey said the current keystones will make it back next season. considering that theyre
