Good example of this are  {{champion:92}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:58}}. \nRenekton is my most played top laner of the three (dont play riven, find her boring, tend to leave lee in jungle) \n\nI have had many first bloods from lvl 1 or 2 playing renekton because its super easy in quite a few match ups. a lot of players expect you to use your fury on an empowerd q so you can bait them into an empowered w insted which destroys the HP especially in the early game, or they dont think you started with your q at lvl 1.\nI pretty much always run, {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}} and grasp of undying on my toplaners. If you give me an early kill (lvl 1-2) i can pretty much gaurentee you can no longer lane effectively. Because by the time you have got back to lane, i have regained a lot of hp and now have 1-2 lvl advantage (depends if they took ignite or tp) and upon your arival back into lane, if you so much aproach the minion wave i am going straight for you. get a free trade with empowered W and empowerd Q  and e back out. your now left with about half hp, on top of being underleveld. Then if i freeze the lane you are screwed.\n\n\nSome champs are just really good at getting fed in lane. but the single best piece of advice i can offer is that if you give away an early kill and cannot lane properly, stop building offensively immediately and build defensisvly. Because if you keep going offensive, its easier and easier for your oppenent to kill you. Because you can pretty much guarantee that if you give the early kill your opponent is more than likely to build some more damage. it sucks more if they are able to utilise {{item:3071}} {{item:3748}} as because they not only do more damage, they become harder to kill.\n\n\nSo please if you die early, for your own sake, pick up {{item:1029}} over another {{item:1036}} and buy your self HP potions and if you can buy a pink ward for your tri bush to give you some tower dive warning","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2016-04-26T07:53:23.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best attempt was a 0/1/0.
