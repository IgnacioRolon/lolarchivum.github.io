and when he kills you he can run away leave you alive and the only thing you can do to it is run into another one of his teammates giving them the kill just to bm him.\nPeople will put down defensive items as ways to counter them but thats not counter play counter play is when you can play around it well enough that you force them to build defensive items for you and the only way to do that is to be someone more broken or unfun to play against than them like Aureloion Sol or  Azir or some
