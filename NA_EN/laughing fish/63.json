Shadow is fine AF, but other skins I think need to some love too. Safecracker cost more, yet adds nothing a doesn't mesh color palette wise with her base. Some ideas could be to make the effects more pure black or gray so it matches with the skin theme and Lasher spears. Just maybe make the Tango skin have some recolored red effects for Tango or some rose petals in her ult. I think Masquerade is over all fine, but maybe tone down the massive hair a little.\n\nWhat do you guys think of the new Eve skins?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Josh de Tonreau","date":"2017-10-02T15:31:16.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pinkaj","date":"2017-09-30T04:57:34.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's BEAUTIFUL\n{{sticker:sg-lux}} \nlol","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheZacStreetBoys","date":"2017-09-28T23:19:56.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOBODY UPVOTE OR DOWNVOTE FROM 69\nPLEASE","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChuShoe","date":"2017-09-28T21:39:56.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**STRETCHING** the truth, as always laughing fish.\n\nI knew something was **fishy ** about you from the moment I started stalking you on the boards!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eternal Torment","date":"2017-09-28T19:31:58.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"( •_•)\n\nGuess you could say\n\n( •_•)>⌐■-■\n\nthis is a very\n\n﻿(⌐■_■)\n\nflexible matter","replies":[]}]}
