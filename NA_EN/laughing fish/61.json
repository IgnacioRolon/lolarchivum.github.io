(Come and get your free skins!)","subforum":"Memes & Games","up_votes":360,"down_votes":21,"body":"#Closed. Thanks for playing! See winners and details in the [pinned comment](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/2RdVoyti-laughing-fishs-200000-lifetime-upvote-spectacular-come-and-get-your-free-skins?comment=01c5) below!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xIOOyEo.png[/img]\n\nIt's a Christmas miracle! Just in time for snowdown I have achieved this monumental achievement! A lot has changed since the last upvote spectacular. I ascended to the rank of Moderator, I reached gold (The snack that smiles back!), and I have been working hard to try and reforge M&amp;G and return it to its former glory. This has required me to change my tactics and philosophies when posting on the boards. The community has changed, and to be a proper ruler I must change with them. There have been bumps and obstacles along the way, but M&amp;G is thriving once again, and I have reclaimed my throne atop it. Truly, it feels good to be King!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/89aiFos.gif[/img]\n\n\nBut, as much as I would like to talk about my own personal glory, the reality is I played but a small role in all this. None of this matters without the community, without the people who come to M&amp;G and support each other. People may complain a lot, and the boards may often be filled with salt. But this really is an incredible community, and I am proud and thankful to be a part of it. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JF4EOlJ.gif[/img]\n\nNow, enough rambling. Onward to the real reason everyone is here: Free skins!\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xSnJcKv.gif[/img]\n\nSo here is how it will work: Since this is Snowdown, everyone must post a funny Christmas related gif or meme. For example:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fyy0wZI.gif[/img]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/i1nrGUR.jpg[/img]\n\nOh, and as always. **Say my name.** This is not a joke, if you do not say my name you are illegible to win.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/G5YGnbu.gif[/img]\n\nAdditional prizes will be unlocked as this thread gains upvotes. Hey, I'm not *completely* selfless here ;)\n\nPrize tiers (each tier includes all previous tier's rewards):\n\n* 1 upvote: Random mystery skin **Unlocked**\n* 50 upvotes: Random mystery skin **Unlocked**\n* 100 upvotes: Choice of any skin worth 1350 RP or less **Unlocked**\n* 150 upvotes: Random mystery skin **Unlocked**\n* 200 upvotes: Random mystery skin **Unlocked**\n* 300 upvotes: Choice of any skin worth 1350 RP or less **Unlocked**\n* 400 upvotes: Random mystery skin\n* 500 upvotes: Choice of any skin worth 1350 or less\n* 600 upvotes: Random mystery skin\n* 700 upvotes: Random mystery skin\n* 1000 upvotes: Choice of any skin worth 1820 or less\n* 1,000,000 upvotes: Every Teemo skin available in the shop\n\n\nContest rules:\n\n* To enter, post a Christmas related gif or meme in the comments below, and make sure to say the name **Laughing Fish**\n* Only one entry per person will be counted.\n* Winners will be selected at random. Each poster is only eligible to win a single prize.\n* Open to NA only (sorry EUW folks, but I only have an NA account)\n* Contest ends **Saturday, December 16, at 3:00pm EST**\n* Upvotes will be counted using BEK, so it will be the gross number of upvotes NOT the net (so downvoting has zero effect). \n\n\nFor help posting images or gifs, please check out the following guide:\n\n* [Posting Images and Gifs on the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/esjzN2Q1-posting-images-and-gifs-on-the-boards)\n\nHappy Snowdown to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-12-17T02:20:45.592+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"#With a total of 361 upvotes, 6 prizes were unlocked.
