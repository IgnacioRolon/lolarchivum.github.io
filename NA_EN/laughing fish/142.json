While it's not ungodly, it's still a good 50+ damage to make sure you really, really kill'em.\n\nI dunno about the rest since normally I'd say the Thunderlord's decree for the bursters, but 10% of your AP and a crap base every 30s compared to Deathfire? Ehhh... Galio does well with the 4% reduction though since he'll have 8% in teamfights when pressing R.

If your a burst mage this is a great keystone. If your an immobile mage then stormraider might be better.  The big difference between luden's echo and thunderlord is echo can be charged and help with poke. while thunderlord is part of the burst damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-13T03:22:08.101+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sreggad,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=cKnWtFIj,comment-id=000200020000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-13T02:58:28.654+0000)\n>\n> seeing as it can proc off of AA and spells 10 seconds is why too short seeing as it is 10 per level + the bonus AD and AP ratio. people complain it's \"not very good\" but really it's arguably a better luden's echo passive.

I guess it's comparable to Luden's after level 10, but unlike Luden's it won't help you farm and it requires 3 consecutive hits on top of it only have the 10% ratio. It's pretty bad. Most immobile mages though wouldn't do better with Stormraider since they only need to get in range for their burst, after the burst, they don't need MS anymore. For a melee assassin like Akali, sure Stormraider's might be decent so you can get around, but immobile mages like Annie? They've either got heavy DoT's or heavy AoE and Thunderlord works better with the AoE while Deathfire works better for DoT's.","replies":[{"poster":"sreggad","date":"2015-11-13T04:20:22.402+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damage wise at level 10 it's the same damage and after that it's better damage. it's \"arguably\" better than the luden's echo passive because it's there the whole game. and will hit all units in the AoE instead of just 4. Now can one argue the point luden's echo's passive is better, yes...  That's why I stated it's arguably better. \n\nNow if you read what I said... I stated \"If your an immobile mage then stormraider might be better.\" this is assuming your going 18 in cunning not 18 in ferocity. The reasoning is if the burst doesn't kill the enemy it gives you a chance to get out of there. so if your laning against a champion that you can't just burst to death and the extra dps from thunderlord won't change it. you might take stormraider so you can drop your burst and get away till your spells are off cooldown.\n\nI didn't say anything about DFT because it's in a separate tree. so really no reason to bring it up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Specter027","date":"2015-11-13T12:04:32.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}}  I've been going Cunning Keystone on Ahri, either the Thunderlord or the Move Speed one.\n\n{{champion:3}} This fellow is interesting in that he can be built tanky or damag(y).
