She originally refused to get married, which hopefully Demacians aren't marrying kids, so she'd be about 18 or so. Then there was the trail of her father, their duel, and his defeat. That should have taken about a year or so. After that, she became the head of the family, and in the years that followed, fought other people who disgraced her family name. To date, she's killed at least 30 people, which must be spread over a few years, since killing people normally keeps people from wagging their tongues for a while. 40 seems a bit old, but I could see late 20's to early 30's.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-07-21T19:19:09.019+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mhm that would make sense.
