If your jungle pushes your lane when you, and the enemy just got out of lane, that is good. that means although you lose xp, the enemy laner does too, and this not only puts enemy a little behind, but actually helps your jungler get exp and catch up in levels (because the jungle is more unviable then the left sock you left in your shelf for the past 2 years due to the exp nerfs)\n\nMemes &amp; Games\n\nYou diva","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2019-04-19T17:21:05.454+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sometimes the laner is just being toxic and blaming the jungler for their own failures.\n\nBut sometimes, junglers really do be like that.

It also makes the enemy team lose gold and exp considering the guy on the other team is dead.

Sure there are some bad junglers, but our entire job is to deal with 3 lanes and baby sit them all, while baby sitting all four quadrants of jungle, dragon pit, and herald pit.

Weak top lane = your team has no front line, better hope your bot lane picked something like a Galio/Thresh/Alistair and that said bot lane won their lane.","replies":[]}]}]}
