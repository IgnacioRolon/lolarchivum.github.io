Actors that play strong men have well defined muscles. This is because they purposely tear their muscles and let them heal, which increases bulk at the cost of efficiency. Actual strong men keep their muscles healthy and lean, which makes them look smoother. This confuses people into thinking it is fat, as fat is also smooth.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-08-04T21:11:55.405+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not entirely.\n\nThe whole process of tearing and healing muscle is involved in *every* facet of strength training (whether for aesthetic bulk or actual power) because your muscles do not grow unless your body tells your brain \"we aren't strong enough for the tasks you're making us do, divert more resources to making us bigger as we heal.\" Lack of definition doesn't come from not tearing down muscles, it comes from not going on a super fat burning diet right before a bodybuilder competition. In fact, most bodybuilders look an awful lot like that strongman in your OP when they are \"bulking\" (trying to add muscle mass to compensate for the mass lost when getting ready for a competition) and only look like the quintessential bodybuilder most people think of when they're \"trimming\" (basically dieting and doing super focused workouts that target very small independent muscles to improve definition).\n\nThe strongman that you shared a picture of does in fact have a lot of body fat which is why he does not have the same definition as a bodybuilder, but if he tried to diet away some of that body fat, he'd inherently atrophy away some of his muscle mass as well, for no gain outside visual appeal, which is why he and other strongmen don't try to look thin. They have healthy levels of body fat for adult men.\n\nThe difference between definition and lack of definition in these guys is also directly related to *how* they exercise. Strongmen exercise using general strength building workouts that focus on making them stronger as a whole, where bodybuilders use specialized workouts and machines that allow them to bulk up certain muscles that a normal human will hardly ever use on a day to day basis, which makes them and the muscles around them more defined.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-08-04T17:57:25.404+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"This:","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-08-05T06:04:21.745+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know a family of strongmen personally.\n\nThe people are fucking terrifying yet surprisingly nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-08-05T06:29:11.539+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because they don't have any inadequacy issues LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2015-08-04T23:31:04.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet Zombie Jesus!","replies":[]},{"poster":"XenonZaleo","date":"2015-08-05T12:17:10.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This sort of picture only works if there's a common individual amongst all of them.

Even in movies depicting hunky beefsteaks (Thor, Troy, 300, Wolverine) they don't have the kind of body tone you've come to expect based on Bowflex commercials.
