{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-09-16T15:38:57.983+0000","title":"In support of Teemo, the swift scout","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"Teemo may be an evil, sadistic, unrepentant killer. But every story needs a villain to test our heroes, to show what they are made of. Would Garen&#039;s light seem as bright if it wasn&#039;t for Teemo&#039;s darkness? Would Soraka seem as merciful if Teemo didn&#039;t show us what hate looked like? We should not hate Teemo, but rather thank him. Without a villain, there are no heroes. So in appreciation for all Teemo does to make our favorite champs look great, I bring this fine selection of Teemo fan art. \n\nhttp://am.leagueoflegends.com/image?f=http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/articles/2015/june_2015/BOET/FanArt2Teemo_thumb.jpg\n\nhttp://img01.deviantart.net/1a7f/i/2013/093/c/2/teemo___that_s_gotta_sting_by_amci12-d60dj5u.jpg\n\nhttp://pre12.deviantart.net/3a7c/th/pre/i/2010/196/5/2/evil_teemo_by_clintosthegreat.jpg\n\nhttp://pre02.deviantart.net/2a05/th/pre/f/2013/260/a/c/evil_teemo_is_evil_by_fimbulknight-d6mndei.jpg\n\nhttp://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/5600296_700b.jpg\n\nhttp://img14.deviantart.net/9d60/i/2012/099/5/0/badass_teemo_by_fabykun-d4vn0or.png\n\nhttp://orig04.deviantart.net/f4b2/f/2015/268/4/4/teeto2_by_vartius-d9av9yg.png\n\nhttp://67.media.tumblr.com/a7067a015a0e3224cf5d254d48536c30/tumblr_npvywxf3ON1syf8nwo1_1280.jpg\n\nhttp://img02.deviantart.net/7c64/i/2015/136/8/2/omega_squad_teemo_by_ichimoral-d8tmmyc.jpg\n\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IlcrH2YFrwk/VDIpC7CMlbI/AAAAAAAAAek/sHl3ucfRifo/s1600/InfernalTeemo.jpg\n\nhttp://img08.deviantart.net/d786/i/2014/109/d/7/battlecast_teemo_by_viking_heart-d7f4uqc.jpg\n\nhttp://img05.deviantart.net/711f/i/2013/065/b/4/rebel_fighter_teemo_by_uriak-d5x4pqu.png\n\nhttp://pa1.narvii.com/5812/49969d63337a6388707e601044b80552ef3ae5d1_hq.gif\n\nhttp://st.elohell.net/public/chill/43db32dcce763bd69f8c86fa15dffaec.jpg\n\nhttps://ukailshamsherlock.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/sherlock-bbc-moriarty-quotes-5114.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2016-09-16T20:27:55.265+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP sleep","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-09-16T20:49:43.789+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/dnkTkZs.jpg?noredirect","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hoes and bows","date":"2016-09-16T16:00:30.265+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://m.popkey.co/5e8342/xYzvr.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-09-16T17:46:26.937+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/Qmt4gXP40kmeA/giphy.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PopePancake","date":"2016-09-16T17:40:42.631+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo? a villain? please\n\nTHIS is a REAL villain \nhttp://i.imgur.com/gmpDNKe.png","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-09-16T17:44:29.525+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar has nothing on this\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/yFITIolMdd25q/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schoenberg","date":"2016-09-16T21:45:49.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PopePancake,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=qNEjPxky,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-09-16T17:40:42.631+0000)\n>\n> Teemo? a villain? please\n> \n> THIS is a REAL villain \n> http://i.imgur.com/gmpDNKe.png\n\n{{champion:44}} Is it not a crime to be this fabulous?","replies":[{"poster":"Zarvanis","date":"2016-09-17T01:53:01.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about fabulous AND evil?\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/l2SpRQAdB9FDiBesE/giphy.gif?noredirect","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SSJTribe","date":"2016-09-16T16:48:37.027+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://mrbrokoli.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/teemo_splash_0.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-09-16T17:46:51.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.makeagif.com/media/3-29-2016/lM_J9X.gif","replies":[{"poster":"aspects1","date":"2016-09-17T05:36:32.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what have you done???","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zarvanis","date":"2016-09-17T01:55:30.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/2eEwnIBilB82Y/giphy.gif?noredirect","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2016-09-16T22:36:13.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually forgot this. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VaSMYVE.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Odin","date":"2016-09-17T03:07:55.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add my own personal creation to the lot\n\nTimo's **TRUE**form\n\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/fc45b75b01804a4eb1fd5203a2e6a8d9.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Castman","date":"2016-09-16T20:49:17.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dying from anything is easier than dying to {{champion:17}}.
