It's traditionally a Japanese Bamboo flute with 5 holes on it - one in the back for the thumb, and 4 in the front for tones. It is most commonly tuned to D minor, as well.\n\nThe name \"shakuhachi\" literally means \"1.8 shaku\", where \"shaku\" is an archaic unit of measurement equal to 1 ft, and \"hachi\" means \"eight\".\n\nTypically, a shakuhachi is made from bamboo, but can also be made from synthetic materials, such as PVC pipe or plastic, which are much cheaper alternatives. It can also be made from regular wood, which is more expensive than the synthetic materials but not as expensive as bamboo.\n\n - Prices for PVC/plastic shakuhachis are usually <$100 USD\n - Prices for wooden shakuhachis usually range from $100 to $300 USD\n - Prices for bamboo shakuhachis can be upwards of $300 for a new or used flute, and on occasion can be around $10,000 - $15,000 USD for an extremely old, possibly 15th century, bamboo flute.\n\nThe shakuhachi is a relatively simple instrument by looks, but the amount of extreme fine detail can make it or break it.\nThe shakuhachi has a small \"lip\" on it, where the player is intended to blow onto the sharp edge of the lip, splitting the air much like blowing into a bottle. Lifting your fingers off of the holes in the shakuhachi changes where the air escapes, effectively altering the note.\nAlbeit, it can be compared to a recorder, but it is *much* more difficult to play, and is arguably one of the hardest instruments in the world to play on even a basic understanding.\n\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7s-wXZWT5o) is a great example of shakuhachi playing, as it features one of the best shakuhachi players in the world.\n\n(source, am a Yasuo main and shakuhachi player)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-06-08T07:39:53.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://66.media.tumblr.com/85e902e2b102b072313dc4a18e9bd91e/tumblr_inline_nzup6h2OYa1t0932s_500.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"AWyldSylveon","date":"2016-06-07T22:42:41.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boy I hope it's the Star Wars Cantina theme.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2016-06-07T13:52:13.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-06-07T09:32:07.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The real question is, what is cutpurse {{champion:4}} and cutthroat{{champion:104}} doing in Ionia?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-06-07T08:06:51.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Eso1JcXp0","replies":[]},{"poster":"Qiy4na","date":"2016-06-06T22:41:21.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so thats why everyone hates him and complains{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CannonLordFreed","date":"2016-06-06T22:20:41.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't fix everything with sad flute music!","replies":[]}]}
