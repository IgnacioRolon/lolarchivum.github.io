Maybe it was because I had a deep anger and sadness that had been festering in my soul for years, or maybe I just did it for the thrill of eating the forbidden fruit. I don&rsquo;t know why I decided to shitpost, but I suppose in the end that doesn&rsquo;t really matter. We all have our reasons, our petty little justifications on *why* we shitpost. The only fact that really matters is that I did it. \r\n\r\nI know this may be shocking to you folks. I am aware that you all hold me in high esteem, and have grown use to the raw creative genius and original content I regularly produce. But I felt for this reason I had to tell you of my shitposting past. I want everyone out there to know that shitposts can happen to anyone. It isn&rsquo;t just trolls or kids, even the greatest of us can be seduced by the lure of shitposting. \r\n\r\nAnd to anyone who is currently in the process of shitposting, know that you are not alone. There are those out there who know your pain. We know the thrill. We know the shit. You *can* stop. You may not want to, and you may think your life would be empty without shitposts. But trust me, as someone who has only ever spoken the truth to you before.\r\n\r\n######I believe in you.","replies":[]}
