And Riot has balanced the game several times and I feel some of the best parts of Season 4 and 5 were very balanced. The only problem is the game would not be as fun if everything was balanced. You have to admit you like it when your  main gets buffed or your biggest counter gets a nerf. Patch notes that make the game unbalanced  are apart of the game. It makes the game different every time making for changes in play style and keeps you working to get good at what is currently that patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Ayame Isaki","date":"2016-03-24T17:06:03.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not always.\n\n31/12/13 Eve Jungle, 4.8 CS/Min, 26K (I was popping elixirs like candy near the end just to push that last little bit of performance out of Evelynn; swapping between Iron and Sorcery depending on what I needed to do next). S+ rank. Still lost.\n\nThe start of our problems was that our top (who was really chill and truly trying his best, so I couldn't get mad at him) fed the hell out of Teemo early; this caused issues with mushrooms in the mid game as well as Teemo nuking the rest of my team; he would run anytime I showed up (managed to get him once or twice in the early game). Shen didn't really recover until we were too deep in the hole tower wise to get out of it. Like I said, he tried his damnedest and I appreciated it.\n\nThe other big mitigating factor was because Teemo was so far ahead early, three of us ran sweepers and thus our vision suffered. At one point I swapped jungle items just to ward Baron and then backing to get my blue smite back.\n\nIt got to the point where even though we were ahead in kills overall, it didn't matter as Teemo shrooms kept us from taking towers efficiently. Also, my team was so afraid of Teemo that they wouldn't risk towers without minion waves. I did a few times (sweeper OP), but Eve isn't exactly great at tower killing and had to run before doing anything significant.\n\nIn spite of all this, it was one of the most intense and fun matches I have played this season. Shen was awesome attitude wise. No one got mad when the one surrender vote that was posed failed; we accepted that we would play it to the end and everyone put in a solid effort to win.\n\nTL;DR: It doesn't matter how hard you carry as a jungler, if the enemy Teemo is fed you are in for a world of pain.\n\n{{item:3751}} {{champion:17}} {{item:3751}} \n\n...makes...\n\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:28}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"NaturesMayhem","date":"2016-03-24T21:43:09.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well in my book you did not carry enough.
