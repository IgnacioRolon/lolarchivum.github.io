There is a high chance of either feeding the opponent further or not achieving much at all, which costs you a lot of time.\nUsually the safest way is keeping away, and get kills on another lane, in hopes of turning things around during midgame. I think it's a process most Junglers go through - at least I did, and I wasn't playing support as often at that time.\nIt has a lot to do with understanding what Jungle is actually about. First you get this impression of \"I have to gank and help all the time, because thats a Junglers job\" , but in truth the initial reason to jungle was/is to make the most of exp/gold offered on the map.
