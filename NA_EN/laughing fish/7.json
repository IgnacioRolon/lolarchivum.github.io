Yes, its because they want to see more fighting, but no, because it leads to more fighting, but poor fighting. It stops being a game of direct skill and good interactions between players, and interactions between that of the players onto the map. Fighting for vision ends up being a struggle for most players who can't pick or contain a specific control type jungler. Nunu, ironically, being useless as he is now, is a perfect example of this. When nunu is strong, no one can have fun, because control junglers force your team to learn everything about your opponents jungle just to farm your own, and once you get the upper hand as a control jungler, the game ends. There is no coming back from a control jungler who outfarms, re-targets their team, and zones the opponent into submission. Its like the current meta with the leads in lane. If the jungler who is playing a control jungler, well, controls the jungle, the match ends. Rarely will a comeback occur, and usually from a responding control jungler. It ends with fights being a snooze-fest of wards and skirmishes between junglers desperately clambering against one another to get a lane to help them win the fight, and then continue to farm their opponent into submission. Yi is another perfect example. He's a farm/control jungler that wants to just purely deal damage and act as a monster if he gets fed, nearly one shotting carries at lightning fast speeds while tearing through tanks, or rek'sai, who goes from a bruiser early to a near unstoppable tank farm-n-gank machine after a single kill lead.\n\nWhat i'm trying to get at here is, yes, it is and can be a viable and interesting strategy, but its a dominant strategy. Its not a gamble persay, but if by chance you get ahead, you therefore win the rest of the jungle. Riot currently favors gank junglers with more map pressure in favor of control because when control becomes common, games either drag on forever or end in an instant. Think about it from a design state. Would you rather the ability for the jungler to possibly help carry the game by playing the map effectively through teamwork, or just starve a single player or multiple players from gold and experience until the deficiet is so large there's no point in attempting to come back? You'd rather have broken lane mechanics and dominant action than pitiful starvation.\n\nIn total, TL;DR, Control becomes a snooze-fest stomp that makes one jungler feels all-powerful, and the other jungler a Soviet Union member. Meta decides it favors ganks for more action and comeback chances","replies":[{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2017-12-20T15:08:24.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I can see your point here.  It becomes so oppressive when successful that it makes the \"fighting\" jungler feel like they can't fight.  So it's just a matter of time until they just feel useless.\n\nI just feel like this line of thinking has some gaps that don't make sense to me.\n\n#1 - I am a huge fan of very clean games and teams knowing exactly how much they can take off a game without having to risk a fight and being patient.  So I actually really enjoy games where it goes on for like 34 minutes, but the kill score at the end in a pro match is like 8-2 total.  I just think I'm not the only out there who enjoys playing and watching that kind of match, the variety is nice when you can have a control or poke style just muscle their way through objectives one game, then the next game you see tower dives pre 6 and followed by multiple skirmishes and team fights.  (If you look back across like the middle 1/3 of the seasons we've seen so far, there have been times where the meta supports both styles in a healthy way in the pro scene if not solo  q)\n\n#2 - If the control jungle is spending all his time in jungle keeping the other guy down, doesn't this open the game up for fighting in lane?  I mean my thought process is that if the enemy team picks Nunu or just any time control jungling is meta, then you counterpick your lane or pick a lane bully in general and snowball through lane as fast or faster than Nunu is choking out your jungler. (This should be even easier now with the current state of the game) Jungle might be a snooze fest in terms of fighting, but the lanes should be very trade heavy so I'd think it evens out.\n\n#3 - I'm just wondering if the community is going to draw the line at some point.  I understand that Riot is a business and needs to appeal to their clientele, I understand that the majority of their clientele are more casual players, and I understand that casual players and fans of pro games like to see fighting.  I get all that, but I mean we can't just keep saying \"we want more fighting, and we want it earlier\".  I mean if we keep going down that path the champion pool just gets tighter and tighter, games get shorter and shorter, and it becomes unrecognizable.  \n\nThink about the time period where the LOL pro scene was first establishing a very strong presence.  The game was  chess match, not just in champ select, but in the game itself.  You had to earn your win from minute 1 until the nexus dies.  Right now comebacks basically just happen through taking advantage of pretty glaring errors the ahead team makes, usually through a fight or a monumental macro error (which is obviously even rarer).  All of the agency lies with the team who has early pressure.  Even control style jungling had windows because while it is extremely oppressive, if you let up pressure for a second it provides a large window.  You let the enemy jungler take one buff after you had stolen 3 in a row, all of a sudden your 2 level lead is only a 1 level lead.  You let pressure off, they have a very clear and obvious path to regaining  foothold that doesn't involve then enemy team getting cocky and chain feeding.  In order to keep the game dynamic, multiple styles need to be viable, and every style has to have roughly similar sized \"%%%%%s in their armor\" or windows to exploit.  People keep saying \"The game and meta is constantly evolving, you just have to adapt\".  Is it evolving?  I feel more like it is devolving at this point.  League in a nutshell right now is: USE EARLY PRESSURE TO GET A LEAD, USE YOUR LEAD TO FORCE AND WIN FIGHTS.  That's it, that's all.  The art of turtling is lost, split pushing has become a snowball mechanic used to generate kill pressure, people don't even think about things like \"do we have enough wave clear\".  It's all watered down.  Individual mechanics are being heavily valued over patience and cunning.  The high emphasis on aggression is fun and exciting at first, but when you've been playing since TPA won worlds and you consider yourself a student of the game like I do, innovation and variety are much more intriguing.","replies":[{"poster":"General Theritt","date":"2017-12-21T01:45:47.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I respect that my good sir. I too, would enjoy seeing some longer games. Realistically, and what I hope is real, is that CC tanks are slowly coming back into the scene, but not in ways they should. Leona and blitzcrank dominate because they can snowball leads for their allies, and certain tanks like ornn are terrifying in lane. We need to somehow tone down the tanks in terms of pure early utility somehow, but reward them later on for sticking their ground and becoming beefy and nightmarish to fight. The problem is, when you do that, stupidity like the control meta of early power occurs. Champions like {{champion:126}} become meta picks, and toplaners suffer if they cannot somehow survive the hellish earlygames. Of course, it would value patience, but its more, and I think this is actually a really big aspect: Armor and magic penetration exist. It sounds stupid, I know, but its why when we get long metas, everyone groans because earlygame picks become necessary to prevent the long match from being long enough for it to pay off. {{champion:33}} is like the king example of how tanks are almost being forced to be early strength powerhouses to compete. As long as he can force the ADC to legit kill themselves on him, then he wins. When lethality comes in, that's when things become a problem. If a tank like ramus can't endure too many hits, his opponent gets a lead, gets lethality or magic pen, and suddenly all stats Rammus has been rushing evaporate. Its not fun.\n\nNow you take this to the jungle, where it becomes this fiasco. To tackle the lane idea, where jungle vs jungle means more lane, its ironic, because then its not control jungling. In almost all league history, control jungling is done by a lane managing to get a strong enough push that they can back their jungler into enemy territory, set up vision, and well, death ensues for the poor bloke that hops into ward range. the problem with the idea that the trade should take longer is a myth. While champions like Jayce, LB, Syndra, Blitz, Kalista, and Lucian exist, trades mean nothing because some characters are so entirely dominant that they win jungle control by threatening the lane with walking alone. While powers like Lethality and massive lane advantages exist, so too will the problem of control jungling, with it being too rewarding for the opponent.\n\nStrategy wise, like you said, I LOVE control types of fighting sometimes. It interesting to see positioning, catchouts, and punishes from either side. But that's the problem. Yes, it becomes team play, but its also entirely solo play. The carry gets caught out? the match ends. The sheer number advantage nowadays is a problem. Remember, snowball is a big factor, meaning as the game currently stands, there has to be a way to reward champions that take longer times to pull off, but can endure the insane BS that some early games champs have.\n\nI guess nowadays Riot focuses around the LCS style of play, where it bases on the whole game from pro to soloq high tier for similar picks, rather than innovation. Hell, when I saw midlane Kayn played by EU, I was ecstatic. They showed it could still be done, but we have to wait for Riot to decide when they want to properly reward tanks for being tanks, hyper-carries to wait patiently, and not making early champs destroy face by moving their feet ina direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2017-12-21T06:11:07.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So here's my solution:\n\n1) Give everyone back the base HP and armor/MR they had under last season's rune system, making all champions slightly more survivable in the early game.  The new runes have put more damage in the game, so assassins and lane bullies like Jayce should still be viable, it will just be slightly harder to get the lead or chain kills into more kills.\n\n2) Nerf tanks damage to champions in the early game, but not to minions.  Give tanks %hp damage with very low ap/ad ratios so they have shit damage early and scale more into late game, or just shave a few points of their base damages for level 1-2 and put it onto levels 4-5 of the skill.  Options like that should allow tanks to survive and neutralize lane without being too strong early.  Between these first two changes you can see how a tank becomes a damage sponge earlier on, but he won't be able to abuse it cuz he won't really be able to do enough damage in early levels to kill anything.  Most just a wave clearing CC bot.  So if a team want's to utilize a tank in the early game they have to use him for want he designed for, CC and engage.  Gank for him, set up TP plays for him, ask for him to roam to objectives.  This is how you would play the tank because with their low damage chances of them winning the lane outright is slim unless they are playing into another tank.\n\n3) Maintain the removal of catch up XP from the jungle, putting that only on the buffs was a good idea to help alleviate some of the strangulation style if you are getting choked out the jungle, and it also makes it more intentional so a jungler can't catch up purely through hard farm if the opponent eases up off counter jungling in favor of ganking.  What DOES need to be put back in is catch up XP from kills.  This makes perfect sense because it slows the snowball slightly, but ONLY if the team that is ahead makes a mistake OR if the team that is behind makes a play above the level they had been playing at previously.  Making a mistake when the ball is in your court should be punished heavily, and making a good play when the odds are against you should be heavily rewarded.\n\nHere is the point of all this:\nWE NEED TO HAVE SPACE WITHIN A SINGLE GAME TO IMPROVE AND ADAPT OUR GAMEPLAY\n\nRight now you go into a game and are under pressure to play perfectly from the get go unless your team bails you out.
