For 10 minutes he flamed me non-stop for that, I was getting super annoyed and was done trying to tell him how i know my champ better than he does.  \n\nThen me and him got caught out, he wind walled their engage, I flashed behind them and ulted he ulted off of that getting 4 of them, I Q'd them, he Q'd them, I shielded him and Exhausted their Vayne. He got a Quadra and the Zac got away after we popped his passive during the fight but couldnt focus him.  \n\nAfter that he said \"Gj with that ult Q and thanks for the shield man\" and i said \"kick ass timing on that windwall and great follow up\". We honored each other.
