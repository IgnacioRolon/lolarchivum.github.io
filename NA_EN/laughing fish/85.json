Because of the nature of \"If you're in my very limited range, you die\" kit, he's a natural lane bully to other melees. Thing is: Kiting and minimal damage outside of melee range are very real weaknesses, and a tank can't always be there to patch it up for you. Just ask Jayce and Kayle how much they worry about a Darius -- especially in the laning phase. Oh, you want a melee that beats him? Yorick and Mantheon, with Jax going even with him. \n\nA weakness is always a weakness, even if it isn't always a bleeding ulcer a la Spain to Napoleon. For every tank that can enable that Darius, there's someone that can disengage and make the tank's efforts futile and further prevent harm from being done by Darius. He really isn't broken. He's a lane bully and he's damn good at what he does - why is that apparently not allowed to exist in this game and called broken almost every time it shows up?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-03-30T21:02:01.780+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was with 3 friends in a normal game.
