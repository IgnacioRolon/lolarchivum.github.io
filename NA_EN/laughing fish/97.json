All you need to do is play your best champion to win. I was stuck in silver for 3 seasons until I otp Lissandra, my favorite champion. It took a while for me to start doing good with her but when I finally did I got to G3, then the next season I got to G5 in 100 games and P5 under 250 with just Lissandra. She was not meta until after I got to P5 and by then I was stuck in real elo hell so it didn't matter. Just spam your best champion and keep trying to get better than your opponent and it won't really matter until P5.","replies":[{"poster":"Joseraph","date":"2017-06-07T23:45:53.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trundle being or not being meta isn't my issue though.

Lissandra has a lot of counters mid, I just eventually learned how to play against them and still win. It is going to take time but you can outplay your counters. That is why there are otp in challengers on off meta champions, they just learn their champion so well they can just brute force push though facing their counter and come out on top more often than not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2017-06-06T06:00:45.526+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"ahah!
