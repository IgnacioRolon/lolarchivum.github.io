By a lot.\n\nI swear does anyone ever do research on these things?\n\n-Goku is literally the trope of a MC who can constantly break limits get stronger via the magic of some McGuffin that gets popped outta nowhere, or just plain grants him an advantage.\n\n*Defeated Vegeta with Kaioken, Spirit Bomb and friends and his son's help.\n\n*Curb stomps the Ginyu force members even though some had used 'dirty tricks' and even Vegeta got devastated by some of them too.\n\n*Defeats Frieza via going Super Saiyan.\n\n*Cell Defeated since he pretty much passed the Mcguffin to Gohan(Super Saiyan 2).\n\n*Decimates a number of movie villians with Spirit bomb, powered up Kamehameha, etc. and a good one being the Super android 13 one, 'Absorbing a Spirit bomb to basically pull off a Spirit Super Saiyan shockwave move.'\n\nDoesnt even stop there with Super Saiyan 3, Fusion Dance with Vegeta, Fusion Earrings with Vegeta, going Super Saiyan 4 in GT, going 'Saiyan God mode' against Beerus and then suddenly becoming a god tier and then doing it again with 'Super Saiyan God' in the Freiza rematch.\n\nWhile Superman is the trope of a Character being omnipotent but actually doesn't use every bit of his own power he has whether he hasn't hit the potential level yet or he's mentally blocking the limits to not do what Goku might as well do on a daily basis, namely unleash massive overkill attacks to decimate his foes.\n\nPlus you have the typical trope of if both of them were put under the same proper conditions that aren't either 'back ground characters are braindead or insignificant in any way what so ever or less its important to a plot, they either have the love or hate without reason for a hero character.' Then plenty of shit might ensue like how many charges, fines and what not could be put into place for causing damages, disasters or similar things for recklessness, destruction and so on caused even when they 'aren't' in the middle of fighting some 'trope villain that either wants to take over the world or destroy it.\"\n\n\nAs for the Argument that Batman beats Goku because Batman beats Superman and Superman beats Goku. It can only work since the following things would have to occur.\n\n-Batman would use ingenuity instead of just having a fist fight with Goku without using any kind of special devices, items or any means he normally employs against all his 'powerful and dangerous foes he goes against.\n\n-Goku follows the trope of being a powerful 'fighter', but is quite the silly battle maniac idiot. Take away Goku's Saiyan powers and all the ki blasts, flying and all the other gags which a standard manga or anime tends to bring into the pace usually to cover up a character itself. Goku would be the equivalency to a simple fight loving person who pretty much would have to do manual labor to earn a living. That pretty much would make it relatively easy for Batman to take advantage of his 'simple nature' to over'come the power gap which is normally does via tactical abilities.\n\n-Unless Goku magically became immune to all viruses and sicknesses after nearly being killed by Dr. Gero using a heart disease virus (which in the Future trunks timeline, he actually dies to it and its only due to Future Trunks providing medicine by going into the past to save him that happens), especially after becoming a God tier being. Then Goku should technically still still be weak to biological attacks, which Batman is not the type to shy away from using items like Scarecrow's Fear gas if it becomes necessary or similar measures.\n\n-Lets not even forget that Bruce Wayne is a extremely influential person with his WayneTec company and as Batman, would be quite good at researching his 'foes' and can even go as far to look into possible weaknesses or elements of them he could exploit to 'level the playing field'. Since the DC universe is not exactly a stranger to dealing with magic, otherworldly things and other kinds of energy and technology, it wouldn't be that hard for Batman to pull a McGuffin such as a possible weakness/problems that Saiyan biology could have naturally.\n\nSo in the end: Goku could easily destroy Batman in a unprepared fight, but he's the kind to prefer to hold back for a challenge of a fight and could easily have his own leg shoved down his throat by letting 'Batman get some time to prepare(technically that was pulled when Goku could of taken down Cell easily but just like Vegeta letting Cell get to his Perfect Form, Goku rather op for his opponent to get a proper fight then ending a monstrosity early on.\n                          So likely Goku would get a dose of a powerful virus before or 'when' the fight starts, leaving him in a impaired state, letting Batman able to take him down, just like how Batman takes down Superman via the use of Kryptonite to either win the match or weaken Superman enough to where Batman has a chance in a powered Mech suit or similar equipment to let him hit hard enough against a weakened, but still powerful Superman.","replies":[{"poster":"Lordllo","date":"2016-08-03T05:19:59.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like saying NERD!!!, and walking away but i actually understand this...","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2016-08-02T23:40:02.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They explained in the show that when a saiyan takes damage, their body evolves and recovers stronger.
