The Seahawks often threw on redzone plays with great success, and the Patriots tended to be quite poor at actually stopping redzone passes. Malcom Butler (Patriots player that made the interception) had been very bad at stopping similar plays (failing in practice to stop that exact play several times), but before the Superbowl he drastically changed how he handled redzone passes, ignoring the opposing player and focusing completely on the football. Evidently it worked.\n\n If the pass had worked, people would have been talking about how Bulter just ignored the other players and let them score. Both teams made it to the Superbowl by being aggressive and taking risks. The Patriot's risks just paid off slightly more than the Seahawk's risks.","replies":[{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2015-07-20T18:26:14.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for enlightening me.
