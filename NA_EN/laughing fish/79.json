I was in a Normal game a while ago, and apparently our Blitzcrank support took ONE minion.  That was when the ADC Tristana went insane.  I've seen people get mad, but this was on a whole new level.  She was rage incarnate and it was a mix of confusing and terrifying and pathetic.  Mostly pathetic though.  I knew I should have stayed out of things, but the Blitz had been really friendly and funny in Champion Select, so I told the Trist to \"Calm down, it's just a game.\"  Oops.  She did lay off Blitz for a while, but only because I was her new target.  I was mid and just ignored her raging chat-spam, but then pointed out that by her sitting in base raging at us, she was missing more CS than the one that the Blitz had taken.  She went back to farming, but still kept insulting everyone whenever there was a lull in combat.  \n\nI know I could have muted her, but there was no point.  She was being an idiot and some of the things she said were so stupid and so needlessly angry that it was almost funny.  Almost.  Throughout the entire game I was thinking there are really people this stupid in the world...  \nhttp://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1tq0l7b3l1qieybw.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Bark Wahlberg","date":"2015-04-03T03:54:17.849+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I AM THE ONE...

I don't remember much about it, but the enemy mid-laner (think it was an Ahri) repeatedly told everyone where her team's jungler (Cho'Gath) was, and when he was at low hp.  The reason?  Cho didn't give her the second blue buff, because he said he needed it and she had already died to our mid a few times.  She sat in her base and just gave his location and insulted everyone all game.  To my team's credit, we ignored her even though she was giving away his actual position.  Cho seemed like a pretty decent guy, and I felt bad for him.  At first asked her really nicely to stop, then ignored her and started joking around with us in chat.  Everyone agreed to report Ahri, and we tried to make it as fun a game as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"AFK Push","date":"2015-04-04T03:09:52.479+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"One time I was playing udyr jungle, and there was this lux support who insisted on taking my first blue.
