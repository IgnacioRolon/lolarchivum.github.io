I get that you might not enjoy certain Boards users or topics, but if you don't like someone, do not join their discussion intentionally to be a jerk to them. There is actually an option for hiding boards and/or specific users from your page, please use it if you like, but if you don't do not seek people out to treat like this; [Boards Enhancement Kit (BEK)](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/U8uw8k1l-boards-enhancement-kit)\n\nHowever, I have to note that BEK does not allow blocking of Boards moderators, such as Laughing Fish. You can hide the M&G board though, but otherwise I recommend just not clicking on his threads.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Black Croc","date":"2017-12-07T02:14:24.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":21,"body":"Was just saying my opinion that I hate the guy.

If someone want's to post nothing but memes they got the right. (that's why we have a meme's & games section) \n\nseriously if it bothers you just pay attention to the names and simply avoid the posts. also want to see what board section the post comes from as that would give you an idea as to what the post is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vei","date":"2017-12-06T18:58:59.710+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw1k20DpHfA","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-12-06T20:09:54.165+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keemstar is Sanic confirmed?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Mwf8HUK.gif[/img]","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2017-12-06T21:16:50.015+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":8,"body":"Dude, have you actually read any of the posts on Varus?","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-12-06T21:38:23.950+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yes","replies":[{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2017-12-06T22:02:16.360+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"So, what do you think of it?
