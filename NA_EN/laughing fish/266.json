I mean, yeah you want your expensive ADC items, but we're not there to ward *for* you. Supports are supposed to do their part, and the ADC is supposed to do their's. Which is honestly hard to do if people think ADC+Support as a unit instead of two players out of five, and the support is naturally inclined to ward for the ADC. \n\nAs for the others, yeah supports make mistakes and they feed too. Just the other day I was borderline feeding with Braum against a Thresh, which is supposed to be a field day. Would have been nice if my ADC had put down more than 7 wards, or my previous game where Miss Fortune put down 8 wards to my *33.*\n\nA lot of things are subjective, but ADC warding habits is probably the least offensive and most frustrating one of all *because* it's partially our fault. Did that make sense? If I could blame it on blue trinket, I would, but this is people who don't even use their *free* green wards that recharge. For a class that often cites their items for why they don't buy wards, it's a mystery why they squander something they get for free.\n\ntl;dr: keep a pink in your jungle and buy a vision ward or two every ten minutes I guess. Buy upgraded blue on ADC, shit's OP when it comes to avoiding ganks if the support is roaming or warding objectives (which they should be warding, not just bot lane.
