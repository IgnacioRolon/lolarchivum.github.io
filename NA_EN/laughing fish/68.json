We want players to know what they’re getting and to be happy with the things they’re unlocking (we may investigate other ways to do this). The second is that players want to practice very specific skills without the constraints of a regular game. **For this point, our stance is that sandbox mode is not the way to go. We want to make sure we’re clear: playing games of League of Legends should be the unequivocal best way for a player to improve. While there are very real skills one can develop in a hyperbolic time chamber, we never want that to be an expectation added onto an already high barrier to entry.** On an individual level, we know this isn’t always true – some just want a space to practice flashing over walls without having to wait at least 3.6 minutes in between – but when that benefit is weighed against the risk of Sandbox mode ‘grinding’ becoming an expectation, we just can’t accept the tradeoff. We never want to see a day when a player wants to improve at League and their first obligation is to hop into a Sandbox. We do want to support your ability to grow in mastery, and there may be other avenues to do so, but not this.\n\nMany disagreed with this because,let's be honest,Sandbox mode would be used more to dick around & test out dumb stuff rather than \"train\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ruy","date":"2016-03-12T03:03:17.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember some other Rioter said it was pretty much because of the spaghetti.

Those servers could be used better to host rotating game modes every weekend (oh look at that, something the community wants!)\n\nOn top of that the barrier to ranked would be raised due to the expectation that you have mastered everything about your champ and the game in general in sandbox mode already.
