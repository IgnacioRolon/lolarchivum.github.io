Let's look back at some of the other gif lords!","subforum":"Memes & Games","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are a lot of people posting gifs these days. Some say there are too many, others say there is no such thing. But there are the few that stand above the rest. The strong, the committed, and the hilarious. That&#039;s right, I am talking about the gif lords. Last throwback Thursday I featured myself (I am lovable),  but this time I think it is fair to honor those around me. So without further rambling, here are the first gifs posted by some of the greats:\n\nNyX Reks:\n\n> #When you&#039;re recalling...\n> \n> and you thought the enemy was dead but he comes back\n> http://25.media.tumblr.com/82d465e8141f0fb2a268cc4d00c4958c/tumblr_mhxwldnKeA1qaa97co1_250.gif\n\n\nVayne Want A Hug:\n\n> #When ive been hiding in a bush for a enemy\n> http://www.drodd.com/images9/funny-cat-gifs9.gif\n\nKing Odarth (did you know he didn&#039;t used to post cat gifs? Those were dark times.)\n\n> #A funny thing happened to me.\n>\n> My midlaner stayed by her tower during an invade of my jungle where I ended up dying , and then died once more to gromp. Then she dies twice in lane vs a {{champion:76}}  as {{champion:1}}  and complains about me not ganking at lvl 2 as {{champion:56}}  when I haven&#039;t even gotten my red buff yet \n> http://media.giphy.com/media/8FTRebdOKVjcQ/giphy.gif\n\nWell there it is folks. The early days of the other gif lords. Upset that you didn&#039;t make the cut? Well I couldn&#039;t include everyone who has posted a gif. But these three are the greats, and deserve recognition.\n\nWhat&#039;s that? Upset that I didn&#039;t include my first gif? I did that last Throwback Thursday! But you all love my just that much? Fine, I will include my first breaking bad gif!\n\n> #That wonderful moment when someone insults you, and than you save their life\n>\n>That moment when you come rolling out of the jungle with Rammus, and you save the life of the person who just called you useless.
