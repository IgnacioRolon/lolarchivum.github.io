He has been playing LoL for some time. Tyler had really tried to get away from League for some time, but he still played often. It was one the only games all our group could play together, and I know he enjoyed playing when we did play as a group.\n\nHe left, and left his account without leaving a password or anything for anyone, but, for some reason, it is online today, right now! After asking everyone from our group, we have found NO ONE has his account info. My assumption is he has been hacked. Now, I guess I may be blowing this up, but I am pissed. This is HIS account, with his progress on it, with his money invested, and possibly his card information. I, based on principle, want to look out for my friend. He may come home, and not want to play games anymore. Fair enough, but that is his. No one should be on it except for him! \n\nThe image is a recent match history. You can see the account has not been played in 23 days, until a few hours ago. \n\nThey are playing with a duo named Net Of Thunder, playing (what I assume is trolling) ranked games, and unfriending some of his friends. \n\nI need help trying to figure how to contact a Rioter or how to flag the hacking. \n\nPlease, any and all help is much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T03:41:34.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever someone has their account 'hacked' we're more than happy to help get it back into the right hands!

He just left for basic on the 5th. \n\nI mean, surely you can admit this is an odd occurrence? We all have known Tyler since elementary school and im just trying to look out for him.\n\nI dont know what else I can ask, just make sure his personal info and card information is save? I wish I could actually speak to someone about this, not prowl boards hoping for answers","replies":[{"poster":"Xeoxed","date":"2017-03-26T17:51:10.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not want his information, I just want who ever this is logged out of his account. It isnt him nor is it any of his friends; just reset the password for the account and send an email to his personal account. If he cares enough when he gets back he will reset it. I just don't want what is his to get taken over by someone else","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T20:28:59.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's frustrating to see someone else abusing your friends' account, but rest assured that we do keep an eye out for suspicious activity. I can't share any details for security reasons, but rest easy that I _have _ taken a look into his account activity!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
