Press Ctrl+F.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Due to unforseen circumstances, Riot has decided to not take competitive gaming seriously in the NA region by redacting statements about their \"trucks loaded with servers\" giving everyone on the East Coast of the US false hope.  \r\n\r\nThey ask you to jump through hoops in order to not be banned by players or possibly even their own anti-afk system simply due to the fact they have bad routes with certain ISPs, or in some situations the entire east coast in general. Many struggling to get a ping under 100. I actually ping EUW servers lower than NA sometimes, all the servers located in LA make no sense and essentially cuts out the more skilled half of the country. No offense but we have snow, we are inside more. It's just common sense that there is more skill on the east coast.\r\n\r\nIf you are the leader of a team and are recruiting any east coast players I would be highly skeptical of ANYONE from east coast on the NA servers, that alone shows a severe lack of good judgement, that being said **I would like to present the fix:** TRANSFER TO LAN SERVERS, THEY ARE LOCATED IN FLORDIA.\r\n\r\nRiot doesn't want a region split. It started with the LAN servers being opened and placed in Florida. They said their new servers would be central US, which generally is pinged higher than Texas servers which is essentially just another west coast server. A region split is THE ONLY OPTION. **I was afraid to transfer my smurfs to LAN because of high queue times, THE QUEUE TIMES ARE THE SAME IN RANKED AS NA!** I paid what $10, $20 to transfer one of my smurfs there, BEST DECISION I'VE EVER MADE. If you read this far DO IT RIGHT NOW. It is 100% worth it. \r\n\r\n It cut my ping from 90-160 to 60. In half my range of Vayne feels like I'm playing Caitlyn. I can tell who has a high ping like me in lane, it's not even close. The games are all jokes and as a highly mechanically skilled player it is unexplainable in one post how big of a difference it is. There isn't enough space. It isn't just the new longer ranges, skillshots are like they move in slow motion, it's so much better on LAN. If you own a team and are recruiting anyone on the east coast be skeptical, that is a REALLY big decision, question WHY they aren't on LAN, if they are research their LAN accounts or make them put a smurf there and review their play. That is a lot of money and someones life you are influencing, LAN challenger ladders are going to be a hotspot of East Coast challengers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransfer to east coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n****Stop reading here if your a weirdo thinking im self promoting******\r\n\r\nThe difference really feels like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/jamminn_yeah/c/3915514\r\nThis was every single game I had for months. Crush everyone always but, hey if you aren't in the game, how can you win right? Especially if you are the only one that does good, which you have to be in order to gain. This is on NA.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/jamminn_yeah/c/5947814\r\nEverything about this makes me happy.\r\n\r\nSimple things like for example on EUW I can land INSANE LEE SIN Q's , because I lag. However on someone say Vayne I get pulled by darius. Vayne top is not viable against Darius because his pull range is my attack range due to lag. NA That is not the case, so generally I shit on him unless the jungler gets lucky. LAN for example. Bring mid and top and jungler or else I'll get two kills. It's not the same game. Now if I lived in FL or the server was in chicago--well if the difference is that huge from NA->LAN what would be possible with a 10-30 ping?\r\n\r\nKorea is better for a reason, their internets infrastructure allows everyone to play at this level, it's a level playing field. This is not even close to the case for the US. Not when you ping LAN for half of NA ping, and Korea's pings are STILL lower even if NA had LAN servers as East Coast. The region split has happened, IF YOU ARE EAST COAST, ABANDON NA AND PLAY ON LAN SERVERS!!!!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! YOU WILL MEET LIKE MINDED FRIENDS THAT LIVE NEAR YOU! LAN IS AN NA SERVER!\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Read the last paragraph.","replies":[{"poster":"Grimspeake","date":"2015-01-24T08:59:42.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"fuck your lan servers im east coast canada, u dont know the struggle.","replies":[{"poster":"are you alright","date":"2015-01-24T13:15:03.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I live in Michigan Buddy.

They were talking about checking pings between the majority of the players and getting the best server if it's central or west. \n\nThis is a good concept except it needs to be chosen between FL and Chicago for a new NAE region.  I have so many different views about everything about this game now. I EVEN LIKE KALISTA! This ping difference is NOT the same game I've been playing the past 3 years. Absolutely INSANE how different this game is with a lower ping, and to know it would be like that with an even closer server again, crazy!\n\nI'd recommend it. Basically the queue times are terrible which scared me when you are low. But they are in NA too if you're good.  At all ranked level 30 the queue times are great on LAN. \n\nLEAVE NA!
