Yes, in the real world, a summoner is targeting the enemy champion and pressing a button. But **in-universe** Jax is not casting a spell at his enemy.\nA spell shield in-universe should block spells and abilities cast on the champion in-universe.\nIn-universe summoners are not a thing, and whether or not a spell is targeted has no bearing on whether or not, **in-universe**, it's a spell or ability hitting the shielded champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2020-01-14T16:43:42.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to be in denial about what morgana E is.\n\nMorgana E is a shield that negates CC and blocks magic damage, _as stated in the ability's tooltip_ .

Nothing more nothing less. I don't see where your confusion comes from. \n\nThe only confusion here is you confusing code for canon.\n\nThe **code** is \"negates CC and magic damage\". The **canon** is that spell shields are magic shields that either absorb or deflect spells. In either case the spell is prevented from reaching its target, which means it should have the same effect as a spell that gets thrown into Aurelion Sol's domain by Windwall. None.\n\n> Also, your entire \"universe\" logic makes no sense. It's the same logic as saying \"in universe tristana W is  a jump so it should go over traps without triggering them\" .\n\nSure, in a world where \"straightforward\" means the same thing as \"nonsensical\".\nTristana's jump should absolutely evade bear traps. Because \"high in the air\" is inconsistent with \"oops I stepped on a trap\". It wouldn't even effect game balance much. How you can understand something so perfectly and also claim it doesn't make sense is beyond my reckoning.\n\n> Jax Q is a spell. End of story. It counts as a spell for everything.\n\nNo, it isn't. It might be coded as one, but AGAIN, code is not canon. In canon, it's a jump.\n\n> By your logic, brand should do no damage to water based champs and do more vs ice champions.. Cause *in universe* it's a fireball hitting water/ice\n\nIf being logically consistent on that matter wouldn't _completely break the game balance_, yes. Not completely adding a whole 'nother dimension to the game's balance and thus making the balance team's work 1000% harder is a pretty good argument for not fixing a logical inconsistency.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2020-01-17T20:02:41.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to know where you found that \"canon definition\" of a spellshield. \n\nAlso, where is morgana's E stated to be a \"spellshield\" ?
