Every 3 games or so I suffer from lag akin to ping spikes, but my ping stays in relatively normal levels (50-70, fluctuates so I know the screen didn't freeze with ping). Sometimes I lag for 5 seconds, other times I'm simply kicked out of the game. On top of that, I am unable to rejoin the game. Entering the client and interacting with it works fine, but the actual game itself won't load. Does anyone know what to do about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T18:35:25.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may have been due to some disruptions caused by the live maintenance.
