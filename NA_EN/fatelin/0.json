If not him then Meteos, probably.\nMid: Pobelter - guaranteed a god this season based on his play in Korea, hot damn. If not him, XiaoWeiXiao.\nADC: Sneaky - ADCs are kinda lacking right now in my opinion but Sneaky is a solid pick.\nSupport: Lustboy - easily the best support mechanics-wise right now.\nFlex: XiaoWeiXiao probably.\nTeam: Cloud 9 - just the best and most consistent NA team available right now.\n\nIf I used EU it would probably be different but we all know NA > EU (Kappa)","replies":[{"poster":"Dirzhek","date":"2015-01-13T04:30:17.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone didn't see Riot's article the top players from the last split. \nHowever there is nothing wrong with picking favorites. If you want you could try for Piglet for an ADC. Sure he is on Curse and there is the whole language barrier but they've had since October to adjust to him and hopefully get through that language issue.\n I'm sorry it is Team Liquid now not Team Curse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LFA","date":"2015-01-13T02:06:43.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No Kappa necessary Kappa","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"billie chow chow","date":"2015-01-13T23:12:08.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://fantasy.lolesports.com/share/join/league/417790/qhNtCjkd0CDsIZ3bwQJg","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-01-13T12:45:38.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top: fredy112 - He's the strongest top laner in EU by far and lacks any real competion in the region since the two next best tops (sOAZ, Kevin) are both not on teams ATM. Compared to NA EU is a region with weak tops and fredy stands out.\n\nJungle: Jankos/Meteos - Best junglers in NA/EU, close pick but I'm leaning towards Jankos as there are more weaker teams in EU as of now and his team just had huge upgrades. Honourable mention to Diamondprox.\n\nMid: Froggen - High scorer last season, strongest midlaner in the west, sorry Bjergerson fanboys.\n\nADC: Rekkles/Piglet - Both strong ADCs in their own rights. Overall I feel Rekkles is a bit safer of a pick due to his super high score last season. Honourable mentions to FORG1VEN and Sneaky.\n\nSupport: Lemon/Nyph/Nrated/Xpecial/Edward/Vander/Lustboy: There are so many good supports right now, pick one out of the bag, they're all good in their own ways.\n\nFlex: Nukeduck/Pobelter/P1noy - This is where I take my 'risks'. Last season I grabbed Kerp and that paid off. These three players have so much potential and are not to be ignored.\n\nTeam: Elements (Alliance for anyone who doesn't follow EU closely) - Just a super safe team pick. Almost guaranteed top two in EU, I'll take that.\n\n\nAnd for anyone who says something stupid like NA>EU here's the top scores from last season\n\nTop: Kev1n [18.13 PPG]\n\nJungle: KottenX [17.11 PPG]\n\nMid Lane: Kerp [22.72 PPG]\n\nAD Carry: Rekkles [23.49 PPG]\n\nSupport: YellOwStaR [18.63 PPG]\n\nFlex: Creaton [22.60 PPG]\n\nTeam: Fnatic [15.75 PPG]\n\nThat's right, 7 EU players and 0 NA players","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cripple Oracle","date":"2015-01-13T02:30:41.036+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top: ZionSpartan{{champion:24}} \nJungle: Meteos{{champion:121}} \nMid: Bjergsen{{champion:238}} \nAdc:Sneaky{{champion:42}} \nSupport: Xpecial ???
