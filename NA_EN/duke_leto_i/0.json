It even happened to me, and I was having a great game! It really bugs me that I had an area Internet outage and came back to Leavebuster trolling me and making me agree to not leave any more games. *Like I had a choice.*\r\n\r\nPlease, just turn it off or provide a feedback system to the Leavebuster system to provide some insight as to why they were forced to leave.","replies":[{"poster":"Arch Sight","date":"2014-12-08T04:49:57.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dolores Umbridge from harry potter is the best way to describe what Riot is doing to it's League Of Legends community. She forces you to agree with her that you should be punished even though you know you are telling the truth. \n\nPlayer: I didn't mean to leave/afk it was a crash/power outage/emergency/etc.\n\nRiot: preposterous, you left/afked, you can't blame it on something else, our new leaverbuster system recorded it. \n\nRiot: Player you will write \"I must not leave/afk games\" \n\nPlayer: How many times?\n\nRiot: As long as it takes to sink in.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXoCg_q1YEU\n\nThe leaverbuster system is archaic in thinking punishment will solve player's being unhappy about leaver's/afk's ruining their games. \"Assigning blame and seeking punishment as a means to encourage change won't ever solve problems.\" Punishing player's after they leave/afk doesn't solve the problem of having a leaver/afk on a player's team in a match for 20mins until the surrender vote is allowed. Not being able to get a new match up of players to replace that afk/leaver immediately is the problem. It's the source of player's complaining about AFKs and leavers. The leaverbuster system can't detect grieffer's that farm exp, letting the other team win and it can't stop leaver's/afks from happening intentionally or not intentionally. \n\nIntentional leaver's are determined to grief their own team or are determined to avoid a game they think is impossible to enjoy. They will do whatever it takes to avoid the system and get out of the game as quickly as possible which is letting the other side win while farming exp now. \n\nNone intentional leaver's/afk's are regular folks that don't mean to harm their fellow player's on purpose but can't avoid doing so because of a unforeseen problem or bad service. No form of encouragement can make a player not disconnect or go afk from a unforeseen cause. The system is insulting these player's.\n\nPlayer's who want to play Riot's game but know they have problems getting a match working range from people testing whether they have fixed the issue from reading a support ticket, and whether they just want to play even though they might have a problem. \n\nIf the player testing whether their fix didn't work has the problem again leaverbuster add's strikes to their account every time they fail to fix that problem. How does that encourage trying to fix it when the next time they attempt to do so may not have been the right fix for the problem? \n\nThe player that play's anyway with the likely chance of having a problem has those strikes and will likely stop trying to play the game entirely. \n\nMy new system idea will solve the main problem making the leaverbuster system obsolete. It's called the Rematch System. \n\nIt will automatically put the nine other player's who didn't disconnect into the matchmaker when a player disconnects with in 10mins of the start of the match. No game currency will be given out and it will not count towards any special bought items from the store within those 10mins of the start of the match. \n\nSurrender vote will be available after that 10mins. 3 yes and 2 no will surrender the match. No votes will not matter. \n\nThere will be a player AFK vote system available. When the player's on the team reach a majority of votes the player within question of being afk will receive a notice that if not answered within 3 mins will prove that they are afk. If proven before 10 mins of the start of the game is up they will auto rematch except for the afk. No game currency will be given out and it will not count towards any special bought items from the store within those 10mins of the start of the match. This notice will use a random set of images with letter's or number's that the player has to find and input it into the notice in order to be cleared of being suspected of being afk. The notice will first show up as a none intrusive to gameplay, big long icon stating the player is suspected of being AFK above the player's champions interface. One's clicked will open a window within the game allowing them to clear it","replies":[{"poster":"aLawfulFalafel","date":"2014-12-09T06:00:48.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TLDR\n\npunish ppl they will say screw this and leave LoL\n\nreward ppl they will stay and be good and work harder to achieve rewards\n\nexample : every 20 games consecutively completed u get +1 good guy pts\n     100 gg pts earns certain special gg skins or are worth a small amount of RP or something, nothing big but enough that if you dont ever leave/afk then eventually u can get 'X' cool thing or 'Y' other cool thing\n\nbut u know, punishments work too, thats why nowehere in the world has needed a jail for what? 1800 years now?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Misys","date":"2014-12-07T14:42:21.973+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yes, but even if it wasn't intentional, it still ruins the game for everyone else. Riot has no idea if you left intentionally by turning off your internet yourself or if it actually was an accident. If it happens every once in a while, then you will never be banned. Riot is sensible enough to understand occasions such as yours or emergencies where you have to leave. However, if constantly have to leave games, and you are continuously banned for this, League is not the game for you.\n\nThere are people who think that the LeaverBuster system is not harsh enough, and I agree with them.
