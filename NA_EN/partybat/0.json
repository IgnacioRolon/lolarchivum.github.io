Haha. No.\n\nRiot pretty much leaves ARAM alone to do its own thing, unbalanced as it might be. It's even worse for Dominion. I legitimately don't remember the last time they did anything to that game mode at all.","replies":[{"poster":"PartyBat","date":"2015-11-25T07:17:28.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah its a shame i really love aram and id enjoy dominion but noone plays and the wait is so long, i feel like they should pitch it for a new game mode","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-25T07:25:55.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On one hand, it feels like a shame to just scrap it. On the other, I really, really liked Ascension and would love to have it back in place of Dominon.\n\nIt was nice having a legit team deathmatch mode for a while.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
