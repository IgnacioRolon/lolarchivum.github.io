When I play by myself, it already sucks that half my kit is in the hands of a random que player. Sometimes me and my support don't work that great together(not in a toxic way, just in that we have different ideas on what to do) and I'm stuck without the use of my W and ult majority of the match because we are never on the same page.

Abandoning most other ADCs is like leaving a cat for it's self outside, it'll probably be fine and join you once laning phase ends. Abandoning {{champion:429}} on the other hands means she'll get snowballed on even harder because she loses dash frequency (Her pseudo defense) and could very likely be useless by the end of laning phase.\n\n\nHow about instead of forcing the support to always be with their ADC (Who might not be living to up to \"carry\" part of that.) and limiting their options, why not nerf {{champion:429}}'s defenses? {{champion:429}} already has more than enough mobility to ensure that she'll never be hit by a skill shot (Assuming she's played well) so she's already tanky than she appears (pseudo tankiness).

As a Kalista player nothing is more frustrating than almost finishing someone off just needing one more auto, but they dip out of vision and you have no wards available to put down, and the projectile from your auto was already in the air.

It's completely unjustified.\n\nIt's very tempting to nerf the most iconic parts of a champion's kit because they are the most obviously powerful parts. What you get then is every champion being sanded down to look closer and closer to every other champion which makes for a game that is more boring and actually harder to balance in the long run. Riot generally resorts to nerfing an iconic part of a champion only when literally nothing else has worked.\n\nVision is underrated by a lot of solo queue players but it definitely matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Masala Chai","date":"2016-03-09T01:06:49.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Sentinel doesn't give you a ton of vision, it's a small narrow cone that is visible to the enemy team, and can be snuck up on from behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-03-09T01:11:14.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RefurbishedIce,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6FgEnrvI,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-09T01:06:49.919+0000)\n>\n> But Sentinel doesn't give you a ton of vision, it's a small narrow cone that is visible to the enemy team, and can be snuck up on from behind.\n\nit's wide enough to effectively lock off jungle paths","replies":[{"poster":"Von Revanchist","date":"2016-03-09T19:01:58.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"for 1 second?? then you walk behind it.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-03-09T19:10:38.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Von Revanchist,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6FgEnrvI,comment-id=000300000000000000000001,timestamp=2016-03-09T19:01:58.564+0000)\n>\n> for 1 second?? then you walk behind it.\n\nit doesn't matter if they don't get seen at all by the spirit and instead kill it, Kalista still knows an enemy is there and her entire team now knows whether they can pressure an objective or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Von Revanchist","date":"2016-03-09T22:47:57.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who said anything about killing the wisp?
