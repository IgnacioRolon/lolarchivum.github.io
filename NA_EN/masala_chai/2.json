Also, because he is melee, any slow / hard CC will destroy him (destroy = having to use his ultimate before doing any meaningful damage).\n\nYes, he CAN be efficient in TF under the right circumstances. But he will have to adopt an assassin-pattern approach, aka flank the ennemy team after they used most of his CC. If he doesn't flank or if the ennemy team didn't use most of their CC, he will be extremely useless.

Or, rather, you understand the champion and talk about it as if his gameplay was a _mistake_. Now what, you think he is frustrating ? Have you ever played against Tahm Kench, Poppy just after her rework, or other \"one shotting tanks\" ? How can you be so frustrated against a champion without any hard CC, vulnerable to exhaust/CC, that relies so much on his ultimate ?\n\nNo, indeed, he isn't a teamfight beast. But he still can flank, and force a lot of things on himself. And above all, the moment someone picks Tryndamere, OF COURSE he is going to splitpush. Hey, what do you think ? That everyone needs to play Malphite and farm up until you can group and ulti ? A strong aspect of League of Legends in my opinion is that there are many different kind of champions, hence many kind of gameplays and playstyles. As the meta evolves, some get better during a few patches, some weaker, and so on. But some players, especially in soloqueue, feel confident mainly on a certain kind of champions, like mid lane long ranged poke champions, aggressive AP supports, utilitary tanks, afk farmer hypercarries, snowball roaming assassins ...\n\nI, for myself, enjoy the splitpush playstyle, with champions such as Jax, Shen, Yasuo, and above all Tryndamere. Yes, I _enjoy_ splitpushing. Would you deny a player to play what he can and likes to play ? Or would you rather champions get uniformized so they all fit one single playstyle meant for teamfights, as you seem to suggest.\n\nNo, I am clearly opposed to a Tryndamere rework. Especially since I assume, reading the author, that he isn't himself a Tryndamere player, and that he can suggest such a thing feels even more unhealthy.\n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2016-07-11T03:11:05.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"All splitpushers make a teamfight 4v5.
