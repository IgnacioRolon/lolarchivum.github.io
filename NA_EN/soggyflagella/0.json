I was literally flamed the entire game by a 4 man premade who got mad at me because I wouldn't \"rotate\" to their likings. Let me add that in these moments of me not rotating I was taking objectives when it happened so rightfully so why would I not take the objective instead of forcing an unnecessary team fight? To also add onto this, I took every single tower and the only inhib we had in the game, completely by myself, and it added up to 8 towers total and an inhib, one of those was a nexus turret, and when I say by myself, I literally mean completely by myself while killing enemies. There was not a single time that any of my teammates were even close enough to a tower to get gold when I took them, not even an assisted auto attack. I even tried to say the same things to them that they were saying to me in chat to see if they would get the picture and even explained after I said it why it was useless to say those things to another teammate and still got banned ex: Soggyflagella: you didnt rotate\nSoggyflagella: whats wrong with you??\nSoggyflagella: how dare you leave me\nSoggyflagella: why would you do that omg\nSoggyflagella: see how useless that is?\nSoggyflagella: or do you still not get the point\nSoggyflagella: it wasnt your fault i died\nSoggyflagella: but i blamed you anyways\n\nHere is what blitzcrankbot decided to perma ban me for: \n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nSoggyflagella: no\nSoggyflagella: i told you she was there\nSoggyflagella: you dont have to fight it\nSoggyflagella: watch me not do it\nSoggyflagella: you and brand arent the whole team\nSoggyflagella: get over yourself\nSoggyflagella: good\nSoggyflagella: see if i care\nSoggyflagella: good for you\nSoggyflagella: i never rotated\nSoggyflagella: keep lying to yourself though\nSoggyflagella: you lost a 4v4\nSoggyflagella: i guess thats my fault too\nSoggyflagella: youre not smart\nSoggyflagella: ive taken all the objectives\nSoggyflagella: literally all of them\nSoggyflagella: ohhhh look\nSoggyflagella: i helped and yall did nothing\nSoggyflagella: original\nSoggyflagella: go cry in some other game with your 4 man premade in normals\nSoggyflagella: yall are some babies\nSoggyflagella: njo one cares\nSoggyflagella: cry baby\nSoggyflagella: you didnt rotate\nSoggyflagella: whats wrong with you??\nSoggyflagella: how dare you leave me\nSoggyflagella: why would you do that omg\nSoggyflagella: see how useless that is?\nSoggyflagella: or do you still not get the point\nSoggyflagella: it wasnt your fault i died\nSoggyflagella: but i blamed you anyways\nSoggyflagella: maybe get reported\nSoggyflagella: enjoy\nSoggyflagella: oh yes you foil all of my plans\nSoggyflagella: im soooooo worried about you\nSoggyflagella: yup\nSoggyflagella: its always my fault\nSoggyflagella: dont worry\nSoggyflagella: you can improve your score\nSoggyflagella: and actually take an objective for once\nSoggyflagella: oh wait\nSoggyflagella: thats been all me\nSoggyflagella: thats right\nSoggyflagella: btw, my team is blaming me for losing the game\nSoggyflagella: just so yall know\nSoggyflagella: this is a lot of reports in a norms game\nSoggyflagella: thanks\nSoggyflagella: gg\nSoggyflagella: enjoy the reports                     CAN ANYONE TELL MY WHY ANY OF MY COMMENTS MADE ME GET PERMA BANNED?","replies":[{"poster":"PrisonNightmare","date":"2019-02-18T03:41:20.400+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because you did supposedly good doesn't mean you are exempt from the punishments of being toxic.

You alone are responsible for what you type, and punishments, consequently, are issued based solely on _your_ behavior, no-one else's.\n\n> you cant just go off of one persons chat log when everyone was responding to each other.\n\nTheir behavior is their own, and they did not make you type anything. You alone are responsible for your own behavior. It doesn't matter if everyone in the entire match was flaming up and down the aisle - _you flamed_, and since flaming is against the rules, _you got punished for it_.\n\n> it takes my comments and makes them not even make sense.\n\nWe don't need to see other people's chat to see that yours was below the bar of acceptable behavior. All anyone else's logs would do is provide context as to _why_ you said what you did - it would not excuse you for breaking the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"Soggyflagella","date":"2019-02-18T04:01:35.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"this is what im talking about, you not being able to see the full chat log is taking my messages out of context.

Whether they flamed or not does not change the fact that _you flamed them back._\n\n> ...and I also was boasting about my \"accomplisments.\" I was literally trying to explain to them why blaming me for not rotating and them dying was stupid because I was taking objectives.\n\nYou did a poor job of explaining it. All you did was repeat what they said, and then ask them if they saw how useless it was.\n\nAnd then flame them immediately following.\n\nThere are two big problems with this, first and foremost is that, as CharDeeMcDenniz said, _fighting fire with fire doesn't work_. Throwing their own flame back at their face only serves to further agitate them, and gets you nowhere - all it does is make them want to harass you more, because they think you're trying to act like a smart-alec parroting them.\n\nSecond, is that if they're flaming you and being general assholes, _the odds are cataclysmically low that they would be inclined to see reason. **It is not worth your time to bother dealing with flamers.**_ You would have been better off muting and reporting them than going off and participating in a flamewar.\n\nAll told, this is a problem where everything could've been solved by either the use of the mute feature, or even just a modicum of tact. Muting, for the aforementioned reason that flamers aren't likely to be reasonable and shouldn't be bothered with, and tact, because _your way of explaining their problematic behavior was just counterflaming._ There were a billion and one better ways of wording it, and you chose to fuel the flamewar.\n\n> leagues tribunal system is some garbage.\n\nThe Tribunal system hasn't been around for four or five years. You were punished by the Instant Feedback System - an automated system operated by a neural network/machine learning system - and that means you were punished _strictly_ in accordance with Riot's rules, not just the community's interpretations of the rules, as it was with the Tribunal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-18T04:15:26.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because they blamed you first does **not** mean you weren’t blaming them.\n\nThis is a common misconception - that someone else doing something justifies you breaking the rules or changes what you’re doing.

You were told this, and yet you spent the entire match doing exactly what Riot told you not to do. The logical outcome of this is that this account is locked and you can't access it anymore, which was the only way Riot could guarantee that no more toxicity could come from it.","replies":[{"poster":"Soggyflagella","date":"2019-02-18T04:05:08.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"excuse me, but how can you tell someones emotion from them typing? sarcasm isn't something that you can just tell in writing. sarcasm varies from person to person.","replies":[{"poster":"Soggyflagella","date":"2019-02-18T04:11:37.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"im also glad that calling someone a cry baby because they are whining like a baby is inflammatory. so if any of you call somebody out for what they are actually doing you are flaming them, remember that.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-18T04:36:32.455+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Soggyflagella,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gs3EeFJq,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2019-02-18T04:11:37.151+0000)\n>\n> im also glad that calling someone a cry baby because they are whining like a baby is inflammatory. so if any of you call somebody out for what they are actually doing you are flaming them, remember that.\n\nCalling someone a crybaby, baby, etc. is inflammatory, period. \"Calling somebody out\" with no constructive feedback is totally unnecessary, and if you do it in a very rude way, that's harassment.
