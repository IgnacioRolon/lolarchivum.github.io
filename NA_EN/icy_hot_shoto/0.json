Originally, we thought it was because someone took smite and/or was in the jungle. However, I just played a bot game and none of us had smite nor did anyone start in the jungle.\n\nHere&#039;s a screenshot from 9 minutes into the game, when I noticed the one bot wasn&#039;t there. As you can tell, everyone but the Volibear bot has items, so he hadn&#039;t left spawn at all.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/6164cfdd8a78630327908a66b91737bf.jpg\n\nHappens in both beginner and intermediate summoners rift bot games.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2018-07-26T23:06:46.137+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey friends. :3\n\nWe are looking into this!
