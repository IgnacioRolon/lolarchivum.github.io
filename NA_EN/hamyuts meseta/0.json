Got to silver first time I did my promos, sadly I wasnt that good at league yet so I was soon in bronze ( like playing {{champion:9}} ad because I didnt know ap was a thing.) Now a few years past and I&#039;ve been playing a lot of bot lane ( adc {{champion:222}}  and supp {{champion:111}} ) and I like to think I&#039;ve made a huge improvement. I learned lots of little tricks here and there and now with the addition of berries stealing drag has become more easy as well as escapes. The thing I dont understand is, why are so many people so bad in bronze? Do people just auto-pilot in ranked does no one pay attention to patch notes and such? People like to say &quot;oh, if you&#039;re good then you can carry&quot;, but Im in bot lane. Im not the hyper fed {{champion:157}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:107}} and Im not asking to be carried. I usually do well in my bot lane, but this is a team game and it annoys me so much 2 or more of my teammates feeding like hell or just seem to not know how to play in general. I get things like team members roaming jg alone when there&#039;s a fed enemy jungler out there or I get ganks that end up feeding my lane. I&#039;ve been trying to get out of bronze 4 but I keep losing. I will admit that there are games I do bad but those are very few and rarely in ranked. Should I just stop playing bot lane and learn a hyper carry like the ones I mention earlier just to get out of bronze? Or should I just I dunno keep at it and hope for the best? It has been so frustrating and I needed to vent to. Let me know if you experience the same thing or if any of you also have some advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-01-19T02:02:06.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looked at your match history....\n\n{{champion:222}} - 38 minutes- {{item:3508}} ?, no boots\n\n{{champion:222}} - 28 minutes - no boots\n\n{{champion:222}} - 34 minutes- {{item:3508}} ?, no boots\n\n{{champion:222}} - 28 minutes - {{item:3508}} ?, no boots\n\n{{champion:21}}  - 29 minutes - no boots\n\n{{champion:222}} - 40 minutes - {{item:3508}} ?, no boots\n\nKeeps on going like that. *Why dont you buy boots?* I honestly am very curious","replies":[{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-01-19T02:30:27.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eedat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eEZQGZvc,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-01-19T02:02:06.670+0000)\n>\n> Looked at your match history....\n> \n> {{champion:222}} - 38 minutes- {{item:3508}} ?, no boots\n> \n> {{champion:222}} - 28 minutes - no boots\n> \n> {{champion:222}} - 34 minutes- {{item:3508}} ?, no boots\n> \n> {{champion:222}} - 28 minutes - {{item:3508}} ?, no boots\n> \n> {{champion:21}}  - 29 minutes - no boots\n> \n> {{champion:222}} - 40 minutes - {{item:3508}} ?, no boots\n> \n> Keeps on going like that. *Why dont you buy boots?* I honestly am very curious\n\nIf OP wants to go mid, he should learn cassiopeia","replies":[{"poster":"Hamyuts Meseta","date":"2017-01-19T18:24:56.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like getting boots on jinx, many people will think Im dumb but they don't really help me much.
