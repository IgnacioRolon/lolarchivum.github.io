By engaging with retaliation, you only run the chance of going down with them.  :(  Your chat also included racial slurs, negativity as soon as the match began, telling them to afk, claimed to have stopped playing yourself, and degrading others for the entirety of the match.  \n\nAll of this could have been stopped simply by using mute.  Based on the sevrity, a suspension was applied.
