First was Lux couple'o years ago. New voice is kinda ok, and i got used to it, but i miss the old one, too.\r\n\r\nTHEN THEY KILLED AATROX. I don't care about new gameplay, never seen one, can't compare. I liked the old idea of sustain machine, especially on phantom strikes, but it was kinda unbalanced cuz of grievous wounds, with em it was to weak and without it was too strong. Anyway. Gameplay apart, his character is what i used to adore. Y'see, old Trox felt like an echo of glory, he was the face of war - certainly epic, but afterwards somewhat sad. YOU COULD FEEL THAT. And new Trox is just generic demon berserker. Reminds me of Berial from DMC. I think pretty much every game about demonslaying has someone like that guy as one of first bosses.\r\n\r\nAnd now Ashe. She was my first champ in League and she has been my main and favourite even if i didn't play her as much as some other champs. It's been over six or seven years since i started playing. It's been a glorious time and Ashe became one of my favourite characters over the games. I didn't pay much attention to new lore, i don't say it's bad, i just don't want it. But then... I was reading the recent patchnotes when SUDDENLY \"Ashe got a new voiceover.\" So i instantly checked it because i was playing Ashe yesterday and didn't notice anything (then i realized it was project Ashe ._.) and when i heard it... don't get me wrong, it's kinda cool, especially ingame, but it completely twists her personality and makes her sound like an old granny. Overwatch has their own Ashe, but this one sounds like Ana. Some old lady that has been through some tough events. That's kinda interesting twist tbh, first time i see a video game character aging on my eyes from a young girl to an old-aged woman. It would be fine but not with Ashe, cmon! I know her ever since i was 16! \r\nIngame new voice is kinda cool tho. But still. Riots. I know you don't listen. But ffs don't delete old voices completely. Especially if they differ so much. Bind them to skins, i'm okay with that. Some old skin like Freljord or Sherwood Ashe to keep her young :C\r\n\r\nI know this leads to nowhere but i sorta needed this cryout. Thanks for reading.","replies":[]}
