It was such a fun item! All be it meta golem was ridiculous xD But with all the tank busting going on out there it wouldnt be a problem. I think it'd be cool to have more items that give strength through other stats other than straight ad or ap.

You're losing two stats and gaining a compositional passive, since only your ADC and maybe one other laner will have the need for life-steal and AD. Zeke's Herald was sub-par on any champion, it's not whether it was built - but should even be in the game? Why would you get it? When you're stomping? I can just get a Frozen Heart to have a better effect on the teamfight or trades. When I'm behind?
