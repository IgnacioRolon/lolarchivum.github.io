He lets me contest objectives easily, since it's extremely hard to duel a Skarner in his zone of control.

He didn't need either of his reworks and I cried when they changed him.

Still underplayed.  Still underpowered.  Her fans hated that rework.\n\nThen they did it AGAIN with {{champion:82}} .  He's a problem right now, but so were Cass and Skarner immediately after their reworks.  Soon he'll be nerfed and he'll be underplayed and underpowered again with the only change coming about from his rework being that the old Morde fans lost a champ they liked to play in a misguided attempt to appeal to the average player.\n\nThe average player spams whatever is flavor of the month for being OP.  Stop trying to appeal to these people!  They only care about picking the champs that the meta/the pro steamers/the LCS has picked FOR them and then trying to ride those champs to easy wins.  Please stop destroying the champs people love to appeal to those people Riot.  Cass, Morde and Skarner were NOT causing problems.  They didn't have insane winrates... either high OR low.
