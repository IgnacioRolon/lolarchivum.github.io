It&#039;s about the **lack of professionalism and consistency**.\r\n\r\nMany frequent users who post here have been permanently banned, for very vague reasons &quot;Don&#039;t be a jerk&quot;. Should their posts have been removed? Yeah, probably, but to go straight to a PERMANENT ban? It&#039;s obviously excessive\\\\ This is all being handled unprofessionally in a &quot;Just ban them and hope the problem goes away&quot; mentality.\r\n\r\nI mean it&#039;s up to Riot what they don&#039;t want posted here (And I&#039;m in agreement that content had NO place here) but it needs to be handled in a better way, instead of just banning people who NEVER posted said content.","replies":[]}
