This nothing to address the fact that his laning phase is atrociously overpowered vs any melee champion ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT HIS SCALING IS BROKEN. Gets rewarded more damage for building tank items.. balanced..\r\n\r\nGut his scaling, his base damage is meaningless when he can still build tank and outscale almost every other champion in the game. -.- Then again knowing Riot they will nerf his scaling by .1 and increased his base damage by 200% as a \"compensation buff\". \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5ZUOHyb.png","replies":[]}
