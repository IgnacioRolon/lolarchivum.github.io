That's all he really brings though, yes he has a slow, yes he has moderate damage, but really his peel isn't great, his stun is rather conditional, and his E could really just read  activate to reduce all damage taken by 50% for 10 seconds and you'd all be fine with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViashinoWizard","date":"2015-10-27T08:01:03.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he's the goddamn River King, that's why.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Little Stick Man","date":"2015-10-27T03:28:35.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bc adcs cant build zhonyas (doesnt even do the ad damage shit item) so rito made a champion that does that for them all hail adc master race","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-27T03:03:04.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because balance.","replies":[]}]}
