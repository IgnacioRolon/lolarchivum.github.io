I cant click on them to sell or anything. I can't drag the shop up any farther because its at the top of my screen. I also cant get to the bottom right corner because its off the screen. WHAT DO I DO?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T23:07:47.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Shop window can be resized just like a window in Windows and Mac OS. If you grab the top and move it as far up and left as possible, you should be able to grab the bottom right corner and resize the window. \n\nBelow are screenshots to assist you visually:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/0pm2R\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkoo Enoshima","date":"2016-09-10T01:45:07.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unfortunately I tried that. The issue was that i couldnt drag it far enough up to resize it. I ended up changing the resolution in a windowed screen and making the shop smaller from there. Then i resized it and it worked\nbut thank you!\nBTW: xD nice that you included your mastery 7 kat in the shot XD XDXD","replies":[]}]}]}
