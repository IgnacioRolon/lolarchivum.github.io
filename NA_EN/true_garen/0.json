Imagine going from 6.4k BE to 1 masterwork chest(of which can contain an emote.. For real they need to fix masterwork loot.. if u get anything thats not a 900 ~ RP skin, it should give u multiple.. 2 cheap skins 500~, 2-3 emotes etc.. 2-3 icons.. etc...) Thats really underwhelming and kind of a kick to the d*ck.. could've atleast gave us the rarer purple chest that has good loot. Also was QUITE Dissapointed to see the Bonus skin is an annie skin.. like we dont already have 11 of them.. :( I sound entitled, but still its the 10th anniversary lol, some of these seem a bit lazy.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-22T03:57:28.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine contained a chest which contained a chest which contained an emote.","replies":[{"poster":"Pumpedhero","date":"2019-10-22T04:00:13.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine just gave me an emote.
