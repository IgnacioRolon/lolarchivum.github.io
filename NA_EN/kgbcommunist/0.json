Im not interested in the game disk but i am interested in the skins it comes with. I love playing kayle and her silver skin supposedly comes with it. I assume its a code entry. I am not sure tho. That is  my question. If i do buy this collectors edition bundle will the skins 100% come with it. Weather that be in a code form or something else. Anyone with knowledge of this please let me know. Thank you and have a great day.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-04T16:39:13.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, these codes have been deactivated so you won't be able to redeem them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KGBcommunist","date":"2015-09-04T06:23:56.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats the thing im not sure if this is a code.
