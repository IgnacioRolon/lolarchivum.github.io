Albeit Ashe's kit seems fairly simple, it's the fact that she has no form of mobility or escape, that her CC is both single-target and a skillshot, and that her Q requires precise timing that makes her a challenging champion. On top of this, she is a sustained damage ADC with a niche role in the game and shouldn't just be picked just to be picked.\n\nBecause she has no form of mobility, the player has to be aware of their positioning at all times, a concept that is very unfamiliar to a lot of people in low silver, and doesn't really stop being a problem until around Platinum elo. She must be positioned the furthest back in a teamfight and making sure to utilize her slow to kite any enemy that tries to dive through the enemy team. As well as her poor mobility, due to her sustained damage, rather than burst, she can't dive and take out a single target. She HAS to stay to her niche only focusing whatever target is closest to her in the furthest back of the team.\n\nHer CC being single-target means she needs to use it as on the highest threat, and because it's a skillshot she needs to hold it for the right timing and aim it properly at the highest threat. For example, if a Zed ults, she knows exactly when he'll come out of the shadow. A good Ashe will ult at the right timing to where he gets stunned the instant he's out of his shadow. Low elo players don't know these timings and tend to just use her ult on whatever at the start of a teamfight instead of using it for crucial moments. They also tend to have trouble landing skillshots.\n\nHer Q makes her have to stay still in order to maximize the damage output. If the Ashe isn't in a position of complete safety, enemies will take advantage of the fact that she's standing still during these autoattacks. A player needs to make sure their Q will go uninterrupted before using it, which low elo players tend to use it every time it's off cooldown and waste the damage steroid. \n\nLastly, Ashe shouldn't just be picked just to be an ADC. Her role is to counter bruisers like Darius, Garen, Fiora, Gangplank, Zac, Sejuani, and the etcetera. She is especially strong against tanks, able to shred them fairly quickly. Ashe shouldn't be picked into a Riven top, Shaco jungle, Talon mid, Lucian adc, and Vel'koz support, for example. \n\nLow elos tend to use Ashe as their \"fill\" ADC thinking she's easy, but she actually requires a lot of skill that isn't tied to champion knowledge. Because of this, many Ashe players in low elo are usually not ADC mains and were filled into the role, and aren't aware of many of these crucial points. The rest of them just don't have the game knowledge to utilize her potential. In high elos, she is a huge threat when played and usually gets camped just to make sure she doesn't dominate the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-11-27T22:20:09.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Include that the use of Ashe’s E can unintentionally reveal where she is on the map.\n\n For example: If Ashe is hiding in the bush near raptor camp on the enemy side of the jungle, and the enemy has no vision of the jungle, then by using E (in the direction of the enemy midlane) Ashe unintentionally gives away where she is and gives the enemy team some time to prep and collapse on her in their jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-11-27T22:13:12.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember Ashe is very squishy and honestly hard to get a hand of. You aren’t gonna see that many good Ashe players in low elo, and usually the good ones would climb out of low elo.\n\nAlso remember that ADC’s don’t ward as much during lane because usually the support is in the position to do it while the ADC is getting CS. And with Ashe she has her e to help her get vision in far away places.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-27T21:36:37.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My personal theory is that playing ashe makes one temporarily bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2018-11-27T21:30:36.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time I play Ashe, I get my Ashe handed to me.  ^_^","replies":[]}]}
