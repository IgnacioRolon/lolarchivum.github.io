Allies inside the aura also gain 5/10/15/20/25% Tenacity.\n\n**W &ndash; Crystal Barrier/Shatter &ndash; 500 Range &ndash; 14/12/10/8/6 Sec Cooldown &ndash;**\n\n*Passive:* While this ability is not in cooldown, Taric gains 5/10/15/20/25 (+5/6.25/7.5/8.75/10% of Taric&rsquo;s bonus Armor) bonus Armor and 5/10/15/20/25 (+5/6.25/7.5/8.75/10% of Taric&rsquo;s bonus Magical Resistance) Magical Resistance.\n\n*Active:* Taric imbues an ally with a gem shell, losing the passive effect and granting the ally bonus 5/10/15/20/25 (+5/6.25/7.5/8.75/10% of Taric&rsquo;s bonus Armor) bonus Armor and 5/10/15/20/25 (+5/6.25/7.5/8.75/10% of Taric&rsquo;s bonus Magical Resistance) Magical Resistance. After 5 seconds or reactivation, the shell explodes, dealing 60/100/140/180/220 (+0.6 Ability Power) Magical Damage to nearby enemies and lowering their resistances by 4/8/12/16/20 + 6/8.25/10.5/12.75/15%.\n\nTaric can cast this ability on himself to instantly cast Shatter.\n\n**E &ndash; Bedazzle &ndash; 450 Range &ndash; 18/17/16/15/14 Sec Cooldown &ndash;**\n\nTaric unleashes a flash of light in a cone, causing 80/100/120/140/160 (+0.5 Ability Power) Magical Damage and slowing all enemies in it&#039;s radius by 25/32.5/40/42.5/50% for 0.5/0.62/0.75/0.87/1. The damage and slow duration increase on closer enemies, up to a maximum of 120/150/180/210/240 (+0.75 Ability Power) and 0.75/0.93/1.12/1.31/1.5 seconds.\n\nEnemies facing Taric will also be blinded and have their damage lowered by 15/20/25/30/35% for the duration of the Slow.\n\n**R &ndash; Radiance &ndash; 450 Range &ndash; 120/100/80 Sec Cooldown &ndash;**\n\nTaric smashes his hammer on the ground, dealing 120/200/280 (+0.7 Ability Power) Magical Damage to nearby enemies and pushing them away. Taric then creates an Aura around himself that empowers allies and lasts 6 seconds, giving them bonus 15/30/45 + 10/15/20% of Taric&rsquo;s bonus Armor and Magical Resistance as Attack Damage and Ability Power respectively, up to a maximum of 60/70/80.","replies":[{"poster":"chipsquared","date":"2015-05-01T21:55:10.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So he now presses R-W-Q and makes his team gods late game. At, say for example, level 14 his combo would provide his team with 40 AP and AD. That would easily be followed by W to whoever your front line is to provide 29 MR and 31 Armor for 5 seconds which at any time can be detonated to provide your team an opportunity to burst their front line 20+15%, almost being a miniature Last Whisperer or Void Staff for (You never filled in how long the debuff would last for.) Lastly during this process you are channeling your Q healing them for between 100 HP to 304 HP and stacking 25% Tenacity to not feel punished for stacking close to Taric during his channels. \n\n**_This was all taken into account base Taric without runes and masteries who had 3 items complete and boots that didn't have Armor or Magic Resist. The items were completed Sightstone, Face of the Mountain, and Locket of the Iron Solari._**\n\nThe numbers aren't overwhelming, but the combination potential and the ease of doing it would make him very strong. Using his passive only makes his Q stronger. You probably realized that while working on it, so well done because it's a fair number at waiting until your teammates are below 40%. I can't tell you if it's good or bad it's probably just around the sweet spot. What makes his passive very strong is its very low cooldown. Every team fight you encounter it will always be up. Even if the opposing team tries to reengage, it would probably be no more than 10 seconds away after the first core fight to be back up. Not even accounting if this passive stacks with CDR. Allowing him to buff himself the longer the team fight by shredding his own HP in exchange for larger heals.\n\nNow I also want you to note I took into account the 350 range of his Q and how you should never stack an entire team that tight, or at the very least how almost impossible it would be to keep that formation. I took that into a lot of consideration and found his kit allowed him to stack on top of his back line and buff his front line. At max CDR of 40% your spells cooldown for his Q would be 4.8 seconds, and he channels it for 5 seconds. So the entire team fight you can stand there healing and buffing. \n\nI haven't talked about your E, but primarily because it would be something I would max last on Taric. Not because it is bad, but because his other two spells synergize together well as a support. That being said I will let you know his E is probably the most broken part of his kit. You can add more buffs and debuffs than half of the supports combined. Getting back to it though, the reason this is so broken is because of the slow and decrease in attack damage in conjunction with a blind. How is anyone ever going to assassinate you or for that matter anyone who stands right near you. There wasn't a character in the game that I felt could break how powerful Taric would be in team fights. This Q and everything you added to it reassured me that nothing would ever touch the backline. \n\nOverall I really enjoy the concept and is definitely a much more interesting kit than he had before. Take some time to go back and do the math and run the scenarios because last thing people want is a champion that doesn't die. Let alone a champion that can keep everyone alive. I'm no genius and people are going to have different opinions than what I have. Perhaps see something completely foreign from what I see, but in my own opinions I try to take a very logical approach to it and see how far I could push the kit to abuse it. The fact that you can buff up anyone and armor shred every 2.5 seconds and max CDR and channel heals that get stronger as you take damage, that is something a little bit strong. \n\n{{champion:44}} {{champion:44}}","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-05-01T22:01:07.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair point, I definitely fucked up on the math. Thing is, all I have is a concept, in order to get the full idea of how it'd work in the game, I'd have to either have it work in game (obviously never going to happen), or be a serious number cruncher (And I'm not good enough for that).\n\nStill, the fear that I may have made him too strong was in the back of my head. The idea that I had was that he excelled in defending his squishier teammates, and sucked at everything else, hence the complete lack of mobility and pathetic range. If he came across as just Buff God, then I definitely fucked up somewhere in the numbers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lucentile","date":"2015-05-01T21:07:04.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"issues: A) Sacrifcing health is awkward on a tank. I'm not doing the math, but is that even a net positive health gain for the team? It probably isn't a net gain Effective HP, since whoever Taric shields will have fewer resists.\n\nB) That Q is amazing, but -- it is channeled, making Taric unable to tank for his team and seems like a much weaker version of Janna's ult. What's worse, Taric is slow and has trouble chasing, making it so he can't heal on the move will make him have even harder problems dueling/chasing than he already has.\n\nC) Especially if we take away his point and click stun on E. Blind and slow ar enice, but Taric, as a tank, needs a hard CC, and Dazzle is it. \n\nD) The Crystal Barrier also seems pretty strong, getting passive resists that feel almost as good as Leona's W. But, it hits into his identity as being an effective anti-physical unit by not letting him strip armor to help his carry or buff his team's defenses passively. \n\nAll that said, I actually like the idea of displacement on Taric's Ult, though -- it'll give him a hard engage/splitting power that his kit kind of lacks. I'm just not sure if that's a good fit for him.","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-05-01T21:22:56.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) I figured it was less about gaining health and more about saving an ally from death. I designed Taric here around the niche of being an anti-burst buff-based Support tank.\n\nB) The idea behind the Q is to quickly bring back an ally into the fray, or help them survive otherwise lethal Damage. I don't think Taric's suits should be chasing, more like sticking to the side of your ally and making damn sure he doesn't die.\n\nC) Even if it's not targeted, the cone is fairly large and should be able to hit anybody you want fairly easily. It's as much of a skillshot as Annie's W. Even if it's not a stun, it's still an area of effect CC that can also severely (or completely) neuter the damage from a dangerous foe for relatively long periods of time.\n\nD) He still strips armor. He just so happens to strip Magical Resistance as well. He just has to think a bit more between protecting his allies or muddling his enemies. And the reason why he doesn't provide armor for his entire team is because... well, I kinda share Riot's vision regarding auras, I don't think that just being able to give your team stats from the aether is good design, because there's not much that the enemy can do about it, meaning that they generally need to be kept weak, so weak that their effect is barely felt. Still, he can still give a fairly massive resistance bonus to priority allies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-02T01:04:42.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happen with the targeted stun?

As a paladin, {{champion:44}} should definitely have the tools to empower himself and allies, but I think that power needs to be made a lot more localized (i.e. it should only affect a specific target), and a lot more visible. Taric sacrificing his health to save an ally would add a ton of gameplay and tension, for example, him making allies slightly less vulnerable to crowd control for 5 seconds... not so much. Not all of his abilities need to revolve around super-clutch plays, but they do need to make a clear impact in a fight beyond just giving Taric and his allies more power in general.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-05-01T22:16:41.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"teric is best champ rito go work on him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silent Pace","date":"2015-05-01T21:36:58.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-05-01T21:42:57.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlike some *nine-tailed skanks whose names shall go unmentioned*, Taric-baby doesn't *need* to force anybody to be charmed by him.
