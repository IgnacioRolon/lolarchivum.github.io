Upon looking at the results of several games I've played as and with a Ziggs in, I have noticed, repeatedly and without fail, that his damage potential is LITERALLY DOUBLE any other champ in the game.\n\nSure, you may say \"yeah, but he's squishy\" or that \"he can easily be countered, you're just bad and salty\". No. Listen... I've played with him recently. Without even really trying, I pulled 120K damage to champs where I normally only pull about 60-70K damage with other champs with the same amount of effort, and I don't even consider myself that good of a player. This is a glaring hole in the balance of the game. Ziggs is broken. He needs a nerf. BADLY.\n\nDo something about it, Riot. I'm tired of losing games with a Ziggs on the enemy team just because his damage potential is literally double every other champion in the game. Give him a longer cooldown on his Q, or something, I don't care. The point is he needs a nerf, and he needs one soon.\n\nBelow is a link to an image with the results of a match in which I recently played as Ziggs :\n\nhttps://imgur.com/AZ04bJ4","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-08T21:17:46.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ziggs is only broken in ARAM, like every artillery mage.\n\nHe is subpar on SR, and only slightly OP on treeline.\n\nWas that ziggs even using dark harvest/lichbane? I once got a quadra kill in ARAM with him just auto attacking and oneshotting people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-05-08T21:06:51.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is that an ARAM game ?

Ziggs cant miss in ARAM!! literally everything you throw at them is going to hit at least someone. \n\nIm a Ziggs main, and i can assure you he is not OP at all... Can Ziggs swing teamfights by doing insane dps? YES. Can Ziggs backdoor and end a game super fast? Yes! Can Ziggs get utterly destroyed in lane, and not be relevant for 35 minutes? Absolutely!\n\nThe champ has a super passive/weak lane phase, assassins and mobile junglers can abuse Ziggs so easily early on, and in team fights. He only has 1 escape that isnt that reliable, and hes extremely squishy. Zoe, LeBlanc, Zed, Talon completely murder him in lane. Jarvan, Kayne, Zac, Completely murder him from the jungle. \n\nPlay him in some matches outside of ARAM, like a ranked game. And you will see Ziggs is extremely positional based, Skill Shot Reliant, and very punishing for your team if you are not performing up to par.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2018-05-08T20:49:10.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ziggs damage is fine because it's all easy to dodge, his only strength is in his ability to siege.","replies":[{"poster":"CptRageBeard","date":"2018-05-08T21:00:37.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're clearly not looking at the same numbers I'm looking at, then.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-05-08T20:48:27.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He is a high dps mage with light zone control capabilities, and conditional hard CC (either you get a knockback or you have an escape).\n\nHis damage isnt too high, thats literally why he exists.","replies":[{"poster":"CptRageBeard","date":"2018-05-08T20:56:27.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nah, I'm not taking that as truth. I've literally watched the results of every game I've played that had a Ziggs in it. His damage at the end was literally double every other champ. I've even attached an image here of a game I played as him. I only had 6 more kills than the Jayce, yet I did double the amount of damage to the enemy team as their heaviest hitter did.
