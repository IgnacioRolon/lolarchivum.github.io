This has become very inconvenient for me and my friend when we decide to play together because we have to wait 5-10 minute intervals before going into a game. So we'd spend about 3 hours playing with only about 3-4 games being played. Please look into this, because i know you guys are trying to make it so only the new client is being played but im sure many others are having the same problem and have to stick to the old client.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-11T03:18:08.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely shouldn't be taking *that* long to get the after match lobby to pull up, so I'm curious if there is something blocking your connection from grabbing that match data from our servers.
