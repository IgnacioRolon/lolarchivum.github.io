Thats what was changed from solo Q. Solo Q you could queue with 1 other person in the old system correct..?\n\nSo why would dynamic queue mean 2,3,4 when solo queue was 1 or 2... I dont queue with 3 4 or 5 people i never do. Ive had 1 game with a 3 man premade in the past 3 weeks and that was it. So i dont deserve a ''dynamic badge'' when ive done nothing but solo qued or qued with a friend. Majority of my games are solo tho","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-07-12T20:01:10.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes you could queue up with one other person in the old system, but that isn't technically a \"solo queue,\" it's a duo queue.

Majority of my games are solo Q. No reason to have a dynamic queue badge.

Out of the 165 games played in ranked, of the 87 wins as well as the 25 games it asked for once badges were released to get my solo badge I was able to hold onto it for 1 day because after 3 ranked games in a row with some pals I met it changed my preference to Dynamic. I've played 3-4 ranked games since, still Dynamic even though this entire season I have made it a personal goal to climb solo. With under at most 10 games of the 165 with anyone other than myself, there is something obviously wrong with the system. I've already read that it works as a 'vast' majority of ranked games being solo, I'd consider 155 solo games in ranked to be vast. I did what you asked and got the solo badge from the 25 wins alone and after all of that you take it away after 3 games? I honestly want to know what's going on with this system I've played an extra equal number of solo games and I know the badge isn't much but it's a nice reminder of what I've done for those moments when tilt starts to hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"batyman4u","date":"2016-08-14T02:06:19.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I almost never rank with anyone else so I don't know why I have dynamic queue when I rank alone","replies":[]},{"poster":"Macbeth n Cheese","date":"2016-07-13T02:48:39.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having this issue.
