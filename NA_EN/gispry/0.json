I have tried this many times, I have logged out and logged in many times I have restarted the link many times and still nothing. The link is broken, I have talked to friends and the link is broken for them too, so it is not just a me problem. Also, why is there not a board for problems with links, league has links everywhere so this must happen frequently enough for there to be a board about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T05:38:59.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aware of the issues with this page for some players.

It appears the problem is caused by an API request going to https://yir.na.leagueoflegends.com/stats/v1/private and returning a status result of \"503 Service Unavailable\". This causes the personal status Javascript code to fail and return you to the general stats page. \n\nI've put in a bug report with the details... here's hoping they fix it soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lamb of Anubis","date":"2016-12-14T12:20:45.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am super frustrated about that.
