As he is unable to post on Boards due to too low level, I want to relay his message to you.\r\n\r\nAny feedback or messages of support for his artwork are welcome!\r\n\r\n> Hello everyone 🙂\r\n\r\n> When I started playing League a few years ago, the first champion that I played and my favorite till this day is Dr. Mundo.\r\nSince there was a vote pool about 2 months ago for Zaun champion rework, Mundo did not win his rework so I decided to try and do rework myself. I imagined Mundo as this colossal monster that roams around dark valleys of Zaun. I got a lot of my inspiration from characters such as Jack the Ripper. The idea was to present him as some sort of mix between Hulk and Jack the Ripper ( long coat, colossal body, veins, ripping clothes and of course his iconic cleaver.) \"Mundo goes where he pleases\".\r\n\r\n> Dr. Mundo is the property of Riot Games, I do not own rights to this character, this is fan art.\r\n\r\n> Rito pls rework my man Mundo T T\r\n\r\n> Hope you guys like him. 🙂\r\n\r\n\r\nconcept by Ivan Đuđar \r\n\r\nYou can find him drawing all sorts of games related stuff on Instagram @[dudidraws](https://www.instagram.com/dudidraws)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-08-30T01:09:43.632+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He kinda reminds me of a combination of Jack the Ripper and Frankenstein's Monster. I gotta say, this one is actually one of the very best Dr. Mundo rework concepts I have seen to this point (and I am searching the interwebs alot for it, mind you).\n\n__________________\n\nThe clothing style and this big, towering bodyshape are really great, imo. He feels unnerving, I can imagine people getting terrorised by encountering him in the depths of Zaun. The only critique I have is that his head, which is _tiny_ compared to the rest of his model, looks a bit ridiculous. But since Dr. Mundo has to keep some weird stuff about him, I think that is actually fine.\n\nI am in **love** with the syringe glove. It's something that makes him more of a dr. and not just some insane maniac with a cleaver. Syringes are something that I want a champion to utilise for quite some time now and I think giving them Dr. Mundo is the right call, since the syringe that got stuck in his shoulder has been iconic for him and this is a way to homage it.\n\nYou can be proud, my dude, this work is truly amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-30T05:35:33.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The syringe glove is great since, for his ultimate, he could inject himself with it to get the super regen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OoTriloDiveroO","date":"2019-08-30T10:09:08.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!\nI very like this concept rework for Mundo,especially the design with his face,it's look very psychopathic as it must be!\n\nBut there is my question,how his E works? it's something what improve his next AA,or it just work when you are click the enemy?\nAnd how his ult works?because i don't get it...\n\nAbout the Q i don't know,it's kinda boring by my opinion,for that i have an idea!\n\n\nThere is two options how to use it:\n\nFirst cast:Mundo chage his next AA.When Mundo hits an enemy champion/minion/tower he will deal physical damage,something like Darius W/Garen Q/Trundle Q/Illaoi W.\n\nHold on:Mundo throw his cleaver on one direction.If it hits an enemy champion/minion/monster it will deal physical damage.\n\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Large Black Man","date":"2019-08-30T12:06:13.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your idea of Q, it needs some improvement, my idea was pretty much the same as his current Q.\n\nIdea was to slow enemies with Q or cleaver toss, then get close to them so you can inject them with your W and give them sort of \"debuff\" that allows you to heal more from your basics. E is sort of the same thing like Warwick e, gives you shield and on second cast fears enemies. \n\nUltimate gives him speed and health reg as does the current Ult, but gives him attack speed and cone attack pattern like Titanic Hydra has. I imagined him like some psycho on killing spree that runs and slashes everything in his path.","replies":[{"poster":"OoTriloDiveroO","date":"2019-08-31T08:40:01.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Large Black Man,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=tG3RzKJk,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2019-08-30T12:06:13.763+0000)\n>\n> I like your idea of Q, it needs some improvement, my idea was pretty much the same as his current Q.\n> \n> Idea was to slow enemies with Q or cleaver toss, then get close to them so you can inject them with your W and give them sort of \"debuff\" that allows you to heal more from your basics.
