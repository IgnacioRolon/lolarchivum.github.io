Then I ranked and due to soft reset i do as well but to lesser extent. So why is it that norms even since I got put in B2. Feels like I&#039;m stomping B5 scrubs. I&#039;m S4-2 elo and I will get there when I get time. But when I want to have fun or learn a champ. Going 11 2 8 is not healthy for getting better","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-02-29T05:42:29.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got to be perfectly honest, this is the first time i've seen someone complain about stomping to hard.  \n\nJust keep playing norms and stomping, focus on cs or map pressure if you want to improve while stomping.  The matchmaking will figure it out eventually if you win enough games.","replies":[{"poster":"Paladin 0f Life","date":"2016-02-29T05:46:55.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want to get better. And with norm I don't but when I ranked with same mentality I don't do as well. Ppl don't harass or trade either well or at all in norms and freezing just seems like easy win after you roam.","replies":[]}]}]}
