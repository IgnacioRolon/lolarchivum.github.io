I&#039;m unsure if it&#039;s intentional or not but it sorta feels weird that all her other animations have bats, and her heal doesn&#039;t follow that theme.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-10T02:55:12.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"It would probably have bumped her up a skin tier to do more custom particles.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-11-10T21:27:34.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do you ever read before you write? There would be no extra custom particle, it's always had bats, but it's bugged now and no longer works in human form and Katey is saying it's intentional so whatever. Replacing a particle with an already done one literally takes seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-10T23:53:43.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"...Why are you being so rude? Just because *a* bat particle already exists does not mean that they would reuse the same one, and they would still have to do work with it, not just plug in the bats where the leaves were.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-11-11T00:00:37.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that's actually exactly what it means since it's literally the exact same effect and that's how it was. It wasn't meant as rude, it was meant to show you that I face palm any time I ever read anything you write. Most people do, they just don't care to respond.
