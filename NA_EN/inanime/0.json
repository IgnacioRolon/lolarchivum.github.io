I tried to log on the day after, but the log-in screen stated that I have been permanently banned and an email was sent. The email stated that I have been accused for \"use of 3rd party programs or modifications\". \r\nI submitted a ticket about it. However, the employee \"Borrower\" stated that the permaban will remain and later accuses me of scripting. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to prove that I did not script (because I obviously did not and have played all my games like a normal human being)? I suggested the employee to review the game clips, because it shows all the full-length games, but I'm pretty this person did not, since it wants to keep me banned...","replies":[{"poster":"cluvie","date":"2017-04-13T22:09:03.744+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey @OP --\n\nBorrower and I took another look at your account and confirmed that the detection on the account is accurate. It was picked up for cheating in some URF games back in early March. \n\nPoking further, however, it looks like this took place on under some rogue access on the account from another state. We've forced reset the password on your account as a precaution, but you should be able to log in again once you complete it as the suspension has been lifted as a one-time exception. Apologies for missing this the first time.\n\nHere's some additional tips on account security in case you need it: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664","replies":[{"poster":"Evan PogChamp","date":"2017-04-13T23:20:27.278+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"There have been other false detections in the last round of bans.

Someone gained unauthorized access to their account and used applications that violated the Terms of Use. The detection systems are pretty accurate, and they're quick to identify any sources of false positives in the cases where there may be some.","replies":[{"poster":"Evan PogChamp","date":"2017-04-14T00:43:54.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can only speak for my own case i suppose, but I most certainly have never used a 3rd party program or had my account compromised but was just randomly perma'd the other day.   A lot of others have also expressed confusion and complained leading me to think there was some error in the last batch of bans. Hopefully somebody takes a look into those who are affected and corrects this mess.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PurpléHazéOG","date":"2017-04-14T22:00:53.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any chance that u could look into my account too?\nLast time i was banned for 3rd party programs was like almost a year ago and i stopped using anything that could modify the game in any way.\nAnd my ticket response is same like  Inanimation's , they accused me for using scripts too even tho i was on a loosing streak.\nIs it probably because the files were still changed or something?\nI,m not really a computer guy so....\nThank you in advance!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Odd Weed","date":"2019-10-16T03:22:37.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't played in months . i also have never used any software what so ever, i have spent hundreds of dollars on this account i would never jeopardize my account, i haven't even seriously tried ranked until last season this makes no sense at all. i have never used any third party software hell i don't even use macros!! i play this game solely to connect with old friends from high school. this is wrong and i have been false accused who in there right mind would spend money on a game just to gamble with the rules?! can i speak to an admin or something? throw me a bone here..","replies":[]},{"poster":"DONT NEEEED TEAM","date":"2017-04-16T21:58:52.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you please look into my account it was false banned aswell","replies":[]},{"poster":"DONT NEEEED TEAM","date":"2017-04-14T21:43:46.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"plz look at my bann to i was false banned aswell and would like to play this long weekend","replies":[]},{"poster":"DONT NEEEED TEAM","date":"2017-04-14T12:07:35.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"look at mine too plz","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aZ3R0n","date":"2017-04-13T17:09:41.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A lot of players seem to be experiencing the same issue, and you'll need to send in a support ticket and talk to the Riot staff:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new\n\nThey do bans for using third party software in waves, and sometimes mistakes are made. Politely explain your situation and be patient, it will take up to a day for you to get your first reply. Continue to explain your situation and mention that there have been many players speaking up on the forum about being banned by mistake during this wave and ask for a manual review of your account. If Riot conducts the review and finds that you indeed did nothing wrong then your account will have the ban removed.\n\nThe key here is patience as you go through the motions.\nGood luck!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"nathan85fc","date":"2017-04-16T03:23:31.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me about a year ago.

Get a permaban email out of nowhere yesterday afternoon saying i was using 3rd party software. I have never cheated or modified the client, I didn't even know what scripting was until i went over to the forums to research. I've never even had a chat ban in the 5 plus years of this account. I haven't the slightest idea what could have made them think my account should be banned. I'm already 2 emails into a submitted ticket on what looks to be a revolving door of Me- \"I got banned im innocent\", riot- \"We're sry, we are never wrong, we banned you, too bad.\"but I'm still holding out hope I guess, especially if more cases like this come to light although from what I've seen on the forums it seems pretty hopeless.","replies":[{"poster":"Evan PogChamp","date":"2017-04-14T14:18:41.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their system seems to have falsely incriminated a number of innocent players (myself included), and they are failing to connect the dots.
