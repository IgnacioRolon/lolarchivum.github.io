I want to tell you that I had problems with Nunu and Jhin ult. Every time I used Jhin R I can&#039;t fire bullets, it just won&#039;t fire bullets! Also, Nunu R cannot be stopped. Every time I used it, I can&#039;t stop it and deal damage, I need to wait whole charge ( as you probably know, for 3 seconds, R activates circle that will explode and deal damage to nearby enemies and slow them ).  Can you help me please???\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP. S.

It sounds like maybe your R key is jammed, or you are using a macro/script that is blocking repeated rapid presses of R. \nHave you tried rebinding ult to another key?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-11-05T19:26:47.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe Nunu can only cancel his ult if you put in a move command.
