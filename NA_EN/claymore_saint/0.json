BullFrog kench would be the first kench with out his whiskers. Basically the thought for him came in when I was thinking about cannibalistic bull frogs and how they will eat literally anything.... I had one for a pet once and his bite hurt. These guys don&#039;t have teeth, just snappy gums and a sticky tongue. They are literally the real work tahm kench in small green form. So while the drawing may not be the greatest, maybe you can agree, the idea is perfect for a skin for him.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-09-27T01:34:46.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111133736/3381272-is%2Beverybody%2Bjust%2Briding%2Bthe%2Bbandwagon%2Bor%2Bdid%2Bsomeone%2Bactually%2B_d66a313eaf636e554cc60949c81e9f3e.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Unpaladin","date":"2016-10-01T22:04:20.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This needs to be a thing immediately\nEither that or a totally radical Pool Party skin for him looking like this next year","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-10-01T22:07:33.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nova Force,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=ILsxhkWn,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-10-01T22:04:20.451+0000)\n>\n> This needs to be a thing immediately\n> Either that or a totally radical Pool Party skin for him looking like this next year\n\nString Bikini Kench?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-09-27T23:33:51.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tahm kench , zac and idk skins?","replies":[{"poster":"Claymore Saint","date":"2016-09-30T20:59:06.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol those are the battle toads","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-10-01T22:03:32.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know, but i want them to be skins","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
