Also, her Sinister Steel and bouncing blades are so much easier to see. They were so hard to see before. Any chance of changing her Grievous wounds animation in her Project Skin? Also some parts of her voice over, are so loud and have bad quality are you currently working on it?\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-15T23:09:17.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We try to keep status effects equal across the board so they don't impact gameplay clarity, which is why we aren't changing Grievous Wounds for PROJECT: Katarina.
