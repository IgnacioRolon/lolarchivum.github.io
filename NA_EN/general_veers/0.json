I am using Firefox for Win 8.1 x64 with NoScript add-on permitting all scripts but googlegadgetmanager.com and newrelic.com.  I'd be fine with allowing those scripts, but don't think they're the problem (since the site works as expected like 80% of the time)\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Catzpaw,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=G9ysKafJ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-24T00:16:11.544+0000)\n>\n> If you could verify that this isn't what is happening and that you are getting redirected regardless, then I can escalate this.\n\nThanks for looking into this!

Another thing, this is also why some people think they are randomly logged out. I remember seeing a post before about the site logging them out and not letting them log back in. Reason for this, is cause they clicked on an EUW boards page, then went back to the NA boards, and it switches to EUW which they are logged out on because wrong server page.\n\nI remember this happening to me a few times, and thought it was a log out bug. When trying to backtrack what happened of why it would do that, I had noticed it said EUW at the top and then realized I had clicked on an EUW link earlier that someone has posted. What I think happens is some people post EUW links, and people don't realize it and click on it, and then the boards switch on them like a ninja. Then they are on EUW boards, and can't login and post and can't figure out why.\n\nI think there should be something stickied about boards secretly switching on them. Something like \"Always look at the beginning of the link and if it says EUW or something else, the boards might switch on you\" or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-02-19T01:21:03.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldn't happen to be browsing any posts on the EUW forums (boards or the old one), would you?
