We are currently looking for all 5 roles ( Adc, Jungle, Support, Mid, Top )\r\nFirst off i would like to say that Xtreme is a partner of XE Sniping which their link will be linked below and they have 5k on Youtube and we will be posting videos on Youtube and streaming weekly so if you are into doing that then this team is great for you, however if you are not a streamer or if you don't record don't be discouraged because you still want you to be about of XE. We will only be judging based off of skill so do not worry about your rank, if you feel like you have the ability to make this team then feel free to post a response. The only thing we are asking is that you have a mic and that you can play at least 5 days a week. If you are interested in joining please post a response with the following information and if we are interested we will contact you.\r\nAge:\r\nRole:\r\nBest Champions:\r\nRank:\r\nIGN:\r\nWhy do you want to join XE?","replies":[{"poster":"Bandles Devil","date":"2014-11-28T23:37:37.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age: 17\nRole: Mid\nBest Champions: {{champion:238}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:34}} \nRank: Gold 3\nIGN: StylishExecution\nWhy do you want to join XE?: Sick of players not being dedicated to a team, and this thread seems pretty legit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlwaysAnUnderDog","date":"2014-11-28T23:59:20.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age:23\nRole:ADC\nBest Champions: Sivir/Corki/Vayne/Lucian\nRank: G5\nIGN:AlwaysAnUnderDog\nWhy do you want to join XE?

Ive been on multiple teams spanding all the way back from season 3. Im currently the team captain of one and most of the people on my team dont really care and im always the one trying to analize and get things going i just need a break from that. \n\nWeakness/Strenghts: For marksman I would say I struggle in the laning phase the most and out laning phase would be my strongest. Top lane I am fine playing whatever the team needs , Aggro,Farm,Ap - champ wise. I usually try to farm more than being aggro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coach Brownjo","date":"2014-11-28T23:44:09.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age:22\nRole:jungle/support\nBest Champions:{{champion:64}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:40}} \nRank:Gold 4\nIGN: Earohim\nWhy do you want to join XE? love being competitive and would love to have games streamed.. love the community and I believe I have the skill to make things pretty awesome to watch :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Mid","date":"2014-11-28T21:03:19.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age: 19\nRole: support\nBest Champions: thresh,leona,nami,janna,vel\nRank: d3\nIGN: selfz\nWhy do you want to join XE? look like a team that wants to go somewhere, with the right players might reach something great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Regalian Knight","date":"2014-11-28T20:31:10.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age: 18\nRole: Top/Jung/ADC\nBest Champions: \nTop- {{champion:266}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:68}} / \nJung- {{champion:254}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:57}} / \nADC- {{champion:236}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:222}} \nRank: Silver 3\nIGN: Regalian Knight\nWhy do you want to join XE? I've been looking for a team for a while now to better myself. You can always find the flaws in your skill when you're with someone constantly.  From the looks of your post as well I can tell how serious you guys are about this ranked team and I can totally see the drive you guys have and want to be included. I don't stream unfortunately but I won't let that hinder me from giving my best for the team. Hope to hear from you guys!","replies":[]},{"poster":"eyes wide shut","date":"2014-11-28T19:38:41.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Age: 24\nRole: Top\nBest Champions: Gnar, Jarvan, Irelia, Gangplank, Nidalee, Lee Sin\nRank: G4 in solo queue, P3 in 5v5's\nIGN: eyes wide shut\nWhy do you want to join XE? You guys seem as though you are serious about making a team, and it has been very difficult to find 4 people that are serious and play regularly. I have a mic, I stream occasionally (although I don't get many viewers) and I play every day. I'm always looking to improve, and I hope I get a try out. :)","replies":[]}]}
