Even in my wow dies, i loved going pyro mage, and sub rogue (i think), just because I liked DOTs, i liked the way they feel. League does not have that many true DOT champs, and by DOT champs, i mean champs where their damage-over-time abilities do a consistently high amount of damage. This roster consists of {{champion:69}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:68}} (talon and rumble to a lesser degree ){{champion:90}} . It makes me sad to see that we are losing a DOT champ like Swain, when we already have so few. Swain&#039;s DOT ability was part of what we drew me to him for about 3 years and I&#039;m sad the new swain has none of this. I mean I guess his ult kind of counts as one, but...it&#039;s just not the same.\n\nI hope to see some new champs that use DOTs in a new way this year!","replies":[{"poster":"Rexxiee","date":"2018-01-27T01:55:17.838+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"They removed all the uniqueness from swain and made him another genenic ap champ that also looks like your generic warlock.\n\nAnd im surprised you missed singed, hes like the main champ in the game that has like 95% of his damage being a DoT.","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2018-01-27T02:11:49.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha i knew i was missing someone","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-01-27T01:40:18.713+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:27}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tails9016","date":"2018-01-27T00:13:41.273+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lists DoT champs, doesn't list {{champion:77}} \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ERUHAEn.gif[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2018-01-27T01:16:30.301+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"who?","replies":[{"poster":"Tails9016","date":"2018-01-27T01:34:09.685+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/ERUHAEn.gif[/img]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ERUHAEn.gif[/img]\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ERUHAEn.gif[/img]\n\nBut yeah, Udyr is almost non-existent right now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"THE D1C","date":"2018-01-27T02:04:43.618+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassination Rogues were all about the DOTs Sub was good for Shadow Step and the Vanish reset.","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2018-01-27T02:11:04.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i couldn't remember if it was assassination or sub, i was leaning towards assassination in my head lol","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2018-01-27T04:16:47.301+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a dot lover, I’m surprised you didn’t mention warlocks, haha","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2018-01-27T17:36:52.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yeah! affliction warlocks!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tokogawaruf","date":"2018-01-27T05:52:18.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Sickness Warlock or something wasnt it?\n\nSoul Fracments activated and shower the enemy in 6 different DoTs, rinse and repeat.\n\nMy Soul hurts","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tykenn","date":"2018-01-27T02:38:32.733+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think {{champion:122}} deserves to be listed as a DoT champion, his bleed does quite a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay918","date":"2018-01-27T04:47:19.041+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tykenn,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YRMBZsrJ,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2018-01-27T02:38:32.733+0000)\n>\n> I think {{champion:122}} deserves to be listed as a DoT champion, his bleed does quite a lot.\n\nDoT champ would denote damage over time being their main source of damage.\n\nBleed is not darius's main source of damage, it's only one of his main sources of damage.","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2018-01-27T20:18:10.727+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tychusfindlay918,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YRMBZsrJ,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2018-01-27T04:47:19.041+0000)\n>\n> DoT champ would denote damage over time being their main source of damage.\n> \n> Bleed is not darius&#x27;s main source of damage, it&#x27;s only one of his main sources of damage.\n\nThen take out Brand, Fizz, and Talon, too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tykenn","date":"2018-01-27T05:03:54.584+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then the only dot champion in league would be teemo by those standards.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-01-27T04:26:56.362+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:136}} \n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n\nyour just like riot, leaving poor sol out of things","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2018-01-27T04:45:02.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sol is uh, not a DoT champion.

Up until now, DoTs have mainly just been treated as a different, less clear form of nuke, and that is also what has pushed Riot to compress some of them into more instant burst, as is the case for Ryze's new kit. This I think is kind of misguided, because I personally believe DoTs can have a lot of unique gameplay of their own, and could have much more clarity with just a few UI changes. I think even Riot talked about this when reworking the health bars, but there was mention of displaying DoTs and HoTs on the health bar as differently-colored portions of depleting or regenerating health. Doing so would finally allow DoTs to have their exact value displayed for everyone to see, and would give them a lot more clarity as a result.\n\nIn gameplay terms, I also think DoTs have intrinsic value relative to instant nukes in that they can offer opponents more options to fight back. Because DoTs happen over time, having more of them could establish a greater difference between champions with lots of static health, who are good against burst but not to persistent damage, and champions with a lot of sustain, who are weak to burst but who can heal through DPS. Additionally, particularly prolonged DoTs could create situations where they'd be guaranteed to kill a target, but would give their victim the time to retaliate: one missed opportunity with Talon's DoT, for example, is that it could have turned his victim into a dead man walking, guaranteeing their eventual death but giving them an extra window of time to fight back as he escapes. Similarly, it would complement Singed and Fizz's hit-and-run gameplay much more, and could allow more champions to inflict \"burst\" in a less bursty manner, thereby making them a little more interactive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-01-27T04:34:32.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Get Ogre Here","date":"2018-01-27T04:35:03.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Get Ogre Here,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YRMBZsrJ,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-01-27T04:34:32.556+0000)\n>\n> I think DOT champs (namely Malzahar and current Swain) are really oppressive in lane, Brand and Teemo are super annoying to play against, But the other ones are tolerable.
