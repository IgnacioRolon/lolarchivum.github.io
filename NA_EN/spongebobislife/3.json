Her weak state problems also  extends to other champs in different ways, it's not limited to her as a champion, as is the case with Azir, Ryze, Elise, Karma etc. But those are executable in the hands of skilled players in Solo Q, whereas Kalista has difficulty finding independent success. \n\nBut in Kalista's case, her entire kit effectiveness is tied to her kit, if she doesn't have her support near her, she loses nearly half of her abilities. The Soulbind Mechanic is so wonky and disjointed that not playing with a duo with comms will seriously hinder your chances of getting sginificant success. Couple this with the slew of extremely lazy nerfs by Riot (90% AA scaling lmfao) that ultimately crippled her ability to function as an ADC, instead she serves as a Kirby with shitty DPS. The direction Riot took with the 6.6 nerfs onward have been the absolute worst, since they made her legitimately unfun to play.\n\nMy solution? Remove the Black Spear, give her a more sensible ulti than damage less Malphite Ulti/ get out of jail card for supports and remove these absolutely ridiculous nerfs that did nothing to fix her issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Lolman978","date":"2018-05-05T00:27:17.911+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">a Kirby with shitty DPS\n\nSo she sucks?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-05-05T00:38:04.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Masala Chai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VvbsnvEB,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2018-05-04T18:59:49.127+0000)\n> \n> But in Kalista's case, her entire kit effectiveness is tied to her kit, if she doesn't have her support near her, she loses nearly half of her abilities.
