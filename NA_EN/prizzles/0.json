I am a massive TSM fan, have been since season 2, but the game has shifted and it just isn&#039;t good enough to play tanky initiators and not make plays in the top lane. Balls Rumble is a perfect representation of that. I can&#039;t remember the last time that Dyrus carried a game. I think I remember it happening one game last season as Sion. \r\n\r\nHe either needs to step his game up and start making plays again or it is time for him to move on. The fact that Bjergsen had almost a 100 cs lead in the mid lane and they wren&#039;t able to win that game is on Dyrus and WildTurtle.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Pixy Misa","date":"2015-05-30T20:19:49.167+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The urgot pick was lame.

Yeah it's Balls' Rumble, but giving away Ashe is also really risky for a few reasons: 1. The Ashe synergizes well with Morgana (who'd also be a huge denial pick) and those are two champions both Sneaky and Lemon are extremely comfortable on. Another reason would be if Balls gets ahead, it's not always the end of the world unless he's on something like Hecarim, but if an ADC like Sneaky gets ahead, you're gonna be hard-pressed to try and shut him down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lańce","date":"2015-05-30T20:19:06.882+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really lck plays maokai still.
