My understanding is that the masteries will be expanded and I was wondering what are the niches you feel need to addressed with more masteries options. \r\n\r\nI was personally hoping to get an exp boost mastery kind of like a mini old Zil passive that is on when in range of an ally. \r\n\r\nAre there any updates when it comes to masteries and their current state?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-21T18:53:38.046+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"We'd like to add some new masteries into the trees at some point and had originally intended to do so during the mid-season patch.
