What is weirder though is that it counted the Victory but not LP?? Would I be able to get the LP?? Please help guys!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-20T03:59:50.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still not seeing the LP from this match? If it hasn't shown up by now, try swapping over to the Legacy Client (from login) to check if your LP is listed differently there.\n\nLet me know what you find out.","replies":[{"poster":"50 mits","date":"2017-01-20T12:52:38.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Checked both the new and the Legacy client and both haven't updated...Still both have counted the victory but not the LP earned from it...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-22T21:37:35.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems the reason you didn't see any LP gain from this match was because you were in *the negatives* in LP value due to a stint of queue dodging just before the match in question. Since the Client has a hard time displaying negative values, you only saw 0LP before and after the match, when in reality, your LP value was in the negatives and that single win brought you even.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"50 mits","date":"2017-01-23T21:54:51.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for awnsering,I figgured it out too after reading the penaltys for leaving in match select in Ranked games.So now that I'm at 0LP and have lost 3-4 matches,does that mean that I am in the negative values?? And if I win the next game It will still show me that I have 0LP beacuse it used this LP to lessen my negative LP??","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-23T23:26:08.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, if you queue dodge continuously after your LP balance reaches 0 ~~lose matches after you've hit 0~~ (**EDIT:** I was informed you'll only enter negative LP by queue dodging until your LP loss brings you into the negatives), you'll be going into the negative values in LP. From your end, you'll see points above 0 once you've earned enough LP to get out of the negatives.\n\nI hope that makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"50 mits","date":"2017-01-24T14:39:11.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah thanks.So there is no way to tell how much LP I need to get out of the negatives??

Also, I edited my comment above after I was corrected by one of the members of our game team. You can only enter negative LP values by queue dodging after your LP value has already reached 0.","replies":[{"poster":"50 mits","date":"2017-01-25T13:47:18.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So...If I win a match while I'm at 0LP without queue dodging at 0LP I will get immidiately above 0LP??
