So how does that work and I see a lot of people asking for the champions ?\r\n I mean are we actually becoming kind to each other ? \r\nWhen I started no one wanted to gift anything :') makes me happy that the player base has become more grown up. \r\nHopefully I can see you guys in the game . I don't have the 6300ip or 7800ip to gift to anyone I myself don't have the champions but I guess I have to work hard to earn my ip and get those 2 champs.\r\n\r\nWell I'll be seeing you on the summoners rift  ;) hopefully these changes will make the game more interactive.\r\nAdd me my ign is SKT T1 Madafaker \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
