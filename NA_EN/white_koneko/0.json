Sometimes. \r\n\r\nNow though.....I have to ask. Am I the ONLY person to have to lean forward to read pre-game chat, or otherwise see ANYTHING in the box before a game loads? Cause the text is TINY. And I mean that. I'm leaning in so closely to my monitor my prescription really is going to get stronger, cause I'm still straining my eyes. For instance, yes, trying to read pre-game chat was definitely a challenge just now. After the game though? I got curious to see the Advanced Details of the match I had just finished, so of course, I click on the button. And damn son...the page the popped up? Couldn't read a THING without being literally 2 inches away from my monitor. WTF. So like I said: before, I could write it off on bad eye sight. Now though? PLEASE FIX THIS, RIOT!\r\n\r\nFF Realm Reborn on the PS4 managed to fix their display. PLEASE do the same here!! You'll spare my eyes from straining and prevent a headache in the mix as well &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"White Koneko","date":"2016-12-11T07:26:56.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm good now!

Are you also using 4K?  It's not currently supported, so you may run into some visual issues especially when tabbing in/out.  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
