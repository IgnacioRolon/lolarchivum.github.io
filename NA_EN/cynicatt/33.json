So... I did the unthinkable and opened my mouth over Vent to say &quot;I was gonna Kat if that&#039;s ok&quot;. \r\nI got an instant answer of &quot;ok that sounds good&quot; from the questioner, but then the silent guy spoke up with a &quot;What the fuck?&quot; we get into champ select and Mr silent instantly locks in Kat. he says &quot;She&#039;s a fucking girl, let her play support, she probably can&#039;t fucking play anything else. She&#039;d probably feed the fuck out of mid&quot;. So it was agreed among the other 4 of us that I would play support, and Mr quiet who had often been polite and complimentary towards me ranted and raged and cursed about me all fucking game while feeding the living fuck out of mid because he sucked at Kat. \r\nWe ultimately lost the game, with our Kat not scoring a single kill, and Mr Silent left Vent with a &quot;You guys can keep fucking playing with HER then, You know where to find me when you stop thinking with your dicks&quot;.\r\nAnd with that they removed me one by one, with my best friend of the bunch only PMing  me &quot;sorry&quot; before removing me himself. \r\n\r\nI have had a lot of instances of people reacting poorly to my gender, but that one sucked the worst.","replies":[]}
