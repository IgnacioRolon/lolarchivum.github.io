First there is dog form\r\nhttps://gamingreinvented.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ZygardeDogForme.png\r\nwhich is, ok, pretty cool. I really like it.\r\nThen there&#039;s the zygarde core and the zygarde cell\r\nhttp://www.serebii.net/pokemon/zygardecore.jpg http://www.serebii.net/pokemon/zygardecell.jpg\r\nOk, fine... it&#039;s stupid, but whatever. Then there&#039;s fucking Zygarde PERFECT\r\nhttp://www.serebii.net/pokemon/zygardeperfect.jpg\r\nand it&#039;s a goddamn mess. None of these things even come close to matching a theme of any sort. Just please. Please stop.","replies":[]}
