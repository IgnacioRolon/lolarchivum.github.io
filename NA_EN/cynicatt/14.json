I&#039;m thinking MF with that new Firecannon item, maybe?\r\nI honestly liked what I saw, until I started getting down the to some of the items and actually reading out the new mastery trees.\r\nMasteries are basically braindead now, but I hate them anyway so not really that upset.\r\n\r\nExcitement for the sightstone+gold income combo items, but at the same time, the glowly ball of go fast was nerfed and it is currently my favorite support item. And also, now if you upgrade the sightstone to be goldyrocks, you can&#039;t also get a support item, right? So we&#039;ll see how that goes. Probably a good thing for those &quot;supports&quot; who play Brand(or other dps) bot and build straight damage with no wards.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m digging the trinket changes as well, since now nobody will have to remember up grade it.
