I am also having this issue. It also only happens the first time after restarting my computer, and once I manage to log in once, I can log in fine until I restart my computer again. Switching to a different WiFi and then switching back will sometimes cause this issue, just like restarting my computer does.\n\nI have a fix. And it's really really dumb.\n\nIf I have my password on my clipboard, and I click ctrl+v (paste) and then hit enter as SOON as the client pops up (like less than a tenth of a second), it seems to log in fine. If I spend 3-4 seconds typing out my really long password and then hit enter, it will give me the \"disconnected from PVP.net\" error almost every single time and then close the client.\n\nI'm 99% sure this means your client is derping and doing something to cause the issue while it's waiting for me to type my password, because my \"fix\" really makes absolutely no sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cynicatt","date":"2015-01-17T06:09:39.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=cmMHQdco,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2015-01-17T03:00:28.138+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for following up with a reply!\n> \n> Since it still seems to be consistently failing still, regardless of these steps, I would like to rule out your connection as a root cause.
