The first time might be 0% of 10gb; if you let it run for 4 gb, maybe the next time is 0% of the 6gb that are left.\n\nI'm not certain whether the League client works this way or whether it starts from the beginning each time. If you right click on the folder where you installed League and click 'properties', it'll show you how big the folder is; you can use this to check if more is being downloaded each time.\n\nIf you have a friend with League installed, you could get them to upload their league directory. Then you can download it part by part, and copy it to your directory when you're done. Then run the client and do a full repair.\n\n> Suddenly it hikes to 13GB. I have earlier had this game, and it was around 7 GB.\n\nRight now, league has both the files for both the new client and the legacy client (just in case the new client breaks and they have to turn the legacy back on). In a patch or two they'll remove the legacy client files and it'll go down a bit. It'll still be bigger than you remember, though -- every skin they add takes up some more space, and skins aren't going away!","replies":[{"poster":"100Zeref001","date":"2017-05-02T15:09:53.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 'm not certain whether the League client works this way or whether it starts from the beginning each time.
