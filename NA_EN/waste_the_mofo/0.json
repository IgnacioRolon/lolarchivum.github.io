But this time was a mistake considering i was gone for a couple of minutes and got leaver buster. the team did a remake vote because one of our guys was afk. I wasn't and know have to wait 20 minutes for 4 games, I'm hoping that i could at least get a reason as to why i got leaver buster and the other guy did/didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-06T17:47:08.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way the [/Remake System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) works is, during the first 3 minutes of a match on Summoner's Rift, any player inactive for 90 seconds or more will be marked and will trigger the remake option to become available. Even if someone else has not connected to the match, you should continue to play the game normally until the remake prompt appears, otherwise you may be marked by the system.\n\nLet me know if this cleared it up for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Waste the mofo","date":"2016-09-10T19:35:20.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that makes sense. Got it again after laptop froze and had to restart it. Also I believe they should at least us leaver buster on ranked matches, not aram.","replies":[]}]}]}
