It sounds like your connection handoff between the champ select and gameservers is going wrong due to an *unstable connection*. I'd like you to go through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), which addresses the most common network settings that cause these issues.\n\nIf you still experience these issues after taking those steps, let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PythonArms","date":"2016-12-31T08:28:00.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also can't get past champion select.\n\nSpecific Problem: After champion select (on any game mode), the timer counts down to zero and the game tries to switch from the launcher to the game. It crashes and gives me a bug splat error. It puts me back to the launcher with the reconnect button. When I press reconnect, it does the exact same thing with the same bugsplat.\n\nThings I have tried: \n- Clean windows boot \n- older graphic card drivers \n- updating DirectX \n- update Java \n- compatibility mode \n- run as administrator \n- turning off firewall \n- turning off anti-virus \n- uninstalling/reinstalling LoL and cleaning the registry \n- repairing LoL through launcher\n\nNone of these things in any combination seem to get me into a game. I have leaverbuster now from the ARAM games I was trying to play, so I switched to custom games to try and troubleshoot but still not luck. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm at my wits end here.\n**\nEDIT/UPDATE **This worked for me: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/X6sPFPu8-fps-drops-and-crashes-after-the-windows-10-anniversary-update","replies":[]}]}
