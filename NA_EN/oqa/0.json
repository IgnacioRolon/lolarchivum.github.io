I checked my email and nothing was there to tell me why, and yes I&#039;ve checked the spam and trash folders. Even logged into the site to make sure I was checking the right email. My question is why was my account permanently deleted? I had a 25 game chat restriction but even if I was toxic to someone why would you delete my account? I&#039;ve spent like $250 on it, what happened to maybe a 2-3 week ban at first???? Instant permanent ban? Really? Nor have I ever used a third party client or anything, and I figured it would tell me if that was what my account was banned for.","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2017-04-05T23:56:02.419+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your confusion confuses me: You tested a 3rd party scripting application in mid-February, and as we've definitely mentioned before, we're seriously not about that life.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-06T00:02:56.416+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw thank you anti-cheat team for coming out to the boards today and representing :D","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-04-06T01:12:49.342+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, your name is blue around these parts again?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-06T01:13:53.810+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh shit","replies":[{"poster":"TheMinez","date":"2017-04-06T13:45:11.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"waddup?","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-06T14:01:07.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"DTN was part of the Arbiter program before (since he's always trying to help people out).

Here's a [list of programs](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5dmkJinG-3rd-party-applicationsmodifications-whats-allowed-and-what-isnt) compiled by Wuks (that brilliant chap one comment above) that might give you an idea of some of the sorts of programs that are not allowed.  While it's not all-inclusive, as new programs are being written every day, and there's no possible way that all of them can be accounted for, it does give reasons listed as to why some of them are considered forbidden.  Perhaps it will give you a bit of a clue as to what sort of things you might want to avoid using on your other accounts.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheMinez","date":"2017-04-06T13:48:18.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://rs1112.pbsrc.com/albums/k486/Pokeriaicons/Healing%20Items/burnheal.png~c200\nIt is needed after that {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:14}}.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-05T23:17:12.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could take a little time to receive your email.
