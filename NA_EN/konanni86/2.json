Her original skin isn't even gothic at all, it's victorian.  I don't mind gothic (even like the look on some and admit sewn chaos is awesome), but Oriannas awkward and dark misunderstood side is NOT the only facet to her character, yet its the ONLY character attribute any of her skins play off of.  She needs a skin that represents the dancer, the robot that is trying to understand itself, and the human girl whose image she was made in and whose memories she has.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freidhiem","date":"2014-08-07T06:57:04.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any answer that inst Dragon Master Swain is just wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Don Bobo","date":"2014-08-07T04:09:09.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://elohell.net/chill/225079/soraka-skin-concept\n\nThis dark Soraka would be AWESOME!
