This is a known issue, I don't think that it has been fixed in 5.23. It comes up when you have two mastery pages with the same name but different capitalizations.  For example, \"Aa\" and \"aa\" would cause this error. To avoid getting it and to be able to save mastery pages, make sure you don't have any duplicates with the same name but different capitalizations. Hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paero","date":"2015-11-24T11:13:39.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"^Champion","replies":[]}]}
