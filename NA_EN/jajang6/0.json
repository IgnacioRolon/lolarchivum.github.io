I can see everything happen to my champion but I just cant move. Its been over a week now and I do not know what to do.  The game is virtually unplayable. The strange thing is that my wifi is working fine. No one else in the house has any problems so I cant determine where the problem lies. Is it something wrong with my laptop, wifi or league? One other thing i should add is that about at the same time this started happening we had a gues arrive in our house and connect her devices to the wifi which strangely causes my phone to disconnect until I reboot the motem. I originally thought this was the problem but I tried blocking all other devices from the wifi  and running league and still had the problem. I am really not a tech guy so if anyone can help me find the problem that would be great.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T03:06:15.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The symptoms you're describing are pretty common of *Packet Loss* or *High Packet Buffering*.
