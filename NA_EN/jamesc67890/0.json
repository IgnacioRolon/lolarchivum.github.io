Something like this could happen if your config was modified or became corrupt.  You mentioned input config stuff but I'm not totally sure what that means.  To be certain, your best bet would be a[ config reset](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues#mq2).\n\nIf that doesn't work, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our tech team will look into this with you individually.
