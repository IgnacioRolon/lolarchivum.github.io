You mentioned how it always happens specifically around the 20 minute mark. What I'm thinking is that something is happening at 20 minutes that your game isn't carrying out properly, and that thing is most likely Baron spawning if so. Perhaps you have some files that are either corrupt or missing that make the game freak out when they load, so try a client repair from the settings menu if you haven't first and foremost. Second, I always suggest making sure that your drivers are up to date when someone is experiencing FPS trouble.

Tried it a billion times the game is still messed up,even though I have some pretty decent specs for the game.\n\nNot only this,but it says on the top right corner that it runs at almost 90-130 FPS but has minor stutters and  1 sec freezes.\n\nP.S: Tried the \"Disable Full Screen Optimization\" or w/e it's called.Still no difference.","replies":[]}]}]}
