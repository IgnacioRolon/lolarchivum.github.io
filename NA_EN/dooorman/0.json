Just to give you guys a little bit of context my support and top laner were a duo que and there mid laner made a comment of saying I was making excuses by saying I was tired because I was 0-1 so I said \"And I have a braindead support\" which was clearly intended to be a joke because my support hadn't done anything wrong at the time and it was clearly mean't to be one as shown by my relevant use of \"hehe xd\" my support shortly started griefing after this. I don't know whether or not \"briandead\" is a blacklisted word and I've been done for that or what... but this comment was taken out of context and it's pretty shocking to be insta banned for it..\r\n\r\nWell RIP 5.5 year old account and $700 never been punished up until these last 2 months\r\nHere's my reform card if you would like to have a look furthermore my support ticket has said I was banned for toxic behaviour in a template response..\r\nIs there anything else I could possibly do to get my lil baby back?\r\nGame 1\r\nDooorman: wp\r\nDooorman: @naut\r\nDooorman: man so tired\r\nDooorman: had to pick my brother up from the airport at 4 ---\r\nDooorman: o ye\r\nDooorman: and I have braindead supp\r\nDooorman: hehe xd\r\nDooorman: LOL\r\nDooorman: report this support\r\nDooorman: legit wtf?\r\nDooorman: called him braindead as a joke and said hehexd\r\nDooorman: took 3 waves\r\nDooorman: holy\r\nDooorman: moly\r\nDooorman: gone top with his duo que partner\r\nDooorman: sad\r\nDooorman: Take a joke\r\nDooorman: even for league you're moody\r\nDooorman: christ\r\nDooorman: for what?\r\nDooorman: I dont need to\r\nDooorman: i dont lose anything\r\nDooorman: 3 lp im on\r\nDooorman: this escalated so quickly lmao\r\nDooorman: you're getting reported btw\r\nDooorman: griefing\r\nDooorman: bud\r\nDooorman: you're 0 lp\r\nDooorman: enjoy the demote?\r\nDooorman: bud\r\nDooorman: talk to ur bud\r\nDooorman: ?\r\nDooorman: right\r\nDooorman: k\r\nDooorman: 120 games 45%\r\nDooorman: ?\r\nDooorman: im solo no?\r\nDooorman: let me get a lil more farm\r\nDooorman: then we gucci\r\nDooorman: oof\r\nDooorman: this is so tilting\r\nDooorman: er\r\nDooorman: I muted everyone but you sion about 3-5 mins ago btw\r\nDooorman: relay anything important\r\nDooorman: so toxic\r\nDooorman: awesome\r\nDooorman: my god\r\nDooorman: anything is on the table bud\r\nDooorman: whats cookin?\r\nDooorman: oh my\r\nDooorman: &lt;333","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T04:03:46.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see where some might think you were pushing and picking on others with these lines....\n\n> Dooorman: you're getting reported btw\n> Dooorman: griefing\n> Dooorman: bud\n> Dooorman: you're 0 lp\n> Dooorman: enjoy the demote?\n\nand the braindead line most likely didn't help the situation either. I'm not sure this chat log *by itself* would warrant a perma, but it definitely could have been the 'cherry on top' if you would. This perma could have been the result of repeatedly toxicity in which you were reported for but hadn't been punished yet. I would be sure to submit a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and ask for a deeper explanation from the player behavior agents.","replies":[]}]}
