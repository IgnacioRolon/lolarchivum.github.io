If I manage to get into a game and I end my client process, the game runs smoothly. So that being said I know it's only the PvP client that is struggling. All help is appreciated and I also tried what the stickied post said.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T15:25:46.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you mentioned updating Windows, try disabling the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which was auto-enabled.  Normally, it's caused more issues with the game instead of the client, but I'm curious of the results.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Wumbear","date":"2016-10-09T16:21:59.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried that and it ended up not helping :( \nI did, although set my laptop to factory reset (Windows 8) and league is running as good as ever.
