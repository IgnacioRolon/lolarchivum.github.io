No, the client doesn't have the ability to tell the difference between a rage-quit or something like a power outage. There really isn't a difference since leaving your team always puts them at a disadvantage regardless of the reason. That system actually has a certain degree of forgiveness built in to accommodate with stuff like power outages and such, and you only get actively punished after showing a history of leaves.\n\nIf you're disconnecting so often that you're up to a 20 min queue, I'd really urge you to try troubleshooting that to figure out the main problem before hopping into matchmade games that could lengthen the LPQ's if it happens again. First, update your port forwarding and DNS options using the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a resource if you aren't sure how to adjust those. If that doesn't help, hit me back up and we can test a traceroute to see exactly what's happening with your connection.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mont√ø","date":"2017-11-21T14:45:47.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i guess you did get Rekt m8","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDeadsh0t","date":"2017-11-21T01:18:55.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"do **your teammates care about** the difference between disconnecting and fucking leaving a match\" FTFY","replies":[]}]}
