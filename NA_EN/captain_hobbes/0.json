I was hoping that the development team could make a page on the League of Legend website, for those who wish to sell or give their account willingly to those whom they trust. I understand the risks that this may have on players however if you continue reading I have some thoughts on reducing these risks to a minimum. Firstly I believe that the account sharing or selling page should include a 2 week where the player who is giving their account, whether they are selling or sharing, to deeply think about the choice they are about to make. Just like one wants to delete a Facebook account, they must wait 2 weeks. For those whom are selling their account permanently, they must under go a list to fill out to make sure that that is the original creator/owner of the account (just like in account recovery). On the side of the person selling, over the 2 weeks period their account is temporarily suspended to give them the feel of knowing how it feels to give their account up permanently. If they choose not to follow up with the temporary ban of their account they can simply stop the process and terminate any sale/sharing of their account. Once a player cancels during their 2 weeks (over even longer time to think) they are given a 3 months wait until they can restart another process of selling their account. This is to remove any sign of guilt or hesitation in their mind.\r\n\r\nFor players who want to share accounts they are told to fill out how long they wish to share the account with (both people must have an account that is level 30 in order to share). This is so give players a chance of making their own account and knowing what it feels like to have their own. I'm sure Riot has some sort of I.P. address detection, which could be used to give the person who is getting the account shared to them, to have very strict consequences . If that player receives 1 warning/ban of any sort, the account is immediately taken away from them, and that player can no longer share with any player period(exclamation mark huehue; I'm serious though)! The only way they would be able to get to share again is if they make a second account to level 30 (bought account will not be allowed to share). Once the second player is no longer given the shared account, the owner of the account is given complete and full access to his account, and that specific second person no longer can share with the main owners account. Any bans/warnings WILL be kept on that account, because it is the owners responsibility to keep his account safe EVEN when sharing. These terms and conditions will be given to anyone who wishes to sell or trade their account.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n{{item:3643}}Captain Hobbes {{item:3643}}\r\n\r\nP.S. these are just ideas if you disagree with them please let me know in the comments and why, and just remember that account sale should be done on a safe/secure Riot website, with it's own page. I'll try to get back to you those in the comments as soon as possible. I know this is a big change Riot, but if you even do consider this very big project, call the update, Patch.Revolution (such cool name much wow)","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-18T19:50:21.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account selling is banned and results in account termination in just about every online game and service in existence, and this will never change - for obvious reasons regarding scamming, privacy, monetization, ect.","replies":[]}]}
