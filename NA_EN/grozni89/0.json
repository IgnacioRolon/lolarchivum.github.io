I do not took about ppl that will bust your Acc I took about how much money you need to gave to Riot so you end up 100 % in Gold or Plat.  The thing lolprofile is good for one thing. You can see people that play  play 100 or 200 games and have KDA under 2 , have little more the 1 % of games that they carry in Gold, I personally have friend that is Platinum 5 have KDA under 2 play jungle and Mid and only 10 % of games was best on his team on DMG.  The fanny things are Grades on average my account with similar number of games have 4 TIMES MORE S ranks, and 3 TIMES MORE A ranks and better average KDA for 1.2.  And win rate about 40 % Fanny this is that with 10 champions have KDA from 4.05 to 5.57 and average win rate in those games is 47 %. in those games I have 56 and total number of my wins in this moment is  57. So by this it is shown that with KDA of average 4.5 and average grade A+ you can&#039;t progress from Bronze??? So there is 2 options matchmaking is not really working or they keep ppl like me and others low so they can boost people that bye skins and champion to better elo. There is no 3th option on having people in bronze 2 having better KDA and grades on AVERAGE then 50 % of Gold??   I hope some serious comments all this can be check on lolprofile so there is no real reason for spam!!!!!","replies":[]}
