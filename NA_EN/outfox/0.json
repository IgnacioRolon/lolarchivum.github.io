The 3% lifesteal does help a little early but also will stack with lifesteal items you get later in the game, making the % gain more value as the game progresses.\n\n{{item:1036}} + {{item:2003}} - The 3 extra AD on top of runes and everything really doesn't make a big difference. Being able to get your rush item faster is nice **if** you are rushing {{item:3144}} . Otherwise you are generally rushing a {{item:1038}}, and you don't save any gold on that. The health pots are better in 2 situations (off hand). 1) Either you are trading a lot or taking a lot of poke damage, so you can back up and heal and not be forced out of lane. or 2) You plan to play incredibly passively, just stay in lane and farm, and not go towards a fight. This way you can \"drink away\" any poke that the enemy may be landing on you.\n\nSo the reasons you generally see {{item:1055}}. Currently, most players will play the bottom lane aggressive. You want to set up dominance and maintain it, having the health buffer helps as you can engage in an all-in if you get the chance. Doran's currently gives you an edge in establishing lane presence (along with your support) without being oppressive to play against.\n\nSo, why do people not just play defensively and save that gold? If you play defensively you lose benefits of aggressive play. Defensive play allows your opponent to free farm (even if it also allows you to free farm) meaning you are not gaining any advantage by zoning the enemy away from minions (as you don't want to fight b/c you are defensive). This also means you cannot deny any experience from the enemy lane (you are not denying last hits either) so if you are lucky you will hit level power spikes (generally level 2 and level 6) around the same time. If you are lucky.\n\nHowever, if the opponent is being aggressive (smartly aggressive, not stupid tower diving at level 1 aggresive) they will zone you (as a defensive player) away from minions (xp and gold). They may also be killing minions faster, meaning they level first, meaning they get the chance to take advantage of those level differences (those level 2 and level 6 all in's).\n\nRemember, a Caitlyn csing at the back line, and harassing an opponent when they come up to last hit is still being aggressive. Constantly looking for positive trades while maintaining farm is being aggressive. Mainly,** you can be both safe and aggressive**. Just because you are being safe does not necessarily mean you are being defensive.\n\nSo, with most players tending towards being aggressive so they can get the gold, experience, and level advantage (also meaning they get more consistent power spikes), {{item:1055}} just generally fits better into the playstyle as it offers more immediate survival.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that {{item:1036}} + {{item:2003}} used to be a staple for some champions such as blue build {{champion:81}}. However, this was partly due to {{item:3004}} building out of a {{item:1036}} at the time.\n\n{{item:1036}}\n\n* Gives less immediate lane presence.\n\n* Does not fit into rush items besides {{item:3144}}.\n\n*  Does not have lifesteal, that is a missing factor in many currently popular ({{item:3031}}, {{item:3046}}) mid game builds.\n\nI hope this helps you understand why many players tend to take {{item:1055}} over {{item:1036}}.

The poke is also a bigger threat bot lane because of the extra spells/autos of another player in lane. Giving the life steal of DB much more effective. Also while long sword builds into a couple of cool things DB doesn't interfere with any build path, as it doesn't build into anything. Where most ADCs want to rush IE, which longsword doesn't build into. This also adds to your first back total, because you want to be able to buy a BF sword on first back, but you want LS so that makes you second back a MINIMUM of 1990 with longsword start (1550 BF+440 to complete vamp scepter). Compared to Doran's Blade start your ideal first back can be done at 1600 (1550 BF sword and by the time recall/buy ends you will have the 1620 allowing BF+2 pots+the starting Doran's Blade.\n\n\nNow comparing these even more we will discuss the damage and comparable life steal.\n\nBF sword 50 AD + Vamp scepter 10 AD + 8% LS= 60 AD and 8% LS+ 2 pots for 2060 gold on first back. SO this TOTALS 60 AD and 8% lifesteal for staying an extra 440 gold, risking overstaying and dying at a less than ideal back.\n\nBF sword 50 AD+ Doran's Blade 70 HP + 7 AD + 3% LS + 2 pots for 1620 gold on first back. This TOTALS 57 AD 70 HP (enough HP for 2-4 autos) 3% LS for a relatively common back timing and a fairly safe back time.\n\nAlso factor in that with DB you are not forced to donate 440 gold to make your longsword into a vamp scepter in lane to make it effective gold. Delaying your buy of pickaxe even more. So basically you are gaining 3 AD and because of the HP of DB effectively the same HP (early on the bonus 5% LS would equal about the same as bonus HP of DB), while risking more overstaying as well as technically inefficient gold in inventory.\n\nHope this helps explain why DB is widely considered a much better item. LMK if anything seems unclear or was phrased poorly.","replies":[]}]}
