Super cool stuff. \n\nAs someone mentioned, we definitely need a red to check this out. \n\nThe work is not mine, and as I linked originally, you can find the actual artists work. \n\nIf a red does show up, I would like to ask, if this were to win the art contest for its respective area, what are the chances of us seeing this in-game? I know that is not one of the prizes for winning the contest, but if it gathered enough attention, would it be possible? Or something remade by a riot employee to look a lot like this? I also understand, while braum is relatively new, he still doesn't need any new skins, not like some other guys...\n\nI would love to see this sometime down the road, after some more champs get theirs. \n\nAnd lastly while I'm here, let's talk about that taric rework, nunu TU, and Leona splash art ;)","replies":[{"poster":"OblongOtter","date":"2014-12-24T00:44:08.576+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dislike wrestling so I prefer this (also it's an amazing skin) and I might get Braum for this skin if it were real, love the peppers.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-12-24T04:06:26.112+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why not both?
