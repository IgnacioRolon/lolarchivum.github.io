Day 13.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe constantly spamming everyday about this will bring it to your attention?\n\nAudio distortion and FPS drop in mac client. When will this be fixed? I've gone through all of the posts about this and the last comment was by an employee in skins team who said he *thinks* you guys are investigating it which was already almost a week ago. Very kind of him to at least give an answer while everyone in Riot in charge of this problem is remaining silent.\n\nAny updates or are you guys just gonna ignore this until the next patch? If so, then tell us so I can stop wasting my time on this board checking for updates everyday and just return to play next patch.\n\nIf you guys are just gonna let this problem continue even past 6.7, can you guys also just tell me? I don't want to waste my time clinging on to the hope that you guys would fix it someday or at least give an update about this problem in the boards.\n\nI love this game but it's been getting pretty annoying checking for 13 days that you guys would somehow respond to this. I guess you guys probably don't care one player leaving the game or bunch of mac players for that matter as long as there are greater number of windows players. I'm not sure if that's the best way to conduct a business but who am I to say considering your success in the industry so far.\n\nAnyways hope someone from Riot at least leaves a comment about it here. Thanks.\n\n\n*Unfortunately, the problem still continues in patch 6.7.","replies":[{"poster":"ulie love","date":"2016-04-06T07:09:04.763+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this was a PC problem it would have been addressed much much earlier.\nI have been playing w it sound disabled for close to two weeks now which makes gameplay both unenjoyable and unfair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-04-05T00:11:54.955+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry if the communication hasn't quite been there on this. We're still working on it, but unfortunately the dev team still hasn't been able to find a root cause.  From the latest updates this morning, there's a few possible leads they're following up on, but nothing concrete.\n\nI've been trying to respond to these threads as I see them, but I'll see what I can do to smooth out the communication flow on this issue.

I was just skeptical and annoyed because there were no specific announcements made about this issue despite how critical the problem is for many mac users. It just appeared odd to me how you guys are so quick to announce certain issues on both the website and the client (such as match history and server transfer) while this one seemed to remain relatively silent. I guess you guys only announce it after the root cause is found? Either way, thanks for the update. It's good to know that this problem is still being actively investigated.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-04-05T19:17:27.538+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hear you.  So, for a bit of context, we generally reserve status announcements for widespread or heavily impacting issues. For example, the two issues you mentioned (match history and server transfers failing) could potentially affect 100% of players.  From what we've seen so far, this particular FPS issue with Macs isn't even widespread among Mac users.  I believe the latest data I've seen estimates ~11% of Mac players could be affected.\n\nThis can make both diagnosing the problem as well as communication a bit tricky.  How much value is there to put a server status message for the issue when 90% of the people who it's meant for wouldn't even experience the issue?  Could we be confusing players who may be experiencing FPS issues for other reasons?  Not always a clear answer to these types of questions.  Hope this helps give a bit of insight (from my perspective at least)","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Dzyrt Ua","date":"2016-04-06T11:07:54.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 weeks past! new patch 6.7 and we still can't play. were are only 11% so just let it go. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cadozius","date":"2016-04-06T02:19:58.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget about us...","replies":[]},{"poster":"blessthekellen","date":"2016-04-06T00:14:25.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im curious where the 11%~ of mac players are only experiencing this issue, because it seems like since 6.6 the board has been absolutely flooded with posts from a majority of mac users.

Thanks, that clarifies things for me. I wasn't even sure how many mac players were affected by this. However, for me at least, I tried reinstalling the client, repairing, changing graphics settings, adjusting sounds, and followed the FPS guideline you guys posted and everything but nothing worked. I've never experienced this problem and from the posts I have read on this board, I have low doubts the problem lies to 11% of the Mac players/their laptops as they all shared similar stories as mine. So I would appreciate it if you guys could continue to investigate the issue on that end.
