Your teammates can sit there and be toxic the entire game and harass you and tell you to kill yourself, but if you threaten to report them or tell them they&#039;re being a dick you can be reported too and flagged for it. This is obnoxious. I&#039;ve thought it for ages but never made a post about it until it actually affected my account. I&#039;ve gotten a chat restriction and now a ban and literally never said anything worse in a game than &quot;that was retarded&quot; or &quot;stop being toxic&quot;. I understand the former could easily be considered offensive, but that isn&#039;t as reoccurring as the latter. I&#039;m disappointed in Riot, I&#039;m disappointed in the community, and I probably won&#039;t be returning to the

And yes, I've progressed through the chat restrictions which I no longer have the logs for but felt the same exact way. I agree that these aren't friendly by any means, but am really surprised that they're bannable when I'd say most of them are responsive to toxic teammates. I guess I just can't get over the fact that you don't consider the situation the player is in when they say things like this. In some of these I had teammates refusing to contribute, trying to make us lose, and harassing other members of my team and yah it totally set me off and I probably should've just muted. Instead I chose to be aggressive and convince the player that they were wrong. In the real world this isn't really a big deal, so why would it ban my account in a video game? This isn't COD, it requires strategy and sometimes harsh criticism is necessary imo. I understand I don't make the rules and reflecting on these logs I do feel shitty like I shouldn't have said some of these things and let it get out of hand.

If people are toxic they will get punished. If you are toxic, you will get punished. The only sensible thing to do is to shut up and report them. The moment you start to reply to toxicity with toxicity, you make yourself as punishable as the other player.\nNo, getting harassed does not give you a free pass on being toxic yourself.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GandolfTheGrey","date":"2017-07-14T21:55:20.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just posted the one I thought was the most ridiculous.

Your teammates can sit there and be toxic the entire game and harass you and tell you to kill yourself, but if you threaten to report them or tell them they&amp;#039;re being a dick you can be reported too and flagged for it. This is obnoxious. I&amp;#039;ve thought it for ages but never made a post about it until it actually affected my account. I&amp;#039;ve gotten a chat restriction and now a ban and literally never said anything worse in a game than &amp;quot;that was retarded&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;stop being toxic&amp;quot;. I understand the former could easily be considered offensive, but that isn't as reoccurring as the latter. I&amp;#039;m disappointed in Riot, I&amp;#039;m disappointed in the community, and I probably won't be returning to the game.\n\nAs it turns out, this was all bullshit.  \n\nA Rioter came in here, smited you and showed us the truth.  \n\nThe only thing that would have made it better is if you would have been permabanned.
