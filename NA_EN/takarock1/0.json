I was able to go to LA for job and I was there for a while with my job partner. There I was able to play with like 60 ping and makes a significant difference. Also my partner was diamond so I duoed with him with his silver smurf. Then my family member had passed away, so I had to go back to JP for a bit.... I played for 2 3 games and went back to LA to finish off my job I had and I came back to tokyo again. This is is the reason my Ip address is different. Then I got this email few days later for the MMR boosting accusation.. It was ridiculous. I literally stayed up all night to try to make it to gold in time. Someone please help me...","replies":[]}
