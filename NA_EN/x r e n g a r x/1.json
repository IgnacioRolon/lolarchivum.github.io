I got banned for 2 weeks my main. I have played about like 50 games on my account after the 2 week ban. I have not been toxic or even typing in chat anymore. I simple mute negative behavior and move on with my game. I believe I&#039;m reformed. I dont take trolls to heart nor do I care if I lose. Life goes on as usual.\r\n\r\nThe question is...do I get season rewards if I keep up being a civil player now with no chat restrictions or bans?\r\n\r\nOr is it still like last season where people who got bans or ranked restricted don&#039;t get rewards?","replies":[{"poster":"Destíny","date":"2016-05-17T21:56:13.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you still do.

The punishment tiers are as follows:\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day ban\n* permaban","replies":[{"poster":"Destíny","date":"2016-05-18T00:52:01.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, The last time I got banned was in season 2, and that was the second warning :].
