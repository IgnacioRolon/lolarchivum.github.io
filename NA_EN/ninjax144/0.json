I cannot view my friends' list, change my icon, see my level, change any League Voice settings, etc. because the entire right tab for those things is just gone. It is blank.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I cannot invite any online friends because they do not show up when I click on the arrow or under Suggested (the names from there are just randos I've played with in previous games). I can only invite them by typing in their IGN.\r\n\r\nI am also unable to chat, as it perpetually says \"Connecting...\" and anything I type disappears. This also persists in-game, where when I try to message one of my friends it says something along the lines of \"cannot connect to PVP.net\".\r\n\r\nThis problem cropping up correlates with my transferring over to an official Riot account, although I am not sure how much causation is involved there. I would much appreciate it if some fix could be found for this problem, as it seems others also have this issue.\r\n\r\nThe attached images are just evidence of my problem (apologies in advance for the poor quality).","replies":[{"poster":"KragusIII","date":"2020-01-22T22:48:45.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't care about fixing the client.\nNot until enough casuals (and that's a lot) make a fuss about it.\n\nOR one pro player.","replies":[]}]}
