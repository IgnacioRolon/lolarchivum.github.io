In fact the best part of you ran down your mothers leg and soaked into the mattress upon conception and you should probably put on a blindfold and go play in traffic. now with all that said its really not all your fault it is RIOTS FAULT FOR BREAKING THE GOD DAMN GAME. so im saying this to all of you that think you are some sort of league of legends god because you pick said broken fucking bullshit to just stop. You are not cool you are not  good just because you can roll your forehead across the keyboard faster than someone else and win because you picked some broken fucking shit. FUCKING LEARN HUMILITY ASSHATS. but even with all that said let me clue you folks in to some secrets you may not know.\r\n let us start with the elo system that so many of you love to look up and judge someone on. IT WAS MADE IN 19FUCKING50, I would call that out of fucking date. PLus it was made for chess, not even close to the same game as league. That just shows you how god damn fucking lazy riot is, they couldn&#039;t even make their own system that actually takes into account every factor that caused you to have a good or bad game. so the next time you wanna be a judgmental piece of shit then remember the elo system is bullshit. That&#039;s how much riot gives a fuck about you and me and every other casual player out there. the only strategy left to league is who can stack the most broken bullshit before the other team to win. I fucking DETEST RIOT for forcing me to have to play broken god damn fucking bullshit champs to even have a chance to catch a win. if the game was actually balanced I wouldn&#039;t have any issues with losing a game or two but that&#039;s just not the fucking case. but I am sure riot will deny it and try to act fucking innocent.\r\nnow lets move on to the tribunal and reporting. IT IS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMED BY....WAIT FOR IT.... RIOT to do 2 things , jack and shit. riot will slap you on the wrist 100,000 times before they actually get off their lazy fucking asses to do anything at all. but they will surely be quick to send you an auto-tell and let you know that they know everyone has bad days... FUCK YOU. that is why the community is still so toxic. as gamers we need to stand together for our gaming rights. but that wont happen anytime soon because we can hardly get through a single match without going at each others throats over one mistake or another. all I am saying is that we need to stand together because riot is the bad guy here, not that person that lost to a broken fucking bullshit champ that riot made possible. so just remember the next time you think reporting will do something... it wont. you will just be wasting your time.\r\nBut even with all that said, I still practice the exact definition of insanity every fucking time I log into league. and nothing changes for the good. all that bullshit you see on the screen when you log in is just a huge distraction to keep you cowed and ignorant. riot thinks we are all fucking idiots. and sadly this is the only format I have vent my frustrations, riot doesn&#039;t give 2 fucks about me but I bet  if I had all of them on a stake about to fucking burn them theyd care then. and that&#039;s what I feel like doing to them. but I am just s single voice lost in the bullshit that is riot and I will be lucky if this post even stays up longer than an hour.","replies":[{"poster":"Hobo Shanker","date":"2016-04-21T19:07:34.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i seriously hope every god damn fucking piece of god damn fucking shit at riot dies ina god damn fucking fire... every god damn fucking one of them. afks run rampant all god damn fucking day and all the broken god damn fucking bullshit champs in the game I seriously hope every god damn fucking one of them dies in a horrible god damn fucking way. and I swear one of these fucking days they are all going to fucking wish theyd gotten off their lazy cock sucking asses and balanced out the game fixed the afk bullshit and stopped sucking so much god damn fucking pro team player dick, I swear this with every fucking fiber of my being they will god damn fucking  wish it ...","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-04-21T19:35:31.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So real quick, cool summoner name.  Gave me a smile when i noticed it.  XP\n\nAny chance i could trouble you to tell me what champs you struggle against?  I've against Miss Fortune, Ezreal and Corki and even after playing them I still have trouble wrapping my head around how they work.\n\nI hear you loud and clear about the more negative players.  Its hard to not find people wanting to ruin your day over the smallest of mistakes or perceived offences.  In a way its been motivating me to try talking more during and after game to show there are a few friendly players out there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hobo Shanker","date":"2016-04-22T13:22:42.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"o and lets not forget trundle and shyvana every one that plays them acts they are some sort of league of legends god when in reality they have 0 skill and they are pretty much a piece of fucking shit but we can thank riot and their lazy cock sucking ways for all that since they never balance anything, fuck im still waiting to see whats going to be disabled after this recent patch. its just fucking stupid that people only play broken bullshit that riot made due to having no skill and does riot ever do a god damn thing about it? fuck no they just sit back with a cock in each hand 2 in their mouths and 3 up each of their asses and laugh at us all for being so stupid and not taking this shit to riots door. but they will pay....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hobo Shanker","date":"2016-04-22T03:01:38.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks and to list the top ones im talking aout udyr, jax, yi, yasuo, zed, fizz, leblanc and the attitudes that the people that play them have, and those are just the main few off the to of my head the ones that you get on your team and they are pure toxic garbage and if they are on the enemy team they look like some sort of god with a shitty ass attitude","replies":[]}]}
