(Love when that happens) I rejoin and explain to my team \"Hey my bad, bug splat\" And they are cool with it they understand no one flaming, raging or anything other thing. We finish the game and even though we lost, I get hit with a leave buster. \r\n\r\nNow this is the same B.S. I've sent paper trails to riot support over and over that their leave buster is in fact flawed as hell. I got a leave buster just as we got to the status screen showing our results. So I know good damn well I didn't get reported that quick even IF my team were to all hit a report button on that. \r\n\r\nI've even show a picture (Best of the ability) up there. But I'm still going to be damned for the next 5 games?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-26T02:44:10.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaverbusters happen when you're afk or disconnected for a long enough period to have it potentially affect the outcome of the match.

MY INTERNET/**YOUR SERVERS DISCONNECTED ME**.\" Though you say the system keeps all of that in mind, it does NOT However take in consideration a bug splat. IF that was true, why would you guys allow lost prevention, if the leave buster suppose to \"know\" the difference ;/","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T03:21:27.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem here is that the servers didn't actually disconnect you. A bugsplat comes from your own files not working properly which has something to do with your own pc.
