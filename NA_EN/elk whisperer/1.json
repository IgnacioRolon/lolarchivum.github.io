Some will argue that Zedd is too but the videos of him 1 vs 3 killing people will say otherwise. Albeit he was ahead but thats due to his crazy safe laning and dueling potential from Death Mark and his W. Jungler ganks W out, or if you're ahead R your lane opponent who is likely gold starved pop Q and E on em plus cutlass and a few AAs and R out then your going 1 for 0 and wasting Jungle's time and resources attempting to kill you and failing since you can still get away from them with W shadow + flash","replies":[{"poster":"Phoneixflare","date":"2015-01-29T22:03:40.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ultimately, all of Zed's abilities still require skill/aiming(skillshots) to fully take advantage of the damage that will occur, where as veigar and malz did not so much have to do that, especially with malz's silence and veigar's stun. Once you hit that...gg DFG and combo= dead\n\nAlso, you can DEFINITELY kill zed before he kills you if you utilize cc properly, and if you do it right, you will prevent his mark from dealing that much damage to you, meaning Zed's ulti actually does have counterplay because he doesnt have cc. He just has damage, and a lot of potential damage after level 6.","replies":[]}]}]}
