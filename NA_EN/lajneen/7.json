Did you seriously think that Assassins didn&#039;t need total armor penetration to kill squishies? Did you seriously think that nerfing ALL of their god damn core items wouldn&#039;t affect them? Did you seriously think that they didn&#039;t need crit in order to deal any damage past 30 minutes?\n\n#&#039;&#039;Assassins will be stronger now when ADCs are even more valuable&#039;&#039;\n---\n#THEY&#039;RE TOO FUCKING WEAK TO DO THEIR JOB YOU DAMN MORON\n\nDid no one in the balance team stop for a second and say &#039;&#039;Wait a minute guys, we&#039;re fucking over every AD Assassin except Yasuo and Yi with these changes&#039;&#039;? Either they don&#039;t give a fuck anymore or they decided to listen to all these unskilled low elo garbage scrubs that acted like Assassin experts despite having no fucking experience with them at all.\n\nHonestly at this point it&#039;s pretty hard to deny that Riot purposely fucks over Assassin mains with every new patch seeing how they&#039;ve continuously nerfed them, their itemization, given every new champion an ability that hard counters them and now this shit.\n\nThere is still a solution for all this absurdity though: Revert the price increase to Hydra, make a melee only upgrade for Last Whisper that penetrates total armor, revert the nerfs to BoRK but make it so ranged champions deal 6% instead 8% and revert Gostblade to how it was before the update and give it 5% more crit chance to compensate for the Infinity Edge nerf that Assassins never got any compensation for a few months ago.\n\nThey&#039;ll still be weak, but atleast they&#039;ll be fucking playable until Riot makes an update for them too.","replies":[]}
