No, all they care about nowadays are their precious little low IQ Support mains who throw money on them due to their incapability to use their brain efficiently (hence why they main Support).\n\nBut what about the people who spent years to master Akali, one of the hardest champs in the game? Do you think that giving us a skin will make up for the fact that our champ is useless?\n\nThat's not how it works Riot, we are not Support mains, we can see past the bullshit. Akali's been trash for so long now that the only way to make her viable is to 1. Make E proc Q again, 2. Give her ult 800 range again and 3. Make her spellvamp passive scale of AP.\n\nYou can keep your skin until you give us these buffs.","replies":[]}
