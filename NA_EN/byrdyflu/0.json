In far too many cases, you can ignore the turret with high enough HP and basically loiter around under while you fight your opponents.

In older days, we were just worse at tower diving, and S2 to maybe S4, or maybe just end of S3, no one ever grouped to push down a turret as fast as possible, we normally tried to farm for as long as possible, and kill the turret when it was low from minions, which is why lane phase lasted so long back then.\n\nEdit:\nI was very focused on the patch history so I missed a few things, because it seems it was never been in the patch notes, but outer and every other turret deal 152 and 170 AD respectively, which caps at 180 and 250-290 respectively, and the armor is at 55 rather than 40","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-10-11T22:11:01.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although i agree with your statement, i have some questions:\nHow long is too long in terms of diving turrets?\nOne, two, three, four or more seconds?\n\nKeep in mind that the longest CC in League is with Ashe's long distance R and it caps out at 3.5 seconds. That's more than enough time for anyone to just leisurely walk towards you and hit you until you die. Morgana's Bindings are dangerously close to this cap (at 3 seconds). And let's not mention chain CCing is a thing, which can 100-0 a person without any means of retaliation.\n\nSo how many turret shots should champions take before having to get out?\nRiot can definitely make turret shots do % max HP damage but that would only make any class be able to dive you, the spotlight clearly being on champs that are ranged or have quick means of disposing a target.\n\nShould turret aggro juggle be a thing?\nIf you're being dove by a group, you can't realistically expect that the turret should at least be able to get a revenge kill unless the group heavily misplays or you manage to unload your damage quickly before the target reacts with a Flash.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ugly Alien","date":"2018-10-11T18:14:41.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot MapleNectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TEy4Jk1L,comment-id=000400030000,timestamp=2018-10-11T18:10:28.429+0000)\n>\n> Gesundheit!\n> \n> What people wanted is to just have us jack up turret damage and turret hp and leave it at that.

JUST DONT 50/50 baron yeah plz thats the most pathetic excuse for Biggest game objectives being coinflipy. Baron steals happen all the time and dont require skill, COINFLIP\n\n- Crit is still RNG BASED (It can be every 4TH/2ND auto starting with first/second/third/forth based depending on item/item combination\n\n- Tower diving issue. (Towerdives are to hard unless your champion is akali or in 2vs1, make 1vs1 dives easier 2vs1 dives harder)\nBBBUUT What about my lategame champs TOWERS PROTECT ME. no towers turtle you, minions should be bad matchup softeners not towers\nALSO WHY THE FK ARE TOWERS ON WHICH YOU DONT WANT TO PRESS WHEN DIVING 12381031 FEET TALL yet bounce plants on which you want to press are so fking small\n\n- Supports still dont do anything in this game. 1 leona e every 5 minutesin high elo what a fun fking gameplay. Rework minions let supports interact with allied minions for unique effects (Obviously if someone farms all the time he cant interact with allied minions)\n\n- AP itemization is dogshit idk what else to say, everyone follows the same build formula apart from ryze, anivia and very few others\n there is also massive favourism towards AD\n\n- Rectilinear creep, good luck dodging anything if you are melee on top of ranged champion because there are to much EZREAL Q esque abilities (IN a distant past there were way more targeted / brand W/ Karthus Q like abilities. We need dodging masterie, (Puts you on a side of champion you autoed or something like that)\n\n- Minion block is still a nusiance rather then mechanic (Literaly its obvious REWORK minions and you can fix so many of the game issues)\n\n- Sion, Cho and other tanks dont need 102381301 wide radiuses because tehy cant dodge anything and just feel helpless in teamfights. (One of the reasons tanks arent fun to play)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"crispy66","date":"2018-10-11T00:17:31.879+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes please, maybe make towers do percent health with increased armor penetration","replies":[{"poster":"Byrdyflu","date":"2018-10-11T00:29:21.168+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or scaling per shot true damage","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-10-11T07:01:52.440+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Byrdyflu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TEy4Jk1L,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-10-11T00:29:21.168+0000)\n>\n> Or scaling per shot true damage\n\nThere's actually two pretty easy solutions to this without going into neither percentage maximum health nor true damage territory:\n\n1.
