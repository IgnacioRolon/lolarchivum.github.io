I know Tier lists are just opinions and such, but still. His kit is amazing. He has a gap closer, aoe, mana regen on hit, and 20% max health dmg + a 1.0 ratio for attack dmg - just on his hammer. Group that in with his Cannon's crazy poking Q, the insane steroid on the E, a group sprint and combo tool. And if that isn't enough he gets the 25% armor/magic resist debuff when swapping to the cannon, which is friggan huge. That's like a Black Cleaver and Wit's End combined. His burst can go nuts with a Last Whisper, Cleaver and his resist shred from the cannon, all the while popping his steroid, he can basically light even the most respectable tanks up. Plus you can build him tanky and still have over 300 attack power. Oh and add in the passive armor and magic resist from the Hammer as well. Am I missing some glaring weakness he has? Or is The Man just trying to keep him down?","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-08T06:05:38.212+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce is not a bad champion, but he actually has several weaknesses:\n\nA) He has not ult. This means that once he reaches level 6, there's a 95% chance that his enemy laner reached a huge power spike while he didn't.\nB) He has practically no escapes. His only disengages are the gate and the hammer backslap, which may or may not work depending on how many gap closers the enemy has on him.\nC) Most of the other champions with no ults (Nidalee and Elise, in particular) have Assassin as a primary or secondary role, which means that their kit is specifically weighted to overcome 1v1 situations, either through burst or out-duel potential. Jayce doesn't have this, which means his lack of ult is even more debilitating.\nD) As a Fighter/Marksman, Jayce is too squishy for the Fighter aspect and doesn't scale hard enough for the Marksman aspect. He can't compete with Fighter/Assassins (who out-duel him) or Fighter/Tanks (who can contribute more to teamfights) or ordinary Marksmen (particularly the hypercarries, who are able to out-duel him extremely easily late-game).\nE) He does not have significant contributions to teamfights other than a well-placed E+Q combo and a trio of W-enhanced autoattacks, given that by mid-game, it's practically suicidal to jump into a teamfight in hammer form with how squishy he is.\nF) He faces an extremely disadvantageous itemisation. Rushing a Tear early means that he sinks 700 gold into something that isn't damage, mobility, sustain or resists, while his opposing laner can translate that same gold into a chain vest or [longsword/cloth/flask]+boots+pots. Essence Reaver is also horrendously designed, as it's an expensive item that works best early game (only it's too expensive, particularly if you're rushing manamune first), and by late game the passive is useless (again, particularly if you rushed manamune already). What he needs to build is all over the place: he needs standard ADC stats (AD, crit and arpen, though he can ignore aspeed thanks to his W), but he also needs mana, CDR and mana regen, and he also needs some manner of tankiness in order to not die in a stiff breeze.\nG) His objective-seizing capacities are average at best. Yes, the W is great for taking down towers/dragon/baron, but that's all he has going for him, particularly since that very W means he can easily neglect attack speed items. His ability to steal dragon or baron with a well-timed E+Q combo is neat, yes, and he has reasonably adequate wave-clear, but he is a poor split-pusher given B).\nH) He only has one form of hard cc (the hammer backslap) in all his 6 abilities, and it's very short duration (and short displacement).\n\nCombine all these things together and you get a champion with no ult, who is not an Assassin, who is squishy and requires far too many stats to reach his true potential, and who has limited utility in a teamfight. He has his strengths, of course, and I've seen Jayces completely crush top lane (he does have a bit of Marksman-like scaling in that 1.0 ratio, so he can pump out a surprising amount of damage if he manages to get his full combo off on a target with no tank items), but it rarely translates into objectives or teamfights.\n\nIn short, there are other champions who do his job better. If you want a squishy top laner that deals a lot of physical damage, you have Fiora, Irelia, Pantheon, Nidalee and Jax, to name a few.\n\nI feel I would only pick Jayce in top lane if I was facing an AP ranged caster, like Teemo, Lulu, Ryze or Lissandra. And even then, I'd rely more on my jungler ganking than my own plays. I might play him against Darius and be hyper-aggressive pre-6 and then just kite/bait him afterwards (or try to keep him constantly harassed so that he can't all-in me).","replies":[{"poster":"Sadistic Cheese","date":"2014-09-08T12:23:34.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta agree with this. I've been wanting to try more of Jayce since I see people play him on occasion and whenever they do it always seems like they're stuck in some kind of season 3 time-loop. Like they're playing him as if he was what he was back then and he's not. But I feel like there's potential for him to be 'the next big thing' if he was played right.\n\nFrankly if Riot was to buff him, I'd like to see his stats become better in the tank department, and maybe some damage upped in the Hammer side of his kit. Heck, he may need an entire gameplay rework. Poke comps don't work much anymore. There's no more nuclear nidalee spears, Jayce's E+Q doesn't hit like it did in the old days. The only person I feel like can reliably poke anymore is Caitlyn and maybe Ziggs. Barring changes to his mana costs and cooldowns so spells can be spammed better, I feel like poke is all that he can do.\n\nI think whoever handled the Nidalee rework needs to take a look at Jayce. Honestly they did a good job, at least achieving the goal of 'we want you to actually USE this other form you have, instead of sitting around and chucking spears all day.' There's an incentive to using Nid's cougar form now. It's a part of her kit. Jayce's hammer form really isn't. It's that thing you use the W for when you need mana but not much mana because it doesn't produce much and MAYBE you can use Hammer to peel. (support Jayce? anyone?)\n\nBefore Jayce can really be played, I feel like Riot needs to re-address their vision and goal with him. What was he really supposed to be and do? Did they achieve that? If not, what can they do to get closer to that goal? Hell, is the vision and goal unattainable without still being fair to people playing against him? He just really needs to be looked at. I don't normally say this, but I do like the character, so...\n\nRiot....please.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rodee","date":"2014-09-08T06:39:45.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his saving grace is that more than likely they are going to be going for the actual carry in a team fight, leaving him open. If it comes to killing a fed Vayne or a decently fed Jayce, I figure they'd go for Vayne 9/10. I guess its more reliant on your team composition. A strong initiator like Malphite could do wonders for his squishiness. I'm going to keep trying builds on him to maybe balance his defense with his offense. Lucidity or Merc treads, BT, Manamune, GA, SV, and a LW or BC seemed to do pretty well.","replies":[{"poster":"Drogeist","date":"2014-09-08T07:52:02.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I do think he's underplayed.  He can be really powerful laning phase, but a lot of the points here are valid regarding what he brings to a team fight.  He's too squishy to use half his abilities.  The other thing is the season 3 nerf whereby Acceleration Gate's CD was changed to 16 seconds at all ranks.  This basically means the Jayce player needs to be laser accurate with his gated Q, and when he misses he basically sits around for 16 seconds (9.6 secs with max CDR) until he can do something useful again.\n\nThat said, his laning phase is fun and you do even get to use your hammer from time to time if you're smart about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EVG Mike","date":"2014-09-08T12:45:13.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The answer is meta. Toplane meta is sustain tanks that bring loads of cc and work well with teleport. Jayce thrives against squishy melee toplanes that he can abuse and his kit takes a fortune in gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-09-08T11:57:32.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird, every tier list I see has Jayce as a sleeper OP. I think he doesn't get played because the meta doesn't favor him, he's not in the 1% top that pros play (though he is apparently heavily contested in korea's semi pro leagues), so other players don't pick him up because no pros play him at the moment.\n\nHe has too low range to be an ADC, and basically has to build full damage. He doesn't have much utility like Lulu in solo lanes, plus he's an AD threat, not AP.\n\nReally I think he just has a weird kit, it's super powerful in pretty much every aspect, but doesn't do anything better than another champion. Basically a jack of all trades, master of none.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2014-09-08T05:46:39.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some champs are not played just because no one plays them.
