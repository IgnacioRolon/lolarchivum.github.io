Previously I was getting FPS drops during TF as low as 40 and my goodness it was laggy, but not the usual kind of FPS lag but rather the character movements were jittery like micro stutters. \nI can see it as soon as I left the platform. Today I swapped out my SSD and cloned it to a 1TB WD hard drive for an unrelated reason. \nI started a ranked game, and BAM! As soon as I spawned FPS was high as 270. I was literally awestruck. Played the rest of my game and lowest FPS dip during a full-on TF was 120 at the lowest, and the best part was? Smooth as butter.\nNow, I would like to poll the rest of the community, how many of you with FPS lag are using an SSD drive? Or a laptop HD with a small memory buffer? The only thing I can think of that may have helped my situation is that the fact is my SSD has amazing burst read rates but sustained writes are somewhat lower compared to my 1TB WD drive which has a huge 64MB cache buffer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l1nd3nz","date":"2015-03-01T07:34:45.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turn off anti-aliasing.

Because of the patch my anti-aliasing and v sync was turned on again where I before had it turned off. By simply turning it off again your fps (at least my fps did) will go back to normal.

These spikes are random it wouldn't occur only during teamfights, it would occur right in the beginning of the game, or when i'm farming... random. I don't understand, here i thought it was only me, but it seems like other people been having the same experience as me. I'm wondering if Riot knows about this problem. If they do why don't they do something about it, all i've seen so far are additional updates that doesn't fix the fps spikes. i've decided to stop playing league of legends just because i would get frustrated when i get spikes like that, and would get reported when i can't do anything about it\n\nPlease i do hope they resolve this issue. I now know that i'm not the only person experiencing this problem. so please fix this problem.\nI just hope it would get the attention that it needs cause its an inconvenience to new and old league players.\n\nThanks for spending your time to read this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InfamousZen","date":"2015-02-28T02:17:01.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unplayable, but don't worry Riot is going to act like nothing is wrong and just continue making new skins instead of fixing the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunken PwNeR","date":"2015-02-27T22:24:28.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant even play league until they patch the patch.
