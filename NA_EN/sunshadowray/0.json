She got skipped because of too many textures and someone said a rioter could work at it if they ever find some „free time at the office“. Sounds like Rioters always get a different task before the skin gets some attention :(","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-23T16:18:11.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you're right in that she has a ton of models when compared to a lot of other champions, but that isn't why one person or team is purposefully avoiding her. She (and other tasks, too) are backlogged, so to speak, because there are other tasks that take higher priority, such as working on a full-on champion VGU (we have several ongoing at a time). That keeps most artists pretty well occupied. \n\nMy team, Skins, for example, doesn't usually work on updates for skins, unless we're talking super small scope like updating the Pentakill textures with the release of Pentakill Kayle. We're also pretty stacked with upcoming skins to work on. \n\nI know it's super crappy to have a skin that you like be pretty outdated - and I know Zyra isn't the only one - but the teams are given work in a matter of priority, which means things like this, and even some bugs, fall onto the backlog until some time clears up to work on them. \n\nTexture updates that were done to Dragon Trainer Lulu, for example, were done as a passion project buy one of our 3D artists. She took that on on her own time, which is why she was able to get it done. She did the update for fun, showed it to the team and the team said, 'yeah, this is awesome and meets the quality bar/what we'd expect a texture update to look like\" so we shot it into testing and put it on live. But again, it wasn't assigned work, she did it after hours on her own time. \n\nAll of this said, I couldn't tell you if/what anyone would have planned for this lady moving forward, particularly because I'm not on the team who would take on this type of thing. ;-;","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-03-22T21:49:15.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brb, making thread titled \"Wildfire VU CONFIRMED!\"\n\nWhile you're here talking about Zyra...\n\nI know you can't drop spoilers, but you *can* predict my emotional state within the timeframe of soon(tm).

Like season 4-ish. This skin has always off and on been like that. Especially in areas with rounded terrain like the walls near wolf pit and wolf pit itself. When I first started playing and I bought the skin I was still a noob and I thought that the seeds that did that were supposed to be like lava or something and that they would make stronger plants! Lol I since realized it was just a texture glitch.","replies":[]}]}
