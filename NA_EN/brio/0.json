It's one thing to talk about behavior you genuinely disagree with. It's quite another to basically insult everyone who has a different perspective or opinion.\n\n~ Ulanopo","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-12-09T03:52:38.877+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not offensive.

More or less an unspoken, unbroken rule of society is that you act politely and respectfully around people you do not know.\n\nPeople who wont tend to be outcasts, or in this case, permbanned. Boom.\n\nAlso, typically if someone reported you, it was not due to them being offended by your language, it was them being annoyed by your entitled, arrogant attitude and probably you flaming and harassing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2017-12-09T04:15:10.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get offended by any of the racial slurs or homo-phonic word at all.  However, when I play a game to have fun or relax, I don't care to see them either.  \n\nProfanities by themselves are not offensive.  Hell, I fucking curse the shit out of most of my fucking games.  There is a big line you need to draw between throwing profanities at no specific person and using them to flame or harass people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2017-12-09T03:51:05.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I almost never see people using the chat for reasons I feel like reading.  If they are not crying about someone saying something bad they are crying about their poor emotional handling skills when something frustrating happens, and by that I mean they turn into children and start screaming.\n\nHaving a thick hide isn't just about weathering a few insults, it's about handling frustrating situations in a way where you don't have to turn into a giant rage filled child.  It goes both ways here, and I honestly wish there was a way to make both sides of this problem shut up and learn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-12-09T03:50:00.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I'm not really sure either. I've played alot of different multiplayer games over the years, and I have never seen a community nearly as sensitive as League. Part of it is because Riot themselves promote it, but I think its mostly just the nature of the game. It can already be very frustrating, so I suppose people get  more upset than usual when someone says something about them.","replies":[]}]}
