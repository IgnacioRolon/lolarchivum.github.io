It's important to consider that. Telling a joke about concentration camps will elicit a negative response from people, shrugging it off saying, \"it was just a joke...\" does not change that it was inappropriate.\n\nYou don't walk around on the street telling racist jokes because it's considered inappropriate. Same thing should be the case with misusing words like \"Gay\" \"Retarded\" and \"Autistic\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OceanicEyes","date":"2017-06-09T18:21:25.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do another, draw Giant Enemy Crabgot next :O","replies":[{"poster":"BloodCurse","date":"2017-06-09T18:28:32.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will remember that. :V","replies":[{"poster":"OceanicEyes","date":"2017-06-09T18:30:55.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm only a lowly mastery level 6 Urgot, but Crabgot and Butcher are my favorites.
