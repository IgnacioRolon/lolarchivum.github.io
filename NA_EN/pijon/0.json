When I come back with a fresh re-install of drivers, I see that I've been put in 20 minute queue timers. For what? For having drivers that are completely okay to use and should be stable enough for me to use, but they aren't. Riot, please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-31T22:54:19.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently, those drivers weren't installed correctly the first time if it caused a big enough error for the client to crash. Keep in mind that the client can't tell why you left, only that you left. That 20 min queue timer also came from a recent history of leaves, and this was just the next step. Glad you got those drivers worked out and functioning now!","replies":[{"poster":"Pijon","date":"2017-10-31T23:08:59.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand I've left before and i should be punished for that, I agree completely, but I was given timers for something I could not control at all.","replies":[]}]}]}
