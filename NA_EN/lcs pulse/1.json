THE FEATURE IS FINALLY HERE WITH PATCH 7.19!! TY RIOT {{sticker:sg-lux}}\n\nHello Riot Employees,\n\nI&#039;m annoyed by the fact that this old &amp; useful feature is now gone from the new client, I used to **Fliter Champions** in the search bar during champion select like so: \n> Ahri|Kassadin|Lux|Orianna|Xerath\n\nP.S.: That&#039;s actually my mid lane roster {{item:3089}}\n\nHere&#039;s a picture example:\nhttps://image.prntscr.com/image/KTmTWG7ASOitVTxtm_Hlxg.png\n\nHowever, this does not work anymore, you can still filter an individual champion name like typing &quot;Kass&quot; and then Kassadin will pop up.\nhttps://image.prntscr.com/image/87HHatPySBGL2urrb_4xSg.png\n\nI know for sure that you have left the old client and you are now focused on improving only 1 client, so the work required to implement &quot;new&quot; features shouldn&#039;t be as much as it was back then! That said, please work on bringing back this feature ASAP!!\n\nMade some progress! Here&#039;s Riot&#039;s first response about this topic:\n\nhttps://image.prntscr.com/image/jzuL4Jr6QtCoo8sbDd6Lsg.png\nEven more progress! Here&#039;s Riot&#039;s second response:\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Credo,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=xE9QrUHa,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-09-09T05:33:06.730+0000)\n>\n> We know that there is more to do here to make finding the champions you care about easier. The solution which existed in the old client has some flaws that we would want to address: 1. its hard to discover; many players dont even know that that feature existed 2. Its a lot of work to type out lists of champions that you care about (some players even stored lists of champions in text files to copy paste!); we&#x27;d like a solution that shortcuts all of that manual work and keeps you in the game 3. the updated client has fuzzy search whereas the legacy client did not, this causes more problems when doing something like this because it becomes more confusing why a champion is matching (especially in regions where you search for things which arent the champions name). All of that being said, we have a few designs for how to make this easier. I cannot commit to a specific timeline, but check back later :)\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nLCS Pulse (&#039;Capt Ahmad&#039; in EUNE)\nLeague of Legends\nCooperative Summoner\n\n**EDIT:** I F****** DID IT!

You place champions in that playlist and u add a tooltip in champ select that allowes you to click on a playlist. This way if you get autofilled support you can click your Support playlist and it would show champions that you want to play in that role.","replies":[{"poster":"Hextech Healer","date":"2017-09-10T08:01:02.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking this too.

First, because i did not know it existed in first place and second, because i find it pretty useless. I play jungle/support and while i have few powerpicks ( like Sion ) it could be the case that i have to flex over different champions depending on situation ( i want to play something different, i have to pick something else, someone is banned etc) and i just find it quicker to type the character i want to pick. It just feels so uselessly self-restrective and so hard to come by ( you copypaste from a .txt every time?), especially now that there is the chance to pick intent.","replies":[]}]}
