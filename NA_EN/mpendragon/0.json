I'm an ex-DotA veteran, and regeneration always triumphed anything else in the lane.\r\n\r\nNot, the majority of the time, not the minority of the time. ALL THE TIME. I realize LoL is different, and some mechanics are just merely shattered in comparison.\r\n\r\nBut D.Blade doesn't give you much breathing room for suffering harassment. If you don't have a sustain Support, you're probably screwed over a self-sustaining harasser.\r\n\r\nMy early game farm is not hindered whatsoever by not getting a damage item, even if I start Q. I have like 90-95% last hit for the entirety of laning phase.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nGranted, I realize not every ADC is dependant on mana, yet I don't think people think outside the box when they're making decisions on how to build their champion, even from level 1. People just buy Doran's blade because the recommended build tells them to, even if it may or may not be the best decision. Same thing with Annie mid, self sustaining; I just buy health pots, stealth wards, and a vision ward, and non-stop farm creeps. I have near perfect CS until the 10-15 minute mark, and have several thousand gold, I don't get ganked because the jungler can't flank me without me knowing that he's attempting to.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-02-02T15:44:24.669+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware, the reason adcs typically take dblade is because lvl-2 all-ins are so popular, and when you fight an all-in, the extra hp and damage makes much more of a difference than a little sustain. If you've got a disengage support like Janna, you could probably afford to run flask.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doogmi","date":"2015-02-02T07:34:56.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason you don't see pros use anything but Dorans to start is Trading. By taking pots and flask to start you have extra Health/mana regeneration. But you have a smaller pool of health and all of your abilities including your autos will deal less damage than your opponents. And as you level up before your first back that difference only increases. High elo adcs don't run lifesteal quints anymore after the nerfs to them because they are no longer efficient. Also because of the changes to the Dorans blade. as far as spamming abilities goes, that is largely a skill match-up. Your ability to aim and your opponents ability to dodge are the main factors. You can fish for damage, and to a degree that can help. But that won't always work. at least this is what I've heard from several challenger/pro players","replies":[]},{"poster":"MPendragon","date":"2015-02-02T06:30:01.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense bro, there's something wrong with humanity if ADC's are diving that far into the Support Tree, let alone at all.\n\nBut because I am a mathematician, I will debate your argument.\n\n10.5% lifesteal off of 72 damage is still only 7 health returned per auto attack, with the single health pot you get for regeneration. You would most likely win burst trades, or early all-ins, but unless you had a sustainable support champion, you are most likely to lose trades against a sustainer, or spend your time trying to last hit under your tower.\n\nI don't think most ADC's do run lifesteal quints, although I would agree that they used to. Doran's blade was nerfed in S3 or S4, removing 5 health returned upon slain target, which stacked well with Feast in offensive masteries and lifesteal quints, as you would return approximately 10 health per slain target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MPendragon","date":"2015-02-02T06:16:56.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've really only opened it up on Varus. \n\nOn Miss Fortune I might start Long Sword and pots, and rush into a brutalizer / black cleaver for early team fights depending on composition.\n\n--------------\n\nFlask + 3 health pots, is just insane sustain.That's 900 additional healing from items, to get that same amount of healing from a Doran's Blade lifesteal, you would need to auto attack something insane like 2,000 times.\n\nIt's a clear sustain advantage, nothing in the game thus far can triumph that, subtract a healing support.\n\n-----------\n\nHonestly really, any champion that has a spammable harass skillshot, could see validity in it. I choose Varus because he has a built-in damage boost in his W. I usually try to rush BF sword, if not pickaxe, if not brown boots and D.blade. I generally always pick up a D.blade anyway, but it isn't always necessarily my first item.","replies":[{"poster":"Zinju","date":"2015-02-02T07:01:04.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running that much sustain, you could get away with more offensive runes?

I play a lot of mages and I am also fairly new to LoL and only have one rune page. On said page I have  a fair number of mana regen runes, attack speed, and health regen. I believe in sustain durring laneing phase.\n\nWhen I go ADC I tend to pick mana hungry Sivir. When I buy my starting items I get..... D.ring...\n\nI am sick of being asked why I got that. Noobs all act like I just have no idea what Im doing and bought a random item. Iv been accused of trolling.... I then have to tell them:\n\n**\"Sivir uses her Q to harass, poke, and farm in lane. Sivir's Q scales off AP also and D.ring gives more damage than dagger. Since Q is so important that is good. D.ring also gives mana regen and mana gain/on kill. This provideds mana sustain. I can also buy 2 potions instead of 1 with dagger. Getting health from D.dagger means hitting minions and thus pushing the lane. In my opinion the 2 potions is better for health sustain. With 2 potions I get better health sustain and D.ring gives better mana sustain. In summery, D.ring is Q damage/mana sustain, if you dont understand how that is good for Sivir then you havent played her.\"\n**\n\nI have to generally stop farming and educate people cause of their foolish preconceptions of what the ONLY starting item configuration for the bottom lane ADC SHOULD be in their tiny closed minds.\n\nI get further grief when I get Essence Reaver as my first item...

I don't think there is anything wrong with taking flask on an ADC, it is also super cost efficient. Personally, I take D-blade on champs that cannot afford to have low damage early, which is either late game ADCs who need the extra stats early to not get pulped, or an aggressive/bursty lane bully who can capitalize on the extra damage in their combo. Varus would probably be one of the only ADCs where flask would actually be the better option in my opinion, for the reasons you mentioned.
