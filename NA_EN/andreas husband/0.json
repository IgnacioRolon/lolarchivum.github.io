This is because regardless of intention, any disconnection negatively impacts everyone in the match. \n\nBugsplats are often caused by system driver or hardware issues local to your PC. I recommend working through the steps in our [Bugsplat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) as a first step since those steps commonly resolve this issue.
