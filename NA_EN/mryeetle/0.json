Have Quinn and Tahm Kench in same game. \r\n2. Have Quinn use ult\r\n3. Have Tahm Kench swallow Quinn while in valor form\r\n\r\nWhen Tahm Kench spits her out, she&#039;s stuck in valor form. Move and attack speed are as if she&#039;s Quinn but is forced to do melee and all spells are as if she is Valor. Ult is stuck with a 136 second CD, and cannot be used. The helper text reads &quot;Spell not found&quot;. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-10T17:53:21.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! \n\nThanks for the report!
