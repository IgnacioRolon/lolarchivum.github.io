I completed the chat ban over 2 days and now it's been a long time of me being totally cool trying to get rid of this dishonor level. I realize that I need to keep my cool over time but does anyone know how long or how that works because I've been getting honored constantly and haven't been toxic at all over the past week. I plan to stay cool for the rest of my league playing and I'm being truly honest by saying that because I want my rewards back and realize my mistake. I'm just totally done with not getting items and want to move on to working up to honor level 3+.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T20:12:57.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't really a set amount of time to get that loot unlocked after being dishonorable, but I did actually go ahead and take a look at your hextech loot. It's already been unlocked! You should be able to get keys and chests again now.","replies":[]}]}
