If she was dealing the most damage and had the most kills (which would suggest that she wasn't simply ks-ing) then she is clearly not \"doing nothing\". She may not be doing what is best in the given situation, but again, your comments are not constructive. I honestly think this should be the lesson you take from this. Instead of making a statement that such as \"You're doing nothing\", try making a suggestion for what they should do. However, keep in mind that you are not their boss, or their elected leader. If you make suggestions in a friendly, constructive way, people are far more likely to work with you. \n\n> 8.
