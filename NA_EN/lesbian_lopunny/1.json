We fall behind a little bit but are still strong. They are able to control the entire map with ease after this fight, however, even though we eventually get the only baron of the game. While we have baron, we have no one split pushing, even though we have an Irelia. I decide to do it, I get collapsed on, die and we have no gained map control. After our upteenth skirmish against them (with no map control gained), after baron was gone, they end the game in a very anticlimactic manner. I tried asking my team why we lost, but the only &quot;answer&quot; I got was: don&#039;t do what your role can&#039;t do. That was said in regards to my attempted splitting when literally no one else on my team would do it, as well as initiating, which, again, my team refused to do regardless of the enemy&#039;s mis-positioning.\n\nIf no one on my team split pushes, and if I do I die, we lose.

Is the other team always \"in better sync\" than my team and able to win because of it? That sounds like nonsense.

You are part of the team and thus contribute to how well your team is in sync. It's like poker where yeah, luck plays a role, but there is also skill involved in reading other players, reading the cards, and deciding whether to fold and stay in. It also isn't defeatism, it's pragmatism. You don't expect to lose, you don't play to lose. And you always try your best. If you can't separate indicators of loss from your performance, that's on you.   \n\nIn tactics/strategy, you push where you have advantage and pull back where you are weak.

My individual skill doesn't mean anything if my team isn't \"in sync.\" I'm still not seeing how it isn't luck based.\n\n>Perhaps the confusion comes from you viewing it on an individual match basis while I'm looking at it from the perspective of climbing as a whole. In my mind, individual matches aren't as important as the overall trend.\n\nThe \"overall trend\" is winning 38 percent of the games I play, with the number decreasing rapidly (on my other account). I can't climb with that number, obviously. The other \"trend\" is that this happens most every game. If every game I have lost is like this one, was there no way of changing the outcome?\n\n>If you cant leave bronze, it's just because either you aren't playing enough matches\n\nSeveral accounts over 3 years; can't leave bronze. I can say with _absolute_ certainty that I have played \"enough\" games. \n\n>you aren't quite skilled enough at the game to push a team to victory\n\nBut I can only win if my team is \"in sync\" enough to win! You are telling me that my team _has_ to cooperate, but you are also telling me that I can be \"not skilled enough.\" Which is it? I can't win if I'm not skilled enough, but I can also not win if I am \"skilled enough\" but my team isn't synchronized? You realize I can just say: \"I can't get out of bronze because my teammates are never cooperating,\" and be _completely_ correct, right?\n\n>To climb you have to get better faster than the playerbase.\n\nYou just keep contradicting yourself! Does individual skill matter now? Does it not matter if my team isn't cooperating now? Carrying is possible now? I thought my team _had_ to be in better sync than the other team, apparently, that doesn't mean anything anymore. I can win by simply \"being good\" now.\n\nI'm trying to follow you here. I don't know if you are trying to tell me that I need to be an initiator and set up plays, or wait for my team to set up plays. I don't get what you mean by \"skilled enough,\" given your point on a team being \"synced.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-03-10T15:48:07.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I think you are taking it to an extreme. It's not that your team has to be perfectly in sync, it's that they have to be more in sync than the enemy team. That's where your individual skill comes into play. Can you read your own team and enemy teams actions well enough to make decisions? That is one part of skill. Can you then put those decisions into action? That's another part of skill.\n\nHere's an example of being more in sync than the enemy on a small scale that is directly owned by you. Let's say your top laner is hurt and is going to get health plant. Enemy jg happens to be on scuttle and sees your top laner as an easy kill. You are nearby and collapse on enemy jg to help your top laner while enemy top laner does not, and you kill enemy jg without losing your top laner. That secures a small gold advantage. \n\nIn that example, you personally put your team in sync better than the enemy team, at least for that small time period. That's how your individual skill comes into play to influence matches.  \n\nEven if your team isn't acting together, you can try to take opportunities to help them succeed so you can win. Sometimes your team will do the same for you so you can win. Sometimes you can't do it better than the enemy team and you lose. \n\nAnyway, that's how your team being in sync and personal skill both coexist to determine a games outcome. It isn't just about the others on the team, you are part of the team too and thus make a part of that cohesiveness. By the same token, you are only a part, so even if you have a rock solid game, you won't always get victory. Your participation though is what tilts the odds in your favor. \n\nIf you lose more than you win, the problem is in your own play. It may not be your mechanical skill. It might be your decision making, flexibility, or team play that are the culprit. Can't say without spectating.\n\nI also can't say what you should do, like be an initiator vs be a split pusher etc. That's something that is context sensitive and varies by game. It's part of your decision making skill to learn to tell which option is the best for your situation.\n\nWe all have limits to what we can achieve though. For example, in counterstrike, I'll never be top tier because my twitch reaction skills/precision just aren't that great. As league gets progressively twitchier I find myself dropping as well.

What if the game is just like this one?\n\nYou need to look at the advice I gave you more objectively than that. Each game of league is different, there will be games where this advice doesn't apply and other's where it does. Most of this advice was in regards to how you handled your team not using it's Baron buff by attempting to split pushing yourself. It's about knowing yours and your own teams limits. To solo carry, you need to have a keen eye for all of the plays that only require actions made by yourself to pull of, it's still a concept that can be done, but not as easily in season 7 as it was in the past.\n\nEvery game though, it's worth sizing up your allies as well as your opponents, try to get a grasp on their playstyles as quickly as you can and then as late game roles around, look to make plays using the information that you've gathered. Let's say that you're really good at flanking the enemy out of stealth in a team fight, that is all well and good, but if your team isn't in sync with your strategy or they don't know how to follow it up then it won't work. I wasn't saying that you're doomed 100% of the time or anything like that, not even close; I do apologize that that's how you read it though. It just takes a change of mindset. You need to look at the game from a different angle. \n\nMaybe this will be more helpful...\n\nWithout being toxic about it, think of your team mates like pawns in a game of chess. To you, they are just means to an end. Each pawn in this scenario though has different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses however. That said, always watch for ways to \"USE\" your team mates in the least risky way possible. Learn to manipulate them into doing something you want them to do without them even knowing that you're doing it. This is how I've started to play recently and it's really  helped me out a lot over my past few game.\n\n***Bare in mind, I only recently adopted this strategy so the results of it are still shoddy at best, but at the very least, I feel more in control of my games now which is helping out in it's own right.***","replies":[{"poster":"Lesbian Lopunny","date":"2017-03-10T15:07:14.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Let's say that you're really good at flanking the enemy out of stealth in a team fight, that is all well and good, but if your team isn't in sync with your strategy or they don't know how to follow it up then it won't work.\n\nYou're genuinely telling me to never do anything, then. I can't possibly know if my team will follow up. If I try and they don't, we lose. If I try and they do, it's ambiguous. I'm doomed to fail 100 percent of the time because I should make the logical assumption (for bronze) that my team will never follow up on anything I do. I can choose to engage, we can lose, and I can reinforce my helplessness. I'm _still_ fated by the actions of my team. It doesn't _matter_ what I do; I have to 'wait for my team and hope we will be better than the other team if we fight.'

It seems more like you aren't changing how you play, you are just giving yourself the illusion of control by acting like your teammates are pawns; that doesn't sound helpful. I don't even know what you mean by 'getting someone else to do something you want without them even knowing you made them do it.' Sounds like something a motivational speaker would say, and I don't like motivational speakers.\n\nI guess I'll just play around my team, then. I'm bound to whatever collective choice they make and fail or succeed, I can't do anything about it but play the game in my role, so to speak. I won't split push even when no one else will do it, I won't initiate if I am not an initiator even if someone else won't do it, and if I am an initiator, I will just 1 v 5 the enemy team.

That made Ali's, Yorick's, and WW's jobs (tank) much easier and meant winning your late game was always going to be rough.","replies":[{"poster":"Lesbian Lopunny","date":"2017-03-10T14:23:51.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're entire response could be summated by: c'est la vie. \n\nApparently, I'm hopeless to forces out of my control and if I win, it's _explicitly_ because I was lucky.

We, for example, looking at the match history have no clue how they were able to get 5 kills for 1 and 3 towers/1 inhib at the 23min mark. We just know that it happened, and it was a big factor in their eventual win. But I can't tell you what you should have done instead because I don't know what you actually _did_.\n\nAll we can do is look at the straight statistics, and tell you how why they were able to win based off the objective information given to us alone.\n\nWhat I can tell you is they had 3 people stacking armor, 2 with ninja tabis that make your aa's do 12% less damage to them, and one giving one of the carries 20 armor (knight's vow). Your 3 main damage dealers, _who all do primarily ad damage via autoattacks_,  including yourself did not buy any last whisper items, and the only penetration you guys bought was Lucians' yomous for 15 lethality which is a joke against late game tanks. That IS one of the reasons you guys lost. You guys needed better builds.

This game was a testament of \"trying something\" being a hollow concept. Clearly, there is a definitive way of playing this game that could be written on paper that I haven't been told; this game does not encourage lateral thinking whatsoever.\n\nSo improving isn't something that exists. If I am helpless to whatever my teammates decide to do, I can't do anything but what they do. Meaning if they want to lose, I have to be brought down with them. Furthermore, this supports me never getting out of bronze.\n\nI don't agree with this logic, but I'm seeing that it may be more truthful that I had hoped. I would like it if lateral thinking and individual skill meant something, but it doesn't seem to.","replies":[{"poster":"137434","date":"2017-03-10T14:51:00.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without seeing where you guys were warding, when you guys were splitting up, etc and what the other team was doing blanket statements are not much help.\n\nThings like ward more, stick together, etc only help so much. Eventually it is less about warding more and more about warding _smartly _ (because everyone \"wards more\" in higher elos for example), better map awareness, recognizing enemy behavior patterns (have they been playing cautiously but suddenly are very aggressive despite low health and/or mana? You are probably be baited into a gank. Are you guys about to gank but the normally aggressive enemy is suddenly cautious? He probably knows about the gank which means your ganker is probably sitting next to or walked by a ward), and recognizing when fights are lost causes and abandoning teammates to die, recognizing when teammates are sacrificing themselves to save you/your objectives etc. Those are more nuance though, and it is harder to give you the advice you need without actually seeing you play.","replies":[{"poster":"Lesbian Lopunny","date":"2017-03-10T15:33:19.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must have the mentality of someone higher than bronze, then, considering everything you just said is obvious to me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-03-10T13:56:44.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"One mistake late is game over\nAlso your team doesn't look great compared to theirs late game in team fights","replies":[{"poster":"Lesbian Lopunny","date":"2017-03-10T14:02:55.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The \"mistake\" wasn't late, it was early on.
