Fiora is a strong and confident character and she is a very skilled duelist but she cares about honor a great deal. She strives to bring honor back to her family and wouldn't do anything reckless that could bring them shame. She is not happy about killing and she even gives her opponents a way to forfeit the duel and save themselves with a minor punishment (compared to death). Even when her opponents disrespect her she doesn't show any disrespect towards them till their last breath. So she is really strong and cool but not cocky at all.
