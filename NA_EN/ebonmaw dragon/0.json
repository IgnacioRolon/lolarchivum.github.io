Von Yipp just wanted to give a new body to his beloved one, that is actually similar to the lore of Oriana.

LoR has an opportunity to show many different points in the Runeterran timeline. That lets them have cards of characters that are dead or in a different state (pre lantern Senna, pre murdered by Yasuo Yone, Ledros, Vrynna, etc) as well as introduce characters who could exist in the world or may exist in the world at some future point. \n\nLoR VO content also serves double duty of getting to give flavorful bits AND support gameplay by hinting at and calling out gameplay synergies (hello, Lux and Progress Day). \n\nDo two characters talk bc they work well together in the deck, or bc they have a history in world? Ideally both!

Katarina and Garen are a story of star crossed lovers (like many interactions already point out). The charme of their story comes from the fact that they are on opposing sides of a war. They would definitely love each other and be a couple if they wouldn't have been born in 2 opposing factions, that's the tragedy behind it.
