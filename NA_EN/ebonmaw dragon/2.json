Machines are perfect, they feel no grief nor pain; he felt better, and now wants YOU to see that you can feel better as well. \n\nAnd yet, everyone is looking at him seeing only a weirdo that cut off his own limbs to make himself a robot.

If not for people like him, there would be no market or tolerance for people like Mundo, Singed, and Warwick.  The pursuit of power in the absence of temperance and/or morals is what he's criticizing, and Viktor is a prime example of that.

Practically the only way to make Viktor more of a villain would be either to make him a Communist or a German Nazi. This quote from Viktor's lore  'He withdrew from the College and barricaded himself in his private laboratory, cutting all human ties. There, in secret, he conceived a project for which nobody else could claim credit. Desiring both to revolutionize his field and to eliminate the jealous human emotions which festered inside him, he engineered parts to replace and improve his own body. When Viktor re-emerged, **almost no trace of the original man remained**. Not only had he supplanted the majority of his anatomy, but his personality had changed. His previous hope to better society was replaced by an obsession with what he called ''the glorious evolution.\"' is about the same as the plot of at least thirty separate B-movies. More lore here \"His transformation had stripped him of what he perceived as his emotional weaknesses, but there was some lingering residue of resentment against the Professor.\" You know what other scientist eliminated emotional weaknesses? Well, here's a quote from Wikipedia as they discuss a mad scientist in a very popular British T.V show...\"Davros realizes that contamination from the nuclear and biological weapons used in the war is mutating the Kaled race, and artificially accelerates the process to examine the ultimate** evolutionary **end product. The mutations are weak and crippled, no more than one-eyed brains with tentacular appendages and with no hope of survival on their own. **His solution is to remove all emotions pertaining to weakness **(a category in which he groups such emotions as compassion, mercy and kindness) and place the mutants in tank-like \"**Mark III travel machines\"** partly based on the design of his wheelchair. He later names these creatures Daleks, an anagram of Kaleds.** Davros quickly becomes obsessed with his creations, considering them to be the ultimate form of life, superior to all others.** To stop his own people from shutting down his Dalek project, he arranges for them to be wiped out by the Thals, then **blames their destruction on a scientist that opposed him**, having the Daleks kill them.\" So, the creator of one of the most evil races in all of Doctor Who was a scientist who wanted to see where this \"glorious evolution\" led, decided the natural evolution was not glorious enough, and thus worthless, so he removed their emotions, put them in machines, became obsessed with his creation and considered them the ultimate lifeform. Where have we heard that before?","replies":[]}]}
