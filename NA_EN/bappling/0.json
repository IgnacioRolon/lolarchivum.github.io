It also looks like you've had several warnings in the past which eventually led up to this ban. Those warnings are meant to give you time to think about what might have happened that led to the punishment. \n\nIf you're playing on a different account in the future, remember that the best way to deal with those types of people is to simply report them for the behavior. That way they're the one with punishments and not yourself!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bappling","date":"2017-05-30T06:02:46.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't be okay in a different account this shit hurts my heart I've spent so much time love and money in this game and I've learned so much from it which  is crazy, why perma ban people, just perma ban them in chat, I've changed a lot from my previous games, look at my chat log, I encourage people to do better, and I defend people that are getting crap in game for not doing so well, this isn't fair, like I said if you guys want to permanently band my account atleast give me my money, show me that you guys care about your people, I'm never playing league again nor will I ever spend another penny on it. Over athousnd riot, over 1k. You guys shouldn't allow perma bans I sent you guys a message as well I've changed a lot in my mid set of league this is sad, figure something out riot. Why not just permantly ban chat? Ristrict that from me take it away from people. Don't let them chat or see chat. They can still communicate well using pings. As pings are already a big part of communication as well, as I've gone games not saying a word but using pings, like I said I've changed a lot I've gotten better at league and way way way, better with my attitude. Don't do this to me or other out there in my position as. One being dunkey, he was i think one away from challenger or something like that and some one in his game was trolling and he got a little toxic, you guys took away from him a lot, dunkey is one of the main reason I started to play and love league, you guys should figure out a way or a system because I have so much love for your game and I don't want to make a new account as it will never be the same :( sorry but riot you can't expect every one to be a dandy lion as every has that little bit of heat in them, make a system please don't ruin my love for this as this really helps put my mind away from personal shit that goes on in my life, kind of like my drug, people get fucked up to forget, I just play league lmfaooo be on a serious not, I hope you guys see where I'm coming from, sincerialy itamate ex league player\nPs - there are huge time gaps where I've stopped playing for a while look at the time gaps as well ","replies":[{"poster":"SadKill","date":"2017-05-30T15:00:08.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though you spent time and money on your account, you are responsible for what you say in the game, and in the end you don't actually own your account or any of the skins and stuff you bought, what you bought was the right to use them on that account. Riot Games has every right to do with your account as they see fit. Could it feel unfair? Yes.   Is it unfair? No. They set the rules that you accepted to when you signed up for the game and accept every patch as well. You broke those rules and were punished accordingly.\nSorry man.","replies":[{"poster":"shadow distroyer","date":"2017-06-04T00:36:03.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dam might as well {{summoner:6}} my ass back to spawn{{item:1001}} *gotta BLAST*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bappling","date":"2017-05-31T14:18:36.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol #boycottleague ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bappling","date":"2017-05-30T19:21:48.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude go look at my chat logs from all my past games like j said big time gap that I took breaks I've changed a lot!
