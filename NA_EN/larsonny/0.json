(note; this was only possible during Act I, Act II, and the Epilogue. Due to Miss Fortune's assassination attempt in Act III, Gangplank was temporarily disabled.) Wherever you heard \"buy six mystery skins you get a free skin after Burning Tides is over\" is a terrible source of information. You may have also gotten your information mixed up between Mystery Skins (can't tell what you're talking about in that respect, though) and Gangplank's Captain skin. However, since Captain Gangplank would very likely not be obtained for free by many players, Riot has placed the skin in the store for 975 Riot Points as of Wednesday, August 12th, two days after the Burning Tides event ended.","replies":[{"poster":"Nathan Kim","date":"2015-08-14T21:12:46.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot had a post about the free skins for buying 6 mystery items\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/mystery-skins-return","replies":[]}]}]}
