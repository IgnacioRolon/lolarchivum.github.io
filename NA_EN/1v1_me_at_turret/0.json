But things changed these last 8 months on boards for the better, and I was able to actually see the Moderators for who they are and see how much they cared. Why am I bringing this up? Because this right here is why we needed them, and not Volunteers to sit around and act like they have the best interest of the community at heart:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Galacius,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=IaEPc1Ei,comment->id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-17T01:25:01.387+0000)\n>\n> Heya,\n> \n> I will ask that if you want to shitpost that you obey the universal rules and adhere to this board&#x27;s >guidelines. A little humor is fine, but insulting others or having an intent to cause trouble isn&#x27;t. Please be >aware of this when you post OP and for the rest of you when you reply. Have fun and stay safe! \n> \n> Edit: I would also recommend that &quot;shitposting&quot; threads be posted in [General Discussion](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/mNBeEEkI) in the future. This thread can stay, but in the future we will start to ask all shitposting threads to move to GD.\n\n\n\nStealing this from Raw&#039;s thread because at this point and after Discord, I&#039;m done being fed the &quot;Oh Boards is going to be sooooo good after all this!&quot; It&#039;s horseshit. \n\nWe have been literally thrown around and beaten. Ignored. Forgotten. GD is literally the place no one really bothers with because of how our community is... but that doesn&#039;t mean we deserve to be the Warden&#039;s trashcan. We have a voice, albeit a very crass and vulgar one. We aren&#039;t always the most polite, hell our rules dictate we can be dicks to who ever we want as long as they aren&#039;t offended to the point of reporting it. That&#039;s who we are, because we are at least HONEST about how we feel. GD is home to the most passionate of the passionate, people who are arguably too... socially awkward to really voice their concerns in a rational manner, myself included. This community has meant a lot through the years, and I can&#039;t sit here and watch it become some trash can for some posters who got a big head.\n\nWe do this right, or we lose our home.","replies":[]}
