But what can we do about it, its pretty much apart of league. We gotta learn and continue to deal with it.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-04-01T03:54:44.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"hi im bannned","date":"2017-04-01T04:49:32.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the community is different from dota's community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-04-01T04:08:38.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's like people dont understand the option of muting lol.. You know, to ignore the person who decides to abuse voice chat, just like u can do vs people who abuse regular text chat?\n\nAlso, in my experience on Dota 2, i didn't have that many cases of flamers or dog barking or what ever.. and if i did you could easily just mute them problem solved..\n\nIf people focused more on communicating to win, maybe there would be less flaming in the chat.

People aren't as willing to talk shit because you're actually talking instead of hiding behind your keyboard.
