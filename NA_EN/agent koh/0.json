If i build anymore attack speed after that the passive becomes impossible to use effectively. I have over 70 games with the champion i would just like to know if this change in difficulty was intended.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-17T02:27:53.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been addressed in the [Bug Megathread](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2siyrp/51_patch_bugs_megathread/)!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikon Pie","date":"2015-01-17T03:15:42.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here too.
