As you know we make skins commemorating your achievements.  Which champions would you like for your skins?\n\nRuler: Hey wouldn't it be really cool to pick the duo of champions to highlight our success as a duo?\n\nCoreJJ: Yea it would be.  We choose Xayah and Rakan for Ruler and I.\n\nRioter 1: Wow thats actually a very fitting choice.  But Asol has been out for 391 more days than those two champs.  I know that neither one of you plays that champion or even the role he goes but we are going to give you gives each an Asol skin. how does that sound?\n\nCoreJJ and Ruler in unison: WOW! That sounds like a great idea.  We love it. Thanks Rito!\n\n\n>Valentine's day approaches\n\nRioter 1: Hey Valentine's day is coming up and these two lover champs would fit perfectly into that theme. Let's make skins for them. \n\nRioter 2: Nah Asol has been out for 391 more days than they have.  Even though they fit the theme much better and would probably make for higher quality skins relating to this event and a skin for Asol makes much less sense here lets make one for him instead.\n\nRioter 1: That logic checks out lets do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"biomaster","date":"2018-06-26T20:49:29.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats the third? they have the cosmic dawn and dusk skins, than the sweetheart ones. but I don't see a third.\n\nthe cosmic skins were launch skins which much like sol is a given.

Those Worlds skins _do not count_ because they are selected by the players who won, and not Riot themselves. They exist independently of the regular skin production schedule.\n\nThat said, they've already confirmed that Aurelion Sol will be getting a skin this year. It was in the update video a few months ago. Read your news, OP, and stay informed.","replies":[{"poster":"JimTheSnail","date":"2018-06-26T21:01:26.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"His point is that it is absurd that newer or more popular champs are getting more skins then champions that where released and only got the one that they come with. They go by most popular champs so that they get more money for making the skin. While champs that are not popular suffer multiple years with ought skins just because RIOT is unwilling to change something of the champ or try to make them more popular. YOU COULD in theory make a skin for an unpopular champ to bring up popularity but for moneys sake that is a bad idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-06-26T21:16:02.802+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not absurd, that's business. Furthermore, Rakan and Xayah will have the same amount of skins as Sol once his skin releases this year - again, because their SSG skins _do not count._ The SSG skins are trophies and rewards to SSG for winning Worlds, they're not part of the standard production cycle. We can't count them because Riot isn't actively _choosing_ to make those skins - SSG chose to have those skins made, and Riot is doing so to reward them. \n\nSo in the grand scheme, yes, Rakan and Xayah did get their first skins before Sol, but also, the skins they got fit their thematic so perfectly, and was demanded not only by their fans, but other players as well, that it would have been poor decision making on Riot's part if they let Valentine's Day slide past without jumping on this opportunity to capitalize on a perfect storm of theme and holiday. Aurelion Sol will get his due. They've announced with resolution that he will get a skin this year, the same year Xayah and Rakan got their first skins. Give it time and patience.\n\nAs for the business decision to make skins for popular champs - this is a no-brainer. It's a necessity for the company to make profit, and all that extra profit they make gives them financial padding so that they can then take risks and make content for champions that aren't so popular and that won't make a heavy return on the investment they put into making a skin for them. So popular champions skins are _required_ for low popularity champions to receive skins. Without them getting skins, there wouldn't be the room for low returns on their investments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-06-27T16:08:28.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot tries to make champs more popular.
