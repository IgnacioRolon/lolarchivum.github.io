I haven&#039;t seen anyone talk about this before, so I decided to try and raise awareness myself about this issue.\nFor the sake of credibility, I&#039;ll state that I play since Season 2 and I finished as Challenger last season. What I&#039;m trying to say is that I know how abilities are supposed to function, and how abilities are supposed to interact.\n\nThe tl;dr here is: **There are a lot of inconsistencies in how abilities function and interact. Call it bugs if you may. **\n\nThough it&#039;s important to note - these aren&#039;t bugs in the sense of &quot;Follow X reproduction steps in order to recreate&quot; - these are *inconsistencies*, so it may act this way or the other. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve encountered a single occurrence more than once, but instead a lot of different ones all over the place.\nI guess I should mention that I play a variety of champions regularly, so it&#039;s not just a single champion that &quot;broke&quot; at some point.\n\nWhat made me finally decide to write this post is the recent Hashinshin clip where Fiora&#039;s Q goes through his Counter Strike, and her passive with it.\nI feel like things of this sort happened to me *countless* times since the preseason update. It may or may not have been exactly on the preseason patch, but it definitely feels like it started around that time.\n\nIf you feel like something of this sort happened to you, you can share it; though I feel like tackling these issues one by one is impossible. Honestly, I'm clueless at this point.\n\n######[I haven&#039;t posted this in the Bug Reports boards for a reason. This feels more like a fundamental issue affecting gameplay rather than a bug, and I believe I explained how this differs from normal bugs.]","replies":[{"poster":"greekvandaL","date":"2018-02-06T15:25:40.160+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"Everytime the enemy picks Taric i instantly dodge regardless of elo. ( well i mean high gold till high diamond ) Cause they got an unfair advantage. His E is bugged the hitbox particle does not by any mean match the ability and it stuns at the very least 50-75 units outside the supposed hitbox.\nAnother one often occuring is Nidalee spears going through you.\nThe whole loophole effect riot mentions which in other words it's just a term they came up with for lazy programming. \nThings like Cho Q hitting outside hitbox and a lot of other aoe ranged abilites.\nRFC procing well outside it's listed range up to 80units further than the particle mentions. List can go on all these are minor but game changing but they do not care lets make more Lux skins.\n\nAnother extremenly annoying bug where Kayn's Q cancels out if he does it if he autoattacks instantly after he leaves a wall with E. All those Syndra bugs that got fixed because the Syndra community started an Uproar.\nAll the Draven bugs that make him unplayable atm etc. \nGp's Q goes through Jax's E consistently at times bunch of broken shit mate. \nLet's make Lux skins so people can fap to her fan art on league porn sites.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha D Reptile","date":"2018-02-06T19:16:16.337+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">All those Syndra bugs that got fixed because the Syndra community started an Uproar.\n\nYou mean that one bug that got fixed after like 10 months of utterly ruining the champion and getting worse every few patches like 2 years ago and then another bug that happens once in a lifetime, while a number of champion-breaking ones are still not fixed?\n\nTell me about that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2018-02-07T00:05:55.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget Jinx ults going through you.
