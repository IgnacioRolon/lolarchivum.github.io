We only knew of it by the abominations it produced in incursions and Void creatures are extremely rare sightings and very dangerous.

We got some backup for this from Rek's new(ish) color story, where she uses that poor kid's void-corrupted soul to continue her work on a Void portal.\n\nWith the addition of the Void's faction blurb, it has moved away from a Dungeon Dimension sort of scenario and more toward a bio-mechanical hellscape with a pretty strong Zerg/Tyranid flavor.\n\nSo there was stuff we could infer.  Trying to piece the bits together to form a more coherent picture was part of the fun.  It's less fun when the pieces get tossed out and the conclusions people drew based on those now retconed pieces evaporates like dead voidmeat.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-02-24T02:21:39.776+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of that is true (and well researched/referenced!)\n\nBut it's not the complete picture.

That would be an absurd position to take.  Obviously I'm fond of my pet theories and head-canon, and I'm curious to see how it falls in line with (or doesn't) the new material we're getting.  Most of my anxiety has been stemming from from the impression that Kai'Sa's experiences erode the existential threat that the Void represents, shifting the threat from the Void itself to the nasty things that live in it.  Pushing it from Cosmic Horror to Space Invaders, so to speak.\n\n> We&#x27;re always striving for the &quot;both/and&quot; solution, not an &quot;either/or&quot; solution.\n\nThat's what I like to hear.

Which means that even if people don't see how Kai'Sa fits into the Void, she comes from the unknown pieces of the puzzle that we previously never had or hadn't considered before.\n\nI'm very excited about the actual Void lore because that place really got my attention because of Vel'Koz.

The bio-mechanical description of the Void in its blurb is pretty telling.\n\nI'm mostly hoping that tentatively physical nature of Void beasties sticks around.  Like what we see of them in Diana and Sol's color stories.  Things that shouldn't exist.  Things that *stop* existing as soon as there isn't a will holding them coherent anymore.  Things that don't quite *get* physical laws and react in counter-intuitive ways sometimes.\n\nIt's been clear for a while now that Riot has been shifting the Void toward 'Not-Tyranids' and I've more or less made peace with that.  I'm just hoping they don't *totally* lose the Cosmic Horror vibe.

Now that I know some of the Cosmic Horror elements are sticking around, I think I can be at peace with whatever direction Riot takes.\n\nAs an aside, I suspect we may be learning soon that the Void has areas of varying intensity in terms of its mutagenic awfulness.  That's probably going to factor into why Kai'Sa was able to persist long enough to find her voidfriend while Kass got messed up pretty quick in spite of his ample prep for the trip.\n\nPeople were reacting sourly because the short lore bits we got are suggesting it was JUST a matter of force of will (and voidfriend), which feels a little cheap.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2018-02-25T16:44:39.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One theory I have about the Void, thinking of corruption and varying intensities, is that I think part of it might be less willpower and more one's general mindset. From what we know of Kai'sa, she was forced to adapt inside the void, changing how she did things so she could survive. Kassadin's new short lore, on the other hand, says that while he may have gotten artifacts to ward off Void corruption, he didn't exactly work to prevent it beyond those basic countermeasures. I think that one's state of mind may influence how the void affects you as he was probably rather desperate and broken over the loss of his daughter, so when the Void breached his magic artifact barrier he didn't put up much of a fight, whereas Kai'sa couldn't really just succumb to the void if she wanted to survive. And even if they do get corrupted (Kai'sa is definitely corrupted, it just takes a different shape in the form of Voidfriend), they still seem to maintain some sanity. For all his serving the Void, Malzahar seems as sane as any other Runeterran, he's just working for a different faction.\n\nThe other pieces of evidence I have for this are Jax, who seems to be the most corrupted yet also the most sane of all the survivors of Icathia, which suggests a stronger willpower after an initial breakdown, and Zilean, who despite being from Icathia is unscathed. It seems like just being exposed to the Void isn't an automatic trip to the mountains of madness, and physical corruption is more caused by panic or moments of weakness rather than just being near the void.\n\nYou make a good point about why people were reacting negatively, I just wish people could wait for all the details or think about potential explanation for things before saying that Riot has ruined the Void. I hope you enjoy the new Void lore!\n\n(side note: until given evidence that Kai'sa and voidfriend hate each other and only work together out of necessity, I'm totally going to imagine that when they're not fighting they just hang out together)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-02-23T21:20:06.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you worried that itâ€™s more alien than lovecraft?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2018-02-24T00:01:57.341+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chromatic Eagle,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bZkgJk8y,comment-id=000100040001,timestamp=2018-02-23T21:20:06.025+0000)\n>\n> Are you worried that itâ€™s more alien than Lovecraft?\n\nBasically, yeah.
