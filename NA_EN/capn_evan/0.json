I'm willing to give it another try, because I love League of Legends, and this is apparently the best place to discuss it. I hope it will be taken into consideration this time.\n\nSince boards came out, it has gone through a series of changes to make it the best forum experience for everyone. I can tell you that from an experienced forumers point of view, this forum is severely lacking in vital areas. So what makes a good forum?\n\nForums must be beginner friendly. Anyone can jump in and start a discussion, and being taken seriously by its readers.\n\nFreedom of speech. Anything that does not break the rules of the forum should be allowed to be said. Those forums that limit the topics that can be spoken about (for example neglecting to include the vital subforums required), are bad forums.\n\nTopic protection. Any topic should be freely available, and easily accessible to a majority of readers, at the original poster's discretion. Forums that hide threads that are less popular among the community, is a bully community that drowns unpopular opinion and chokes good discussion.\n\nVocal opinions should only be challenged by another vocal opinion. If a vocal opinion is challenged by a silent voter, for example, the whole point of the forums is a mute point, since there'll be no discussion.\n\nOkay, so some of these points go around each other, and they're supposed to do that. The bottom line is, make a forum where everyone can be heard. And I'm sure most people want that.\n\nNow what does League Boards have that is in opposition to this? Some of it may be obvious from the way I wrote my points earlier, but I'm going to say it anyway:\n\nThe first opinion I want to take up is that the category system (Best, Hot, New, Recent) is highly flawed, and only showcases a small minority of threads to the public. This goes against point 3, about topic protection. If your post is dismissed or falls behind the top spots on either of these categories, your topic is dead, and unable to revive it without something additional to add.\n\nThe reason why this is bad is because a majority of readers are not on at the same time, reading the same category in the same subforum. This means only a small handful of people will ever get to read your topic, and those might be a sample of people that will not create good debate.\n\nThe second opinion I want to highlight is that the voting system creates a highly negative atmosphere, and ties into all 4 points. Beginner forumers that do not know how to create a popular topic, will easily be dismissed and downvoted by the majority. Then they might see that this forum is not a good place to be and leave instead of trying to work on their topics.\n\nDownvoting makes a topic less inclined to receive comments that can challenge, and even change the original poster's mind about the topic, leading to possible future topics that are not so popular either. Downvotes only create spite, and out of spite, hate is born. We don't want that, do we?\n\nFixing these two problems will change the forums for the better, forever. The two solutions I have in mind are easy to grasp, and are already successful parts of other forums I've been a part of, so I know they do work.\n\nThe first suggestion:\nTo make the forum a place where threads are visible to most people whenever the OP is online to discuss it, a simple feature has to be implemented. That feature is called a bump button. Runescape's official forums is one of the few forums I've been to who has this system and uses it successfully.\n\nA bump button has a cooldown timer of 10 minutes for any thread (not per thread, 10 minutes for all of them), and can be accessed by the original poster only. It is located next to the edit button on each of the OP's posts.\n\nWhen it is clicked, the topic is bumped to the top of the \"recent\" tab (the classical forum tab) on the first page, making it visible to anyone viewing it.\n\nThe bump button contributes to sorting the topics with an active OP first, and any OP can do it with their thread every 10 minutes. This gives OP the opportunity to let their thread fall behind the others when they go away, and when they come back and ready to discuss more they can bump it to the front, making it more realistic for an OP to control the traffic in their thread.\n\nThe second suggestion\nRemove downvoting, keep upvoting in place. The reason is simple. There is no \"unpopular\" tab, only \"best\" and \"hot\" tabs that are affected by upvotes. There is no single reason to have downvotes though. The thread doesn't magically fall into a category where other people can read it, it simply destroys any constructive debate in that thread. That's all the downvotes do. Those who don't like a topic can instead choose to ignore it instead. No harm will be done. So remove downvotes, and keep upvotes.\n\nhttp://gph.is/2mqQ4DM\n\nNeed I say more?","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-03-22T02:58:18.997+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like a lot of your points.

Can you give me an example of one forum that is what you're describing?\n\nI'm not saying downvotes have no use. I'm saying they're doing absolutely no good for constructive debate. No, banning \"toxic\" posts won't make them go away. It will make the authors angrier, making new more horrible posts until there is nothing but toxic, complaining, whiny threads with zero effort or value in them.\n\nWithout downvotes, all you have to do is upvote stuff you like, and ignore the things you don't like. There will be no reason to nullify the upvote of someone else.\n\nTruth is, with the current system, you have no way of knowing if one person liked your comment/post, or if 10 people liked it and 9 people disliked it. That's what downvoting does, it's basically a \"screw you\" button for those who like your content. Even worse, it's a gang-up button if you're already in the negative.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-03-23T14:40:33.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Capn Evan,realm=EUW,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=3PF2KidI,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-03-23T13:18:39.156+0000)Without downvotes, all you have to do is upvote stuff you like, and ignore the things you don't like.

As you said, people find it easier to press the downvote button than upvoting. Adding more categories for people to use to downvote isn't going to help much. Downvoting isn't working as intended either. You may think that it helps in identifying bad threads so nobody reads them, but what it really does is choke any discussion in those threads. People who would otherwise read a thread at 0 upvotes, now won't bother because it's downvoted. It's tainted. Even if they read it, they'll do so with a negative perspective. That's also human nature. \n\nAnd again this ties into my point about beginner friendliness. How would you feel if you created a post for the first time, you put lots of effort into writing a funny or a serious post, and 5 minutes later, you're -5 on that thread and it's dead within an hour?\n\nThose new positive categories are interesting though. We should definitely have the option to sort threads into different categories. None of them should be \"bad\" categories, just funny/important etc. \n\nThe spam category is totally unnecessary. With the new bump button, spam threads would disappear quick enough on their own without someone upvoting them.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-03-23T22:36:04.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Capn Evan,realm=EUW,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=3PF2KidI,comment-id=0002000000010000,timestamp=2017-03-23T22:22:11.948+0000)You're kind of contradicting yourself on your suggestion though.

Remember you're talking to a veteran Runescape player here. \n\nSay you log on once a day to bump your thread using a comment. With a daily bump, how long do you think your thread will stay on the front page? 20, maybe 30 minutes (of course depending on traffic)? I'm talking with the current system. Sure, it will stay on the front page longer than if people can bump more often, but know that people can be updating the forum every second, and the first seconds of it being on top of the recent tab are way more valuable than the 10-15 extra minutes you get in spot 10.\n\nThey only have to spot your thead once, and you'll have readers. Of course, the better your title looks, the more chance of it catching someone's eye. Without the bump button though, no matter how good your title is, you need insane luck with who is on whenever you refresh it with a comment, and if you're unlucky just once, and you've already commented last, according to the TOS you can't ever bump it again without adding something new. And your topic is dead.\n\nThe main point I need to get through is the elimination of luck. People who CAN spend a lot of time at their computer can eliminate the luck factor, or minimize it at least, and can after a few hours of bumping know whether their thread has potential or sucks. I know what you're thinking: What if people just sit there and bump their own threads and don't read other people's threads?\n\nWell, that's always a risk anyhow. Why should those people stick around and read other people's threads instead of just checking in on their own threads once in a while, then go play a game or watch Netflix? I mean, what will change their behavior if they have a bump button? Nothing.\n\nI get your point about making forums move as slowly as possible. However, the more successful a forum is, the faster it's gonna move. No matter the system implemented. Now, do you want 1000 people reading the forum at all times, or 18 people scrolling a dead forum that never gets updated with new topics? If you want the former, you can't rely on forums moving slowly enough for your thread to be spotted by the right people at the right times. You need a safety net. And you need a reliable safety net that allows your topic to be read when you are available to respond.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Capn Evan","date":"2017-04-06T14:27:17.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=3PF2KidI,comment-id=0002000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-23T23:07:38.918+0000)\n>\n> I also think that, at this point, Runescape has a more curated community -- there are a lot of newer, shinier games around, so most of the Runescape players (I imagine) just really love the game and the community.\n> \n> Now, I&#x27;d LOVE to have that here, but I do think we need to remember to design for the transition period as well.

It's in the bottom right. If a thread itself is bothering you, then just report the OP.\n\n(Btw, not to be mean but \"hardly\" means the opposite of what it sounds like.
