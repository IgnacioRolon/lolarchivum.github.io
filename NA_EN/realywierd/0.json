Just played a ranked game all the way through without even realizing it was a ranked game. I didn't intend to play a ranked game, so through out the game I was doing things different, and testing other things out. This could be for just about anything, new champs, roles, build paths, skill order, etc. I think when you are queued up in games you need to have a way to see what queue you are in. In game, maybe its fine if nothing is shown actually in game, but I do feel that when I'm in champ select and making decision about a game I'm about to play that there should be clarity for what I'm about to actually do.\r\n\r\nTLDR- Tell me in champ select that I'm queued for ranked vs normal.","replies":[]}
