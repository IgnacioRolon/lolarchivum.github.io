It's just a reminder of all the things they will have to unlock again just to get back to where they were.\n\nYou and some others willing to waste time starting over again and again doesn't mean that everyone is willing to do it.\n\nIf you enjoyed \"playing with the noobs and owning them\" more than playing on a long-term account, you would never have a long-term account to get banned in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"AvidKane","date":"2019-05-23T14:52:17.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"There is zero difference in a lvl 30 account vs lvl 100 account, except maybe the champs.

Anyone can make a new account for any reason and the only way to curb a specific person from doing it is if they're notable (such as a streamer or content creator) or if you have to verify accounts with things like SMS or ID numbers.\n\n Although I should mention, Riot isn't the one making things worse for new players, the permanently banned players are the ones doing that. It's not Riot's fault that someone chooses to come back and berate new players, they're choosing to disregard the clearly laid out rules and _**because**_ they disagree with them, they think they have a right to be angry and take it out on others. \n\nIt's an endless cycle and the only way for someone to break it is to be self-aware and act maturely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-05-23T05:39:38.587+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not everyone who gets banned creates new accounts, and those that do risk having their new accounts banned if they display the same or a similar kind of poor behavior that caused their previous accounts to get banned.

Most permanently banned players leave the game. Of those that don't, they get tired eventually of having to keep switching accounts. Or they simply be a decent person and stop getting banned?","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-05-23T07:58:52.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not disagreeing with your general point, but I don't think suspending somebody's driver's license is a good comparison. Prohibiting people from driving is much more enforceable than permabans, because permabans are the final punishment. Even if Riot prohibited you from making new accounts, the only punishment they could impose on you would be more permabans.\n\nDriving with a suspended/revoked license (the equivalent of making a new account after being permabanned) on the other hand, carries a different punishment, including potential prison/jail time. And I'm sure you agree that once somebody is physically locked up it becomes fairly easy to make sure they don't drive any cars.\n\nI'd stick with the movie theater example.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-23T06:02:55.253+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because most people aren't so unbalanced that they'll board a Hate Train and load it with a cargo of throwaway accounts so they can distribute \"nice flash, stupid\" to the world until the sun winks out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Martyn Jon VII","date":"2019-05-23T15:21:25.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should ban your IP address instead.
