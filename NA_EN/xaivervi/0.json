One of the things I've noticed though, is that you can currently only gift using Riot Points. It would be a good idea if Riot started allowing people to gift using Influence Points. I understand if they don't because some people would possibly abuse the game and make multiple accounts for the win of the day. But there would also be some people that wouldn't abuse it. It would be a better system to have you be able to gift with IP and a lot of people would really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Matthias9119","date":"2015-07-18T22:08:13.806+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"...and then there were a thousand times more bot accounts grinding out IP.\n\nSorry, causes way too many problems.","replies":[{"poster":"LICENSED HOOKER","date":"2015-07-19T01:48:22.015+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raw","date":"2015-07-19T11:38:32.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Matthias9119,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=sP1B6EJE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-18T22:08:13.806+0000)\n>\n> ...and then there were a thousand times more bot accounts grinding out IP.\n> \n> Sorry, causes way too many problems.\n\nIf bots are able to grind from level 1 to level 10 (level requirement for gifting) without getting caught, that's Riot's fault for failing to detect botting.\n\n\n*Sincerely,*\n\nhttp://www.auplod.com/u/lpodua564a6.png","replies":[{"poster":"Matthias9119","date":"2015-07-19T16:43:03.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, it is **extraordinarily** difficult to detect client-side botting.

If Riot made it possible to gift anything with IP, that would certainly lose them A TON of money, so they would definitely have to limit this to champions only (that is if they were to do this).\n\nHowever, I think it's safe to assume that a large majority of the players still spend quite a bit of money to buy champions with RP since it takes so long to build up enough IP to get a decent amount of champions, not to mention also needing to buy runes with IP. Since there are a lot players with a shit ton of IP that they can't spend on anything, they would just spend that IP to gift a lot of champions to their friends. So even if Riot were to limit this to champions only, they would very likely lose quite a bit of money from RP purchases because of it, since people would likely no longer feel the need to buy RP to unlock champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-07-19T15:24:44.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If gifting IP was an ability ~~purchased with 450 RP~~ required the summoner to charge RP to his account first + grants a donor icon, that wouldn't be a problem because even abusers must buy RP to use this feature.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FriendIy Psycho","date":"2015-07-19T05:38:52.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As it would be convenient riot still needs a way to make money. there would be no point in having RP in this case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SunriseSkaterKid","date":"2015-07-19T04:34:52.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bad idea.
