We definitely want to build a more sophisticated sorting model that could help with this.\n\n\n\n**If I don't post circlejerky nonsense then nobody will see my post**\n\nI think that right now this isn't a problem because there isn't a enough content for some to be \"never seen\". in the future I think the way this gets solved is varying contexts where in the right context any content can be relevant and highly viewed. If you use reddit as a comparison which a lot of people seem to be doing - you can't just look at /r/leagueoflegends but instead at reddit in its entirety. The #1 post on the LoL subreddit is about streamers crushing low elo players. In the context of LoL it's the most important topic, but on all of Reddit it doesn't break the top 200. I think our plan for this community platform is that there are eventually tons and tons of different communities each with their own cultures, rules, and moderation styles.

Additionally the tags function may be locked until the account your commenting with is level 30.\n\nTags could be removable too by requiring a -2 (or less) vote on those tags, while their resistance would be built up by people confirming the tags.

I assume ComSubs work similarly to subreddits in the sense that you can set rules and moderate as heavily as you want by removing threads/posts on an individual basis, but subreddit moderators can't actually affect or counteract community voting.\n\n*That being said*, the ability to change how topics show/stay on the front page of a ComSub would be much appreciated. Even giving moderators the ability to sticky multiple threads to make sure they can't get downvoted to oblivion, or the ability to choose how the ComSub's front page is sorted by default, would help greatly. Of course, the best would be giving individual ComSubs the ability to weight factors like time, votes and posts, but that would also introduce a level of inconsistency across the site that I don't think would work even on reddit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ratcharmer","date":"2014-02-19T19:11:51.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **If I don't post circlejerky nonsense then nobody will see my post**\nI think that right now this isn't a problem because there isn't a enough content for some to be \"never seen\". in the future I think the way this gets solved is varying contexts where in the right context any content can be relevant and highly viewed.\n\nThe issue with your reasoning here is that rate of content creation and number of viewers are roughly proportionate to one another. \n\nThus, if there aren't enough threads being created to bury your post, then odds are there also aren't many people online to look at your post.

More of an intermediary solution imho.   \n---Give reports and Red posts ordering weight  \nWhile not solving the problem of immediate visibility, if a Red posts it could provide additional momentum to increase visibility. Most posts where I see Reds (this one for example) are well-thought out and presented well enough to intice a response. Along with reports being a tool to deny controversial/trolling posts the visibility they do not deserve.  \n---Moderation of some kind, be it volunteers or Reds.  \nPersonally not a huge fan, but moderation that allows control over posts would allow for an easier time to \"tweak\" visibility of posts.

More topics can allow for more constructive posts in appropriate areas and funnel funny/troll stuff to other topics that allow and even encourage that.

Pretty interesting question. I think that the obvious would include general activity like comments, replies, and the vote system should be incorporated, but how.\n\n**DEFINITIONS**\n\nSo, I'm going to define relevant as it relates to the topic stated, as otherwise I just don't see anything else you could really measure for relevance with the current system. There is no tag system, and the current community system already has problems staying true to the community (just check Site Feedback, filled with Server Status complaints, balance things from pbe still occasionally happen, and also some things that better fit Help & Support) Also, considering that what may be relevant for you might not matter to me, I'm going to restrict \"relevant\" to meaning \"relevant to the topic, AKA staying on topic\".\n\nI'm also going to define \"fresh\" as new activity. This means that the more recent the actions taken are, the more weight that particular factor is in deciding the ordering on the front page. \n\n**OPINION**\n\nHow I would achieve this would weigh total vote count minimally, and direct replies to the OP much higher, with subsequent response levels weigh a little lower with each layer. If a post is simply being upvoted, while it will still help, if there is no discussion going on, then why is it on page 1? Likewise, if all the posts are a response to the top comment, then chances are a derailment is going on. That said, if there is alot of traffic in that first comment, and the other factors are weighing well, the discussion could still hit the first page.\n\nAlso, I would take a total upvote/downvote ratio of the thread, and the closer to a range around 1 - 1.5 ratio (this number can be played with) means that the thread has more \"relevant\" material, not just circlejerking/counter-circlejerking. In other words, if the thread is mostly upvotes, or mostly downvotes, the less likely it is to be seen. The idea is that if all that is happening is everyone agreeing and upvoting, then chances are that there isn't a whole lot to discuss, while on the flip side if everyone is downvoted hard, then chances are the thread isn't really being productive.\n\nLastly, the Rate at which actions are happening in the thread would be a large factor. Frankly, if alot of discussion is happening, that is worthy of recognition.\n\nTo prevent Bumping, or any anomilies: these factors will ignore the auto self vote that happens when you post, and actions that happen sequentially by the same person (like upvoting then responding will only count as 1 action, just like five posts replying to yourself will essentially be 1 action). \n\nThis weight will degrade over time if it isn't updated. In otherwords, A mega thread can stay near the top for a while, but if the discussion dies down, it will eventually drift downwards.\n\nI hope that was readable, and it made sense. Feel free to ask me to clarify on any points you didn't quite understand. As a footnote, I would like to know if you have any plans to help out lengthier posts like this one.
