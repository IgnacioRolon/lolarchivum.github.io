If it is weird mouse clicks, my mouse is broken and it randomly clicks or double clicks, the laser on the bottom of my mouse sometimes just slips and causes weird movements... I have just heard that sometimes weird mouse movements cause the system to think it is a bot.\r\n\r\nI sometimes use different keybindings on my keyboard due to the crazy amount of bindings I have, if that is the case, then I seriously apologize and have had 0 knowledge that THAT is illegal in anyways.\r\n\r\nJust please, give me some how to prove myself that I did not use any hacks or scripts etc etc, I am honestly just stressed out of my mind and this is just due to mental issues I have that cause me to become attached to something very strongly","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2016-01-16T03:14:11.051+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"Heya DynastyNam, \n\nThis is going to be fairly straightforward, but I'll elaborate the best I'm able or allowed:\n\nBack in late-September, it looks like you tried a scripting application for a few days and for several games.   As an arbiter of the system that detected you, I am personally and statistically confident that the evidence here is accurate.  I know it can feel like you're innocent because you've since stopped abusing it, but as the majority of those games were ranked, it really wouldn't be fair to exonerate you.\n\nCheating is cheating, and winning isn't everything.","replies":[{"poster":"DynastyNam","date":"2016-01-16T04:06:25.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"See and this is what I am so confused about, I recently sent in a message to riot explain what may have caused this to happen.\nI sent my computer today to get it checked out for viruses/malware and was looking into why my email was getting hijacked over and over again... they found out I was getting keylogged and had many many viruses and malware :/\n\nI am not quite sure how I can prove it but I seriously did not even use a script of any sort :/ I am going to keep my word on this but I seriously did not script.\n\nIf you ask about sharing accounts I never do, not for anything, I do not let anyone on my account :/\n\nI would never even think of using a script. If there is some way for me to prove it, please let me know I've spent so long building that account I would not be as so stupid to ruin it by scripting for a few days or few games :/\n\nEdit: I do appreciate the fact that I was able to get a response back\n\nEdit2: Wait, you said late September?? I was not even in my home town half of september or even had the chance to play league :/ I was in the middle east visiting my grandfather who was dying of cancer :/ I know that could be some excuse, but I am very serious here, I was not even in my home town to play during those few weeks\n\nEdit3: yeah I went to go check with my travel info (passport), from the 13th of september - 18th of october is when I was gone in the middle east","replies":[{"poster":"JQKAndrei","date":"2016-01-17T12:12:33.033+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your match history clearly shows the account was active during those days.

The way I think of it is that if you did use a third party software lets say a year ago for maybe lets say a month or maybe a few days, then later stop, then about 10-11 months later get perma-banned. That is kinda how I think 20k plus accounts got banned\n\nEdit: But at the same time I believe that is how innocent people get banned, for example I used curse voice chat up until they said it was illegal, then I deleted it as soon as they said that, I feel like that may be the reason and it is stressing me out like crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2016-01-15T02:35:50.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah there was a ban wave after the curse voice thing.
