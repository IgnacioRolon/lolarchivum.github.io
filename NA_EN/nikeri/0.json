I thought I would share a few things I feel are advantageous.\r\n\r\n**Tip #1: never build tear (especially if your Karthus)!** I feel like this is every AP's go to starting item. I get it \"I'm going to be spamming abilities, so I need mana.\" \r\nTwo things:\r\n1) **If you are AP** and don't need the heavy engage from Mark/Dash (Such as Morgana or Fiddlesticks) then you should **take Clarity**, Clarity is incredibly efficient, and provides a huge boon to yourself and your team.\r\n2) **The new health relics provide AOE health and mana**, and spawn at 2:00. If your team goes damage instead of mana then it's likely you can push the lane towards the enemy turret. That means you can benefit from not one, not two, but three health relics! They however will only get one. And don't be afraid to back up to pick up the relics; the faster you grab them, the faster they respawn, the more advantage you build.\r\nMy typical go-to is 1 amplifying tomb 1 blasting wand 2 health pots. I feel like they're the most versatile starting items; it provides plenty of AP, sustain, and you can build into many paths depending on the situation. \r\n\r\n**Tip #2: don't be selfish!** Speaking of taking Clarity, remember, more than Summoner's Rift, ARAM is a team game. Many times on Summoner's Rift K/D is a big identifier as to how a lane is performing. In ARAM don't focus on your own K/D.\r\n1) **If you're a tank**, don't worry about getting flamed by your teammates,  **Engage!** In Summoner's Rift ADC's are paired with a support that usually provides some kind of CC so they can get into position. I hate playing when people are more scared about dying, than defending turret. I've seen plenty of games where the tank is afraid of dying, hides by turret with a 3/2 K/D, and then blames the ADC for not doing damage. Nothing is more frustrating than being an ADC on Howling Abyss and not being able to walk forward without being barraged with CC and being melted.\r\n2) Speaking of which, **body blocking is a thing.** Sometimes your life is worth less than others on your team, figuratively and literally. Let's be honest, we're all going to die. If you can stall the 4/0 Caitlyn from drying, the kill gold will be less. and perhaps someone on their team may have to wait for an additional death before completing an item. Now don't needlessly throw your life away, but it may be better they stay in lane and continue to get CS than you.\r\n3) Oh and about CS: **give the minions to the pokey-est, AOE-est champions.** If you want your team to output the greatest damage, let Ziggs clear the wave. Look there is only one lane, and everyone wants the cannon minion. Truth is if Tahm Kench keeps stealing CS, your team is going to lose. Keep that pressure on by giving the CS to your AP carry. Now there comes a point when the scale tips, and you'll have to judge it. At some point that champ will become a target for the other team, and if you don't have the comp to keep him safe, consider switching the champ that's killing the minions. Also judge by how much kill gold everyone is getting. If Ziggs is getting all the CS and the kills, but Jhin isn't doing much, give some CS to him before he falls off. Regardless, Zac shouldn't be fighting people for CS ever.\r\n\r\n**Tip #3: build for advantage.** So it is ARAM, and there is a chance you'll get an all AD or all AP team. Perhaps one of you could change. But let me suggest some overlooked items.\r\n**1) Gargoyle Stoneplate. **There is a good chance nobody has read this far, but if you have, this is a gem. Some of you probably don't even know what this is. With it's passive active, Gargoyle Stoneplate provides more MR and Armor than any other item in the game, save Frozen Heart which provides 100 armor, and Thornmail which provides the same amount at 80. No single item provides the same amount of MR. Now, I'm not saying rush this item, especially because it provides zero health, however the aura on this thing is massive, which means if you are engaging it's likely that it will be active. If you're a tank and facing a mixed team of AP and AD few items will prove more valuable. Not only that, but its several hundred gold cheaper than many tank items, plus if you go down the inspiration tree you can cut off another 250 gold if you're into that sort of thing. I find this as a useful second item after building a health item like ROA or Crystal Scepter. \r\n**2) Rylai's Crystal Scepter. **Speaking of which if your team has minimal CC, someone should probably buy this. That slow is perfect to help your team engage/disengage quickly, even though its only a 20% slow. Your ADC's especially will thank you.\r\n**3) Mortal Reminder.** Honestly this is on here to discourage Morellonomicon. Morellos on an AP is great, given they usually have AOE abilities, however if there is only one person you are concerned with, Mortal Reminder gives a longer lasting Grevious Wounds, and I find Bloodletter's Veil to be very valuable to increasing the sustainability of squishy APC's.\r\n**4) Ghostwalkers.** I don't see people using this as a disengage as much as I do. If you're a tank, when you engage you obviously will pull a lot of aggro. Being able to escape, and reposition can be the deciding factor between winning and losing.\r\n**5) Zeke's Convergence.** This isn't the greatest item. However, if nobody can take Rylai's, you need the CC, and your ultimate is relatively short, this can be tremendous. Linking to your ADC can also help them peel their aggressors while you focus on defending other players.\r\n\r\nHonestly there's plenty of little things that I think could make ARAM more competitive if the community was more vocal about strategy. There is very few guides, steamers, or information about ARAM, though the community is large. I think this is largely due to there not being any ranked play, but I think having a discussion is a good start. If you disagree, or feel you could give some suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I am always trying to grow as an ARAM player.

They share a passive in haste, so only one of them is 20% CDR and the other only 10% if you choose to build both. Tear is a solid starter pick if you choose to build it into Seraph's, since you can start to gather the extra mana needed right away. For Luden's builders, I'd go with Lost Chapter as a starter. Tear, boots and refillable potion has been a common starter combo for me when I go for Seraph's. I'd say that never build tear is wrong, but so is always build tear. For some champs, it might be better to start Luden's and see how your mana handles that. Clarity will also help in such occasions.\n\n2) I sometimes prance around the relic when other champs in the team are low to see if any of them seems interested in coming to share the health benefits rather than immediate grabbing of relics without giving my team a chance to share. Some people don't seem to understand that it is team heal and don't come into towards the relic when I wait for them, though. I've seen even one hit kills do this kind of stuff, then die soon afterwards due to low health. Relic is team heal, share with your team.\n\n#2 \n1) Regarding tanks, my opinion is that tank's job isn't to always be in the front where he gets poked the crap out of and the ADC doesn't have the range to respond. Rather, your ranged guys chip away enemy team's health and tank stays ready to peel for them and tank the damage when necessary. When tank dies, the squishies lose the lane pressure if they haven't managed to damage the enemy team enough so that they don't want to steamroll forward. If you have long-ranged AP carries like Ziggs and Lux bombarding the enemy team, then all you have to do as a tank is keep them safe and let them do their job. Time for engage is when they are low from all that bombardment, not when there's a thick group of four full health champs that will destroy you quickly.\n\nAs for a tip of my own, here's one: Don't feed on low gold. Try to have enough gold to buy items on every death. You can play more brazen when you are loaded with gold and able to buy items to increase your performance, but see to it that your feeding doesn't cause the friendly team to collapse.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikeri","date":"2018-06-16T23:50:33.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are right about the CDR, mage cooldown is much harder. Your looking at hextechs, hourglass, veil, lichbane, ionian boots, or nashor's tooth, none of which are rushworthy under normal circumstances. \n\nLet me give some terrible math (feel free to correct because it's likely wrong). With Archangel's you get 50ap, 20% cd reduction. and 650 mana + a variable ap gain passive. Takes about 5 minutes to build. Lets compare that to Liandry's which is around the same price. Looking at Kassadin who has a larger mana pool and you're at level 6 you have 660 mana, which is only 7 additional AP (+6 from Archangels). So Archangel's would give around 63 ap, with a 20% cd. Liandry's however would give 80 AP. Let's look at Lux at level 6 with 3 points in her E. With Seraph's she would scale 60% of 62 AP (50ap+12 bonus ap from mana) so 37 + base damage of 150 = 187. If you took Liandry's at 80 ability power you'd have 198. However with Seraph's 20% CDR we'll say potential damage output of 120% would put Seraph's at 224. So 26 additional damage. Her CD on her E would be 7.2 seconds, so we'll assume Liandry's passive would be maxed. To compensate (assuming champion wasn't slowed) Liandry's would have to proc on someone with at least 867 health. Nami has some of the lowest health and worst scaling, and would be at 781 health which would be 23 damage. You're looking at a loss of 3 damage. Now for 20% CDR to be 20% higher damage output you have to be perfectly efficient and not waste the 1.8 seconds cooldown you gained.\n\nFor argument's sake lets say the damage is equal at level 6. But lets look at level 3. A Lux with Lost Chapter would have 40 ability power while a Lux with an Amplifying Tome and a Blasting Wand would have 60. At a 60% scale you're looking at a damage difference of 12 per ability. Assuming after the first minute you used one ability every 8 seconds for 4 minutes (so 5 minutes total up to approximate building time of a finished item) your looking at a difference of 360 damage if you hit one champion with each ability. This damage output increases by each AP champ on your team building this way, and is also taking into account only hitting one champion with a low AP scale. But with a 10% cooldown from Lost Chapter lets imagine you used one ability every 7.2 seconds. You could perform 3 more attacks, and that's if your being 100% efficient. With Veigar's long 18 second CD, how many more times do you think you'd cast Event Horizon if it was 1.8 seconds shorter? I'd argue over 5 minutes it would probably be the same. But maybe you will run out of mana? I don't, not with prescience of mind, clarity, and health relics. Also when you do go back you have options on what to build next. Do I go Liandry's, Banshee's, Morellos, Rylai's, Void Staff, Lich Bane, or Luden's Echo? You have much more flexibility on your build path. You could even go ROA if you have an additional 435 gold to make up for the tome. But with Lost chapter you are stuck with Archangel's, Luden's or Hextech. \n\nNow to be fair, while both Liandry's and Archangel's scale, Archangel's will hit a huge power spike when it transforms. I don't know how long it takes for you, but in the mean time you've been giving up all that pressure you could have gained elsewhere, which includes health relics and kills. I personally don't feel it's worth it.\n\n2) I 100% agree. I meant to say that it depends on your team comp. If your team is on the other side of Ziggs, Lux, Xerath, etc it's better for you to go in and try to start something, rather than stay behind and get poked. But yes thank you for clarification. \n\nAbsolutely that tip is very helpful, thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Mreeshai","date":"2018-06-17T22:45:02.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having tested Seraph's in the training mode, A level 18 Lux gets +68 AP from Seraph's passive, the item totaling +1400 Mana, +20% CDR and 118 AP, assuming that you don't build other mana items. If you build Rod of Ages on top of that, the bonus AP becomes +80 AP. If you go fully mana/AP build by adding Luden's+Lichbane, then you'll have 108 bonus AP from Seraph's passive. Rabadon's on top of that and it's a 882 AP five item build, with last slot saved for boots.\n\nAs for the time it takes to build Archangel's, the more mana intensive champs are gonna finish it faster. For ones that it takes a long time to build, you could build Luden's instead and have better early pressure, taking Lost Chapter as a starter item. The point of starting tear is to finish Seraph's faster, I think. I would go for Seraph's start with Janna or Ryze and Luden's start with Heimerdinger, typically. Rabadon's is a common second AP item for me.\n\nAs for Archangel's completion to Seraphs, looking at my own games, Janna with Tear start did it around 12:30, Nasus with Lost Chapter start did it just few seconds before game ended, at 17:55 (I needed the mana and went Archangel's over Ludens for that reason. Nasus E spam is kinda expensive and I didn't have clarity in that game) and Syndra with Tear start finished at 9:00 with Seraph's ready. In my recent Annie game, Ryze completed Seraph's at 9 mins, Syndra at 10 mins and my Annie at 12:42.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mr Dalloway","date":"2018-06-16T03:58:09.246+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only take mark (snowball) and flash on pretty much every champ. There is nothing more satisfying than killing a low health enemy who is hiding way behind their tower with a snowball while playing Soraka. Snowballs are also awesome for avoiding faceplanting into the entire enemy team when going into brush. If you do not have snowball or some ability you can cast ahead of you to detect enemies please avoid walking into the brush when there are unseen enemies.\n\nIf a teammate wants to take Clarity I won't complain but Lost Chapter is sufficient for mana regen in most cases. If you are constantly going OOM and you are sitting on a large surplus of gold  it is probably time to die anyway. If your team is doing really well and you have zero deaths sometimes it is tempting to just try to keep it going and have a zero death game but your damage will suffer as a result.  There are a few champs that I do take tear on if I feel like the shield from Archangel's Staff will be helpful but usually in ARAM the splash damage from Luden's is too good to pass up. \n\nAnother point about Mortal reminder is it gives you grievous wounds much faster than Morellonomican does because Executioner's Calling is only 800 gold. If you need the heal debuff because they have a Mundo or Soraka/Nami an AD champ would usually be better off going for at least Executioner's than waiting for a mage to build a 3000 gold item.  Not enough AD champs will do it which is a shame.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikeri","date":"2018-06-16T23:59:29.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, it is satisfying to kill with snowball.

That last one tends to happen when the enemy team out ranges us and all the melee carries on my team are so afraid to go in because they're getting poked.
