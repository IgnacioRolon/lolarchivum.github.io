My solution was to have two serpentine rivers.  (Which is something that happens in real life too - in the USA there are two rivers with the same name in the same _state_!  Never mind on the same planet.)\n\n-- Shurima is a decent size too.  Good.\n\n-- I'd look to the Freljord event map for a rough outline of that region.  Pretty sure that's at least somewhat canon.\n\n-- Bilgewater and Shadow Isles looking pretty good, relationshipwise too.\n\nProbably cannot comment on anything else right now, but I didn't want to see you (and the other map/geography experts here) with nothing.\nI swear _something_ is in the works, but you know Riot.
