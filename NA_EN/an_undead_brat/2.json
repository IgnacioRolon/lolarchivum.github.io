This map is amazing! But I notise two things I would ad/change with your map. \n\n1. In the new universe site they say that Piltover is built ontop of Zaun. They where the same city befor but now they have become two seporate citys. Zaun is the underworld of Piltover. They are still different citys but they are on the same place on the map because they are stacked ontop of each other.\n\n2. I can't find Icathia on the map. Icathia is located on the same continent as Shurima but we don't exactly know where. I think Icathia is located in the north part of the Shurima desert. Kinda like Urtistan is in the South-west I think Icathia is in the north-east.\n\nThis map is great and really do help everyone to get a better idea of where everything is located.
