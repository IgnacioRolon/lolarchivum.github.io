Also, i had to restart my Macbook because i couldn't even open League without restarting my computer.","replies":[{"poster":"greenlightgo22","date":"2017-11-10T02:01:20.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol Good luck with this. You are certainly not the only one facing this issue. Boro or some other RIOT employee will post the same cookie cutter response stating that you are at fault on your end, thus removing any problem on their end. They will link you with a how to guide on improving your connection. Ultimately, that virtual middle finger is strong with this company.   Honestly, if you read through the help/support, you will see what I am saying is true. Just remember. There are always other games and other companies. If you don't like your current car, trade it in. If you don't like your current job, seek a new one. If you don't like your current apartment, move. You have options. Exercise them. When players start dropping and the money stops flowing, they will be forced to make a correction to their arrogant ways or continue to remain hell bent on lackluster service.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-10T02:04:56.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If the game continued on without you then the servers must not have dropped, and I'm not currently seeing any widespread server issues right now. This sounds like your network had some sort of hiccup with it's connection to our servers. I'd say first update your port forward and dns settings as those are able to get your connection routed in a smoother way. If you aren't sure how to set those up then check out our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[{"poster":"Toketotem","date":"2017-11-11T11:42:29.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to type \" I Agree\" to play again after my power went out for a few minutes when I was in a beginner bot game just now?\n\nNow I'm paranoid to start another game.\n\nLike if it goes out again tonight will i get a ban?
