Please help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nMy League of Legends name is UncleDiggy. I used to play very regularly (pretty much every day) but recently took about a year off (stopped playing in February of 2017). Upon trying to sign back in I'm prompted with a message that says I have been permanently banned and somehow my user name has been changed to Líl Yáchty? I'm not sure if this means I've been hacked or what this really means. All I know is I log in with my user name \"UncleDiggy\" and it says I've received a lifetime ban and the name/chat logs l'm given all have this Líl Yáchty name? I've never even heard of that user name let alone have any clue what it means.. Anyone that could potentially shed some light on the situation would be of great help. Thanks for taking the time out.  I have posted this in the Player Behavior boards as I'm completely new to this and was informed this would be a better place for this type of discussion.  I have filled out two support tickets as well and haven't received a response but here's  a little additional information that other forum members have provided me and that I have gathered that may shed some light on my current situation.  \r\n\r\n1.  I sign onto LoL using my username UncleDiggy and it's suddenly changed to Líl Yáchty which I've never seen before and certainly have not created myself.\r\n2.  When I sign into these forums using username UncleDiggy the same thing happens, my name is changed to Líl Yáchty.  When I view my account it has an email address ******54940@163.com.  (I have 0 clue where the hell that came from but upon further searching and some help from other members of the forums it seems to be a popular Chinese WebPortal).  \r\n3.  https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/215046703  When viewing my match history you can see I clearly stopped playing on 02/05/2017 as that was the last time my name appeared as UncleDiggy in the match histories.  Then on 06/13/2017 all the sudden the name changed to Líl Yáchty and this person has played every single game on my account since that date!  (Wouldn't there be a way for support to be able to view the log in locations of the IP addresses and notice the discrepancy?  I'm from New Jersey and apparently this person is playing in China..  slight difference :D.  )\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks for taking the time to read my message as I'm a little nervous this person was able to change my email (which means they must know my password for my original email to be able to change it right?) so I should probably begin changing passwords around and making them stronger.  All my personal information is attached to this account and I've purchased some things in game on this account, so someone else having access to it is pretty frightening.  Any additional information on steps you think I should take would be greatly appreciated.    \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nUncleDiggy","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T01:12:53.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like someone might have been able to hack your account, change your Summoner Name, and then continue playing until they got the account banned. This account is currently banned for toxicity, but I'd suggest reaching out to our accounts team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if anything can be done at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Líl Yáchty","date":"2017-11-28T14:02:09.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!  I submitted a ticket so hopefully get a response soon..  Hopefully they can just see where this other person is logging in from on 06/13 -> as I haven’t moved since I was playing back in February so it’s pretty clear someone else has access to my account.","replies":[]}]}]}
