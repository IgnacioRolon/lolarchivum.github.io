For example, something may have become corrupted within the config settings.  As another step, let me know if resetting your config fixes this:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Ricochet035","date":"2017-06-15T17:02:25.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=KuoMVOAZ,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-15T15:42:32.843+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for getting back to me, and I see the thread is gaining some momentum with more reports.

But sad thing is, you need to keep on doing it every start of the game so everything will be back to normal.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-15T17:06:22.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info!
