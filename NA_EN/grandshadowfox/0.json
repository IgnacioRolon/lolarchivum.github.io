It sounds almost like that entire game glitched out and dropped everyone out of the match. If it keeps happening specifically with Kha'zix, please let us know again so that we can start looking into it!\n\nSince you saw a bugsplat, it would also make sense that some game files freaked out during the match which caused you to get kicked out. Make sure to go through the steps in our [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) to cover the most common bugsplat causes.","replies":[]}]}
