One was fine, with my fps typically around 30-40 which is normal. The second was a disaster. Even after dialing down all of my stuff my game could barely chug along at 15 and dropped to 2 in teamfights. I noticed my computer was louder than normal, but only when I had league up. If I was looking for an answer online it cooled off. I have never had an issue like this with my desktop. I'm going to be doing all of the suggested fixes. I just wanted to know if there was a known problem and if my end fails, I'll come back with an update.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-01T19:02:41.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on Windows 10?  You could just have some outdated drivers or even game files that causing your frames to drop.   I wouldn't worry about it too much just now, and instead go over the steps in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to tune things up.
