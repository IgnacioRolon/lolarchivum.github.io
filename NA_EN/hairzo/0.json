I&#039;ve come up with many champion ideas which i unfortunately don&#039;t want to share with the world, as i would like to keep them for if i join Riot. I am 15 (at least 3 years to go), and the only prior technical knowledge i have is a little bit of Python.\n\nit is my dying passion to be able to work for Riot Games, and would do anything for a chance to become part of their ever growing family\n\nthank you for your time\n-Hair","replies":[{"poster":"Grand Medic","date":"2015-07-21T18:30:55.768+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Must push three human sacrifices into a volcano and call out the name of the demon god himself, \"CertainlyT\".

I definitely agree that you should check out Extra Credits.  You can and should spend days going through their backlog of Game Design videos.\n\nThe \"Game Maker's Toolkit\" videos are also very well made and offer a lot of insight about particular facets of the industry.","replies":[{"poster":"Hairzo","date":"2015-07-21T22:32:45.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've always been interested in game design, so i would happily delve into their videos","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deotay","date":"2015-07-21T21:01:54.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll want to look into a career around \"Game Design\". Before anything though, I'll have to warn you that it's not an easy life. Game Design is full of ups and downs and grueling work hours for not a whole lot of pay. It's not for everybody. However, if you think it's worth it and still wish to take the plunge there are a couple ways into the industry.\n\nRiot is pretty well known by now, which means they won't just be taking anybody. Before you work for Riot or anybody like Riot, you'll need to build up an impressive resum√©. Remember, no one is going to take an \"idea guy\" so you have to provide more than that. You'll have to build up skills that show you can be an asset to a development team, like coding or art. I suggest you figure out which you're most comfortable with and start working on it. If possible, you could be strong at both which would make you much more valuable. Alternatively you can try downloading a basic game making program (e.g. GameMaker) and try to make a few small games yourself and prove how strong your design skills are.\n\nEither way, the more you can \"prove\" your worth as a developer the more likely people will take you. The sooner you start creating a portfolio of your work, the better. 15 years old is still pretty young. If you start working hard now, you'll be pretty ahead of the curve.\n\nUnfortunately, it could still be many years before you're ready to help design or develop games. It'll take even longer to get into a specific company you want and then it'll be even longer before they let you touch one of their main attractions (e.g. Champions).\n\ntl;dr What you're asking requires years of unwavering dedication. Start working hard now if you really want it. Be conscious that things may not go the way you want even if you pour in years of work.","replies":[{"poster":"Hairzo","date":"2015-07-21T21:21:07.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it's my dream, so i'll do what it takes. just being able to work in the game industry is great in itself, and i will definitely check out game maker, and make a couple of games.\n\nps. what games do you recommend i make, i whatched multiple Riot Games panels, who said my portfolio need to be made to suit the need of the company, so should i make a top down game  that has the character move with right click, or just anything to show i have creativity and initiative.\n\nAlso, thankyou sooooooo much dude. have a great day","replies":[{"poster":"Deotay","date":"2015-07-21T21:42:25.153+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first few attempts at making a game will very likely not be a part of your future portfolio. So go ahead and make whatever sounds fun to you. Just make sure to keep the game very, VERY simple because development time takes much more time than you may think.\n\nMy recommendation for starting projects are simple maze games, basic adventure games and top-down shooters. Depending on how you approach these game types, you can show off your prowess for level design or character design.\n\nRemember, it's more impressive and engaging for the player to make simple ideas interesting. Complex ideas run the risk of being cumbersome and unnecessary. Try to think of the most basic ideas and make them as interesting as you can.\n\nIf you're interested in the theory and concepts of Game Design I recommend the Youtube channel [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z06QR-tz1_o). They're quite insightful and offer a good introduction to many concepts.","replies":[{"poster":"Hairzo","date":"2015-07-21T22:34:10.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for all the help that you are giving me dude, it is all greatly appreciated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CatWithNineLives","date":"2018-10-02T13:04:18.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Deotay, u sound like u are professional on this kind of job.
