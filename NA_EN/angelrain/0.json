First they started showing up almost every game in ARAM, often with all of them on one team. The people who got stuck with the 3 feeding bots just had a terrible game that they had no chance of coming back from, and could do nothing but let the winning team end it quickly. They couldn't even surrender. The people on the winning side had no fun in doing so, because they'd have been in exactly the same circumstance as the enemy team before, and statistically they probably would be again in their next game. It made me give up on playing ARAM altogether and just stick with Co-Op vs. AI.\r\n\r\nNow the bots are in Co-Op too. Every single game I've played in the last few weeks has had a minimum of 2 bots, and the last few have had 3-4. They always go mid and feed the enemy laner (usually an AP carry who can 1-shot you when he gets enough kills), to around 10/0 by 6 minutes in. If there are enough real people on the team working together, the fed bot can usually be shut down or the game can be won by split-pushing, but when there are 4 bots on a team against Intermediate AI, the game is an automatic loss – one that you can't even surrender from, or quit without getting leave penalties.\r\n\r\nSometimes you can spot a bot in queue by their name and summoner spells (heal and barrier) and just dodge the game. Usually though, you have no way of being sure until you get to the loading screen and see that they all have the same icon and no keystone mastery. By that point all you can do is exit the client and wait it out, but you're already screwed because you'll just get leave penalties for doing it, and the next Co-Op game you queue for will 100% certainly have bots in it too. If you're like me and decide to go into the game and hope there's at least one other human on your team, then in game the bots will buy boots first and not move until the minions spawn, then start running down mid lane and suiciding to the AI. If you're alone with 4 bots and decide to go AFK, then you get leave penalties. It's a broken system that punishes the ones already being hurt by the botting, and it's a seriously crappy feeling to be left with zero choice other than to simply not play Co-Op anymore.\r\n\r\nEvery game I report the bots, but the next game I load into has 4 new ones, and again the game after that. There isn't even an easy way to get hard physical proof of the botting to send in online, because the replay feature isn't implemented for that game mode. All I can do is report, and post on the forum, but it feels like nothing comes of it. I suffer through it in hopes that it will get better, but I feel like nothing's being done about it, like Riot just don't care enough to fix the problem. I've been playing this game since 2011, I've kept coming back time and again for new champions and map updates, and I've spent a lot of money on skins and icons... but this is honestly making me not want to play League of Legends at all anymore.\r\n\r\nCome on, Riot. Please... end this nonsense.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-05-29T17:23:29.775+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"From what I understand, Riot bans in waves when it comes to things like Scripting and Bots.

Also you ban the bots immediately then they'll just constantly keep making more. Best thing to do is keep track of them secretly and then ban them in a bit to hurt their customers. In time the customers will just give up and feel it's a bad product to buy and stop doing it. In turn the botters would just move on to a better market since they are losing time on this one.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Owyn","date":"2017-05-31T12:35:09.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Also if you ban the bots **_just after months after all botting is completed_** then they'll just constantly keep making more. **Damn, they wouldn't even notice those bans.**\n\nfixed it for ya.\n\nIf bots were banned before they finished leveling noone would be able to sell those and people would just stop botting for no reason.\n\nAnd ofc players wouldn't be punished for actually trying to play the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Itsbeghdev","date":"2017-05-29T17:31:03.047+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like, at one point, it was impossible to play TT without bots, then it just stopped all at once.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gosh Darn","date":"2017-05-29T20:03:12.271+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the image I used in my thread when I brought this up. http://imgur.com/NB6x8Bu.jpg\n\n4/5 players were feeding bots.
