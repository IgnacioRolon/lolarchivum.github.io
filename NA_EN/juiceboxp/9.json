Cinderhulk is a must, and if the enemy is not full AP, dead man's plate is necessary too. The rest is rightful gold investment in MR, which is proven completely useless because again, damage > defense. \n\nTo you that argue that an artillery mage rotation should remove 60% of hp of a tank, remember that that tank must also soak damage from DPS sources (which should counter tanks), from the frontline and maybe from the jungle. I.e. a tank must survive from multiple damage sources of both types. Arguing that a single source (that I add, should be sub-optimal on tanks) should almost do the job by itself, instantly on a burst, seems almost madness.\n\nPS: Maokai and Ornn are laughable, if you have doubts play them top against riven/Darius/Renekton etc. The others range from mediocre to good, but they're played for their damage, and not their tankiness.

Rito on the first league page has all the different classifications of champs e.g. fighter, mage, carries. In this they also have Tank. This is where they have Malphite listed. As a tank. Not as a mage. Not as an assassin. A tank. He is meant to be a tank. Normally Tanks cannot move too fast or deal too much damage. Let alone one shot someone. I am constantly finding AP malphites though. Not tank. Not a single item will be bought on him that is considered his normal build. Rito went through so much to try and make him a tank again. With the changes to his passive making him larger with more armor and his stats were supposedly scaling better with armor too. Still.... no tank malphite. \nWanna know why? why would I go tank Malphite when you can chunk/slow people with a Q that not only is back up within a couple seconds, but grants A SIGNIFICANT amount of movement speed to run away till it is back up. I was singed with boots of swiftness and I could not catch up with him while ulting or using my W. That is ridiculous and makes no sense. Then pair this up with his full combo? He can blow up basically anyone on my team and nearly would one shot me with full MR. Am I saying he is broken?? no, obviously you just need to work around dodging his ult and he becomes useless. My point thought is why does he have such significant AP stats if he is supposed to be a tank????? So I 100% agree with you. I would say Rito's balance team is too focused on TFT, but their balance team has continued to be more useless than the degree I got in 2017. \nMy point being that even on this single champ meant to be a tank, it is far better to go damage than tank build.
