I picked her up as my 2nd main, and I've played a lot of games this past month or 2, and I've only seen her picked 2 times this past month (outside of the games I played her ofc) and only seen her banned 1 time in 2 months. Even if you want actual numbers, her Mid lane pick rate is 1%, and her support is 0.63% (Shes not even listed for Top lane).\n\nShes a good champion, but no one really gives her a chance it seems lol.\n\nBut to be on topic: Yea I really don't get why Riot added that part to Kayle's ultimate. Her ultimate was already strong enough with just the 2-3 seconds of Invulnerability, and they added a strong AoE nuke to it, just seems not really needed.","replies":[{"poster":"JuiceBoxP","date":"2019-03-05T20:32:39.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't really just \"added\"...

I missed that and didn't notice, then it kind of makes sense for that to be there. As for the Neeko, she does need some work and I will agree with what you said about her W, it is hard to really \"fool\" anyone with it and is just used for either for the Stealth/Movement speed or for the passive for On-hit Neeko, not really for trying to fool enemies unless they panic. \n\nNow I can her W working very well if you used it from un-warded areas, say for example you have a {{champion:72}} as your jungler and you go bot lane disguised as him and sit in bot lane bushes. Then just press W from there, and the enemy team just see's a random fast Skarner come out of the bush running into them, could be a fun little way to force {{summoner:4}}. I'm saying that situation because I duo with a friend of mine who is a Skarner 1-trick lol.\n\nBut yea, her Disguise into W isn't really going to trick anyone, unless maybe you disguise into some one on your team who has a speed up. But the enemy team see'ing a {{champion:81}} running into the enemy team with a movement speed buff isn't going to do anything.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-03-05T14:33:41.477+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"At least Neeko isn't a rework.","replies":[]}]}
