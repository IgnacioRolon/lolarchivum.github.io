He is beyond broken.\nIt literally became a mode of who has garen instawins because he just doesn't stop spinning all game. He has many ways to get ontop of you and once he's ontop you will just die. His spin naturally gives him movement speed so anyone without lots of dashes can't really escape him\n\nYou really don't need any abilities other than judgement and his ultimate. You won't use them anyway so don't bother even leveling them.","replies":[{"poster":"Dasdi96","date":"2019-02-16T06:22:15.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there is really a champ that needs to be disabled in urf its jax.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-02-16T06:01:45.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen can lose.\n\nThe real problem is how obnoxiously noninteractive he is, either while cheesing your team or being kited to death.","replies":[]}]}
