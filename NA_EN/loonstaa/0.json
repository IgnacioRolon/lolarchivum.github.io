Can you give me some more detail about what your seeing, when, as well as any error messages you might be seeing?  With some more details, we can work towards figuring this out.\n\nWhile I am not the OP, I have experienced a similar issue.\n\nDuring random moments ingame, the game will freeze, with the colour being grey or, on one occasion, beige-like. The game will then either A). Crash, requiring me to rejoin the match, or B). Recover and let me play again. During the times the game did crash, I would send a Bugsplat report when prompted to.\nPrior to today, as a matter of fact, I thought the issue only happened during mid- to late-game. Today, it happened twice, during early-game and mid-game, the latter of which being one of result B, as previously mentioned.\nIt should be noted that I am using Nvidia GTX970, which is a bit of a black sheep in the Nvidia line.\n\nPrior to today, I also thought that by force-quitting Nvidia Share, which had crashed on a few occasions after these strange errors, I could escape them. This was not the case. I also thought by quitting Nvidia GeForce Experience so that it was invisible in the hidden icons menu, I could avoid it as well, but this proved to be false.","replies":[]}]}]}
