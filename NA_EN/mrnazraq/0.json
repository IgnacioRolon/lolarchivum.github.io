Also, I had one good game against a Thresh, and decided to see if Taric actually counters Thresh. Whenever I saw the enemy team take Thresh, with me in support and still have my turn to pick, I picked Taric to counter him. I&#039;ve won every game so far with me as Taric against Thresh matchup (probably 4 matches so far).\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s why it works:\r\n- if Thresh hooks you, after you&#039;re stunned/knocked up (from Flay), you shield yourself and use your stun (Dazzle). Thresh will take considerable damage, especially if your ADC follows up with some poke, and Taric is usually tanky enough to win that damage trade;\r\n- if Thresh hooks your ADC, use your stun right away if he goes in. Thresh will not have time to use his Flay because he will be stunned, have taken AP damage, and then will be low health;\r\n- from what I&#039;ve observed, Taric is more tanky than Thresh, especially if Thresh gets behind in collecting souls;\r\n- when the enemy jungler comes to gank and you&#039;re squeezed in a tight spot, use your ult and then GTFO;\r\n- OR use your ult to tower dive when your jungler comes to gank.\r\n\r\nOther observations on the Taric/Thresh matchup?","replies":[{"poster":"Skias","date":"2016-06-25T21:55:45.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric has his drawbacks. He eats poke easily and Thresh also has the insta-escape. If the carry is near the lantern, there is basically nothing you can do to stop it. Also, Lantern ganks.\n\nEdit: I should add that Taric is a tank. Thresh isn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Macanimus","date":"2016-06-25T18:00:31.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Thresh Main I think it is a skill based match-up. If thresh can land a hook on a carry and they focus that carry before 6 then thresh can win the match-up. After 6 by far I think the scale tilts towards taric. Thresh has to be pretty close to pull off his cc and taric's ult cancels it. If thresh lands a great hook they have to kill the carry within the 1-2 seconds. Taric ult is also much shorter than the box by at least 30 seconds. \n\nSo as a recap: Early it is more of if thresh can land a hook or taric a good stun\nMid: Taric wins due to his ult\nlate: Pretty even because at this point the amount of time before invulnerability won't really matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-06-25T20:03:05.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Breakdown makes sense to me, but I always figure Taric as being a much more proficient team fighter than Thresh.  If your team can capitalize on picks, Thresh is king.  But if you're actually getting into a full 5v5, I take Taric over just about anyone.  It's surviving up to that point that is a bit more difficult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-06-25T19:08:24.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I consistently beat Thresh as Taric as well.
