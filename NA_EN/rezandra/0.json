But we can definitely look into it!

Then the max volume was set as the new default. It's always a possibility that when providing new features, blips can occur.

I swear if I heard anyone in real life laugh like Vi does I would chuck a rock at them (or a more socially acceptable equivalent). With the number of times I see enemies emote spam, I would likely have this bar permanently at it's lowest setting.\n\nI have just as much to gain in my experience playing the game hearing Vi's laugh from a room of first-graders' recorder recital, as I do from hearing the enemy Gnar saying \"Demaglio!\" or any interactions between an enemy champ and mine. I understand that this view would not only keep in the sound effects that some repeat in emote spamming, but this view also fundamentally seems negative. What I boil it down to is the fact that it's easier for the voices my opponents have to distract and annoy me (after having played the game for as long as I have), than it is for them to enrich my experience. The sound from abilities, the music in the game, the sounds from buying items, these all do give me not only a sense of satisfaction but also add clarity and convey things that I wouldn't be able to perceive if I played the game on mute.\n\nWould I be willing to reduce or remove all of the good from this specific situation if doing so meant that all the bad would go with it? I'd answer yes six days of the week.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ark Angel HFB","date":"2014-10-10T22:04:19.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey all,\n> \n> Just throwing an idea out there -\n> \n> **Would an enemy VO slider be something to look into? **\n> \n> If I am understanding the issue correctly, its that you would rather not hear other players VO as often.

Then make version of those that deal with other people's champs.\n\nAnd while we are at it... can we get a mute option that mutes everything by a player.\n\nLike sometimes people just talk crap... but sometimes they start emote spamming and pinging. I should not have to mute all of my teams pings just to deal with one problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arc Noir","date":"2014-10-10T21:24:17.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > The new Sion sounds great, but much like many other champions (Twitch and Aatrox just to name a couple), I'm growing annoyed by how much he talks. \n> > \n> > If we could get a slider to either increase or decrease the intervals of champ speak, I would greatly appreciate that.

And that's because it gets so incredibly annoying to constantly hear my own champion talk at me. I haven't heard any voice acting  for that long because it's just not worth it to me.\n\nRight now it definitely feels like a all-or-nothing situation. Either I get to hear all the voices in the game but just have a barrage of responses assaulting my ears whenever I click like a maniac or I go with nothing at all and preserve my sanity.\n\nI would ***LOVE*** some sort of slider to set how often the champion I'm control responds to commands. I think if I could set it at like 10-25% of what it is now it would make a world of difference while playing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2014-10-10T18:15:06.878+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak to the feasibility of this, but it's a cool idea that we'll add to the list of things to investigate.
