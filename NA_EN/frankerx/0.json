Jhin is perhaps the only adc (maybe shared with corki) who cannot use that item to effectiveness whatsoever.\n\nJhin's inability to deal with them, his effectiveness against squishy targets, and his severe weakness to assassination champions really classifies him more as a long range burst mid laner type champion like syndra, xerath, vel'koz or anivia.\n\nBut if they're going to design him as an ADC, they should really give him something to smooth out this weakness and make him  a bit more effective/viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonshade","date":"2016-03-02T04:26:58.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 4th shot can do severe damage to health stacking targets, his main issue is that he doesn't synergize with BoRK enough to cut through them like most ADC champions. Sure those champions will never reach him but at the same time he cannot deal with them without team support. \n\nJhin is unique in that aspect, theres nothing wrong with it, aside from sometimes finding your team without tank shred in late game. Each ADC in the game now has unique aspects to them: Jhin has his high damage to squishy targets, his snare, traps and executes, Quinn is all about her burst and mobility, Vayne is the Queen of Tank Shred, Corki is that annoying adc that is SO hard to build against, Caitlyn is the area control queen, Tristana is all about her pushing power and her late game carry potential (plus her early game bullying), Lucian is about a strong early-mid game with his high damage spell rotation + passive procs, Kog'maw is a mini-gun, MF is all about teamfighting with her ult and procing her passive on multiple targets to wrack up that love tap damage, Ashe is a strong utility adc with her slows and scouting abilities, Kalista is the ADC that melee tanks/bruisers cry over, etc... Hopefully your team will realize that Jhin is weak vs tanks and take a tank killer champion, something like Shyvanna, Irelia, Malz, Vayne top, Corki mid, Jax,  Yi, Yasuo, or Kindred to help remedy the situation.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"masterdragon481","date":"2016-03-01T20:54:30.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might be true of mundo specifically, but an Olaf or a garen or a maokai running you down can be a real problem.
