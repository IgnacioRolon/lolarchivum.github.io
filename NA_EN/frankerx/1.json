What I see is VERY MUCH within the boundaries of what Riot has considered spam (correctly in my opinion). If you want to avoid further punishments, I encourage you to drop the creative definition of spam. \n\nThis is easily a reportable chat log, and easily a punishable chat log. If you meet a moron in game, just mute him and report him after the game.

All it does is encourage a troll to troll harder or discourage/makes it harder for an already poor performing player from improving/to imrpove their performance. From [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&page=1#post43465363): \n\n>**If reports are the preferred response to toxicity, why cant I ask for reports?**\n\n>First off, Riot has set up the case-building algorithm in such a way that multiple reports for a single game dont really accelerate the process. The system uses report density  the percentage of games in which you were reported in preference to raw reports. While a greater number of reports increases the likelihood that a specific match will appear as one of the five cases shown to jurors, this isnt a reason to ask for reports.\n\n>The reason we tell you not to go report begging is that its quite possibly the most toxic behavior you can exhibit. Just using the word causes people to become angry and defensive.\n\n>**I ask for reports because they were ruining my fun and I want to make sure they are punished.**\n\n>Yeah, I know. People suck. A lot. And its natural to be angry with them. What you cant do, however, is harass them and report begging is generally considered to be harassment. Riot has said that reported is the most toxic word in League.\n\n>http://youtu.be/a-5yKdpR0kU?t=34m10s\n\n>(Assistance from Butterfly44)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Puddytat","date":"2016-06-06T16:41:37.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would hate having to play with someone who constantly comments on every little thing I do, especially someone who, after a teammate apparently died after making a bad call, went on and on about it and seemed to imply that I did it on purpose. You have a bragging and self-righteous attitude, both in this chatlog and in your reply to an earlier post here. \n\nSometimes (can't really judge that here, since we lack the rest of the chat), I also report people for keeping the flame going. Some of the things you said could have thrown oil on the fire, as the saying goes. Even if it isn't flaming in itself, it doesn't contribute to an enjoyable game. Don't goad players who are already tilted.\n\nAnd, as someone else pointed out, telling people that their unhappiness made it more fun for you is a horrible thing to do.
