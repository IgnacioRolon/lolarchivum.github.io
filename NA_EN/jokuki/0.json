This kind of interaction happens whether she picks it up or uses E to place the ball on herself. The ball becomes visible once more after she moves it onto another champion or uses her Q to move the ball. I&#039;m not sure how this bug occurs but I notice that this only happens after Orianna dies. I&#039;ve heard about this bug occur for one of my friends as well and we both use Winter Wonder Orianna so it could very well be a skin problem. I should note that the shield animation, the grey bubble, still appears around Orianna if she uses E, it&#039;s just the ball that disappears.\r\n\r\nSo far, the only steps I know is:\r\n1. Orianna dies\r\n2. Orianna tries to pick up her ball\r\n3. Ball disappears","replies":[{"poster":"CD Slurp","date":"2016-01-22T11:43:29.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This also happens on TPA Orianna.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who Plays This","date":"2015-11-20T06:34:14.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just finished playing a game, this also occurred, using bladecraft orianna. When you have an ally shielded and they die your ball disappears and also when you recall using e/ picking up the ball through movement. The range indicator bug only occurred once throughout the game, but the invisible ball happened multiple times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirfrankdoom","date":"2015-11-03T02:52:55.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just had one where the indicator for distance ball was up all the time to a fake ball when i had the ball on me just like when it is invisible. i have had a game where it was invisible and had 3 range indicators  every time it happened to me it was when i died and the ball was travailing to me with my alt+E or when i just went out of range. but have replicated it several times in aram but my screen shots haven't been able to take and my recording is crummy at best not a lot to go on from it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2015-11-02T20:41:19.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happened for me as well, though I didn't notice it immediately so I've no idea how to reproduce it.
