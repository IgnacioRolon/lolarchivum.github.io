No wait, Dominion. Yea Dominion sounds cool.\r\n\r\nIt could use the existing Ascention map. This would save a lot of time and effort in creating a new game mode.\r\n\r\nEssentially this new Dominion game mode would be a sort of King-of-the-hill type battle arena where 2 teams of 5 fight to control 5 capture nodes around the map.\r\nHolding capture points would deal damage to the enemies big nexus crystal and when it reaches 0 you have beat them.\r\n\r\nSo do you think? Could this be a viable new game mode to add to the rotation? I mean more than half of the assets are already there...","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-04-26T22:27:35.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have already said it's possible for them to add dominion into the rotating queue, same as any other mode they've released.\n\nSorry your attempt for upvotes didn't work","replies":[{"poster":"TheHobbits","date":"2016-04-27T01:45:27.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't trying to get upvotes.

Hope they do not though.  It would be like a dead weekend.

Instead of 5 \"nodes\", you have the 3 crystals that you can grab for a set amount of points.  But wait!  There is more to ascension!  You also have {{champion:101}} buff.  There was not any buff like that in Dominion.  On top of that, your kills count as points for \"Nexus damage\".\n\nYou are asking for a lame version of Ascension, where your kills mean next to nothing(just gold advantage), and you have no objective diversity.  Its not going to happen.","replies":[]}]}
