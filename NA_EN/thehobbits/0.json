There is an element of sound design on one of his abilities that always catches my ear. \r\nI don't own him and he's not on free so I'm using his skin spotlight (It has the sfx im talking about). Take a listen:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/QWsyxpCin2M?t=480\r\n\r\nThat kind of _bouncy_ addition to the scything cut. (Does that make sense? Can you hear it?)\r\nIts kind of like a _bloopy_ sort of noise sometimes and a little synth rattle other times. \r\n\r\nI'm asking Riot 'what is that? What does it mean?' Did you feel that Rhaast needed some other sfx added in there for players to differentiate the too in the chaos of a battle? (Totally understand that). What was the choice on this sound specifically though? Is that the sound Darkins make when slicing things?\r\n\r\nI studied sound design and its always the sound that pick up in team fights. Just curious.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sound Bear","date":"2017-09-26T20:11:25.937+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TheHobbits! You are spot on with your analysis! \n\nKayn was a tricky Champion to design since he has 3 models. The idea behind his design was to figure out what he was going to sound like during base form (Kayn), his shadow form (Ascended Kayn) and his Darkin form (Rhaast). Each form has very little variation in the abilities so I found opportunity sonically to push those thematics a little farther,  I designed the kit on Base and copied them over to each form and embellished textures and tonalities I thought worked well with each form's thematic...\n\n\n-Base form Kayn is recognized by the raw sound of the scythe with a touch of foley for specific moments, which is played up to make him feel dangerous. I used minimal magic throughout his spells to save room for more magic during other forms.\n\n-Shadow form Kayn identifies as being sleek, fast and dangerous. We want his sound to reflect that. Using shadow magic and blue tonal magic we can build on the sound that was made for base Kayn, editing in layers where we could add the more character.\n\n-Rhaast was the difficult one, I didn't want just bloody sounds for each slice, I wanted something that pulls him far from shadow and base form, and the distorted synth textures you hear I sprinkled throughout his kit. More than just dangerous Rhaast had to sound scary and evil. I found this by using lots of distortion on all the synth textures that were built for him, then carefully editing them into the sounds I created for Base Kayn to give Rhaast a darker/Darkin personality.\n\nLet me know if this answered your question!","replies":[{"poster":"TheHobbits","date":"2017-09-26T20:54:52.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. \n\nSeparating and creating distinct sounds for players to recognise was right. I just wonder is the sound something characters could hear or just for us players?\n\nThink of {{champion:51}} sounds. All mechanical. It sounds like characters in the game world would hear those sounds. Traps being deployed, nets being shot, if close enough the sniper taking aim.\n\nThen think of {{champion:19}} or {{champion:240}}. Blood Hunt has this deep drum beat and the Skall remount is a little trumpet.\nThese sounds, I'm sure, are just for the player.\n\nSorry if I sound confusing. Sound is half the game and it always fascinates me what goes into the design. I would love to get into sound foley for games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"l shinigami l ","date":"2020-01-02T03:24:34.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, so, I know this is an _old _ post but if there is a possibility of you seeing this then, might as well try, y'know?\n\nI am helping a Youtuber who does voice over for fan-made comics involving Kayn and he does a really good job as is but has been talking about how  he wants his Rhast (which is still actually really good) to sound more Rhast-like. Now, from reading what you have said, I am not too sure iif you were apart of the team who did the voice editing for the lines as well what i assume to be in the in-game action sounds? Either way, any input on how to become more Rhast-like would be amazing - whether from you or another Riot employee who had a hand in forming Kayn and his different voices.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-09-27T17:29:20.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the Sound Team did a great job on the Kayn sound effects. I especially enjoy the sound effects for all of Rhaast's spells as they sound almost alien-like. My one issue is with Shadow Assassin Kayn's W. Why did you guys choose to make it sound like a seagull cry?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Toppien","date":"2017-09-26T20:33:44.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"some of his lines are too quiet too...i can barely hear him","replies":[]}]}
