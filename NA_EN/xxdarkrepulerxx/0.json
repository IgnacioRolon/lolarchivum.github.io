The download link given to me was of the legacy client and since legacy client is retired I can't launch into the game.

You should be able to update the legacy client through your patcher though (the screen with the Launch button).  If it's not showing up for you, toss over a screenshot so I can see what's going on.   Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
