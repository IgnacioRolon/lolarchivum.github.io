However everyone is most curious about their favorite champion and so I have to ask, will (at the very least) Zyra {{champion:143}}  be included in the pool of champions receiving lore related changes? By no means is her current lore &quot;lacking&quot; per se.  It&#039;s just really open ended. Zyra fans understand she&#039;s a being of terrible beauty and power and not to mention ancient. She probably has a degree of naivet&eacute; as well.  I think there&#039;s a lot of potential possibilities for her. \r\n\r\nIn her lore, the last we know is she&#039;s free to roam Valoran independently. I&#039;d _love _ to know her potential perspective and experiences with her new surroundings. What are her motivations? (other than &quot;observing&quot; or experiencing the new world around her). Is there any realization about the impact she might have?  Is she discovering how much she&#039;s capable of and/or incorporating her abilities into the world around her? Any factions she&#039;s encountered and either dismissed or harmonized with them? Or is she too wild to ally herself with any civilized community? What&#039;s her level of intelligence and communication?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-08-02T16:20:16.403+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zyra isn't high on our priority list right now, but she will be getting a fresh coat of story paint (sorry, it's early and I've got my first cup of coffee waiting for me).  I agree with you that there are some very strong possibilities with her, (PBJ's post below being an excellent example), and we'll be looking to show how she's responding to the world around her.\n\nSorry that I can't be more concrete than that for now, but some of the Champs are in more urgent need than Zyra.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-08-02T21:49:34.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More urgent story wise or will these champions be primarily updated with visual and gameplay changes?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-08-02T23:01:34.711+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm talking purely from a story and background perspective.

For a being so ancient to suddenly change in such a dramatic fashion, it's like a complete rebirth. In this way, basic survival is still an issue, because she is experiencing the world anew.\n\nRELATIONS:\nZyra looks down on Maokai. Personality-wise, Zyra is a predator, a killer, the wild fury of nature, whereas Maokai is the sturdy, defensive, protective force of nature. Zyra loves the power that her new \"animal\" form gives her, Maokai laments it. They might be the only ones able to show each other the merits of either form.\n\nAhri might be a subject of interest to Zyra, since there is some commonality to how they both came to be. Otherwise she would just be a many-tailed snack.\n\nI'm also interested if Zyra has the mother nature personality like the community makes her appear to have.If you ever seen a discussion everbody talks of her likes she cares for other plants and nature.\nI personally don't see her as much,more of a killer and predator.I could imagine her interfering if someone tries to destroyes a huge forest or eco-system,but nothing more.\n\nFingers crossed you get a RED. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-08-02T18:01:09.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zyra lore is exactly like Ahri but instead of a fox is a plant.\n\nLiterally, read their lores, they stealed a human body in almost the same way","replies":[{"poster":"StellarPrime","date":"2015-08-02T18:25:32.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Celio Hogane HD,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=EFq6ZdTj,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-08-02T18:01:09.414+0000)\n>\n> Zyra lore is exactly like Ahri but instead of a fox is a plant.\n> \n> Literally, read their lores, they stealed a human body in almost the same way\n\nShe never \"stole\" a human body.
