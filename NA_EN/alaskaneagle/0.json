In fact I am not even in the same state. I'm visiting family at the moment in between moving to another city/state to spend most of winter snowboarding as close to daily as possible. If you like I can copy all the logs in the `riot games` folder for you.\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMISTY SLASHER December 03, 2014 06:48\r\nHey Alaskaneagle77,\r\n\r\nThank you for writing in again. My colleague is not here at the moment. So I will be assisting your today.\r\n\r\nEven if you are at a different state playing League of Legends, there should not be any problem at all since the server you are in caters the entire North America (and beyond :) )\r\n\r\nAre you still experiencing this issue regarding the context of your ticket?

It is no exaggeration when I say that the internet allotment here for the entire month is what I was aloud to use in a single second at my old house.

I'm sure if you had a player on your team who left the game or sat at base, whether intentionally or not, you would hope that player received some kind of warning for their behavior.\r\n\r\nI can't remove LeaverBuster punishments, but I am here to help you find and resolve the source of your issue. Our Knowledge Base contains several articles that may provide a solution to the most common issues, while I can help you troubleshoot more complex problems.\r\n\r\nHere is the link to the technical articles in our Knowledge Base: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/categories/200137704\r\n\r\nIf nothing in these articles resolves your issue, please let me know and we can take steps to identify a solution.\r\n\r\nLaxus \r\nPlayer Support Specialist \r\nJungle/Support\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nALASKANEAGLE77 Yesterday at 11:56\r\nyou sent the wrong generic message. This is a \"Client glitch and I got booted from the select menu and your system treated it as a dodge\" support ticket not an in game afk ticket.\r\n\r\nMaybe read the last comment. The more I deal with player support the more I think it's just fully automated to tell everyone to \"go fu ck themselves\" so employees don't have to waste time dealing with their player base.\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nMASTER O Today at 00:39\r\nHello Alaskaneagle77,\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our system does not allow modification of leaves, losses, or Elo. The system was built this way in an effort to prevent corruption. We are, however, working to better accommodate for disconnects and server stability.\r\n\r\nPlease note that while sometimes losses are prevented when our servers encounter a large scale issue, this is done proactively and at the time of any server complications. Losses cannot be removed retroactively. If you were involved in a game that ended prematurely because of large scale server issues, your losses would have been prevented.\r\n\r\nIf you believe this leave was the result of a bug in our system, we can explore the issue if you provide us with a copy of your r3d logs. R3d logs will help us figure out where the problem originated. Our Knowledge Base will explain how to find these logs; you can attach them to this ticket in your response.\r\n\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674#jwq7\r\n\r\nIf you are experiencing consistent network issues or crashes, let me know and I can help you troubleshoot them. I still won't have a way to alter your record, but hopefully we can reduce the chance of this happening in the future.\r\n\r\nMaster O \r\nPlayer Support Specialist \r\nThe Wandering Master\r\n\r\nAvatar\r\nALASKANEAGLE77 Today at 11:02\r\nRe-tune your bots riot it still didn't answer my question.\r\n\r\nAvatar","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-12-11T22:48:40.107+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey alaskaneagle,\n\nI won't mince words here; the responses you received fully sucked.

Actual humans made those... I assumed, based on the generic nature of all responses I've ever gotten to pretty much all support tickets, that you guys used one of the many programs developed that try to mimic human interactions.  \n\nAnyway thx for the response and the help.  You definitely sound non-robotic :-).\n\n  I have sent in a few support tickets but never actually seen the support team do anything other than talk.  Some companies give their employees a lot of flexibility and power to help people but I'm thinking riot follows an older style of player support where trying to talk nice is the extent of what you are allowed.  Could be wrong since my sample is limited to my own requests.  As a person with a business degree I would love to know if you can tell me that sort of thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OmgThatFiddle","date":"2015-02-17T13:45:09.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear dArtagnan ,\ndid you reach out to \nMisty\nThe Forgotten Blade Princess\nPlayer Support Specialist\nHowling Abyss Expert?\n\nCause she is still sending automatic mails about very important issues,\nand with that she is wrongfully acusing innocent players,me,saying i show toxic atitude,\nwhen i only get reports from flamers ,ragers and trollers that i told the truth,\ni can be very direct in doing so,\nbut i never ever flame,\nand if you choose to spoil a game for other players,\nthen they should also be man enough to take the comments you get then.\n\nAnd i can state that i had some kind of problem about not been taken serious with a ticket with that Admirall Bullfrog also last year.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Get Rekkkt","date":"2014-12-17T10:22:53.442+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got the same type of responses for the same problem\n\nthe WORST player support ive ever seen for any game, and thats a big statement\n\nsad when even the rioter is like wow, cant even shove that under the rug but still gave you the sorry it wont happen again\n\nfun fact=it will, probably  the very next time also","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2014-12-11T23:04:34.090+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I've actually had the same problem before with ridiculous \"Riot bot\" answers; last season, when there was a huge problem with the Mac client crashing on League, I sent a ticket to Support that got responded to pretty quickly.

The subject line said it, the ticket said it, and I just couldn't understand why they kept telling me I needed to follow steps for my \"Windows\" system for like 4 times in a row.\n\nFinally I guess it got through to someone who actually understood how to read emails, and a Rioter gave me the proper info on how to help my Mac problem.\n\nPoint in case?

The system also won't be able to differentiate between getting disconnect due to a glitch or other error and intentionally leaving. This is because you could just as easily unplug your modem and avoid getting penalized. \n\nIf you have consistent issues with this, my advice would be to follow through with your player support request and give them the information they need to help you.","replies":[]}]}
