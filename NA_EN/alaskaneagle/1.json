I had once ticket open but then you guys closed it after a couple months of runaround.\n\nThe \"multiple tickets\" are all different.  Every one of them.  And all the responses are half bots, half half-assed and NONE answer a single question....  \n\n\" If you have further questions, make sure to respond to your original ticket.\"... are you just responding with a pre-made phrase?  The original ticket was closed.  which is why I had to make new tickets, though if you look and again they are ALL DIFFERENT... Let me guess that confused your answer bot programs.  Is that why its been a month and not a single question (there were 5 I think) were answered?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eambo","date":"2015-01-07T19:23:25.101+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi alaskaneagle,\n\nIf this is an account/billing related issue, support tickets are the only way to get this actioned - Riot don't tend to look at this forum **too** much, as it's mainly for Player to Player support.\n\nIf it's more of a technical enquiry/issue, posting the details here might help as someone may be able to assist with isn't a Riot employee.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-01-08T23:54:09.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh, snap.

Seriously if you have ever dealt with Riot Support you will know they are useless. BUMP THIS OP SO THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. You cant actually get anything solved because it takes them a day or two to answer you, then you reply and wait a few more days. This is simple, get a customer service line. Even if it is just online chat. They tell people to go to support for an issue that could be fixed in minutes takes a week or two and doesn't get solved. Its ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}
