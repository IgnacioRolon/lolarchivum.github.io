This results in chat restrictions? Nevermind the 0/8 Riven who told me not to take last hits when I had to go top after not calling anything in lobby, then getting mad when I took CS anyway, so he tries to 1v2 a Malph/Trundle bot at level 1, and because I wasn&#039;t willing to walk in and die, I&#039;m the bad guy? This is kind of sad... People can&#039;t take the criticism they&#039;re dishing out, so they cry and daddy Riot comes and tries to shield them from all the scary words of the world?\r\n\r\nMind you, THIS IS BOTS! I JUST started this account, that was the first game I played. More evidence to the fact that Riot will single your accounts out if you&#039;ve had negative behavior in the past...  I know there are going to be all kinds of people who do nothing but surf the boards looking to point the finger at negative people, but this wasn&#039;t negativity, this was mild sarcasm at best, anyone who claims otherwise is just looking to be offended like a child.

This is absolutely worthy of punishment. It doesn't matter if it's just bots, the rules of the game are the same, whether it's ARAM, Co-Op Vs. AI, Normals, Ranked, or RGMQ.\n\nAlso, I don't see a single instance of mild sarcasm. I don't even see heavy sarcasm. You were just being straight-up toxic. You were _so_ negative in _your first match on that account_ that you warranted an immediate chat restriction. That's pretty bad.\n\nAnd, in regards to your response to Silent Gravity...\n\n> ...this game is not worth the time anymore...\n\nThen leave. You obviously have no respect for the rules, you don't seem to find the game enjoyable anymore, and you're negative enough to warrant a punishment on your _first game_ on a given account. It has nothing to do with Riot being predisposed to punish you, as, as you said, that's the _first match_ on that account. You had a completely clear punishment history, and _still_ got punished on your first match. It's not Riot that's the problem, it's you.","replies":[{"poster":"Epitaphfire","date":"2018-05-25T03:46:32.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"Sorry to disappoint, but facts don't care about your feelings, Riven claimed to be smurfing, and went 0/8 against bots, so the fact she couldn't 1v2 does make her bad, Ashe and Lulu tried to come in and take a kill, and when they \"failed\" I called them failures....

And anyone who reports someone for non-derogatory words, is obviously a kid who doesn&#x27;t understand the real world, and that being offended by everything will get them nowhere.\n\nIt has nothing to do with being offended, but it has everything to do with you being rude and disrespectful to them. So they messed up, everyone does from time to time, even in bot matches, which as Umbral Regent said, the rules still apply to. What good will calling them failures/bad do? Nothing. As for the \"kid\" argument, from [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&page=6#post43663843): \n\n>**If you kids report and punish things like this, youre going to be in trouble when you get out in the real world.**\n\n>This is a subset of the oversensitivity argument, but I feel it warrants separate treatment.\n\n>You're making the highly unwarranted assumption that the people who punish for \"noob\" lack real-world experiences. If you were to ask the TBI regulars, you would find that almost all of us are at least in their late 20's, if not significantly older. Most of us have at least undergraduate degrees. So, this idea that we're all naive little children is more than a little silly.\n\n>Also, we know that professional players dislike people who spend their time typing because math. Not only are the report rates for the highest tiers not significantly lower than anywhere else (this from Lyte), but the pros know how that kind of behavior affects play. Someone who is on tilt is throwing the game just as much as the person who is playing poorly.\n\n>The truth of the matter is that the loose cannons end up having their misbehavior overshadow their skill. Look at Dennis Rodman. There has never been a better rebounder. Ever. But his legacy is not that he was basically a human vacuum. No, it's that he was out of control, both on and off the court.\n\n>In short, this is a stupid argument if you know anything about the people who are reporting and punishing you.\n\n__________\n \n> Diabloman91: won&#x27;t do any good, I&#x27;ll keep adding you Kingg, you&#x27;re really fun\n> Diabloman91: Be my friend?\n> \n> That seems mildly sarcastic, maybe even heavily sarcastic considering I blocked that person lol... \n\nTrue this can be seen as sarcastic, but it was only said in the post game lobby after you spent the entire game being rude and disrespectful to your fellow teammates.\n\n> Also, anyone who still thinks that Riot doesn&#x27;t group all your accounts together is in denial, if I can view my tickets back from August of 2014 on this account that I made 5 mins prior to THAT match (about an hour and a half ago), they&#x27;re all clearly linked, believe it, don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t care what you do, but if I can make some people (clearly not you, my special little snowflake *squeezes your cheek*) think about their bans/restrictions with a bit more realistic thought processes, then I&#x27;m doing something good. Cause quite frankly, you&#x27;d be an idiot not to realize that accounts are linked based off of IP address they&#x27;re associated with.\n\nWhile Riot does have ways of tracking peoples smurf accounts, the IFS from my recollection is also programmed to be slightly harsher on lower leveled accounts just in case that they're the smurf accounts of a recently punished user trying to circumvent their punishment on their main account(s).\n\nP.S. If you can't make your point without resorting to name-calling then chances are it wasn't really that important to begin with, so I would highly suggest finding some other way to make your point without resorting to such tactics.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-05-25T03:38:49.917+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">Was this worthy of punishment?\n\nIt's not whether or not it's worthy of BANS it's w- wait.
