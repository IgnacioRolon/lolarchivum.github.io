Even though I already have a rank. Can someone explain? I can't play any ranked games because I don't want to register as placement games when I'm not supposed to be in placements. It has also deleted all my ranked stats. Someone please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T20:41:58.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a visual display issue while we undergo maintenance.
