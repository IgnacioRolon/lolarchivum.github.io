An amazing level of gameplay, a plethora of interesting and unique characters to choose from and more recently an upgraded lore to go along with it. It leaves people with mechanical prowess and those without many options to still shine and to always grow and learn with the ever adapting meta. \r\n\r\nLeague is one of my favourite and I think it could be considered one of the greatest games ever if it had not made this mistake early on. I fault riot and league&#039;s curators for this shortcoming, but at the same time I know it&#039;s not just a problem with league. The issue that holds league back for me and I&#039;m sure for many other players is not the community, or the ranked system. Not the &quot;cancerous champs&quot; or the tilt that comes from getting smashed by another player. I believe it is fully the fact of the matter of the league mentality when losing. \r\n\r\nLeague of legends let a mentality come up that whenever you are losing a game of league. Someone has to be of blame - and that someone has to know it. Even if your team was winning or staying even as soon as things start to look awry someone is going to be blaming and flaming someone else. Whether the jungle is blaming all his lanes for falling behind or the lanes flame the jungler for not ganking more when they die or take bad trades whenever he&#039;s on the opposite side of the jungle. The support gets the brunt of an adc&#039;s wrath when he ends up with the kill even though the assist still puts his ad ahead. Every league player has the mentality that someone has to be held accountable and it can never be me. It&#039;s not just good enough that they&#039;re accountable but they know it&#039;s all their fault this game was lost and that they are a bad player. We&#039;ve all experienced it and even worse we&#039;ve probably been on both ends of it. We&#039;ve all played with players above our skill level and we&#039;ve all had bad games where we&#039;ve played with players who are better. We all know the feeling of wanting a player who isn&#039;t as good know that it&#039;s their fault. That&#039;s not the problem. \r\n\r\nThe problem with league is that they made it acceptable to say practically whatever you want and to be able to get away with it. While there is a threat of being banned it is very lenient and was never made good enough to actual stop people from taking away the fun from other players. Is it easy to enforce rules where you actual say things that are useful or just don&#039;t say anything - no, absolutely not. Is it likely even possible now? No. But can the game ever reach it&#039;s full potential of being enjoyable the way it is now with how players interact with each other? No, it can&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-08T12:50:20.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The opponent team is usually more toxic than my team. But I am trying to play with Flex5s. If I am upset at another lane, I will keep it to myself/just say wow x enemy is fed.\nBut the other team gets an easy lead and just spams EZ EZ EZ. \n\nI do have someone from the boards. I've played 3 games with his Flex of 4 + me. And each time I as support get blamed for the loss =\\. Like yea I may make a mistake but your team is pretty toxic to the new guy. First two games were back-to-back, third game was later and I forgot who he was (I wish I realized my mic was muted because my callouts were not getting heard leading to lost teamfights).\nJust play the game. Don't blame anyone for having a bad game. Keep trying to encourage good teamfights. Last night my 3manFlex had an amazing comeback (other team throw) vs a 12-0 YI at like 15minutes with a 4-0 Yasuo. They could just press one button and delete us, but there was no blaming in that game. There were mistakes but we worked together and kept pushing. I am impressed with the two fills for not quitting and for not blaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-05-08T08:52:57.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't vote in polls, but this one is particularly atrocious to me. It is pretty rare that I have negative experiences with other players in this game, losing or not. I would say maybe 5% in losing games.\n\nGenerally from personal experiences with other people, the ones who complain about how poor the community are the ones that cause those interactions with themselves or amplify the smaller ones for themselves.","replies":[]}]}
