Typically these towers fall early, which means champ damage is low relative to creep damage, often champions will allow minions to die to the tower to deny them while farming the enemy minions and early damage often comes from creeps pushing into the tower.\n\nI don't think it's that rare for more than 3000 raw creep damage (1800 post mitigation on 7.23), which is the number needed for the 10% boost to creep damage to balance out the 300 extra HP.\n\nSomething else to think about is that outer towers have 3800 HP since 7.23. This means creeps don't need to do a majority of the towers HP for it to fall faster, if they deal half, distinctly not a majority then they've dealt 317 extra damage, outweighing the 300 extra HP already. \n\nSimple math shows that in a realistic situation tower bulk has gone down. The only time when this isn't the case is VS a 3+ man push, but in these cases dealing 300 extra damage isn't even a challenge. The towers last an extra 2 seconds VS 3 people, big fucking deal. The fact that they die quicker to creeps is a far larger impact than that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2017-12-04T07:47:26.689+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right, they seem to have misunderstood what the changes would do.
