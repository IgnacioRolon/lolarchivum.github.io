I can already see balance issues miles away.\n\nOn the other hand, thank you for making Zeal more expensive. it only took months of ignoring your community.\n\nOh , also, the new IE is fucking rediculous.

With {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3006}} at lvl 18, he does 140 AD and 69 true, when conqueror procs, he does 132 and 148 respectively. This is on test dummies of course. That's 209 vs. 280, a 71 damage difference. So it seems conqueror is still a good keystone.\n\nCompared to live, 207 flat, changed to 197 and 98 true, 295 total.\n\nSo essentially. New IE is better for yasuo if he takes a different keystone, otherwise its definitely a nerf. Maybe people will stop complaining, maybe it will be changed. It will be a long PBE cycle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Datel√Øne NBC","date":"2018-05-07T14:40:12.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"think about it tho 2o% true damage from IE and 50 from Yasuo ult + if you add in Stormrazors the secondary passive will go off on every attack im seeing a perma ban into some kinda nerfs done to yasuo if not hell will break lose","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-05-02T06:39:56.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:33}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharp Chedarr","date":"2018-05-02T04:32:46.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is everyone forgetting the true damage?","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-05-02T06:39:12.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk fam.
