It seems everyday now the first game I try and join I get a bugsplat.  I then have to logout and log back in which usually forces me to reapply patch before i can join the game. Then it will work fine.  Not sure what the issue is but I have run repair and tried other things and not helping.  Don't really want to have to reinstall everything from scratch to try and fix this.  Not sure if there is a known issue someone else has found to maybe help me out.","replies":[{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-11T09:44:32.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Search before posting:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/X6sPFPu8-fps-drops-and-crashes-after-the-windows-10-anniversary-update","replies":[{"poster":"Alanchen0705","date":"2017-03-04T18:52:29.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried closing the dvr recordings in the xbox app and it still doesn't work.
