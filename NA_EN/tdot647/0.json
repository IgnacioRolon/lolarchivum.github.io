Basically, this ended up in you being marked for dodging the game it sounds like, which is why you got the small 5 game LPQ. You mentioned the \"first two times\" so it seems like you kept repeating those dodges which led to high LPQ's since those dodges were in a short amount of time. You'll need to wait that time out and play through the entire game in order to get rid of the LPQ games.","replies":[]}]}
