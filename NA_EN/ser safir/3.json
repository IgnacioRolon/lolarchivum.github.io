Yet you are conversing with the non-existent gods. They even give you a very real stat boost.\r\nThe woman who revealed to you that there are no gods is soulbound by the gods and you convince her to prove the non-existence of the gods by destroying her soul, which she admits is held by the gods.\r\nYour whole quest is to stop a madmen from giving power back to a god, and before stopping him you almost make him admit that the god he wants to empower doesn&#039;t exist. Then you have the option to empower the god that doesn&#039;t exist yourself, only to find out that the non-existing god exists, but it doesn&#039;t because that was the point of the story.\r\n\r\nWhat the fuck does this mean.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know what the writers were on, but that is some of the dumbest shit man can conceive and somehow call it a story.","replies":[]}
