So I took the class.\n\nThe teacher asked us to discuss possible topics to cover that would be persuasive speech topics and I mentioned \"videogames don't cause violence.\"\n\nShockingly, everyone went from somewhat left-wing to hardcore fox news 'everyone knows videogames cause violence' attitude, the teacher said, \"you can do it, but every student who ever brought this topic up to me has always convinced me otherwise.\"\n\nA person to my right acted like I was crazy, \"I play videogames and I can confirm they cause violence.\" I said, \"how?\"\n\nHe said, \"Are you kidding me? Kids playing grandtheftauto and call of duty obviously cause violence because of those games.\"\n\n\"so what if they're playing a violent game? That doesn't---\"\n\nhe immediately ignored me, glancing away, \"K, just whatever dude.\" Waving his hand to the side in front of his face.\n\n\"They don't--\"\n\n\"k just whatever dude.\"\n\nI almost forgot I was in college. People were acting so immature and so adamantly against videogames...\n\nThen as I walked out of class a different guy started talking to me about how he knows kids are playing call of duty. So I asked him, \"so what? I don't violently assault people after playing games.\" He said \"we're adults, so we feel desensitized by violence. It will desensitize them to violence in a way that makes it appear more acceptable.\"\n\nI said, \"I'm going to argue that it's the parents responsibility and duty to teach their children the difference between reality and virtual reality; that if they neglect their child and leave him with a violent game and he commits a crime, it's not the videogame that should be accountable, but the parent. Parent's don't like to believe their child's behavior is bad because of their poor parenting skills, so they blame anything but themselves, using videogames as a scapegoat.\"\n\nHe said, \"sorry I was ignoring you.\"\n\n**So I was wondering, can anyone give me logical arguments and statistics that I might bring up?**\n\nI'm personally looking for the information and I'll be posting some of it here:\n\nhttp://videogames.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=003627\n\nhttp://videogames.procon.org/\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11507576/Study-finds-no-evidence-violent-video-games-make-children-aggressive.html\n\nhttp://cjb.sagepub.com/content/35/3/311.short","replies":[]}
