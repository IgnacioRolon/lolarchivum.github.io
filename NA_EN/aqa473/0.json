Thank you to LordRedStone Nr1 for the info.\n\nhttps://66.media.tumblr.com/0dc55bda1b4988e19350efd998630d81/062a2a838f7cf115-52/s500x750/79bbdeb3cbcc1b73708f6ddd0d75dd6bbed85ff3.png\n\nI’d like to start by expressing that this is all speculation and **wishful thinking**. I know Nid ain’t ace. No character in League is anything but cishet unless explicitly stated otherwise, over and over, on twitter, in official posts, yelling and screaming in the faces of people who refuse to believe that anything other than cishet exists. This bit of rumination on my part is my own interpretation of a character and a desire to see more representation in a game I love.\n\nFor the uninitiated, asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction towards others. It’s a spectrum and can exist in many forms. Aromanticism is separate, but is the same only to romanticism rather than sexuality. For example, my sister is ace/aro and she has no romantic or sexual attraction to anyone and has zero desire to be sexual or romantic in any way. But, again, there’s a spectrum.\n\nFor the purposes of my theory, I posit that Nidalee is ace/aro just to be simple. In this argument, I use the term “asexual” a lot while discussing subjects of both asexuality and aromanticism, but remember that these are two different things. In fact, most asexuals are romantic, panromantic, biromantic, etc. I just think that Nidalee is probably both so I’m using asexual as a blanket term for this essay.\n\nNidalee’s always been a sort of interesting champion in League. One of the oldest champions in the game, everyone knows about her and what she can do. Her spear is infamous, but even people who don’t play League know about her sexualization. More so than, I’d say, any other female champ in the history of League, Nidalee has been a sort of sexual icon for LoL. Her /dance is a stripper dance, her quotes are flirtations, her art has always been sexual, and her body is prominently featured in many promotional media. But, even in the beginning, she’s never been actually _sexual_.\n\nYes, her voice lines have a certain level of “let’s @$#%” energy, but that’s the case with basically every female champion from beta to s1. It wasn’t a part of any of their stories (with the exception of Ahri) and was just there to make them appealing for a largely male demographic. Well, we’re past that point and many, many champions’ lores no longer pertain to their in-game voice lines. Oddly enough, Nidalee’s lore has _never_ pertained to her in-game voice lines.\n\nNidalee’s lore has remained largely unchanged since her inception. She’s a human baby left in the Kumungu jungle to be raised by cougars, gains magical shapeshifting powers, and spends most of her time defending the jungle from the terrors of colonialism and hunting. That’s basically it.\n\nNowhere in her lore has there ever been any mention of sexual desire or action. And for this, and a few other reasons, I thought she’d be a perfect candidate for League’s first asexual champion (if that’s ever a concern for them).\n\nThere is one instance where anything remotely close to romantic or sexual connection is discussed and it’s a single paragraph in her new biography that came out when Neeko was released:\n\n“Over time, she learned to better control her powers, eventually shifting between both forms with ease. Perhaps it was a yearning to find others of her kind that led her to the chameleon-like wanderer Neeko, but the two became inseparable for a time. Nidalee delighted in mentoring her inquisitive new companion, and they reveled in exploring the jungle’s numerous wonders together, before Neeko eventually departed to follow her own destiny beyond Shurima’s shores.”\n\nWe know Neeko’s definitely allo and has exhibited attraction for several champions. According to Matt Dunn, she was even attracted to Nidalee, perhaps during the period quoted above, but it was unrequited.\n\n[twitter post](https://twitter.com/thatmattdunn/status/1064640118919548928?lang=en)\n>Realmente: Does Neeko like Nami? or Nidalee ? (romantic way)how old is she?\n>\n>matt_dunn: Neeko's currently single and looking. She loved nidalee, but it was unrequited.\n\nWhy was it unrequited? I’m sure you could come up with any number of reasons. The most popular is probably “she’s straight” but I reject that answer! One of the common thoughts among allosexuals is that it’s difficult (or impossible depending on who you talk to) to not pursue sexual encounters. Like it’s this primal, self-destructive need to have sex regardless of near anything else.\n\nWe know Nidalee rejects society, choosing to live with cougars (like literal cougars not middle-aged women looking for a date). Even Vastaya refuse to see her as an equal. She’s between human and Vastaya, defending Kumungu with all her heart because it’s the only existence she’s ever known. She could be having sex with the cougars in her pride (pride? pack? group? idk) but I don’t know if Riot’s willing to promote bestiality. It seriously seems to me that Nidalee just doesn’t want sex and it seems to fit her lifestyle rather well.\n\nAlso, just because someone is asexual does not mean they don’t form attachments to people. Asexual people have no problems making friends, loving their family, and having close emotional bonds with other people. You know, like a person. Nidalee could easily be close to Neeko, as close as the biography suggests, and not have any sexual or romantic attraction to Neeko.\n\nhttps://66.media.tumblr.com/d142e7af5c9add0bc5f07b02099019bc/062a2a838f7cf115-50/s250x400/4be922597c05c494776e0bc15130535135fc90a8.png\n\nI’d like to draw attention to this gem on her forehead. The only places I can find referencing a gem, dot, tattoo, or other such signifier on the forehead is the bindi used in Hinduism and maybe some other similar belief systems. After a brief stint on Wikipedia, I think bindis are religious signifiers, typically worn by women, as a tradition and a symbol in Hinduism. It’s placed on the forehead, very near the eyes, because it is meant to represent a third eye, a spiritual eye.\n\nI came across a forum post from 2012 made by a woman who was Hindu but was also asexual and wanted to know what that meant for her destiny as a Hindu. There’s apparently some line in some text that says it’s a person’s duty to bear children a care for a family, even if just for religious purposes if nothing else. But this woman was like, “not like sex, what do?” Someone replying said something very interesting.\n\n>I think it’s a gift, quite honestly. I think it’s something removed from your essence to allow you to focus on other areas of spiritual growth. Perhaps you fulfilled your sexuality in a previous life, and now it is time to remove that. I know that in this world most of [us] are sexual beings… Embrace your (a)sexuality and channel your other energies to other areas of spiritual growth.\n\nBroken all that down? Cool.\n\nNidalee has a bindi in each of her updated splash arts that shows her forehead. Her base splash and five of her skin splashes feature a bindi gem with the exception of Headhunter which has a tattoo. The others have that section of her forehead covered or obscured.\n\nLeague of Legends doesn’t exist in a vacuum. If it did, a forehead gem could just be a forehead gem. But it doesn’t. A game is made by real people in the real world for real people to consume. A bindi holds cultural significance for a not-insignificant portion of the human population. Considering that these are Nidalee’s updated splashes, I like to believe that these were not accidents. Riot intentionally gave Nidalee a bindi, a cultural signifier of Hinduism, which makes Nidalee a fantasy parallel to a Hindu. Nidalee is Hindu.\n\nNidalee defends her jungle, the animals, nature, with almost spiritual zeal. As far as we’ve seen in her lore, it is her primary objective. There’s a hint in her new lore that she’s curious about her origin, which is a nice internal conflict, but she is generally consumed with her duty as protector of Kumungu jungle.\n\nIf her devotion to nature is paralleled with Hinduism, then one could make the argument that Nidalee’s asexuality permits her to perform her duty to the jungle with unmatched fervor. I am. I’m making that argument.\n\n—\n\nI’m not saying this is fact. It’s not. This is 100% speculation and wishful thinking on my part. I _want_ an asexual champion, and I think Nidalee fits perfectly. When representation doesn’t exist, or when _a thing_ doesn’t exist, people who want it to exist will find a place for it. I _want_ there to be asexual representation in League of Legends. So I picked Nidalee. This is my argument, these are my reasons.\n\nBut I want to say why I think Nidalee would be such a good ace champion, too. As I mentioned earlier, she’s a sex icon for League of Legends, despite having never had sex in the lore or anything like that. She’s been drawn with the male gaze in mind and is constantly used in promotions to be titilating and exposed. She is sexualized and objectified in the most literal sense. As a character, she is none of these things.\n\nhttps://66.media.tumblr.com/8cdb6fc92320ddaf14649eb82133864d/062a2a838f7cf115-a5/s500x750/380a6bb8c2e30367e13fb4b2fa195642860ff4d4.png\n\nIf she was confirmed asexual, it would be a huge reversal of expectations. People see this buxom forest lady (although her new design is far more conservative) and instantly make assumptions that she’s sexual, alluring, flirtatious, promiscuous, etc. Unfortunately, her voice lines don’t really refute those judgments, but I already said my piece on that. If she was actually asexual, with no desire to seek a sexual relationship of any sort, it would put a rather interesting spin on a character largely used for sex appeal.\n\nIt would also force people to observe their own judgments and expectations. If someone makes the flash judgment of Nidalee, “she’s a slut,” and then find out she has no desire to have sex, it would make them think. It would make them reassess how they value and devalue people. Having the lonely hermit in the corner with no friends or associates be ace would be 1) offensive and 2) not push any boundary or expectation. People already assume aces are either introverts or mentally handicapped, neither of which are true.\n\nAce people are perfectly capable of being sexy, having friends, being dedicated to their jobs, loving their families, and any other number of things humans normally do. Making Nidalee, League of Legends’s (dare I say) oldest sex icon, ace would be quite the statement. Similar to making Soldier 76 gay, who was often attributed as the stereotypical military straight man.\n\nThis is just my headcanon, my speculation, my theory, my opinion. I’m saying that there’s any factual evidence for ace/aro Nidalee. There’s just an argument to be made, I have made that argument, and I would like people to consider it. There isn’t a lot of ace/aro representation in media and it seems like Riot’s starting to dip their toes into the qu*er waters (Neeko, Kai/Val, Taliyah) so this is a possible avenue they could go down while continuing to do that.\n\nAnd, a special note to the League Boards crowd: please read **the entire post** before commenting. **Please**. I know ya'll have short attention spans and shorter tempers, but this is a discussion. I will ignore anyone that just goes \"ew ace\" and downvotes. I get it, you're cishet and don't need representation and don't want education. I get it. But I want a discussion. If you don't want that, go away.

So, it cant have sexual attraction to anyone. Another example could be {{champion:203}} since they are death itself.\n\nAnd yes, of course that the old lore is not canon anymore, and to be fair its kinda dumb to imagine Nidalee dating a reporter of a journal, but there are still traces of it in the new lore (The lore of Rammus actually mentions his love towards cactus, a thing that is mentioned in the same article of the JOJ that mentions the relationship between Bob and Nidalee).\n\nBut if you want an argument about why Nidalee should be straight in the lore, well... She was raised by felines, and its in the nature of felines to follow mating season, since Nidalee was raised by felines, she should act like them and follow their instincts, reproduction is one of those insticts. In fact, she even mentions that in her (limited) VO.\n\n{{champion:76}} \"Instinct guides my steps.\"\n{{champion:76}} \"Did I mention it's mating season?\"\n\nhttps://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/sexual-instinct\n\nI mean, if you tell me that asexual felines exist in the wild, then i could see Nidalee as asexual as well, but i dont think there are.","replies":[{"poster":"AQA473","date":"2019-09-21T03:32:01.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"_deep, concentrated, beleaguered sigh_\n\nRammus is a meme and them commenting on his love for cactus in the new lore is part of that meme. TB Skyen even discusses in his video \"What's the Deal with Rammus?\" that Rammus is a meme, both in and out of lore, and that his memeness is core to his character. It was probably accidental, but Riot's leaned into this element of Rammus and it's working out pretty well. You can't make the same argument for anyone else.\n\nHowever, there are some relationships, character traits, locations, past events, histories, etc. that _have_ been carried over from pre-2014. Rammus is probably not the best example for your argument, but yes. If they wanted to, they could hook Nidalee up with reporter Bob again. It just doesn't really make sense at this point. Judging by their recent style of writing and lore inclusion, do something like that would be very out of place and, honestly, childish. Having Nidalee bone a reporter \"because\" is just to stroke the toxic masculine egos of supposed straight-male teenagers reading the Journal of Justice. Those kinds of stories have no place in the modern lore.\n\nWe seem to be arguing from different places here, so let me get you to where I am. Asexuality is not _learned_. You are born with it. There is no choice, it cannot be taught, it cannot be trained or brainwashed into you. Yes, conversion therapy and societal conditioning is a thing. Society's expectations and a lack of qu#er education is why my sister dated people in high school. But she eventually found out ace was a thing. It was a massive revelation that took her months of research and self-evaluation to finally realize. She suddenly knew why all her relationships sucked, why she didn't feel the same way other people seemed to feel about sex and dating. She never had crushes and never wanted to kiss anyone. She was raised being told \"you're gonna get married someday,\" \"one day, when you have sex...\" and etc. Society, media, school, teachers, movies, news, everything told her \"this is the norm, you will have sex, you will have kids, and that is life.\" Despite all that, to her, it still felt _wrong_. Hearing about asexuality from someone on the internet was like some cosmic spirit (it was probably Bard) telling her \"that _isn't_  the norm, that _isn't_ life; **be you**.\"\n\nSexuality, romanticism, and gender aren't learned. They _are_. If there's someone who says \"well _I_ chose,\" then that's because they're genderfluid, bisexual/romantic, etc. Take me, for example. I don't suffer from gender dysphoria, but I do have gender euphoria and would prefer identifying as a woman. However, I have no problems identifying as a man. That isn't a choice. That isn't something I learned from somewhere. It's my brain reacting to different interpretations of myself. Because I don't have gender dysphoria (which causes depression and can lead people to suicide), maybe I do have some level of choice. But, again, that's along those lines of genderfluid, bi, etc.\n\nIf Nidalee is ace (and I never said she was, I just said she could be and hope she will be), then being raised by cougars won't change that. Being raised by anyone anywhere has nothing to do with her gender and sexuality _ever_. It doesn't matter what instincts are. Who knows, maybe she will end up dating Bob. In fact, let's do a thought experiment.\n\nNidalee is a **human child** raised by wild cats in a magical jungle. This magical jungle eventually imprints on her and she gains the ability to turn into a wild cat. She meets Human Bob at some point because he's there for some reason. She determines he is male, having had little experience with society so she doesn't really understand the whole \"gender\" thing but he has a penis (she sees him pee) so he's clearly \"male.\" She's seen her cougar pride and other animals mating and knows that it is \"the circle of life\" so she must be destined for this, too, despite not being like any other animal in the jungle. She pursues Human Bob to fulfill this reproductive destiny, begins a sexual interaction with him, and realizes rapidly that **she does not want this**. She keeps telling herself \"this is for nature, I _have_ to do this, it's what's expected of me,\" but she can't ignore how uncomfortable and distasteful this interaction is. It hurts, she has no personal desire to be anywhere near this man, and she realizes that she has a choice. She doesn't need to be here. There's plenty of cougars in the jungle. If she were to die today (another inevitability in the circle of life), would the ecosystem suddenly collapse because she hadn't reproduced with a stranger who might not have even showed up? So, she leaves the man, he being quite bewildered, and decides that she doesn't need \"sex.\" The only penetration she needs is her spear sinking into the hearts of poachers and colonists.\n\nYou could have her \"mate\" with another cougar while she's in cougar form, but the result is the same. Gays that have been to conversion therapy are either psychologically damaged in immeasurable ways or they \"relapse\" and start exhibiting \"gay tendencies\" again. Because, guess what? _It's not a choice_. This is who we are. There's no fighting it. And why should we have to? Our sexual and gender identities don't hurt people. There's plenty of cishet people to reproduce for the rest of us, if that's a concern. And plenty of gay people, if not most, still want kids. Being gay doesn't mean you don't want kids. Asexual people are also capable of having kids. Ace people that aren't sex-repulsed are known to have sex for their partner who they love (if they're alloromantic) or if reproduction is a necessity.\n\ntl;dr sex and gender aren't a choice. Nidalee being raised by cougars would not stop her from being ace if she was. This isn't an argument. It's just fact.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2019-09-21T04:39:45.701+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My argument was not about being \"educated\" to follow the \"circle of life\".

The condescension comes from the stereotype or assumption that the \"outspoken majority,\" or people who yell on twitter and send death threats and cry in /all chat, are cishet. We assume they are automatically against anything non-cishest because they are cishet and therefore don't see any reason for representation to exist.

But representation isn't about _you_, it's about _everyone_. It's about education. It's about making people who feel alone and misunderstood feel like someone's listening, like they aren't the only ones. It's about showing people what minority individuals are really like, that they are everywhere, can be anyone. Like you. I mistook you for a cishet \"because.\" Those on the qu#er spectrum are everywhere. The more representation, the better. At least, that's my opinion. I will always push for more no matter what and no one will ever change my mind on it. I've dedicated my life and education to it; I'm not about to stop now.\n\nLet people hate on tumblr. They won't know what it's really like until they make an account and hang our there for a week, anyway. I have no obligation to give people the politically correct, sensitive crybaby description of tumblr. That's not up to me and that's not what this post is about. I just made the original post on tumblr and was complaining about the formatting of league boards. Plus, I also tell people when I'm cross-posting.\n\nNaturally doesn't cut it. Or, more that naturally doesn't exist. There's 144 champions in league and many of them were originally meant to be qu#er (Diana/leona, Taliyah, probably some others) but the original writers chickened out or were told by higher-ups that it was too risky. If an unconfirmed champion from the old lore was suddenly given a het romance (many of whcih have been), no one would bat an eye. No one would, no one has said \"don't change pre-determined lore.\" Because cishet is the default, the status quo, tradition, the majority, it's what we're used to. I didn't hear shit when they gave Orianna a new robot boyfriend to help her rediscover her humanity (manic pixie dream boy). But no, when someone says, \"nid could be ace?\" everyone jumps on them and tell them to shut up and deal with things the way they are because everything's perfect and nothing needs to change.\n\nFuck that. Fuck all of that. We demand representation because we won't get it otherwise. Cishet is the default. Stock holders know that, CEOs know that, marketing teams know that, so they go with the safe option and make everything cishet, and white, because they know it will sell and (most likely) won't get them in trouble with various groups and international marketing.\n\nBut companies, especially big ones, need to take these risks if that destructive status quo is ever going to change. In fact, it _has_ to be these big companies because they have the money and resources to make those risks. Indie developers and solo private creators make one mistake and they're on the street. And yet it's indie games that we put the responsibility on to create non-cishetwhite content? That's unrealistic and unfair. Big companies _have_ to take a part in this.\n\nAnd Riot listened. At least a little. Neeko's a lesbian, Varus has a couple of gay squatters in him, Taliyah got word-of-god confirmed trans in a twitter post after Neeko's release. It's clear that Riot is looking at more ways to enter this pool, so-to-speak. Let them. Let them try. They have to.\n\nThere's 144 champions in League of Legends. Most don't have post-2014 confirmed gender or sexual identities. That's a massive pool of characters ripe for representation, representation that won't go counter to any of their existing personalities. Leona/Diana could literally be confirmed any day. Many new lore stories actually hint at it (I recently read Soraka's short story where Leona and Diana were referred to as \"counterparts\"). Cait/Vi could easily be confirmed with a new skin or a new short story. I'm sure there are some dudes that could get it, too, but I haven't done a lot of research on male champions. If we just go, \"only make new champions qu#er,\" then we'll be here till the second coming. Every new champion for the next two years could be qu#er and it still wouldn't be enough.\n\nAnyway, yes, people are free to disagree with me, and they do, and they have already downvoted the post (and I thank them for their participation). But the comments are for discussion and debate and that is what I am doing. But I am still allowed to make arguments in hopes that I sway more people, whether it be the people I am talking to or people reading the comments, to my line of thought. Or, at the very least, consider new ideas. That's all I ask. And I would apologize for this massive wall of text, but I don't regret it and it's important to say.

Any time someone brings up sexuality a lot of people like to whine about _**\"But what if its forced!??!\"**_ as an excuse to dismiss sexuality as a character trait. If you do make another post about something similar to this, you might need to cater a bit more to the board's sensitivity to the topic.","replies":[{"poster":"AQA473","date":"2019-09-22T02:40:34.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for all that insight!

As I mentioned earlier, she’s a sex icon for League of Legends, despite having never had sex in the lore or anything like that. She’s been drawn with the male gaze in mind and is constantly used in promotions to be titilating and exposed. She is sexualized and objectified in the most literal sense. As a character, she is none of these things.\n\nFully agree here. Now as others pointed out, she wouldn't technically be the first asexual character, but that's not the point you're making. The other examples are god-like beings and definitely not human anyway - except for Jhin - and I think Nida would be a good addition. \n\nOn the topic of voicelines - Yup, she does need an update. (She actually has another reason: her VO _still_ mentions summoners!)\nFrom the \"classic sexy ladies\" she and MF need it the most. I'll give Ahri a pass because it does fit her lore, but especially these two had drastic changes to their lore. I wouldn't mind if they toned down the \"sexy\" lines. Sure, as you said, she _can_ be sexy, but eh. I'd prefer her less slutty at least.\n\nI'm not sure if I agree on aromantic - it could be interesting to explore asexual romantic relationships but the evidence shows she's not interested in Neeko? She could be alloromantic and Neeko left for a different reason? IDK, both could work I think.\n(I'm also not an expert with the terms and had to look up \"allosexual/romantic\", so excuse me if there is anything wrong.)","replies":[{"poster":"AQA473","date":"2019-09-21T04:03:34.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What a lovely comment! Your use of terminology is good. I had to ask my sister about the allo stuff, too (mostly 'cause I didn't know how to spell it).\n\nI thought about this, too. Like seriously considered it. Neeko is one of my favorite champs and I'm always on the lookout for possible ships for her (shipping is how I interact with most media). She's had canon attraction towards Nidalee so that's like an easy pair-up right there, and there is fanart for the pairing. But, yeah, Nidalee didn't reciprocate. It could be for any number of reasons. in fact, I wasn't even going to bring up the Neeko thing in this post because it doesn't say in the text \"Nidalee's ace so she didn't hook up with Neeko.\" But it was an instance of a rejected relationship so it helps my argument.\n\nIt would also be good to have an asexual/alloromantic champion. Most ace/aro characters in media (of which there are, like, four) are ace/aro but most ace/aro people in real life are ace/allo or allo/aro. My sister is the only ace/aro person I know and the only ace/aro person _she_ knows. Having more ace/allo or allo/aro characters would be great for representation, especially to show people a more realistic portrayal of asexuality and aromanticism.\n\nBut I just don't see it in Nidalee. Maybe when discussing another champion, like Kai'Sa, or Dr. Mundo, but not Nidalee. Nid really feels ace/aro to me, for reasons stated in the post.\n\nThank you so much for the thoughtful response and all the help with the formatting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Viktor","date":"2019-09-22T08:08:17.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But first rito must give us Star Guardian {{champion:6}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-09-21T18:35:48.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't disagree that we could use some more representation in the game, turning Nidalee into an asexual is not really the way to go for me.\n\n___________________\n\nNidalee, for many people, has been associated with sex for a really long time. The jokes about mating season, that there was the rumored hidden passive that she gives bonus exp to underleveled champions around her and so on.\n\nChanging her now into being completely unrelated and uninterested in sexuality seems a bit drastic of a change for me here.\n\n__________________\n\nLike some already stated, there already are asexual champions in the game, so the situation is not as bad as it seems. And while you made the argument about Jhin being a mass murderer, there is also the point that Jhin is actually a really popular champion when it comes to his thematic. He is one of Riot's masterpieces and he represents asexuality, so I don't know if him being one really makes it \"problematic\"....\n\nBut sure, let's add more to the list. I just think there are better candidates than Nidalee for this. Just to give some examples:\n\n{{champion:61}} Has been a real girl formerly, but she had to replace her entire body with Hextech. We don't even know if she is still **capable** of having sex anymore, not to mention if she would actually want to.\n\n{{champion:112}} He is a scientist trying to improve humanity as a whole. Nothing in his story shows any hint that he might have any sexual desires. I could imagine him being the type who just wants to sit in his lab and research, not getting disturbed by sexual desires at al.\n\n{{champion:133}} She is a scout in the lands of Noxus and actually spends most of her time with her bird companion Valor. I can see her as someone who is purely driven by duty and doesn't have any sexual interests. Nothing about her story, quotes, or anything shows that she has any sexuality currently either.\n\nSee, I just think picking champions which are not already intertwined with sexuality would be a better representation for asexuality. Because it would feel less forced. If you turn Nidalee into an asexual, then I think there could happen what you probably fear, too. People will complain, since they are changing Nidalee from being connected to sex to be completely unconnected to sex.\n\nMeanwhile these other champions.... if Riot would tell me now that they are asexual, then I could just think \"Yeah, I can see that. In their story they could always have been asexual and we just didn't know, now they just have chosen to **show** this detail about their personality that was always there, but hidden\".","replies":[{"poster":"AQA473","date":"2019-09-21T19:39:03.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jihn's still bad, to me. I don't really think it matters how popular a character is? And Nid is definitely high profile, if that's something we're discussing. But, if anything, Jihn being a fan favorite is worse because that means a lot of people like this serial killer, know what he is, and now have _that_ as their analogue for asexuality. \"Yeah, asexuals are totally psychopathic. Makes sense.\" I wholeheartedly disagree that a champion's popularity determines whether or not they're a good model for _any_ kind of representation.\n\nOrianna certainly seems interested in the opposite-programmed sex in her lore update. I totally agree with you that she could have been ace, but Riot clearly didn't think so. Aside from that, a person's inability to have sex does not make them asexual, and vice versa, and that's sort of a damaging archetype to have.\n\nYour argument for why Viktor would be good ace rep is the argument of \"workaholics are so productive because they're ace,\" which is an actual stereotype ace people deal with. Plenty of workaholics are allo. A person being driven or obsessed or determined or productive is not dependent on their sexuality or lack thereof. For that reason, I think Viktor is a poor choice. Not that it's impossible, just that it's unnecessary.\n\nThat said, ace people don't really dedicate time to pursuing or even thinking about sexual encounters so that could certainly make them better at the things they value. For _this_ reason, Quinn is the best example you have. She isn't a workaholic, exactly, and is specifically driven because of the tragedies she's suffered in her life. She cares deeply for her country but knows how to pace herself. She's realistic and feels more like an everyman. However, she still doesn't work because Riot doesn't think she does. She has one of the Heartseeker skins, likely because she's hot and shoots arrows, but that still feels like a really fu#king weird skin to give an ace person.\n\nAll this to say that Nidalee's past sexualization, her seeming role as sex icon of League of Legends, is _precisely_ why I think she would be great ace/aro rep. She's an actual good person, doesn't have a Heartseeker skin, is due for a visual update because of her summoner-targeted lines, and would most certainly be de-sexualized across the board during that update. But, I'm sure she'd still be quite sexy and attractive. Making her ace would be a wonderful reversal of expectations and stereotypes. I explain all this at the end of my post but I will reiterate as many times as necessary. Her being sexual in her original version is _why_ I think she would be a great ace character in an updated version.\n\nAnd for all the people who would cry about her mating lines and sh1t, they can f#ck right off.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2019-09-21T05:24:47.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I am not at my computer right now and don't have time to double check myself as I should, but isn't Evelynn already what you want?\n\nEvelynn is canonically a virgin, I believe because she has no sexual or romantic interest in people and that is a reversal of expectations.\n\nDidn't give your post full attention due to lack of time but I think that was the gist of it.","replies":[{"poster":"AQA473","date":"2019-09-21T05:32:34.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, um, thank you for commenting and giving me your time, it's greatly appreciated, but I must ask you to read the whole post before reattempting to discuss it.

Your closing paragraphs say that Nidalee is a good choice because she has been in the game for a long time and is considered to be sexualized but doesn't act that way in the lore.\n\nEvelynn is ace/aro. She uses her sex appeal and charm magic to attract prey and feeds on their pain as she tortures them, but isn't interested in them sexually or romantically. She is also a character that has been in the game for a long time and is considered to be sexualized.\n\nYou say that your post \"is specifically to argue in favor of an asexual/aromantic reading of Nidalee\" and if it read that way I probably wouldn't have commented, but in the post itself you say \"a desire to see more representation in a game I love.\" That is why I see it as \"looking for\" something.

I mean, if you read the comments, Jihn's actually been confirmed ace/aro, but I told them why that's a problem and that still stands for Evelynn, if not moreso.\n\nEvelynn, unlike Jihn, was not confirmed ace/aro (to my knowledge, anyway). Like Jihn, she's a homicidal sociopath that feeds on the misery of others. Like, literally _feeds_. She eats sorrow. That's not very positive representation. It's like how all the villains in disney are qu#er coded. Look, gay people are evil! Look, asexuals are psychopathic serial killers! Get what I mean?\n\nAnd I really should removed the \"Nid should be first ace/aro\" champ since she apparently isn't. My desire to make this discussion thread was because I wanted Nidalee specifically to be ace/aro, but then I started to pull out all the lines I use in academic essays. It works most of the time. But I can see how that message got lost along the way.\n\nRegardless, I do want Nidalee specifcally to be ace/aro, Evelynn is evil and is therefore horrible rep especially if the only ace rep are two serial killers, and even if none of that were true, what's wrong with **one more** ace/aro character? There's 582359385 cishet champs and side characters in the league universe. What's three or five or seven asexual champions? The more there are, the more varied their rep can be. Like having two killers, for instance. That's fine if there's some good guy asexuals to balance it out.\n\nIn this sense, there is no \"you already have that thing.\" Because it's not a check mark. It's not like \"alright we got our asexual in the game, NEXT.\" This is a process of inclusion and visibility. The more there are, the more varied forms of representation, such as ethnicity and gender expression and sexuality, the better. There isn't some invisible quota. This has to keep going. And my argument above specifically pertains to Nidalee, who I honest-to-god view as ace/aro.
