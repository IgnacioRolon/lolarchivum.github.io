Lol...\n\nBecause people who actually know how to play him aren't?\n\nIn challenger tier (ALL challenger tiers) he's picked the most. As in, out of every single champion in the game Lee Sin is picked the most often. Also, in Challenger he has a 53.37% win rate.\n\nGuess what, some champions suck in Bronze. Doesn't mean they aren't overpowered, just means they have a higher skillcap.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Psi21","date":"2015-01-06T15:15:52.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A tank should not be locked down by a kick that kicks him out of the mess.
