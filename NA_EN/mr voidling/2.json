His hand is corrupted, not entire arm, and hidden from people with bandages; his hand allows him to cast dark magic.\nHe is a scavenger as his title implies. Being rejected by his society and all thereafter, due to his deformed demonic hand, he took up scavenging as a way of living; trading stolen or lost goods for the necessities of life. Typically he functioned like a vulture, prying loot from corpses, but he also doubled as a great thief and pickpocket in his leisure time. He went from city to city, nation to nation, island to island, all in order to find somewhere he could have residence and secure a job. This all amounted to nothing, his dark magic and unholy hand brought only scorn upon him, however he gained a very wide array of knowledge and sharpened his skills; later he used these abilities to orchestrate a group of like-minded people, cast outs bitter at society for betraying them. Setting up shop near very popular roads and trails, his group of bandits ambushed traders and the like. These actions left fear in all who traveled, and gave him the moniker of Unholy Scavenger.\n\n**Abilities:**\n\n>Passive: Looting\nStanding over a dead champion's body for 2 seconds grants him permanent bonuses. Strength of the bonus is dependent on his level(1,6,11,16).\nHP: 10/15/20/25\nMP: 10/15/20/25\nAD/AP: 1/1.5/2/3\nAR: 1/1.5/2/3\nMR: 1/1.5/2/3\nMS: 1/1/1/1\n\n**_&quot;Beggars can&#039;t be choosers&quot;_**\n**_&quot;Let&#039;s hope this doesn&#039;t break&quot;_**\n**_&quot;No way!

Really slow moving projectile that deals less damage the longer it lasts and slowly gets faster. Deals 14/13/12/11/10% less damage per second, disappearing after 6/7/8/9/10 seconds. Moves at 150 movement speed and increasing by 50 every second. Deals 80/130/180/230/280+(100% Ability Power) magic damage to the target and half damage to enemies hit along the way. Stuns the target for 1 second if more than half the duration has elapsed.\n\n**_&quot;Seek and destroy&quot;_**\n**_&quot;Don&#039;t play hard to get&quot;_**\n\n>E: Faulty Wares | CD 22/21.5/21/20.5/20 | Cost 75 | Range 400\nActive:\nDisable all uniques on the items of an enemy champion for 3.5/4/4.5/5/5.5 seconds, during this time basic attacks against the target will grant an additional 5 gold.\n\n>Passive:\nGain 5/7.5/10/12.5/15 Lethality and Magic Pen.\n\n**_&quot;What you thought the warranty covered that?&quot;_**\n**_&quot;So cheap, must&#039;ve been made in Ionia&quot;_**\n\n>R: Pillage and Sunder | CD 200/160/120 | Cost 100/130/160 | Range 250\nImpales a target with his glaive and then charges magic into his claws and explodes it. Deals 100/140/180+(100% Attack Damage) physical damage initially and then deals 100/140/180+(75% Ability Power) magic damage in the area(about brand flame size) after 1.5 seconds. Target is suppressed during this time.\n\n**_&quot;You really need to blow up a little&quot;_** when used on Zoe, Jinx, Nunu, or Annie.\n**_&quot;Time to embrace the darkness!&quot;_**\n**_&quot;I wonder what you&#039;re hiding in here!&quot;_**\n\n\n>STATS\nHP|560+50\nH5|6+.6\nMP|340+20\nMP5|6.2+.7\nAD|55+3.0\nAS|.68+3.5\nAR|26+2.5\nMR|32+0.5\nMS|330\nRG|150\n\nBasically he is a thief/mage hybrid, and offers a new mechanic.\nJust about ALL new champions add a new mechanic to League, it is what makes them unique and what actually ADDS quality to the game.\nGame-play he will be ALL over the map. Once a champion gets low or dies, he runs over to try and get their goods before respawn. While still needing to keep his jungle camps in check. Or whatever lane he is in.\nVO-wise he has interest in champions who are alone or misunderstood, feeling a connection.\n\nHow does the scaling work?\nAbout 30-40 bonuses per game, averaged at lvl 11 for 600-800, 60-80, and 30-40. With lower base stat scaling than most champs.\n\nEnd game you'll probably be at: [vs Nasus]\nHP|1,410+800(2,210)[2,091]\nMP|680+800(1,480)[1,039]\nAD|106+40(146)[126.5]\nAS|1.08[1.00]\nAR|68.5+40(108.5)[93.5]\nMR|40.5+40(80.5)[53.3]\nMS|330+40(370)[350]\n\nLvl 1: [vs Nasus]\nHP|560[561]\nMP|340[325]\nAD|55[67]\nAS|0.68[0.63]\nAR|26[34]\nMR|32[32]\nMS|330[350]\n\nWhat about stopping items from working?\nJust uniques, no base stats go away. You can lose crit gained from IE and ap gained from Rab/Seraph, but not much else, Banshee still blocks. The mana gain isn&#039;t unique so no harm there. Stops active items, but isn&#039;t a long silence or eternal stun(Morgana), so feel lucky that you can still move/use abilities/summoner spells.\n\n***\nCheck out my other champions here:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ymj1MEPc-all-my-champion-concepts","replies":[{"poster":"Snowbrand","date":"2018-12-03T21:28:26.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe change the passive to something like this: \n\nPassive: Looting\nStanding over a dead enemy champion's body for 2 seconds grants him a temporary (1 min) bonus, only one bonus can be kept at any time but it can be switched to another bonus if he finds another dead body, which he can view on their body prior to looting(Like Zoe W).
