Future concepts will just come as they may from now on. Heck, I might throw some ideas at other people now xD\nI will also start a new page for listing new concepts, as 20 is already a long list to go through.\n\nFigured I'd just post him today and take a break tomorrow, so... Eh, not much difference.\n\n***\n\nArt is not created by me, check out the artist yourself.\nhttps://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/bd004519-bfc3-44cc-bee4-024a11a1e1f8/dbe87sm-b8bb5234-33a0-471a-bfa2-7be8f1c631d6.jpg\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/petemohrbacher\n\n**Kra'Abrul**, Guardian of the Seas\n\n>Kra'Abrul is known by many as a sailor's tale, a myth of a creature bringing the lost safely to shore, or wreaking havoc on large fishing boats. Some swear it the truth, others are skeptical and mostly mock those who believe due to their lack of evidence.\n\n>When not saving sailors or the marine life Kra'Abrul spends most of his time in ship wrecks reading books that sank within the vessel.\n\n>Long ago, about 3,500 years in the past, Kra'Abrul was known as Eithis, but was cast out from amongst the stars. Incurring the wrath of his fellow aspects due to his unethical methods and views, he was sentenced to spend the reminder of his existence in the farthest depths of the ocean unless he could recenter his self and prove his valor once again. Losing his mantle of aspect he was stripped of his name and form, and a curse was placed on Eithis that twisted him into a horrible monster which they then bequeathed the name \"Kra'Abrul\"; directly translated Kra'Abrul means \"creature of hate\" or \"creature of scorn\".\n\n>Once he was in the waters away from his beloved sky, he grew increasingly angry and took out his frustrations on travelers and anything else around him, bitter at the apparent betrayal against him. And the legend of the Mad Typhoon was born, as his wrath knew no bounds and he often made his best attempts to reach the mountain he was cast from with his powers, harming all in his path.\n\n>2,000 years later his anger had finally faded, and he visited all the ships he sank, feeling remorse for what he had caused. This was not who he had wanted to be, and he was not going to be a prisoner to his anger any longer. Searching and reading scripts and books in the wreckages he found meaning in the life around him, and he made a vow to be a better being than he ever was before, to truly reclaim his seat among the stars.\n\n>Another 1,000 years had passed, during this time Kra'Abrul was working on reaching greater heights until he managed to bare leaving the waters and set foot on shore, and this was the day which he managed to touch the warm sand. Every day from then on he checked to see how far inland he could go, marking his worthiness and personal growth along the way.\nHe went from crawling around on six limbs furiously attacking his surroundings, to now standing on two limbs in a refined manner with two other limbs crossed as though meditating; and now he protects his surroundings with purpose. Slowly proving that despite circumstances anything can be overcome, and lessons always learned.\n\n>500 years have passed since stepping foot on dry ground, and he is almost to the peak of Targon once more.\n\n\n***\n\n**Abilities**\n\n***\n\n>**Passive: Deep Carapace**\nEvery point of bonus AR(Armor) grants Kra'Abrul 0.5 bonus AP(Ability Power).\nDue to his crab-like nature slow effects are 40% stronger(50% = 70%) against Kra'Abrul.\n\n>Passive: Wet Shell\nCasting Kra'Abrul's abilities involving water and being in the river both make him Wet which persists for 1.5 seconds upon leaving or ending an ability. Kra'Abrul gains +10-15% movement speed and +10-20% Armor while Wet.\n\n***\n\n>**Q: Chela | CD 9/8.5/8/7.5/7 | Cost 35/40/45/50/55 | Range 250**\nKra'Abrul unwraps his front legs and uses them like pincers, pulling enemies toward him.\nDeals 40/65/90/115/140+(40% Ability Power, 80% AR) Physical damage.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/qwbnS4o\n\n***\n\n>**W: Tidal Surf | CD 14/13.5/13/12.5/12 | Cost 60/65/70/75/80 | Range 350 | Radius 175**\nKra'Abrul calls a wave from 150 units behind him that rushes forward 500 units, slowing all units hit by 25% for 1.5 seconds and dealing 30/50/70/90/110+(35% AP) magic damage to units hit, increased to 200% damage on minions and monsters. Recast while Kra'Abrul is within 125 units to ride the wave.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/JQHm42C\n\n***\n\n>**E: Submerge | CD 28/26/24/22/20 | Cost 80 | Range 400**\nKra'Abrul drops into the ground after 0.5 seconds, splashing water around, and emerges 0.5 seconds later from the ground in a nearby area.\nEmerging deals 80/110/140/170\\200+(70% AP, 30% AR) magic damage in a 175 unit area and taunts all enemies hit for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds.\nRange is decreased by 50% while slowed.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/6vc0K4q\n\n***\n\n>**R: Typhoon | CD 210/170/130 | Cost 150 | Radius 700/750/800 |**\nKra'Abrul spits water into the air and causes an area around him to rain down water for 10 seconds.\nWhile in the Typhoon he heals for 2/3/4%+(1% AP) of his max health each second.\nEnemies in the Typhoon take 1/1.5/2%+(0.5% AP) of their max health as magic damage every second.\nThese effects are canceled while in bushes.\n\n>Passive: Water Works\nBeing wet now enhances Kra'Abrul's basic abilities.\n\n>Q: +15/20/25% damage and applies 0.25/0.5/0.75 second stun.\nW: +40/50/60% larger wave and distance traveled, and 30/35/40% slow on enemies hit for 1.75/2/2.25 seconds.\nE: Cooldown reduced by 40/55/70%, delay reduced by 50/65/80%.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/Jcx1sMA\n\n***\n\n>STATS\nHP|640+72\nH5|7+.6\nMP|300+25\nMP5|6.5+.6\nAD|64+4\nAS|.62+3.5\nAR|30+2.5\nMR|20+1.25\nMS|330\nRG|150\n\n***\nHow does he work?\nHe is intended as a jungler or top laner. Might be able to support decently.\nLots of area control and mobility, but weak against mages and cc. And has high mana costs given his mana pool.\nBuilding items like Zhonya, Sunfire, Liandry, and Spirit Visage or Abyssal are good choices. Trying to find a balance between AR and AP items is difficult, so generally you'll end up choosing one path over the other depending on the game. If you go Armor route you will want something like Iceborn Gauntlet to help with mana problems, and if you go AP you'll likely want to get ROA to help with both mana and tank problems.\n\nE is essentially a delayed mini teleport, like a LeBlanc without the safety back, but can go around things like Veigar wall.\nW collides with walls.\nQ cannot pull units over walls.\nR is VERY deadly, but in a much more subtle way. When paired with Liandry's and Rylai's it can deal about 95% of a target's max life over 10 seconds(100% with 10% increase on Rylai's), reduced by magic resist of course. Typically only yielding around 60-50% over the 10 seconds, but that is still a huge amount of damage in a huge area. Given, it is completely cancelled while they are inside a bush, so you'll have to bait them out or pull them out yourself.\n\nFor reference 725 units is Janna R size, and 750 is Trundle W size, so 800 units AOE might be unmatched(Not counting ASol).\n\n***\nCheck out my other champions here:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ymj1MEPc-all-my-champion-concepts","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2018-12-26T07:06:54.446+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That lore was _amazing_. I could honestly take that for an officially released champion's lore. \n\n I think it's refreshing to have a champion who's somewhat refined and intelligent like Azir, so many champions are edgy and cool _just_ for the sake of being edgy and cool. You also did a great job showing character growth, having Kra'Abrul learn of his mistakes and work to become a better being was really interesting and it's something I'd like to see more of in the future. \n\n Great work!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chikaku","date":"2018-12-26T20:35:11.427+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marvelous concept, as expected from you Void.

Even for a fallen Aspect, its a bit too different from the rest of them.\n\nLeona, Diana, Pantheon, Zoe, Taric, and... Kra'Abrul.\n\nYou could try the Riot way of naming champions, which varies from person to person but its basically looking at the champions and culture from the region you champion is going to be from and going from there. For example, one of my champion concepts is from Zaun, so I looked at all the Zaunite champions to see the similarities in their names. That eventually lead me to naming him Zircon, as it sounds hard like most of the other Zaunite names, while also being a bit soft like Janna. He's a doctor/medic so I wanted his name to be professional sounding, not too harsh but not too gentle.\n\nThe thing with Targon is that a lot of its names are gentle and not too harsh. There's not a lot of Ks or hard Cs in the names. However, I suppose the harshness in his name could be excused via his lore. Perhaps the other Aspects cursed him with a harsh sounding name to show his betrayal and what not, making him sound more like a monster than a celestial being of power. This could also explain his appearance, which is also more Shuriman than Targonian, as he embodies an animal avatar like an Ascended. Perhaps he was cursed with the name and body of a monster, and he has to earn back his true name and appearance.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2018-12-26T18:58:06.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...I'ma just go with that xD I mean, might as well go all out with his exile from the Aspects. Given \"Taric\" isn't necessarily gentle, and has a K sound, but regardless.

The only one in SR right now, in fact, is {{item:3157}} (and of course the Ornn buffed one). So in building more armor to benefit from his passive, he's already going to be losing a fair amount of his damage. If your purpose in the passive upgrade on his ult was to have him deal more damage, I'd just say \"All of Kra'Abrul's abilities (other than this one) deal 30% more damage when empowered.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Voidling","date":"2018-12-28T03:22:18.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the healing gets to be close to 90% over 10 seconds with a full Armor build. I did check out all his stats. 140% heal with full AP build.\nThe armor increase is just another way to boost him up when building armor, you know adding more AP value to a full Armor build, since as stated AR + AP items don't mix much. And certain keystones deal damage based off of AP ratio etc. Though I might adjust ratios to add more AR ratios or something.\n\nIt's not very complicated, when wet you get bonus armor and less magic resist(not only through R, it is a passive effect you gain), and R heals/damages. The only other thing is it changing the abilities slightly, but that is in the descriptions of the abilities, not R. I guess I could rework it into giving a different boost...

To me, at least, its not rewarding  to point why do i  even have that. If you cast ulti when you are on cooldown, because reasons, you pretty much cant use your augumented abilities. If you have your abilities augumented while you are wet. It would be still situational but usable.\n\nYour W - Tidal surf has range 350. There would not be an issue if you could not ride on it. Because if the wave is fast enough, there will be a really small window to actualy make a second cast to ride it. I know it can increased by Monsoon but still.
