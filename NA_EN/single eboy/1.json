If his experience is ANYTHING like mine since the last patch.. Your unable to play whatsoever.. packet loss can be upwards of 40%.. You can't play like that and none of your \"common\" solutions work","replies":[{"poster":"husktoucher","date":"2016-05-13T04:21:32.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind, if none of the \"common\" solutions work, it's a good indication the problem is coming from poor routing or problematic nodes along your route to the game servers. Nothing Riot has done with patches or Peering could have caused this. You'll want to reach out to your ISP and ask they look into your route from your home to the League servers and find the issue. Alternatively, you can reach out to Riot Support and request them to take a look at your network setup (first be sure to already be on optimal settings as per the connection KB) then they can have you run some traceroutes to see exactly where the packet loss is happening. \n\nKeep in mind, the solution here is your ISP's investigating and resolving the issue on their end.
