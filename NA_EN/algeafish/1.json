I'm certainly no expert, but I'll do by best at offering some insight. \n\nFrom what I understand, if the matchmaking system expects you to win a match and you win, you'll get less LP than if the system had expected you to lose and you won. Additionally, winning streaks can affect how much LP you'll gain for each win along the way.\n\nI strongly recommend checking out our [Ranked Play FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ) for a complete rundown on the system. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"AlgeaFish","date":"2016-12-04T19:20:33.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the run down that makes more sense.","replies":[]}]}]}
