I figured I would go and submit a ticket to riots support page but they keep asking me to verify my email but they never send the verification email. This all happened right after I bought a new skin and then I read that they have a problem with credit cards. I'm really annoyed that I can't even get help from riot on this issue and now worried that my credit card may be compromised. If a rioter sees this please respond I could use a hand and don't really now where else to go. Also I have redownloaded the game and used the repair tool in the client neither of which has worked to resolve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-06-09T23:32:25.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure we can help with that!  I re-sent the verification e-mail just in case, so be on the lookout for that (make sure to chem spam folders!)\n\nAs to the issue you're seeing after champ select: are you hearing game sounds in the background with a black screen, or does the loading screen not pop up at all?  This will give us a better idea as to whether or not it's a connection issue or a software/hardware issue.\n\nSince you mentioned it, also wanted to say that your credit card should be fine.  The error earlier in the day was from a back-end networking outage, not a security incident.  If you see any problems though, let us know of course!","replies":[{"poster":"cupcake0069","date":"2016-06-14T19:50:15.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey so I fIgured I would wait for the next patch to come out and now that it has I am still having this same problem. I really don't know whats going on and have tried all that I could think of to fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-06-14T22:33:33.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Sorry for not getting back to you on this, I apparently missed the update notification :( \n\nIn terms of the e-mail verification, I'd try using a different e-mail provider to see if there may be an issue with your e-mail.\n\nAs to the champ select issue, it's starting to sound more like a connection issue.  In the case of a black screen, it usually means that you're failing to connect to the game servers.  Best first step is to follow the steps in the [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide which should help to rule out the most common causes of connection issues.  \n\nLet me know if it fixes the problem or not!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"cupcake0069","date":"2016-06-09T23:50:52.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly thanks for the response. As for the champ select problem the entire game just fails to load no sound or anything also I do not get the failure to connect error message which usually pops up. Unfortunately I still did not receive the email in my main inbox or my spam folder.","replies":[]}]}]}
