I was level 58, 98 exp short of 59.  I Played in an ARAM game and won, getting 113 exp.  when I get to the game over lobby, even though the screen said I had gotten 113 exp, the game gave me 226 (I was 128 exp towards 60, not 15 like I would have been if I had just received 113 exp).  Also, I never received a loot capsule, or any notification that I had hit 59, although in my profile it says that I am now 59. No loot makes me sad.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Somehow the game screwed up and gave me a double win, but didn't credit me for hitting level 59.  Hopefully support answers my query.","replies":[{"poster":"fuzzyturret2","date":"2018-01-16T00:49:42.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Resolved, support just got back to me and gave me a capsule.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T02:31:08.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweetness!
