I've told them the same thing: it is probably a spam website and I wouldn't trust it.\r\n\r\nI'm not the tech-savviest person in the world, but I did a WhoIs search and found that both league of legends (dot) com and riot (dot) com share the same registered owner, where as riot promotions (dot) com has a private registrar. Very unlikely that a company would register a domain name (in august of this year) and not use the same information/service as before. \r\n\r\nThe URL is also kind of a giveaway - Riot doesn't refer to it as \"Christmas\", it is \"Snowdown.\" And going to riotpromotions.com doesn't give you a list of \"promotions\" but some kind of default website you'd expect from a registrar. I'm asking solely because my friends insist it is legit, and I need confirmation from a Red before I'll believe them.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamat","date":"2014-12-18T04:44:54.588+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":2,"body":"**This is a scam**.

This is something that should actually be on the main game page and that fact you got banned for doing something that everyone wasn't even sure of is just plain stupid. As hateful as your comment was, I just have to say, I agree on this. Sorry Riot but you fucked up on this one, if you clearly could post this on the main game page, many people could of stopped posting the links. You say the links will be gone soon but that doesn't stop how many people are clueless of the situation. If you did anything, you shouldn't ban people for your own faults, we take our responsibility as well for fucking up. We didn't look up a thread before clicking it, but who would when the first words you hear are \"free RP\". Even if you don't do such of the events, people always still have that little spec of hope you do. If you can please just do us all a favor and put it on the main game page, that would be really nice. I love you guys Riot, but truly this situation needs work on. Shouldn't have to ban people over something that they didn't know and were clueless of.
