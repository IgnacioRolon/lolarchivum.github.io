Usually when this happens I could fix by alt+tabbing out and in and League would grab on to the mouse again.  Any time I try to drag my mouse to the right side of the screen, instead of scrolling to the right, the mouse leaves the window instead.  I've tried full screen, windowed, and borderless modes, pressed F9 on and off, and I can't seem to find a setting within the options that governs this behaviour (I used to think there was an option for this and perhaps it was turned off by accident).  Does anyone have any idea how to remedy this?","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Mobus","date":"2016-12-23T06:54:25.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ended up fixing this by re-installing League.  I don't know what was the real cause of this, if it was due to the League update, or the OS/WINE update (Arch Linux), but in any case a fresh install has the mouse working the way it should.\n\nWould be really nice of you guys to put out a native client for my OS though.  I love this game and will continue to support it, but I always hear Dota 2 in the background trying to entice me with its native support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T19:39:37.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strange that your mouse is running off like that, and you've already tried steps I would have suggested.
