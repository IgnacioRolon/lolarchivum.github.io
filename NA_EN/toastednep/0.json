I've looked into it and it's all by interpretation from the terms of service so I was just wondering if someone would be able to give a straight forward answer to whether or not I'll get in trouble for hanging up some splash art on my wall. No redistribution and no claiming it was my work. Any help would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2019-08-25T02:39:01.361+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... as far as i remember, the \"Legal Jibber Jabber\" (its literally called like that) says that its okay as long as you dont use their official logos or sell the thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2019-08-25T03:06:48.264+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ebonmaw Dragon,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=2tws9JXE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-25T02:39:01.361+0000)\n>\n> Well... as far as i remember, the \"Legal Jibber Jabber\" (its literally called like that) says that its okay as long as you dont use their official logos or sell the thing.\n\nEbonmaw remembered the name right :D\n\nhttps://www.riotgames.com/en/legal","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToastedNep","date":"2019-08-25T03:58:27.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh cool thanks a ton!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KestrelGirl","date":"2019-08-25T01:09:57.440+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not making money off it or claiming it so I'd think it would be entirely legal, but I'll let a Rioter give official word.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2019-08-25T03:02:44.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fine.
