I was sitting in lane waitingfor it to reconnect for about 2 minutes until i attempted to leave the game then reconnect. When I left, it didn't give me the option to rejoin it was just the main page. So I checked my match history and there was nothing! I started up another game and I have no leaverbuster. Can someone explain wtf just happened?\n\nEdit: Coincidentally it was the last game in my promo series, but the game I started after to check for leaverbuster I won and got promoted.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-29T00:30:03.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh sounds like that game must have crashed entirely from the server. It's not all that common, but when it does happen it has these symptoms. You're able to re-queue immediately since the client can't find a game to reconnect to, nobody will get any penalties, and the game simply doesn't exist anymore!","replies":[{"poster":"brandonf131","date":"2017-09-01T18:43:55.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
