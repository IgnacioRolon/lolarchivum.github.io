But then I see the shit he's doing in the pentakill music video and idk what to think of it. Like, he's literally hitting rocks... and ok? I guess... in the lore it does say he just loves hitting stuff but come on, really? Rocks? Just plain rocks? You're telling me that in all the time that the Pentakill members performed, killed each other, and resurrected again they never considered that it might be a good idea for Olaf to be hitting something at least vaguely similar to a drumset?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-05T03:02:40.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean.....they are in a *ROCK* band......\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-05T03:33:11.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I mean.....they are in a *ROCK* band......\n\nI completely (p)understand what you're saying. Quite punny indeed. Olaf's quite brutal in the music video with the way he pun-ishes those rocks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-05T03:40:17.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh mY GLOB YOU DID NOT JUST OUT PUN ME GOOD SIR!!!!!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-05T03:42:27.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, captain.
