I've tried installing the PBE client 2 times now, both got to around half way and the servers shut down for maintenance, and when they come back up, I have to start the entire thing over. =( and let me tell ya, when the best net in my are is around 700kb/s Its a struggle, IMO it should pick back up where it left off or have a save point in there somewhere unless my stuff is just messed up or I'm a monkey and doing it wrong lol and hey if i am, let me know..

Maintenance should not impact your progress, though.  It sounds like there might be a more underlying connection issues struggling to grab updates, so just in case I recommend running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your connection runs smoothly.
