So what do you want to see? {{champion:19}} \r\n\r\nFor me the things that are iconic to Warwick are attacking fast, built in life-steal/drain and the Blood Scent passive.\r\n\r\nBlood Scent in particular is something that I think needs to stay. It is a fairly unique mechanic, unlike the rest of his kit, and I find it very satisfying when it triggers. Especially when it spots a wounded enemy that my teammate was trying to chase and I get to rush in and finish them off. It just really suits the kind of thing that a Warewolf should be doing.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think he could work really well as a Juggernaut, but keeping him as a Diver like he is now is also fine. I don&#039;t think it makes any sense to turn him into a Tank like Sion or Poppy.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? {{champion:19}}","replies":[{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2016-11-24T06:51:45.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keeping him as a Diver would be nice, along with giving him some short range mobility.
