He&#039;s one of the older champions too, so the amount of skins that he has for a six year period is pathetic, yet when I see champs like Katarina have way more and is now getting another skin!!!

Sand animations on djinn?); b) interesting concepts/ ideas that did not end up being as cool as they could have been (djinn's skin is kind of bland, overlord could probably be more epic looking); c) old models and old art.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-15T23:00:07.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing at the moment.

But I wonder: shouldn't the visual effects of his new passive put him at a higher priority than usual for a visual update? There are many champion skins that do need updating, true, but not all of them got screwed by a new, recent effect, right? For most of them, you can still enjoy their old skins, no matter how limited they are, but playing with a pink vizier malzahar or a pink prince malzahar is just not what you bought them for. Couldn't this additional hurdle justify making him a higher priority than your average \"old champion\" that do not have this problem?\n\nAnyways, thanks for the answer.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-18T18:20:05.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bit out of my realm in terms of expertise - I don't work on Champion Update, so I don't have a ton of context into what's getting updated and why, or what the priority of content should be. \n\nFrom what I understand, the updated are based around what the skin originally had. So, if it had base particles, it would still use base particles. If the skin had new particles, we would give them a new particle that was cohesive with the thematic of the skin.  Of course, the exception here would be large updates, such as Poppy where entire champion changes, and warrants an entire new kit.","replies":[{"poster":"AsheGetsGanked","date":"2016-07-18T22:00:04.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding to my post here and all that.
