I just got myself a 4k 60hz TV. All is fine and dandy excepting this glitch. The glitch only shows up in Full Screen or Borderless, and the game is fine in windowed mode.\r\n\r\nHere's the dealio:\r\n\r\nEvery time I Alt+Click the screen, you can see that it stretches and the colours change. I also tried holding down the click and it persists until I release the click.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help it would be appreciated. I'm not a big fan of the big white window bar at the top of my screen while playing.\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Enfae","date":"2016-12-27T18:46:16.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"REQUEST #24851609 :) Thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-27T17:41:52.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"4K is not currently supported and can cause issues, though this visual issue seems pretty severe.
