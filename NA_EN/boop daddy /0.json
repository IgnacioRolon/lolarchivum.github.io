{"poster":"Boop Daddy ","date":"2017-01-21T23:26:43.561+0000","title":"A slight variation on Aurelion Sol's Kit","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This one is in gameplay because the Malz one got deleted in C&amp;C\n\nAnywho, A.Sol is incredibly dull to play so this is an attempt at making it better. \n\nPassive: Stardust: Sol leaves a trail of burning solar material that lingers for 4 seconds, after which, becomes inactive. Always visible until Sol expends the stardust. Not visible through FoW when inactive. \n\nQ: Starforge: Send a unit of stardust out in an aoe to become a star. Size and damage increases the longer it incubates, up to a cap. If detonated without Universal Expansion, the star leaves behind Stardust.  If incubated after 4 seconds and with UE, the star collapses into a blackhole,  trapping the enemy in its aoe for two seconds. If an enemy leaves the trap, cannot be retrapped for ten seconds. Max two star units. Stars Deal DoT until detonated while Blackholes deal no damage unless detonated.  Stars can affect each other: A black hole will siphon a star, dealing damage between the two units; either can orbit each other or bend each other&#039;s projectile path. \n\nW:Universal Expansion: Gather surrounding stardust to empower your next spell and gain increased movement speed, immunity to cc and  terrain collision for three seconds. Does not cleanse CC. ( Vacuums Stardust in a large area around Sol).\n\nE: Comet of Legend: Sol shoots comets in a straight line that slow enemies on impact. Comets can orbit stars and blackholes and their projectile path is affected by them. Can orbit only twice before being destroyed. If three comets connect, enemy is frozen in place. If stardust, Comets pass through, dealing more damage with their tails and can orbit six times. \n\nR: Duel the Sol: Sol forges a galaxy from his mouth, which deals loads of damage, and forces stars (and comets) to orbit it as it travels. \n\n\nBasic run down of play pattern: in lane, you nurse a star to deal continuous (and infinite) damage in a single spot, up to two stars (or blackhole). Ideally, you&#039;ll want to keep moving so you generate stardust, or keep exploding stars or both, so that by level 4~6, you can have your lane a mess of comets. The maximum diameter of a star is about Tibbers aoe, and the trap diameter of a blackhole is about Viktor stun/slow. You can essentially screw over ganks if you get a blackhole to orbit a star, since you can trap enemies in star damage for two seconds while they&#039;re being whipped all out of position (lol). In teamfights, you&#039;ll want to zone with preplacements to make key locations inaccessible, or lock down enemies with your ult followed up by Comets of Legend. \n\nAnywho, what you think? Too much, too little, etc?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-21T23:37:27.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally destroys his identity and makes him a balance nightmare. What is the point?\n\nHis kit has a very high skill floor and is rather unique, and definitely not for everyone. Riot is considering a few QoL changes to his kit that will make him easier to play without changing his playstyle significantly, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Boop Daddy ","date":"2017-01-21T23:40:33.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In what way does it destroy his identity? \n\n\"Aurelion Sol, the Star Forger.\" \n\nI can understand it being  balance nightmare, I'll give you that. But I think it would make him feel a lot more like a star forger than he does now. And tbh, QoL changes wont fix the snooze fest that is his passive/W.","replies":[]}]}]}
