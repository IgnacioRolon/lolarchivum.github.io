The color scheme of the concept we were shown is only really differentiated from Frejlord Taliyah by the skin tone. I personally don't mind either way if they make her skin tone match her base or not (I think Riot doesn't really utilize the potential of different skin tones for champion skins, there could be a lot more cute brown girls in the game if they did), I just want to know if they recognize the similarities in color scheme and have any plans to shake it up a bit. A great example could be SKT Syndra, who prominently features the color blue despite it not being a part of SKT's colors and not prominent in the other skins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2018-03-07T02:00:06.716+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey!
