In part because everything we write has to be localized, cast, and acted into 17+ languages worldwide before our release date!  \n\nSooo as VO has developed we've de-emphasis specific types of lines when they have less impact.   \"Buy_Item\" lines have (as someone noted) been replaced by \"kill_lines\" and some other things.  \n\nFocus group testing showed that most players were not really noticing this type of line. (you are the exception rather than the rule.)   Also changes to items or Item names can reign havoc on this catagory.  \n\nThis type of line will still exist and for some new champs/skins even be prioritized--- however for this skin I think the team viewed them as a low priority.","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2017-09-07T09:39:17.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A not-so-legendary legendary.

It would be really nice if you could hear shop lines while dead--I know it's a thing in Smite, at the very least.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2017-09-05T15:56:09.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She isn't a material girl, I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2017-09-06T19:09:30.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they spent all her quotes on kill lines.\n\nShe legitimately has like two minutes of kill lines.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nut on my Butt","date":"2017-09-05T20:11:11.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did they really not add them or are you just going by the interactions video?
