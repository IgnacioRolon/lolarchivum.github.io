But when you power cycle and still have several matches where multiple people are constantly dcing and hitting high latency, it is your servers. Maybe fix the problem? Cuz being reported for hitting high ping when I'm clearly not the only one dealing with it and being dc'd is just full on bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T04:38:43.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of factors at play that can affect your connectivity outside of your network hardware and our servers. If multiple players are disconnecting, it could be a regional ISP issue, an issue with a Backbone Provider (that multiple ISPs use) or it could be a gameserver being unstable. An easy test to uncover what's happening is to make use of a VPN such as [Hotspot Shield](https://www.hotspotshield.com/) or [Cyberghost](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/) to force reroute your connection to the servers. If anything changed at all, then the issue is likely in your route and not caused by the League servers. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
