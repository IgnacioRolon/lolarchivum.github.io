This ruins the game for me and my team and it's very annoying.\r\n\r\nThis is not to do with the internet. If I use a different computer (which I currently don't have access to, hence the problem) it works fine. Does anyone know what this could be? At all?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-15T18:12:27.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you are in queue to accept a game, the server needs to group everyone together.  You might be having a local network issue here that's causing you to lose sync, and it's interesting that you're able to make it through at all after that long.  You should go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your network and get this resolved.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Redname","date":"2016-12-16T01:50:11.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I gave these a shot but nothing really worked. If it helps, once again I'd say that my other computer runs perfectly, and this one is not nearly as good in terms of specs. In fact, it barely has them. There's also a lot of lag in the ranked solo queue; which is the flashiest. I tried disabling the animations or activating the 'low-specs' option, but neither of them changed anything.","replies":[]}]}]}
