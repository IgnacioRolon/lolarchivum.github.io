You just sabotaged your team, single-handedly delivering victory to the enemy\"\n\nThis is the issue with any shared buff effect / all unit effects. You need an additional effect to make it worth it, say like the travel speed boost for allies for Bard's tunnel. Normally, these changes aren't enough to really make a large effect. \n\nKindred has no differentiated effect on top of its base effect. I would believe if any changes are to be made, it would be adding this differentiated effect, and not a full rework of it.\n\nAs some simple options:\n\n1. The heal can be amplified for allies while remaining the same enemies\n2. Enemies also are nearsighted while within the area\n3. Enemies also gain a Thronmail like effect while damaging allies in the area, and only this damage will bring them below 10% threshold\n4. There are inverse threshold for allies (increase per rank) and lowing threshold for enemies (lowering per rank)\n5. Enemies gain a long term Grievous Wounds effect if they hit while at the threshold.","replies":[{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2017-10-19T18:56:12.077+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"the nearsighted effect alone would make it awesome: actually punishing ennemies who gets in it instead of giving them a clear advantage in 8/10 situations","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-10-20T02:09:01.286+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the changed heal amount is the only one that would be balanced and feel good to play with and against.  Nearsight would just suck to deal with.  You're punished currently if you aren't in the area (you're able to die), you shouldn't be directly punished for being in the area too.  Lose-lose situations are just unfun.\n\nThe thornmail idea is ok, but is basically just a knowledge check.  If they know what the ult does, it's the same as before.  If they don't know, the ult kills them on its own.\n\nThe inverse threshold thing is ok, but personally the heal change feels like it would feel better for both sides.\n\nGrevious Wounds would basically just be a harsher version of the heal change and also possibly destroy some champions (Vlad and Swain for instance) while leaving others relatively unaffected.  Perhaps a very short duration Grevious Wounds would work, to prevent them from healing back up to max instantly (from Redemption and stuff like Swain in Zhonya's).\n\nBasically I'd go with either the different heal values for allies and enemies or the grevious wounds for enemies, changed from long duration to short.  The other options are just to generally punishing and would likely result in the only counterplay being to run away rather than try to stay in there.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-10-20T03:57:43.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is being unable to dis a punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-10-20T04:20:39.191+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being unable to die is an advantage.

That's probably one of the more crucial functions it should've had from the beginning that it never did get.

When this distinction doesn't exist (between an ally and foe), any ability is a hit or miss and requires just the right circumstances to use it effectively.\n\nJust imagine a skillshot that can both hit your allies and enemies and deals the same amount of damage either way.

That's honestly a lot of time and he acted as a damage battery for his teammates, essentially making his entire team tankier by default. This was obviously a big problem as Maokai just rooted someone and then everyone swarmed around them, hardly even making a dent at trying to save their dying teammate.\n\nKidnred's ult only makes everyone invulnerable at 10% HP and stops all healing effects and lasts 3 seconds. It works for both enemies and allies alike. So giving her the ability to move the zone with her, where the fights is taking place, might prove a lot better usage wise as Kindred would then have the option to edge her ult just enough for her allies to be in it but not her enemies.\n\nThis is pretty much a big dance between good Kindreds and great Kindreds.","replies":[{"poster":"SirLapse","date":"2017-10-25T22:10:47.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently we have the option of fed Kindreds showing their skill via controlling their death and damaging the enemy enough to oneshot via E cast and prep. That's already amazingly hard to do for most players since they don't necessarily recognize when they are capable of doing this.\n\nWhen we involve Taric ultimate, IT DOES NOT BENEFIT THE ENEMY TEAM. It has a prep time due to this, but with Kindred's porposed ult here, all you need to do is run Flash and you can essentially hold the detonation timer of the enemy by witnessing what your teammates are doing. The opponent on the other hand is given no option to really counterplay if you are doing this under the scenarios of:\n1. They have no Flash or escapes. (So basically anything immobile without Flash.)\n2. They have no CC to stop you. This is already an issue with current Kindred ult that is only kept at bay because you cast it at the center and it cannot move. You are a ranged champion with dashes.\n3. They legit cannot move up without guaranteeing their own death. When you do a tower dive for example, Kindred and her allies have to risk taking a huge amount of shots and the timer for the ulti can be misplaced so that you'll still die to the tower in the end. By being able to move it, you essentially have a no risk tower dive scenario which Maokai was also popular for performing. Naturally melee champs wouldn't be able to abuse it with Kindred as easily, but then mid lane and bot lane are an assortment of ranged champs...\n\nOn paper already, none of this sounds balanced. Where is the justification of situations in-game that the opponent would capitalize on Kindred based on them being BAD rather than giving an ACTUAL OPTION to counterplay? That'd be no different than pre-rework Azir who was a balancing nightmare.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-10-20T04:01:59.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're buying time for your team to resume the team fight, so rework the ult into something that lowers the cds of all allies in the area by 3 sec at the end of the portion that her ult stalls for.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2017-10-19T19:27:19.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like her ult actually doesn't really make sense for her character.
