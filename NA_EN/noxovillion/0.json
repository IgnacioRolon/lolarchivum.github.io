Are you on a PC or Mac?  What happens if you change your video settings to Windowed or Borderless?  I ask because I'm not sure if this issue is specific with the game, or maybe some setting with your OS.  Just as a first step for now, see if resetting your config could help in case of any issues with your files causing problems.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know!","replies":[]}]}
