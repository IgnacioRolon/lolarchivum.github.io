Almost all of the remainder bandwagon around that. It&#039;s not because &quot;it&#039;s cool&quot; or &quot;it&#039;s entertainment&quot;. It&#039;s little more than a nicer version of the holocaust; those who do not conform should be removed. All of you let your ego prevent yourselves from having any perspective, empathy or ability to see things from any eyes other than your own, which are tunneled into whatever the hell you&#039;re focused on.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t simply &quot;being yourself in a different body&quot;. For most of you, this is &quot;being our honest selves because we can&#039;t get away with it in real life&quot;. I don&#039;t want to be the nasty person I could be. I&#039;d much rather die than become the asshole that several of you have become over reasons so fickle you have to wonder how much of the &quot;nice guy&quot; is an act. It&#039;s a process that will eventually infect me and I&#039;m not willing to let that happen.\r\n\r\nA lot of us come to the internet to find a safe haven. I used to have it here, but the corruption of nasty individuals combined with the mob mentality has made this place no better than my real life. At this point, it&#039;s no longer a safe haven, rather it has become a reiteration of previous real life problems and therefore is not a place I can be accepted as the imperfect human being I am.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t need to name anyone explicitly. You all know who you are and whether or not you fall under what I&#039;ve described. Don&#039;t bother trying to argue about my perception of things, because there&#039;s no way any of you can change it.\r\n\r\nI won&#039;t be posting again. I might read up, but I&#039;m not replying or creating any new posts.","replies":[]}
