When I got back, the game would load up normally, I got some audio hitching for a while, then it would completely crash my computer. Like totally crash it. It would freeze on whatever the last frame was, and nothing would happen; Ctr-Alt-Delete and Alt-Tab would do nothing.  I had to shut off the power manually to restart the computer. This is the only game this happens on. Black Ops 3, No man&#039;s sky, and Overwatch work just fine. Windows is updated fully, as is my GFX driver. My specs:\n\nIntel core i7 3 GHz\nNvidia GTX 960M\n16 GB RAM\n1 TB HDD (in case it somehow helps)\nWindows 10\n\nAnyone else having this bug, or any potential fixes would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: I tried different games to see if the same thing was happening. No Man's works fine, but I have the same problem with CS:GO as I do with league; It freezes on the last frame it was on just on the main menu. Maybe this problem has to do with multiplayer?","replies":[{"poster":"Patmygroin","date":"2016-08-18T15:58:58.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This same exact thing has been happening to me, since this morning when windows 10 updated itself.  As soon as i enter the game, within the first second it completely freezes to where i have to hold the power button.  Now i'm demoted and have a 30 minute leaver buster.  Pretty fucking mad to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T18:18:35.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the Game Bar didn't fix your issue, but we can take a few more steps to help!
