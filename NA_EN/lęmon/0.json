In games I am very positive or just quiet if there are trolls, so I have not been reported for anything like that. But, I understand that when you leave a game while you are still in 20 min waiting queue, you get blocked for 20 mins, this has happened 3 times. I am curious, will I get perm banned after this? or how many games will I have to leave to get perm banned. I do not plan on leaving games in the future, but it will encourage me more so if I know this information. tysm. {{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T04:50:11.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't end up getting a perma ban from the leaverbuster system.
