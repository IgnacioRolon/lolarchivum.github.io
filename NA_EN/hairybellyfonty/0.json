So like draft pick, you enter the queue with a first and second choice for a position. When the queue pops, you are placed in your spot and can pick any champ blind to the other team. No serial picks. No bans.\r\n\r\nThis would solve 90% of the problems in blind pick that start in the queue chat with \"I called top.\" \"No I called top.\" \"No I called top.\" \"No I called top.\" \"No I called top.\" \"No I called top.\" \"No I called top.\"\r\n\r\nResult: Nice quick entry into games without all the grief about who called what position.\r\n\r\nIt's easy, you already have all of the pieces. Just put them together in the right order.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T03:46:49.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyy that's not necessarily a bad idea!
