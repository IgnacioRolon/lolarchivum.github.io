Alot of people get fustrated with the leave buster system so do i. Some people have computer issues or an emergecy comes up. I think that people in the game should report afk players instead of the system punishing them. This way players who go afk will get punished if it they actually had an affect on the other players game. I understand that there could also be trolling like reporting a player for bieng afk or whatever but i figured riot could engineer a system where players will only get punished if they did leave. This means that a person could leave and not be punished if the teamates choose not to but if the player were to stay then trolls would still not be able to report them does that make sense? There should be a poll choose your side or write your own ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-20T19:44:24.015+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would make exactly zero difference, since your team is 100% guaranteed to report you for afk, even if it had no impact at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Chocobo Knight","date":"2016-09-21T18:35:00.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree.  That which you said is only true if you are playing in a solo set-up.  If the game is with friends, it's very possible they understand and don't want to report the player.  The current leaver system doesn't allow for that fact.  Like the OP states, there are times things go sideways and someone either needs to leave or is unable to play the game.  Reporting should be from the player's choice, not a machine's.","replies":[]}]}]}
