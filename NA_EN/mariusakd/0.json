To sum it up, it looks like there's an issue when trying to log back into the client while in a game.  \n\nIf you happen to crash out or run into this issue for some reason, [there is a workaround](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/Tb1fUZFV-known-issue-were-unable-to-log-you-in-because-you-may-be-offline) you can use:\n\n* Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n* Open \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" with notepad\n* Find the line:\n\n   gameflow-patcher-lock:\n\n\n* Delete this whole line\n* Save the file, restart your LoL Client - and you should be able to log in again.\n\nGetting a Leaverbuster for that sucks!  I can't make any guarantees, but hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as we like to look at each case individually.
