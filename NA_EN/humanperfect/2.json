No news since then.\n-The last change made to Yorick was 332 days ago, on April 3, 2014. He got his base armor increased by 4. This was also the same day that every single champion in League of Legends got their base armor increased by 4.\n-Yorick is the 4th least popular champion in Normal mode (as of the time of this writing), beating only Urgot, Zac, and Galio.\n-Yorick is the 7th least popular champion in Ranked Solo/Duo mode (as of the time of this writing), beating only Urgot, Zac, Galio, Kog'Maw, Singed, and Elise/Skarner (depending on if you're looking at daily, weekly, or monthly)\n-Since January 28, Yorick was picked 61,000 times in ranked games.\n-Since January 28, Graves was picked 1,559,000 times in ranked games.\n-Yorick really digs Graves.\n\nTaken from: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2xl8rh/fun_facts_about_yorick/\n\nSeriously.... Where the hell is the Yorick... **anything**?\n\nAt least Urgot sometimes get the completely meaningless \"buffs\" just so Riot can say \"hey we know these buffs do absolutely nothing but we have factual evidence that we still remember what an Urgot is\" in the patch notes and gets put into free champion rotations.","replies":[{"poster":"chipi99","date":"2015-03-02T17:42:47.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":41,"body":"He  has two skins....","replies":[{"poster":"HumanPerfect","date":"2015-03-02T17:49:32.706+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipi99,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HYiIYLYy,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-02T17:42:47.398+0000)\n>\n> He  has two skins....\n\n2009-2012, every champion released with 2 purchasable skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Learnding","date":"2015-03-02T22:35:13.584+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":26,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MetaI Gear,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HYiIYLYy,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-03-02T17:49:32.706+0000)\n>\n> 2009-2012, every champion released with 2 purchasable skins.\n\nRemember when Riot used to do that, then stopped because they gave some retarded ass excuse how it's not profitable and they didn't have the man hours to do it?  Remember when they just said 5 months ago they were planning on remaking an entire infrastructure for the east coast servers?  \nRemember when Riot said anything, then it actually be push through and also being the original plan they stated, not an abstract cover of what they said before but with a few misconceptions nobody actually thought of and cared about?\n\nRemember When Riot has the lowest rating on the BBB for being a company?  Remember when they removed the entire lore basis then replaced it with a scene literally nobody knows about because the content they produce is limited to skins only(that's not a double negative or anything).  Remember back in like 2012-2013 when they used to have different maps that would eventually come out you could highlight when choosing a map for custom games?  Remember those 5 maps that will never come out in the entire existence of League of Legends?  Remember how on the first day of Dota 2, they had more content than League has had in the entire game's lifespan?  \n\nRemember how people actually defend Riot's shortcomings because they're too lazy to transition over to a different game if and when League fails?  Remember how the Riot has literally given nothing back to the loyal members of this game, remember how League's only content provider is Skins, literally skins.  Remember how Dota 2 has Custom Skins for each part of a hero, custom wards, music, gambling boxes, loading screens, huds, announcers, couriers, taunts, tools, custom items for pro players to make money off of, custom maps events, literally an entire community dedicated to custom game modes.  Remember how you can't remember why Dota 2 isn't the dominant force in Moba's and why Riot Games is still a company? \n\nYou guys remember when URF mode came out and how new and a fresh breath of air the mode was?  Remember how everyone that loved it but wanted to find a reason to complain about it because they can?  Remember how every Custom Game mode Riot makes has to be as intricate as a AAA movie?  Remember how everything and anything Riot does is going to get positive feedback from players who literally were hit in the head with a fucking retarded stick, or ass kiss hoping they will get a reward.\n\nRemember all of that guys?  Yeah, me either.","replies":[{"poster":"Egyptian","date":"2015-03-03T08:45:04.847+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 skin with cool effects, new particles and a recall animation > 2 skins that changed a few particle effects at most if riot was going overkill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-03-04T02:35:44.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Remember when you were playing Dota 2 instead of posting an incredibly long and whiny post about League of Legends, a game you apparently hate and yet still play enough to whine about it on the League of Legends Boards, and then in the same long crybaby post you insulted everyone who enjoys this game which is the reason it would be downvoted only for you to still go on and individually insult all the people who come to defend the game they enjoy playing because like you they are entitled to their own opinion and when someone trashes that opinion and calls them a retard for having it they get upset, which is funny because Dota 2 is such a piece of garbage game i couldnt play more then 3 games before coming to the conclusion it was garbage, but this would warrant an insulting comment from you if you werent too busy playing Dota 2 instead of being an asshole on the League of Legends Boards.  \n\nYeah, m....oh wait...  \n\ngo back to Dota 2 if you hate League so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Learnding","date":"2015-03-04T03:06:06.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stephenizgod,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HYiIYLYy,comment-id=0000000100010003,timestamp=2015-03-04T02:35:44.398+0000)\n>\n> Remember when you were playing Dota 2 instead of posting an incredibly long and whiny post about League of Legends, a game you apparently hate and yet still play enough to whine about it on the League of Legends Boards, and then in the same long crybaby post you insulted everyone who enjoys this game which is the reason it would be downvoted only for you to still go on and individually insult all the people who come to defend the game they enjoy playing because like you they are entitled to their own opinion and when someone trashes that opinion and calls them a retard for having it they get upset, which is funny because Dota 2 is such a piece of garbage game i couldnt play more then 3 games before coming to the conclusion it was garbage, but this would warrant an insulting comment from you if you werent too busy playing Dota 2 instead of being an asshole on the League of Legends Boards.  \n> \n> Yeah, m....oh wait...  \n> \n> go back to Dota 2 if you hate League so much.\n\nBe more than willing to go to Dota 2.  You act like it's a problem for me to transition over to Dota 2 unlike you.  You rant a rage over how garbage the game is because, not only are you incompetent, but you're too stupid to realize why one game is better the other with common sense.\n\nThis is point A on why Riot will get praise no matter what they do.  Their players are either too lazy or incompetent to stick to a game and learn the basics; but instead they die one time then rage quit then go on League and complain on how many Trolls there are.  Nobody cares about your opinions because you bring self centered, unwarranted excuses to justify why you're bad on any game you play.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-03-04T03:46:44.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well actually i dont dislike Dota 2, i just prefer League for various reasons (although i did play Dota and i thought that was a lot more fun then Dota 2 for some reason).

Not actively rewarding the community with that awesome skin idea some amazing, artistic individual created wouldn't be a benefit.  No, you're right.  Just giving us skins with big tits and flashy particles is fine. That's the step in the right direction.  Hey GUYS!  Fuck the artists, fuck all the work you guys put into making those fucking magnificent collaborations of skins and characters, lore, poems, stories, videos.  Stephenizgod is right, all your work is useless and you should stop it.
