I simply don&#039;t understand why they felt they had to do this, and no explanation has been forthcoming.  You&#039;ll note they don&#039;t mention it once in the release, which is pretty telling if you ask me.  They know this isn&#039;t going to be popular, they&#039;re just going to ram it through because reasons.\n\nI, too, am curious. Some people like the new Fiora default skin. Some people were attached to the old Fiora default skin. By Riot&#039;s own admittance, Fiora&#039;s models weren&#039;t significantly out of date. If we had had Fiora&#039;s post-rework skin from the start and Fiora&#039;s pre-rework skin were to be released tomorrow as a purchasable skin, nobody would have really batted an eye. I just don&#039;t understand why it had to be done away with altogether.\n\nI think the common arguments against the old skin is that it doesn&#039;t really scream \"fencer\" and that some people have a problem with the \"hear-shaped\" breastplate. Well, I&#039;ve never seen anyone go into a life-or-death fight wearing the white bodysuit that the fencing SPORT is known for and I feel like any armor is better than none. I believe that her pre-rework default gave her SOME armor yet looked form-fitting and easy to move in, whereas post-rework Fiora default somehow manages to look more bulky and less mobile without armor, especially with that gargantuan asymmetrical shoulderpad.\n\nBut as  I said before, I completely understand that some people prefer the new Fiora default. I&#039;m just genuinely curious to find out the reasoning behind why Riot felt the need to completely do away with the old Fiora default and shift it in a very different direction when so many people were attached to her old iconic garb.\n\nIf you reply to this, I sincerely thank you in advance for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-08-07T13:25:15.646+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"actually a lot of historic fencers would go into combat without armor, because the idea was not getting hit in the first place, rather than taking a hit well.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-08-07T13:36:14.497+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"Something tells me that giant shoulder pads would limit your mobility more than the small breastplate that Fiora used to wear.

Your \"frail weak and squishy\" human woman can survive a barrage of cannons from a pirate ship.\n\nTwo elements are to be considered, now that LORE IS SEPARATED FROM GAMEPLAY (and even before, but that's a different can of worms).\n\nThere are two Fioras in League of Legends. Game!Fiora, and Lore!Fiora. Game!Fiora can survive cannonball barrages, knives to the chest, and the literal energy that gave birth to the universe. Lore!Fiora cannot. And her design has to reflect her \"real\" person. Which is why this is such a dumbshit argument. Game!Fiora could go to the fight buttnaked and she still would survive cannonball barrages, etc. etc. And it still would have been just as dumb as boob plating because it would still be a death sentence in the \"real\" (lore) world.\n\n\nPlus, if you're using gameplay as a lore element, Teemo can survive being chewed alive by a six stacks Cho'Gath in game. It's an abstraction of \"real\" (lore) abilities, of Fiora dodging the binding and using the opening to strike hard against her attacker, in the same way that old JoJ interview of Garen clarified he isn't actually summoning a giant sword from the sky with his ult.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlackSunNocturne","date":"2015-08-08T19:44:21.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cissoid,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EqPJA9xZ,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2015-08-07T16:33:25.840+0000)\n>\n> I would prefer if Braum wore armor.

That's how it works around here sis. Women have used armor made for men, with no issues.\n\nI've always found the breast plates in league very funny, and the explanation from the community even funnier. For Fiora it made a bit of sense. She is like a noble woman who is accentuating her feminine aspects, just like a noble man would do with his armor, and she is obviously very showy and proud of herself. It works out well.\n\nFor many of the other female champions, it does not fit their personality or lore.\n\nBreasts, even if big, are not hard, and do not need _that_  much room. Even men wear padding under their armor. The only purpose of it is to say, \"Look summoner, I have breasts!\" Which you know if that's you're thing okay, but don't be lying to yourself and trying to bring up other things because we don't have to live with you, you do. So you need to be real with yourselves.\n\nBack to the topic, I think it's a shame that Riot will not give us a traditional skin for Fiora. I feel like this would ease the saltiness from players who are not happy about her VU. I don't feel like it would be difficult to do either. It just makes sense, and does more good than harm. Making your customers happy is always a good thing.\n\nThey could release a traditional skin, but still go ahead with the other one that will be out for her soon.

Fiora's sword is rather large and logically heavy. The larger of Fiora's shoulder pads is on her off-hand.

Her new one leaves her legs totally unprotected. While most top-notch fencers (as in, a lot better than me) don't get hit very often at all, the place that people get hit the most actually isn't the torso, it *the legs*. A good swordsman/woman who practices dueling in particular is trained to defend their torso and head as their first and foremost priority, since it doesn't matter if you can protect you feet if you then get skewered through the heart. Modern fencing gear is designed towards primarily *padding* the torso because it is the point that a fencer usually aims for (largest target which is also the one your tip is least likely to slide off).\n\nIn standard fencing, there are 9 normal parries, of which 1 is to protect your back, 2-3 (depends who you ask) are to protect your legs, and **5-6** are solely for protecting your head and torso (again depends who you ask). the sort of sheath-like leg gaurds she wore pre-VU would have been very effective at deflecting a sword-tip while allowing her to focus on her torso which was defended primarily by her blade rather than her armor. they also relfect on the style of boots popular at the peak of dueling culture in Europe, which often times reached well above the knees on men.\n\nI never played old Fiora and honestly hated her pre rework (still not a *huge* fan) but I always smiled when I looked at her portrait or model because she looked *authentic*. From her smug grin to her efficient apparel to her unique but realistic blade, she at least *looked* the part even if her kit didn't really live up to her theme.\n\nAlso, her old walk/run animation matches the stride of a fencer **WAY** better than her new animation, because she used to use deliberate heel-toe strides in a graceful manner, similar to proper fencing form, where now she sort of bounds around like she's wearing a pair of moonboots with a 10 pound weight hanging around her neck.","replies":[{"poster":"Delioth","date":"2015-08-07T21:28:21.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, the idea of not protecting your legs also comes from the idea that (at least in sport foil fencing) legs aren't valid target, and thus don't count any touches.

A lot of people on these boards seem very ignorant of the fact that sport fencing is in essence true dueling, simply modified to have a point system instead of being about killing your opponent. All the parries and footwork we use today are the same parries and footwork used centuries ago in the great French and Italian schools of swordsmanship, and when you attack with a lunge, your foil (or in my case, epee) is specifically designed to bend to replicate running your opponent straight through the chest. In fact, modern fencing is more similar to authentic dueling than \"renaissance fencing\" (what a lot of boards users seem to think is the most authentic iteration of dueling today), because even though modern fencing doesn't utilize a dagger in the off-hand, that was not the norm to begin with! Renaissance fencing is more a flashy style used to make reenactments seem more exciting, when it is basically verging on stage fighting, or a choreographed fight (another thing I've learned over the years from acting in plays).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-08-07T17:14:47.733+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"The tri-cape... the high collar... the ornamental armor...\n\nUgh.

They want to turn league into what they want, not what the players want.","replies":[{"poster":"Spider Chief","date":"2015-08-08T05:44:47.900+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your argument is basically \"you can't disagree with me because I'm an artist\".\n\nCan you at least try to get Riot and IronStylus' cock out of your mouth?","replies":[{"poster":"Ant Eater king","date":"2015-08-08T05:49:37.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tWC5qtfby4","replies":[]},{"poster":"A little Peepo","date":"2015-08-09T14:35:58.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spider Chief,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EqPJA9xZ,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-08-08T05:44:47.900+0000)\n>\n> Your argument is basically \"you can't disagree with me because I'm an artist\".\n> \n> Can you at least try to get Riot and IronStylus' cock out of your mouth?\n\nyou are the one that asked for an explanation and I gave it to you. They simply don't care at this point about fulfilling you every need (I would think you would know that by now after the karma rework and the crying that is still happening up to this day.) truth is people like you are the main reason why they don't even hop on the forums and circle jerk on reddit, too many complaints about little things, they don't even reply to posts because people like you tend to resort to disrespectful remarks and just plain stupid replies because you didn't get what you wanted. This is why they don't even bother :) perfect example by his douche bag reply\n\nThey didn't give a shit then and they aren't gonna give a shit now about. Get to challenger and become a good player and maybe then they will listen to you but to them you are a nobody just like 95% of the league community.

Blunderbusses are essentially proto-shotguns, but since they were muzzle-loaded you could load it with as much or as little as you wanted, as well as whatever you wanted (glass shards, gravel, bullets, shells, teeth, basically anything hard and small), at a comparatively break-neck speed compared to other muzzle loaders. that is replicated to a certain extent with her ult were each wave could be interpreted as her loading a fistful of dirt off the ground and blasting you with it. That also explains her \"impure shots\" to a certain extent, since a Blunderbuss basically fires anything, often meaning you would get infected and die from the dirt and grit in the wound as the bullets themselves.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-08-07T17:29:15.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"PureCancer","date":"2015-08-07T23:25:31.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"to be honest.. i love the new fiora splash art it fits her more in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-08-07T13:54:15.273+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"I still remember the early days when I got into this game and scrolled through all the champions and watched their ability videos. Two characters struck my eye as being very bland graphically. Those two were Fiora and Karma.\n\nKarma got her rework and she became more vibrant and got herself a new attire (and became my main). Fiora was still this woman who mostly wore grey armor and had very little color to her kit and thus my first impression of her was: boring.\n\nThe new Fiora seems more memorizable and visually interesting.","replies":[]}]}
