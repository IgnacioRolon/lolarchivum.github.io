Where the hell is the Quinn **anything**? I mean appreciate that a few months back you finally took time to fix Quinn bugs that existed for 2 years (even though there are STILL standing bugs), but isn't it time to finally look at her gameplay? I remember for years Riot claimed that Ashe was in a completely fine, competitively viable position. It's great that they were able to take a step back and say \"what have we been smoking\", but now it's time to do the same for Quinn. \n\nADCs have been nerfed and buffed and nerfed and buffed and nerfed again. Metas have come and gone and come back again, and Quinn has not been a particularly strong pick in any them. I cannot foresee any single meta where Quinn would be a strong pick unless all other ADCs are gutted. Let's stop pretending that nothing is wrong with this champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2015-06-10T21:01:49.152+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":2,"body":"Quinn's kit could be insanely good but its just riddled with little tiny illogical flaws that its very odd haven't been fixed.\n\nFirst off, her AA animations are shit. This has needed fixing since release, and she will never be able to compete with her short range when her AAs are as clunky as they are. Since she has a lower AA range, she should have some of the best animations in class, but hers are instead some of the worst\n\nHer passive could really use some consistency and reliability fixes. A thousand ways have been suggested to fix it. Riot needs to pick one.\n\nHer Q and W are fine\n\nHer E could greatly benefit from being changed to a area-targeted spell like Gnar's Hop, making it so that Quinn could sacrifice the damage to use it as a free dash if need be. If its going to remain targeted the way it is, Quinn should at least become immune to displacement during the duration, fixing a shitton of bugs with things like Vayne's E (as shown in the video).\n\nHer R, which could be honestly one of the best and most unique ADC ultimates, is just meh because of several things. The main thing is that its focus is divided between a Riven-style steroid ultimate and a Rek'Sai style mobility spell. Honestly Riot could go either way with this: either increase its potency as a steroid, making it worth the cooldown it has, or decreasing its cooldown greatly and removing Skystrike, allowing it to shine as a cross-map mobility spell. Either way, the cooldown needs to be changed to start at the beginning of Tag Team, rather than when Skystrike is cast. If they decide to cement it as a steroid, the mana cost should probably be removed, and Valor given a passive that either a) increases damage output, or b) increases his ability to survive in melee range. If it is to be a mobility spell, a cooldown of 50/30/10 seconds sounds good, the mana cost should stay, and the attack speed steroid from W should be decreased to emphasize that it is Quinn who does the damage while Tag Team is primarily for mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorae42","date":"2015-06-11T14:54:18.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really love/hate the idea of an adc with a short cd high mobility spell. \n\nOh, you're coming to stop me split pushing bot?

Instead of Valor coming down to mark the enemies, his auto-attacks could proc the mark like Xin's passive (One thing at a time). That way switching back to Quinn would give some reliable damage (aside from Harrier).\n\nHer W should be changed in valors form simply because he isn't scouting the area for Quinn. The way it is now makes it seem as if Valor is scouting for valor. That's very redundant. I think changing the movement-speed and attack-speed should be changed to an activatable ability. \n\nLastly, I think it would be better to make her ult on a shorter cooldown or even cut Harrier out and turn it into a toggleable ability like elise, nidalee even Jayce's ults. That way she could go back to truly being Quinn AND Valor. instead of Quinn with a side of Valor.\n\nThese are my main ideas, I hope others have had these ideas as well. \n\nPs: I wish her E would proc an auto-attack during the vault as well. This would add to the reliable damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Somohexual","date":"2015-06-12T16:35:14.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anonagon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IxEHO084,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-10T21:01:49.152+0000)\n> \n> Her R, which could be honestly one of the best and most unique ADC ultimates, is just meh because of several things.

Valor\". Make it feel like you're actually switching between two different, autonomous characters to best fit your situation. Having a lengthy cooldown completely ruins this feeling, it should be more of an in-and-out \"stance\"/\"form\" like Nidalee's cougar.\n\n-------------\nEither:\n\n- Quinn is the primary source of sustained damage \n- Valor is the primary source of mobility/survival and burst damage\n\nOR\n\n- Quinn is the primary source of mobility/kiting and burst damage\n- Valor is the primary source of sustained damage\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer the second dynamic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-06-10T22:30:06.752+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"What Quinn really needs is a better AA.

You can literally take steps after it&#039;s gone off & it&#039;ll cancel/disappear mid-max range.\n\n**Also, what do you think about giving Valor W \"lingering vision on revealed enemy champions for X seconds,\" after the big reveal?**\n\nIf you think about it, Valor already loses the lingering vision mechanic from the form costing him Harrier marking.\n\n**Additionally, what do you think about removing the actual Harrier mark bonus from Vault & simply having her fire off a Harrier&#039;d auto as she flips back (besides the fact that this would be incredibly badass)?**\n\nVault applying a Harrier mark interferes with her passive Harrier, further gating its use-viability (which, we have enough of that already with the risk-reward of getting snagged with it) without potentially sacrificing a passively applied Harrier mark.\n\nIn other words, you can gimp yourself by giving up your passive Harrier to Vault (overwriting the passive in many instances) or gimp yourself by not Vaulting simply because you aren&#039;t sure how soon or effectively your passive Harrier will take effect.\n\n**As well, what about re-prioritizing Harrier marking to: Large Monsters>Enemy Champions>Small Monsters>Large Minions>Small Minions?**\n\nIt really hurts her jungle-game & objective-capping capabilities having small monsters equal in priority... also, an enemy champion coming near can also spoil your ability to cap that large monster you were working on--I think it best to put Large Monsters ahead of Enemy Champions for this reason... however, those two could work in reverse, looking at the alternative paradigm (counter-jungling/chunking away a pesky enemy Champion who&#039;s trying to get all up on your biznass)... making them equal in priority may do but I despise the random-factor.\n\n**Lastly, how about something visual to indicate when a Large Monster or Enemy Champion is within range to be detected/marked by Harrier?**\n\nSince her range is low, you want to be as far as possible a lot of the time... but that&#039;s very ineffective, as skirting that line can cost you the champion mark; it&#039;s just too fickle as-is. This would also present an opportunity to give her a tiny, lil bit more particle flavah. A tiny arrow or chit over-head an enemy champion or mark around their hit-box.\n\nThanks for the consideration & *hopeful,* ensuing chat!!\n\nSincerely,\n\nEyrgos\n\n**P.S.

Why not give something like that to Q and E? \n\nWhat I was thinking of was: \n\nLeveling up Q: Gives Valor bonus lifesteal \n\nLeveling up E: Gives Valor bonus Critical Strike chance. \n\n\nThese 3 choices can also be factors on what to level up for what you are facing. What you max first and second can effect your Ult immensely. You can make Valor an sustain fighter with maxing Q and W, or you can make him a burst fighter by maxing E. \n\nThen when you get to level 18, you reach an **\"END GAME FANTASY\"** by having Valor be almost on par with the likes of {{champion:11}} and {{champion:114}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2015-06-13T22:10:30.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really think Quinn is better than people say she is, she's my go-to ADC, honestly they should rework her ult though.
