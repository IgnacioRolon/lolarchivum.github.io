Leveling up GD's self-awareness.]\r\n\r\nGD is a family.\r\n\r\nThe littlest ones post about how many champions are OP.\r\n\r\nThe teens post pin-ups of half naked women and porn.\r\n\r\nThere are the eldest bros that act like you, Frosthaven, or like Chicken Wrap. They know more things, act mature, tinker with things and then get married and move out to start a new life.\r\n\r\nThere are the eldest sisters who answer to every post about someone being depressed, confused or needing help with encouraging and informative content.  They'll also post about overarching drama like what is occurring today (and yesterday) with the GD boards move.  It's like when Dad needs a Mom to translate what teenagers and kids are saying. Elder sisters are translators and psychologists. I fall in this category.  I just read a poster \"Evangele\" doing a similar thing so she falls in this category as well.\r\n\r\nThere are the disciplinarian Dads who everyone fears that of sort of act like Pendragon.  Tamat is like a Dad and Mom rolled into one cause he does also like to talk. Lolz.\r\n\r\nThere are the loving Moms who everyone loves who usually don't even post at all (but delete a lot of stuff silently) or get fired for telling Dad to be less of an a-hole.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are the aunts and uncles who are all the reds that come here to post that we are automatically supposed to love and support, and do so very finely for the most part I should think (though sometimes some aunts are sent running away crying like Aunt Opeli).\r\n\r\nOh, and Junior Member are ALL crying babies.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it.","replies":[]}
