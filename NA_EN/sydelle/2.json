It's already been partially reworked again.\n* Akali: The old one was pretty bad (never personally played it), and the new one is a huge balance issue that needed to have several entire mechanics removed and nerfed into garbage.\n* Alistar: Not a huge rework, and the addition of more CC after a skill check (staying in range of enemy champs for a while, then an auto) rather than just more damage is welcome.\n* Ashe: Kind of killed support Ashe, but makes her a more sensible ADC. Decent (though small) rework.\n* Cass: She's been constantly worked on (remember when she had a huge poison minigame as a passive? now it's just movespeed), but she seems okay and stable now.\n* Eve: Lots of iterations to get to where we are, but seems okay at this point.\n* Ez: Breaking the game since forever with no signs of stopping.\n* Fiora: Actually pretty okay, even with % hp true damage.\n* Galio: He was fine before. The only thing that felt lackluster was his E, and it wasn't actually bad. His current kit has shifted from mage to tank back to mage to support or something like that because he's either OP or trash. Failure.\n* GP: I honestly think replacing a simple stat boost with the barrel mechanic is interesting. Very small rework, but good.\n* Gragas: Has his kit even changed that much? Sometimes he's a little too strong, but I'd put that down to meta changes.\n* Heimer: Good rework all around.\n* Irelia: I think they actually made the problem worse.\n* Karma: I think she's fine now, but some people who actually liked original Karma (both of them) hate the new one and will honestly probably never be satisfied, so whatever.\n* Kass: After being pick/ban for years, he... seems okay now? I don't really hear complaints. Not a huge rework, though.\n* Kat: They replaced a single ability, changing \"Sunfire on a button\" to the dagger mechanic, and it's great.\n* Kayle: People thought it would be trash due to short games but it turned out that she hit her power spike way too soon so she's OP. I don't think I'd call it a success yet.\n* Yi: He can't spam Q and heal to full all the time anymore, so I'd say the minor work he got was suitable. Rageblade is a problem, though.\n* Morde: Cool idea for a character, but everything they've done with him has been a bug-riddled failure. Hopefully the next rework is good.\n* Nid: They did exactly what players screamed for, then players screamed about that, but the screaming has died down. I have to be fair and call this one reasonable, even though spears are now a shadow of what they used to be.\n* Nunu: Snowball spam was cancer. I think he might be okay now.\n* Olaf: Unnecessary rework. Official tournaments should've just added a rule saying that Voyboy wasn't allowed to play Olaf. The reason \"Olafed\" is the term we use to describe a gutted champion is literally that one player was much better at playing Olaf than the designers planned for.\n* Poppy: Necessary rework, but she's needed a lot of changes since then. Still, I don't hear a lot of complaints, and her kit isn't an obvious balance/counterplay nightmare anymore, so I'll call the rework fine.\n* Rengar: Reverted.\n* Ryze: They produced so many failed Ryze reworks that they literally gave up on doing any more.\n* Sej: Failed rework is OP in coordinated play and trash everywhere else.\n* Shen: I thought the old version was fine, but the new one seems okay. The sword mechanic is odd, but I guess people get used to it.\n* Shyv: She's gotten reworks and still needs them.\n* Sion: Other than moving the coolest part of his old kit into something that only activates when you die, good rework.\n* Skarner: The rework just annoyed people with all these spires and nonsense.\n* Soraka: By this point, I'd say the rework has basically been reworked. Failure.\n* Swain: The only reason he was reworked was because he didn't feel tactical enough, but the new champion is good, too.\n* Taric: So weak on his own and yet so powerful when paired with a carry that it gave rise to the funnel strat. Which Riot is trying to stamp out because it ruins the game. Kind of a failed rework, I think.\n* Trist: Not very heavy changes, but seems currently fine.\n* Urgot: I liked the old one, but it did need a change. The new one's needed a lot of work, though. This one's not so easy to call but I'd lean toward a success.\n* Veigar: Minor changes created a much more exciting champion with more interaction and more chance of fulfilling the power fantasy in less than an hour.\n* WW: A popular rework, but I frequently see people following a blood trail way too far, \"securing\" a kill, and then dying.\n* Xerath: A good rework that turned non-existence into reasonable existence.\n* Xin: Pretty good.\n* Yorick: Still a balance problem because the problematic parts of his kit were \"iconic\" and they refused to remove them.\n* Zilean: Great rework.","replies":[{"poster":"KidnapperMorde","date":"2019-05-06T03:35:19.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"As much as old Aatrox was unhealthy he still had clear spikes of power, When hellbent or w are up he is looking to trade, if he is low and autoing minions harass him so he doesn't heal from w\n\nThey didn't have to thanos snap his whole kit.
