You'll have to let me know if you see that again.\n\nAs for the issue of being stuck in the fountain, basically what this seems like is that your packets to the servers that contain the data in your right-clicks to leave the base weren't received by the servers. This could make the clicks not actually send data for the action to take place, meaning it's a problem somewhere between your PC and the servers. This is why I suggested the connection guide and why I believe we'll find the solution with the steps I've provided. \n\nPlease let me know if you see this issue again after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"LEEROY KLEDKINS","date":"2016-12-16T07:23:06.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've book marked this page if i do come across this i will let you know.\n\nits a bit annoying honestly and im just glad im not using beta client.\n\nIf something happens with the same issue before jan 2017 i will let you know.\n\nMerry Christmas.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
