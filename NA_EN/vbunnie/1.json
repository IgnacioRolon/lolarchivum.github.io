It looked like the homes the Hunters in the woods outside of town lived in, but she was never on the inside of one. \n\"She is awake!!\" proclaimed a woman. \n\n\"well isn't that the best and with a bump like that I swear she was a gonner if we didnt find her?\" said a man.\n\n\"Where am I?\" Heidi asked.\n\n\"Well you are at our home of course, let me introduce myself; my name is Adam Rightheart. I am leader of the Revenge corps, an anti siege group dedicated to protecting the Justice of others and the land we hold so dear. This is my wife Amy Rightheart, my dedicated right hand woman and companion. She is also pretty good with a bow. Who is it if I may ask that I am pleasured to be meeting?\" \n\n\"My name is Heidi. I am the sworn protector of my farm and livestock outside of Zaun. Are you a witch? What did you do to me? I ain't too keen on witches or strangers. And you better choose your words wiseley, I warn you I am stronger than i appear and I can take a beating.\"\n\n\"We can see that, no there aren't any witches here,\" Adam chuckled, \"just a lumberjack and his wife who happened to find you in the middle of the woods while we were hunting.\" He replied. \"I have heard about you. Must have been an intense fight you had with fiddlesticks. You gave him one hell of a chase and fight. To think that monster is finally slain. If only times were better. We have been nursing you back to health here in our camp while we plot our counter attack against the new influx of monsters who have entered through the Rift. And I finally think, I have a plan that just might work. We ran into your father several years back, about some lumber he needed to build his barn. How did that project go?  how has he been and is he still up for a fight?\"\n\n\"The barn was the best in the land.\" Heidi said distantly. \"Fiddlesticks killed my father. He took him away from me before I could say goodbye one last time. I had to avenge him. I had to do something about it.\" Heidi said with mixed emotions mostly of anger sadness fear and determination all at the same time.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear that.\" Replied Adam. \"He was a good fighter, but at least he didn't die in vain. At least you finally avenged it. It is good to hear his legacy remained and he raised you well. It is a shame you are now an orphan. But it was only a matter of time I am afraid, with your father refusing to trade with Zaun and all. They were bound to do something with you refusing to give them food and all. What was that all about?\"\n\n\"Don't talk about my father.\" Heidi screamed sadly and angrily tearing up.\n\n\"We did not mean to offend.\" Said Amy soothingly.\n\n \"I am sorry, I know you mean well most likely. He refused to trade with them when they decided not to increase their regulations on the toxic waste spewing from that city. It has been damaging our crops and me and my father were not going to put up with them not doing anything. So We did.\" Said Heidi. \"What is this about a siege and monsters? I am so confused. I don't remember anything about a siege.\" cooed in Heidi excitedly.\n\n\"Well, it has been many months since we first found you in the woods. We have since been treating your injuries. I was surprised you even woke up after taking such a blow. Are you ok? What exactly do you remember?\" asked Adam.\n\n\"Well I am fine.\" Heidi said, the pain in her head still aching, as she tried to remember what happened, but it was so foggy. All she could think of was when she finally delivered that fatal blow to fiddlesticks his last attempt at redemption. The slicing sound of his scythe scraping across a tree and a severe pain in her head. Then the light and no more. She struggled to regain her grounding.\n\n\"Thats ok,\" said the woman. \"It has been a long time. When you were asleep the world around you has changed. Time kept going as you slept. It has been almost two years now since we first found you, a hard two years at that, and there is no clue how long you were sleeping before then.\"\n\n\"That cant be right,\" Heidi interupted, \"there is no way. It only feels like a few minutes.\" \n\n\"Maybe,\" Amy continued, \"but I can assure you...\"\nBefore Amy could finish her sentence Heidi had already got up and dashed outside.\n\n\"you are in no shape too...\" but Amy's words fell upon deaf ears as Heidi was already outside looking around for clues as to what happened. \n\nAmy was right, the world around her was not what she remembered. What used to be large forests and beautiful skylines of cities, now shadows of their former selves. Where there were long treelines as far as the eye can see were now scorched timber and stick piles. What were once beautiful landscapes were now scorned with death and destruction. What was once her beautiful farm was now nothing more than a ruined remnant of the past. It appeared that Heidi had slept for a long time.\n\nHeidi when she had her fill, went back into the house, determined as ever. \"What Happened? Who did this? Where are they? And how do we get there?\" She asked abruptly, as she grabbed her trusty pitchfork, handtorch, and lasso from atop the mantle. \n\n\"Aren't you afraid?\" asked the woman.\n\n\"Not for one second. Haven't they told you? I'm fearless.\"--Heidi  \n\nStats and stuff:\nMelee, Support, tank\nName: Heidi\nGender: Female\nRace: Human\nage:20\n\nPhysical description: Heidi is a 5 foot 4 young female with medium length red hair, freckles, and fine cut features. She wears a white cowboy hat, a black bandana around her neck, a white tank top with short sleeves and a sleeveless black leather vest, black leather chaps with white short shorts showing underneath the chaps, a white belt on top of the chaps with her black lasso on the right side of her belt and her trusty hand torch on her left side, and white cowboy boots. In her right hand she holds her pitchfork.\n\nBasic Stats:\nHealth: 430(+90 per level) (2050 at max level)\nHealth Regen: 6.5 (+.75 per level) (20 at max level)\nMana: 200 (+50 per level) (1100 at max level)\nMana Regen: 7.0 (+.50 per level) (16 at max level)\nRange: 150 (Melee)\nAttack Damage 56 (+3 per level) (101 at max level)\nAttack speed: .629(+2.30% per level) (.875) at max level)\nArmor: 20 (+3.5 per level)(83 at max level)(after global stat changes)\nMagic Resist: 30(+1.25 per level) (52.5 at max level)\nMovement speed: 340\n\nChallenges adressed: seigebreaker because oh the possibilities... q the enemy to heidi and bring them to turret. Q to an ally who broke seige. W an ally under turret and toss them to break the seige.  Ult the enemy and use that blind/stun as an advantage.  \n\nAnd Heidi has channel times lots and lots of channel times 1 to be exact but I believe her e and w count too but i don't really consider them channel times.\n \nAs far as enduring she is a tank and can take a lot of damage. Heidi also meets strange friends (Amy and Adam) she would not have met otherwise.\n\nAbilities:\nInnate: Rebellion/Rugged\nRebellion: Heidi does not perform forced actions, nor can she be knocked up; instead she is snared for the duration of such effects. \n\nThis effect can only trigger once every 12 seconds. If this skill is on cooldown Heidi is stunned for the duration of these effects.\n\n(note forced actions are taunts fears and charms because you actually do something; Knockups do not include pulls, flings, or knockback; and polymorphs supressions and entangles work normally. Also note that snare is the same thing as root. I just dont like the word.)\n\nRugged: Rugged: Heidi receives 150% of her total armor as bonus health, and 200% of her total magic resist as bonus mana.\n\n(note the bonus mana and bonus health act as normal health or mana however if magic resist or armor were to be lost Heidi would lose bonus health or mana proportional to the armor or magic resist lost.\nThe Bonus health or mana gained from these abilities cannot drop below 0. \nIf temporary armor or magic resist were to be gained then for the duration of the temporary armor or magic resist Heidi would gain the bonus health or mana proportional to the temporary armor or magic resist and the health or mana would decay with the temporary armor or magic resist.)\n\n\nQ: Rope Em:\nChanneled Collision linear skill shot\n\nChannel: Heidi pulls out her lasso and spins it over her head, beginning the channel.\nRope Em can be channeled up to 2 seconds. It can be cast prematurely at any time during the channel. \nHeidi can move while channeling but she cannot basic attack and her move speed is reduced by 25%. \nAdditionally hand torch may remain active while channeling, but it cannot be turned off nor can any other ability be activated, including torch throw, while channeling. \nWhile channeling the max range of the ability is increased constantly until it reaches maximum range in 1.5 seconds. At the end of the two seconds if it has not already been cast or interupted Rope Em is automatically cast. When cast Heidi throws out her lasso and will have a differing effect depending on what she hits.\n\nEnemies: Take magic damage and are pulled toward Heidi. They are also slowed after being pulled by a percentage that increases per half second channeled for a duration two times the time channeled and stops increasing once Rope Em reaches maximum range. \n\nAllies: Heidi will pull herself to the ally and increase their movement speed afterwards by a percentage that increases per half second channeled for a duration equal to double the time spent channeling.\n\nHay Bale: Heidi will pull the Hay Bale, and any ally or enemy inside it, to her location. No damage or speed increase/decrease is applied to champions inside a pulled Hay Bale. All units within Hay Bale's path while it is being pulled this way are knocked aside.\n\nCost: 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 Mana\nCooldown: 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 Seconds\nMagic Damage: 75 / 115 / 155 /195/ 235 (+ 50% AP)\n\nRange: 700 ~ 1150\nRange Increase per 0.5 Seconds: 150\nProjectile Speed: 1900\n\nMinimum Slow / Movement Speed Increase: 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0% (+ 0% per AP)\nMaximum Slow / Movement Speed Increase: 15/ 22.5/ 30 / 37.5 / 45% (+ 0.06% per AP)\nSlow / Movement Speed Increase per 0.5 Seconds: (5 /7.5 / 10 / 12.6/15% (+ 0.02% per AP)\n\nMinimum Slow / Movement Speed Increase Duration: 0 Seconds\nMaximum Slow / Movement Speed Increase Duration: 3 Seconds\nSlow / Movement Speed Duration Increase per 0.5 Seconds: 1 Second\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nIf an enemy or ally is inside a Hay Bale when Heidi pulls it with Rope Em, the enemy or ally inside the Hay Bale is pulled as well.\nRope Em does not interrupt allies, and can be used on all unit types and Hay Bales, with the exception of structures and terrain.\nIf used on an enemy or hay bale it works like Thresh's first pull. If used on an ally it works like Thresh’s second pull.\n\nW: Pitch fork: Melee Targeted ability\nOn Enemy: Heidi stabs her pitchfork into the target, dealing physical damage to them while throwing them 650 feet in the direction she is facing. If the target hits terrain while being thrown, they are stunned. Stabbed enemies cannot be thrown over terrain.\n\nOn Ally: Heidi grabs the target with her pitchfork, lifting them into the air. While holding a target, Heidi can move around freely, carrying the target with her. While being carried, the target is completely invulnerable. Any effects or damage the target would otherwise receive will affect Heidi instead. The target is freed if Heidi loses 10% of her current health while carrying them, or if they walk away from Heidi. After a short period of time (unless it was canceled) the target is thrown 650 feet in the direction of the targets cursor. The target can be thrown over terrain, and all enemy units within a small impact point are knocked up.\n\nOn Hay Bale: Heidi stabs her pitchfork into the targeted Hay Bale, consuming the active Hay Bale while adding a stack of Hay Bale. If there is one ally or enemy within the Hay Bale when it is picked up, then they are subjected to Pitchfork's usual effect. If there are multiple targets in a single Hay Bale, extra targets will not be picked up, but will lose the cover of the Hay Bale.\n\nHeidi's next Hay Bale activation within 10 seconds deals 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 50% AD) (+ 30% AP) magic damage, to all enemies within 50 range of the Hay Bale's active range. This bonus effect does not stack.\n\nCost: 60/ 70 / 80 / 90/ 100 Mana\nCooldown: 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 Cooldown\nPhysical Damage: 60 / 105 / 150/ 195/ 240 (+ 50% total AD)\nStab Range: 150\nThrow Range: 650\nLift / Stun Duration: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 Seconds\nKnock Up Duration: 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 seconds\nKnock-Up AoE Range: 250\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nHeidi cannot use basic attacks while an ally is being carried with Pitchfork.\nIf a carried ally activates a movement altering ability, it counts as walking away from Heidi. This includes channeled spells like Recall or Teleport.\nIf Heidi is killed while carrying an ally, the ally is immediately released.\nPitchfork allows the user to move an allied target, but does not prevent that target from moving away from Heidi. Pitchfork does not cancel spells being cast, and cannot be used to pick up an ally whom is casting Recall or Teleport.\nWhile being carried, allies can basic attack, as well as use abilities.\nHeidi must stand still while the lifted ally is in the middle of a channel, unless the ability states that movement is allowed and it will not interrupt the channel.\nHeidi can have Hand Torch active while she is carrying an ally, but she cannot cast any abilities (including Hand Torch) while doing so. 50 units of its active range would equate to a total diameter of 350 units.\n\nE: Hand torch/torch throw:\nHand torch:\nToggle/aura buff\nAOE Diameter Around self: 800 (The range of Syndra's Dark Sphere but obviously an aoe)\nCool down: 12/11/10/9/8\nCost: 15/20/25/30/35 mana per second\nBonus armor/magic resist: 6/12/18/24/30\nAlly armor/magic resist: 3/6/9/12/15\n\nToggle: Heidi lights her hand torch revealing all units within the abilities range.\nDuring this time Heidi's armor and magic resist are increased by 6/12/18/24/30. \nAll allies within range gain half of this bonus as long as they remain in range. \nIf Hand torch reveals a champion for at least three seconds Torch Throw then replaces the toggle off option and may be activated for the next three seconds.\n\n(Note this ability functions like Quinn's w fused with amumu's cry.\nHeidi's torch functions similar to a ward that is carried with her. It creates an aoe around heidi that reveals enemies in bushes and such (except stealthed targets). \nThe aoe also pushes back the fog of war around heidi slightly. (200 units or so). As long as there is a constant mana flow and the ability is not toggled off the vision will remain. \nAs Heidi moves so does the vision.)\n\nTorch throw: Targeted on click ability\nRange: 800\nDiameter of Aoe with Hay Bale: 400\nDamage to enemies directly: 60/105/150/195/240 +(40% total AP) magic damage\nTotal Burn damage: 8% of target's current health\nBurn Rate: 2% of current health per second at time of tick\nBurn duration: 4 seconds\nCost: no cost\n\nOn enemy: Heidi throws her torch at the targeted enemy champion, minion, or summoned unit dealing magic damage and burning the target for four seconds.\nWhile the burn is active the target and all units within 125 range of the target while it is burning receive damage equal to 2% of the burning target's current health per second at time of tick as long as they remain within the burn's range.\n\n(Note a summoned unit would be Tibbers or Malzahars voidlings... \nAs the target moves so does the aoe...\n the damage is dealt every second and takes into account health regen and heals of all sources which is why it deals 2% of current health on tick.\nSo if the target had 2000 health the initial 240 damage would be dealt so the target would have 1760 health say they had 20 health regen they would have 1764 health\nafter regen kicks in then the burn would deal damage based on that number the next second they will regen another 4 health\nand then another set of damage would be dealt based off of that number after health regen. \nIf they had higher health regen, or if they were to suddenly heal for say 200 health, it would deal more damage.\nThis burn doesn’t kill targets only weakens them so the less health they have the less damage it deals. \nAlso note that Handtorch/torchthrow goes on cooldown immediately after torch throw is activated and when this happens Handtorch no longer drains mana.)\n\nOn Hay Bale: Heidi throws her torch at the hay Bale dealing magic damage to all enemy units within 75 units of the active range of the Hay Bale.\nBurning the Hay Bale and enemies within it's active range for four seconds. \nWhile the burn is active the burning enemies and all enemies that come within 125 range the burning targets will receive damage equal to 2% of of the primary target's current health per second at time of tick and will be revealed for this duration.\nAfter the burn is completed the Hay Bale is consumed in flames destroying the Hay Bale.\n\n(Note 75 units of the active range of the Hay Bale would be a total diameter of 400 units including the hay Bale. The burn would be applied normally except if the burn does not move with the enemy instead it is applied only while enemies stay within the burning Hay Bale's Aoe.)\n\nR: Hay Bale: Stock/ground targeted aoe\nRange: 650\nInner circle diameter: 250 (about the size of Graves’s w)\nOuter circle radius: 550 (about the size of Ziggs' outer circle of ult)\nSnare duration: 1/1.5/2 second\nBlind duration 1.5/2/2.5 seconds\nMaximum active at a time 1/2/3\nMaximum stacks held: 3\nActive Hay Bale Duration: 70 seconds\nCool down: 30/25/20 seconds\nCost: 80/95/110 mana\n\nStock/ammo Passive: Heidi Gains 1 Stack of Hay Bale every 30 seconds. While Hay Bale is active it is considered semi- passable terrain and functions like bushes by either team. \nHay Bale cannot be attacked or damaged and can only be targeted by Heidi's abilities. \n(Note: Projectiles, targeted abilities, and similar such abilities function as they would in/into brush.)\n\nActive: Heidi's throws the Hay Bale at target location, costing a hay bale stack. \nIf an enemy champ is hit directly by hay bale at time of cast they are snared for 1/1.5/2 and blinded for 1.5/2/2.5 seconds seconds.\nAll other units within 150 range of the active range of hay bale are just blinded for 1.5/2/2.5 seconds.\n\nExplanation of Hay Bale: the cool down is the amount of time in between casts of hay bale.\nAt any level Heidi still only gains one stack every thirty second. \nHay bale is not a bomb like teemo's mushrooms. \nHay bale only does the stun when it is thrown and functions like any other aoe, it however persists and act like a 200 diameter round bush that can be used by either team.\nIt is terrain and does not turn invisible it does however blend in with bushes. \nHay Bale can be thrown on top of enemies. \nFurther note the Hay Bale has an active range of 250 units meaning it is the size of say Graves’s w and blinding all units within 150 units would mean that, when thrown, it would blind all units in a total area of 550 units except if it hits an enemy champ directly then they are stunned and blinded.\nHay Bale is pretty much a bush that blinds and/or stuns when thrown. \nHay Bales can be warded by enemy teams and can be utilized by Heidi's other abilities.\n\nGameplay and such: Heidi the Wrangler is a melee/support tank who excels at single target engagement, health tanking, and countering enemy mages/assassins, while keeping her allies alive and well through the use of guerrilla style warfare and careful timing. Heidi has 3 ranged attacks decent damage and plenty of crowd control. The idea is that she can control the lane with pulls, throws, and burns while also providing her allies with plenty of support and keeping them alive.\n\nEach of her moves can be used separately or together on her allies, enemies, or her ult, which is her hay bale. Her hay bale acts as a moveable, throwable bush with decent active range and the ability to snare and blind enemies on throw. While Hay bale does not turn invisible it does blend into bushes and can serve as extra cover even within bushes and can reveal enemies within it. If the ally is close enough to Heidi she can pull herself to them and enemies out of battle with her q throw her allies into it with her w, or buff allies and damage enemies with her e.\n\nShe has four ways to engage and each one is better depending on the circumstances. She can either throw her ult at the enemy stunning and blinding them which is good if there is a gank or large crowd engagement, pull them with her q which is great for pealing, use her e and run in which is great for early game/warding, one on ones, or countering ganks, or she can protect her ally with her w then throw them into battle which is great if the ally is tanky or for surprise/tactical attacks, to prevent trolls her w can be countered by an ally who does not want to be picked up by clicking the ground. Her E is great if the enemies are low on health, or if the ally or enemies can disengage easily.\n\nHeidi also has four ways of retreating, she could throw her ult, blinding enemies, and run away, Q them slowing them so she can run away or keep them slow enough to use her w, use her q to pull her to her allies and run away, use her w on enemies so she can stun them and run away, or use her e and with the added armor and magic resist hope she can run away.\n\nShe can also help allies engage or disengage by both roping them and pulling herself to them so she can distract the enemy while her ally has increased movement speed with her q, using her q on enemies and pulling them out of battle so the adc can engage them in a one on one, or using her w on her allies and throwing them into battle or away from it.\n\nAlso while her w is active on an ally they are untargetable by most damage types and can attack and use abilities which are great for either engagement or saving their life. It is important to note that while her abilities are powerful she is very risk/reward oriented.\n\nAll of her abilities have a weakness. Her Q is a channeled ability and channels can be interrupted. Her w on an ally can be interrupted and lasts a short time. And if her w is used on an enemy it only stuns them if they hit terrain.  Her e is awesome and helps make her tanky enough to take damage with ease but does require a constant mana flow and only lasts a short time.  Her E also has a wait timer before it can be used to damage enemies which can be prevented by staying out of sight. Her ult may have a short cool down but it takes a while to gain stacks of Hay bale and it has a limited range. \n\nWhile her damage output and potential are great you have to be good enough to know your weaknesses and be able to prevent them from being abused. Sustain damage/heavy range can mean the death of her so it is important to be aware of your surroundings at all time when either playing as or against Heidi. This means that Heidi can be great but is hard to use. Despite this at any skill level she provides plenty of support for allies. Thus she fits the support role very well with a kit unlike most others that concentrates on keeping the ADC alive while supplying plenty of damage and cc.\n\nHeidi's kit focuses less on straight damage or heals/shields and more on combos/control. You can string together her abilities in all sorts of ways. All of Heidi's moves work together to create a fair and balanced, decent bot or top laner, with good cc decent cs if needed and plenty of versatility. This champ is completely ready, workable, and completely unique of all other champs.\n\nBasic combos: Ready up E. Q enemy pull them away from group and into hands of ADC, R that enemy if they try to get away or pick up the adc with the w and throw them at the enemy. Throw out your E. Ult for additional stun if needed. String in some basic attacks in there and you are home free.\n\nSecond Combo: Ready up your E. Use your vision to scout out the enemy. Ult the Enemy. Q to your ally. W them and throw them at the enemy. E them and finish them off.\n\nThird Combo: Let your ADC engage and stay towards back. Ready up your E. Q to your ADC. W them to make them untargetable. Throw them behind enemy team. Ult enemy team as they try to engage ADC. Throw out your E for added damage then ready it again.\n\nMore intense combo: This combo works when you already throw out your hay bale. For this to work make sure Hay Bale is 650 feet from River bush in either direction preferably towards your tower. Let your enemies push into position. W your ally and throw them into your bush from river bush. Q your ally to follow them. Ready up your E. Throw out another bush on enemy. Throw out your E.\n\nIf this champ ever were created I would ask for nothing in return but a free version of her. Thank you for all of your time and please reply to the post.\n\nQuotes/Jokes/taunts\nHeidi's voice is sweet with a hint of southern bell...\n\nSelection: Finally\n\nMovement: get up with it.\n I reckon. \nI got's a hankerin for revenge.\n\nAttacking: well I'm happier than a dog with two peters.\nMangy varmint.\n\nJoke: but I just got all gussied up (scratches inner thigh and blows nose by holding the other hand against her nostril)\n\nTaunt: come give me some sugar (puckers up drooling). \nPoop or get off the pot already (squats down). \nDid you get hit with an ugly stick or just a pitchfork (lifts pitchfork)\n\nDance: the watermelon crawl.... you don’t know what that is look it up....\n\nRecall animation: Trick Roping, doing everything from the buterfly around the world andover the shoulder, to the vertical loop and texas skip and finally finishes with a flat loop over herself that goes up till the recall ends.\n\nStat priorities: 1. Armor: Health and armor from one stat would give Heidi a good amount of protection against heavy hitting ADCs. 2. Magic resist: This is a great stat that not only protects you from magic damage but it also gives you bonus mana which is essential to keeping Heidi alive. 3. Attack damage: This stat helps Heidi have a decent early game damage output. 4. Ability power: great late game damage potential and increases the damage for her q and e as well as the potential of the movement boost or slow. 5. Mana regen do to her high mana costs and long cool downs mana regen helps out a lot when it comes to getting that mana and maintaining pressure. 6. Cool down reduction, health, and health regen help out a lot but are not essential.\n\nRunes: it is essential to balance runes according to what stats are lacking. Acceptable marks include hybrid penetration, attack speed, and attack damage. Acceptable seals include armor, percent health, scaling health or scaling mana regen. Acceptable glyphs include scaling ability power, magic resist, scaling magic resist, and cool down reduction. Acceptable quintessences include experience, gold, movement speed, hybrid penetration, attack speed, attack damage, armor, percent health, scaling health, scaling mana regen, scaling ability power, magic resist, scaling magic resist, and cool down reduction.\n\nItemization: {{item:3026}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3025}} all good choices of armor items\n\n{{item:3222}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3112}}  all good magic resist items\n\n{{item:3078}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3172}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3071}}  all good attack Damage/hybrid Items\n\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3092}}  all good ability power items\n\n{{item:3800}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3184}} {{item:3023}} {{item:3056}}  all good movement/hybrid items\n\n{{item:3004}} {{item:3003}}  (good mana Items not already listed)\n\n{{item:3050}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3401}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3158}}  all good cooldown reduction/utility items\n\n{{item:3083}} {{item:3084}} {{item:3022}}  All good Health Items\n\nAny boots choice is good.\n\nAny combination of these Items is great to have on Heidi depending on what exactly you want her to do. Heidi is all about Balance and as a tank you want tankier items. These work the best. As a support you want utility/supportive items, and depending on the circumstances some of these items are better than others but it varies on the situation.\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper Review","date":"2014-12-14T03:01:22.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When someone takes the time to offer you advice, acting abrasive towards them is a poor way to repay them.

They honestly arent as complicated as they seem I just simply stated every single intricacy. I did not have to but I have had issues of people understanding her abilities without that much detail which is why I added it. I wanted it to be completely clear as to what the abilities do. No they are not as buggy as they seem. In fact they are quite simple, it is just the detail is needed to clarify exactly how they work. I am sorry to sound rude or mean when I respond but it seems that people have a difficulty understanding what her abilities do, and I hate when people just skim and assume things especially when they are very obviously detailed otherwise to combat that very confusion. I am sure if Heidi were in game her skill details would be less intricate and these details would be provided outside of her kit via a champion spotlight, or other video. If you look at the past few champions that have been released they have all been somewhat esoteric. Jinx, Braum, Azir, Kalista and now Rek'Sai because they have been made for Tournaments, which is what Riot cares about anyways. They are not made for normal people and that is the point and why Heidi fits so well. Riot has already reviewed a past version of her and have told me very positive reviews. Her abilities or similar ones have been impimented into the game because of this. She was actually originally made before Braum or Jinx. And since then parts of her kit or stats or ideas have been implimented into the game. You can see that they have been changed slightly if not a lot but they are still there. Braum's stand behind me is a perfect example of a modified version of her on ally q. The whole Idea that they were both farmers and both support tanks is another perfect example. Just look and you will see the correlations between Heidi and newer champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-10T03:07:37.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay Vbunnie, I'm home for the weekend and now have some time to convert my notes into a cohesive and digestible format.

The passive doesn't just give stats for the sake of stats it supports a Tank build for Heidi and helps dampen the blow of her high mana costs and the magic resist build specifically caters to her e also it can be countered by any sort of ability that lowers her armor or ,aviv resist. the q can do for a change and I like your idea of that change. The w will be changed to just an ally cast and the damage on the q will be increased slightly to reflect this. The e while it does have a toggle and it can appear as a false positive is specifically and tactically given so so that when combined with her passive it supports a more Tank build which dampens the issues on mana and it makes the champion difficult to master making you choose balance over a one pure stat build this balance will change depending on who you are matched against and how you want to play Heidi that match. Heidi's identity is one that is a mana hungry utililty based support who happens to be also be a tank. I know if is not on the levels of Braum because she is not trying to be Braum she is far more utility based and more of a rush in for the kill surprise tank style tank rather than a front line balls to the wall style tank although she can easily be front line if need be.a close example would be someone like gragas blitz rank or thresh maybe even nautilus way ober Braum. Yes these champs aren't really tanks but they are sort of tanks or at least they can be played as one what they lack in front line standings they make up in supportability and utility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BigBenClockTower","date":"2014-12-17T21:02:59.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoa! Lots of debate here. But I digress, I'll leave my comments on the kit as a fellow competitor, and because you left comments on Norme.\n\nSo, where to start? I'll tackle these in order, as well as format them for easier readability for others who see my comment.\n\n> **Innate:** Rebellion / Rugged\n*Rebellion:* Heidi does not perform forced actions, nor can she be knocked up; instead she is snared for the duration of such effects. This effect can only trigger once every 12 seconds. If this skill is on cooldown, Heidi is stunned for the duration of these effects.\n\nI like this so far. It's clean, does its job well, and works great for tankier Champions, who should ideally be able to shrug off some forms of attack through pure bulk, or special ability. A better tie in to her backstory would cement the deal of this being a great passive. I'd lower the cooldown a tad to be more in line with other effects based on timers, (Nautilus' **Staggering Blow** is a 9 / 8 / 7 / 6 second cooldown, for example, while Jarvan's **Martial Cadence** is a 10 / 8 / 6), but the way it is now, it's very workable.\n\n> *Rugged:* For every point of bonus armor, Heidi gains one point of bonus health, and for every point of bonus magic resist, Heidi gains two points of bonus mana. The bonus health or mana gained from these abilities cannot drop below 0.\n\nThis is a sketchier passive. The effects seem very negligible as they are, and could probably use buffing. I'd suggest something more akin to other \"Buff\" passive Champions. My recommendation?\n\n\"*Rugged:* Heidi receives 150% of her total armor as bonus health, and 200% of her total magic resist as bonus mana.\"\n\nWhile the numbers seem scary, considering that the tankiest I've ever gotten in game (while still being useful) was a 240 armor / 140 magic resist Shen, basic math proves otherwise. With 240 total armor, 150% makes it 360 bonus health, which is a good amount, and comparable to other similar passives. Magic resist being harder to itemize for, you can make that number a bit higher, like 250% (140 becomes 350) bonus mana, since people would need to go out of their way to maximize the value here, and will lose out on health, among other stats.\n\nEven at the absolute maximum, a 400+ total armor Heidi would gain 600 health, which, while strong, is at the expense of everything else, thus balancing it, while 600 mana (at 300 magic resist) isn't game breaking in the slightest. I'd recommend, however, that you scrap one of the two passives, and move the scrapped one to a different Champion. **Rebellion** (rename it to **Rebellious** perhaps?) and **Rugged** need to be made negligible in order to coexist, and that isn't fun for anyone. I like the idea behind both however.\n\nNow onward to her Q! Apologies for reformatting it a bit. I want to make it more readable so I can elaborate on it.\n\n> **Rope Em:** [Q - Point Targeted Linear Colliding Skill Shot]\n> Heidi pulls out her lasso and spins it over her head, channeling for up to 2 seconds. While channeling, she gradually increases the range and effects of **Rope Em** over 1.5 seconds. Heidi can cast **Rope Em** at any time during the channel to immediately throw the lasso (with lessened effect).\n\n> Heidi can still move while channeling, but she cannot use basic attacks or her other abilities, and her movement speed is reduced by 25%. **Hand Torch** remains active if it was activated before Heidi begins channeling.\n\n>*On Enemy:* **Rope Em** deals magic damage to the first enemy Champion or minion hit, and pulls them toward Heidi. If **Rope Em** was channeled for at least 0.5 seconds, it additionally slows the enemy hit. The slow starts after the pull is completed and does not apply to Hay Bales.\n\n> *On Ally:* **Rope Em** pulls Heidi to the first ally hit by the lasso. If a Hay Bale is hit, it is pulled to Heidi, and all enemies that are caught in its path are knocked aside. If **Rope Em** was channeled for at least 0.5 seconds, it additionally grants bonus movement speed to the hit ally. The movement speed bonus does not apply to Hay Bales.\n\n> **Cost:** 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 / 110 Mana\n> **Cooldown:** 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 Seconds\n> **Magic Damage:** 75 / 120 / 165 / 210 / 255 (+ 75% AP)\n\n> **Range:** 700 ~ 1150\n> **Range Increase per 0.5 Seconds:** 150\n> **Projectile Speed:** 1900\n\n> **Minimum Slow / Movement Speed Increase:** 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0% (+ 0% per AP)\n> **Maximum Slow / Movement Speed Increase:** 15 / 22.5 / 30 / 37.5 / 45% (+ 0.03% AP)\n> **Slow / Movement Speed Increase per 0.5 Seconds:** (5 / 7.5 / 10 / 12.5 / 15% (+ 0.01% per AP)\n\n> **Minimum Slow / Movement Speed Increase Duration:** 0 Seconds\n> **Maximum Slow / Movement Speed Increase Duration:** 3 Seconds\n> **Slow / Movement Speed Duration Increase per 0.5 Seconds:** 1 Second\n\n> **Additional Notes**\n> * If an enemy or ally is inside a Hay Bale when Heidi pulls it with **Rope Em**, the enemy or ally inside the Hay Bale is pulled as well.\n> * **Rope Em** does not interrupt allies, and can be used on all unit types and Hay Bales, with the exception of structures and terrain.\n\nWhoa, okay, so that was a mouthful! **Rope Em** seems really cool as an ability, but it seems a bit overloaded as far as what it does. It tries to do way too much, and is actually a tad too strong. The interaction with **Hay Bale** is neat though, and the mechanics are sound for a linear collision skill shot with displacement. It's mana cost seems a bit steep for a Support / Tank, but is passable for the effects provided.\n\nIf anything, I'd hit the damage first. Lower the damage (or remove it entirely) and put the focus on the slow, and this way, you can create a unique \"grab\" ability that fits more in line with a Support / Tank. Lessening or removing damage also lets you slightly bump up the scaling on the slow and movement speed buff, and potentially lower the cooldown (most of the similar abilities are between 16-20 seconds for rank 1 cooldowns, so an extra 2 seconds is a bit stifling).\n\nIn fact, removing the damage would be the quickest way to balance this ability very nicely, and fit in with the Support / Tank niche Heidi fulfills. Now, for the W. Again, I reformatted it, for my own sake, apologies.\n\n> **Pitchfork:** [W - Single-Target]\n> *On Enemy:* Heidi stabs her pitchfork into the target, dealing physical damage to them while throwing them 650 feet in the direction she is facing. If the target hits terrain while being thrown, they are stunned. Stabbed enemies cannot be thrown over terrain.\n\n> *On Ally:* Heidi grabs the target with her pitchfork, lifting them into the air. While holding a target, Heidi can move around freely, carrying the target with her. While being carried, the target is completely invulnerable. Any effects the target would otherwise receive will affect Heidi instead. The target is freed if Heidi loses 10% of her current health while carrying them, or if they walk away from Heidi. After a short period of time (unless it was canceled) the target is thrown 650 feet in the direction of the targets cursor. The target can be thrown over terrain, and all [enemy?] units within a small impact point are knocked up.\n\n> *On Hay Bale:* Heidi stabs her pitchfork into the targeted Hay Bale, consuming the active Hay Bale while adding a stack of **Hay Bale**. If there is one ally or enemy within the Hay Bale when it is picked up, then they are subjected to **Pitchfork's** usual effect. If there are multiple targets in a single Hay Bale, extra targets will not be picked up, but will lose the cover of the Hay Bale.\n\n> Heidi's next **Hay Bale** activation within 10 seconds deals 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 50% AD) (+ 30% AP) [magic damage?], to all enemies within 350 range of the Hay Bale. This bonus effect does not stack.\n\n> **Cost:** 100 / 110 / 120 / 130 / 140 Mana\n> **Cooldown:** 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 / 10 Cooldown\n> **Physical Damage:** 60 / 95 / 130 / 165 / 200 (+ 60%  AD)\n\n> **Stab Range:** 150\n> **Throw Range:** 650\n\n> **Lift / Stun Duration:** 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 Seconds\n> **Knock Up Duration:** 0.5 / 0.75 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 seconds\n> **Knock-Up AoE Range:** 250\n\n> **Additional Notes**\n> * Heidi cannot use basic attacks while an ally is being carried with **Pitchfork**.\n> * If a carried ally activates a movement altering ability, it counts as walking away from Heidi. This includes channeled spells like **Recall** or **Teleport**.\n>  * If Heidi is killed while carrying an ally, the ally is immediately released.\n>  * **Pitchfork** allows the user to move an allied target, but does not prevent that target from moving away from Heidi. **Pitchfork** does not cancel spells being cast, and cannot be used to pick up an ally whom is casting **Recall** or **Teleport**.\n> * While being carried, allies can basic attack, as well as use abilities.\n> * Heidi can have **Hand Torch** active while she is carrying an ally, but she cannot cast any abilities (including **Hand Torch**) while doing so.\n\nSo wordy. This ability seems like it could have a treasure trove of problems. Namely, interacting with your allies in a troll-ish fashion. Plus, those allies have so many outs to it that it defeats the ability's purpose. I'd recommend you highly focus on the enemy cast component, as a throw with impale is always good fun, and a perfect disengage tool for a Support / Tank to have, while allowing them some damage (especially if you remove the damage on **Rope Em**). I like the Hay Bale interactions though. Really clever design. I'd need to look more at **Hay Bale** though before I can make final thoughts there. The mana cost is also steeper than the [Trango Towers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trango_Towers), and the cooldown makes it a bit too hard to use effectively.\n\nThat's all I have for now. I'm still digesting **Hand Torch / Torch Throw** and **Hay Bale**. I'll post on those as a reply to this when I'm done analyzing.

You can get out of the ability by walking away or trying to while being picked up (ie right clicking the ground) or by using something like a recall or flash or any other movement based ability. Yes you can be picked up but it does not interupt spellcasts or abilities, or recall (so no trolls here). And if you dont like it just right click the ground. Long cooldown and high mana cost means you cannot spam it and the ally does not have to worry about a troll. Again just walk away. And even if you were picked up (you are immune to damage and can cast abilities also after a short period of time you will be thrown in the direction of your choosing and if you dont like it you can flash away which would drop you or just right click the ground). That means you are not interupted. (that means there is no way to possibly troll.) Literally no way....... Tell me what is troll about it.. You are yet to give me a scenario where it would be used in a troll fashion. Flash into an enemy (really not a problem right click the ground before she flashes or just wait till you are thrown or you can use this opportunity do deal damage i mean you still can use basic attacks and abilities so kill them already or just snare/stun them till you can get away.

The ability says \"Kalista draws her Oathsworn ally next to her, vanishing them and disabling their spells for 4 seconds.\"\n\nCool. If that ally was about to cast a spell, no dice. No Sona **Crescendo**, no **Cataclysm** from Jarvan, etc. It trolls so hard. Now, take that concept, but allow the spell to be cast (as **Pitchfork** allows).\n\nOops, I used **Pitchfork** and picked up Sona. She was about to cast **Crescendo** and by purposefully moving away from the enemy team, I have her whiff it. Now we lose the teamfight. Oops?\n\nAlso, movement nothing, it has cast time. Sona can't \"move to escape the lift\". I just trolled my team by losing us a teamfight. A costly troll, sure, 140 mana and a 10 second cooldown, but I did it.\n\nNow why is Kalista's **Fate's Call** okay? It has a 90 / 75 / 60 second cooldown, and it's her R. Her ultimate ability, that only gets 3 ranks. Heidi's **Pitchfork** as it is can get 5 ranks, is a W ability, so not an ultimate, and has a potential 6 second cooldown at max cooldown reduction (Kalista's **Fate's Call** is, at best, a 36 second cooldown).\n\nThere is massive trolling potential on **Pitchfork**, you just need to consider the other Champions in the game, and how certain abilities and stats work. Then rework the ability to cover these edge cases.\n\nI again recommend keeping the \"pick up and throw enemies for damage\" aspect. It's useful on a Support / Tank for peel and damage. I'd scrap or rework the rest of the ability.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2014-12-14T00:22:39.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you comment without insulting me?

Ok Yasuo, Malzahar, Akali, Aatrox, Rumble, Azir, Galio, Cassiopeia, and Rammus) Yeah what was this about not being double sided? Honestly compared to these Champions it isnt that bad, and while it does provide some extra health or mana it isnt that overpowered or rediculous to consider especially since it is important to help counter her high mana costs, long cooldowns, and increase the effectiveness of her w. Which with this important aspect can easily max out above 3000 especially since she is a tank and armor/magic resist would reduce the damage heidi, recieves by about 75% at 300, and the fact that you can build health along with other stats with a single item or so. \n\nshe can still use her torch throw. There are also Items that remove stuns and such and you can reduce the duration of stuns with items. And the fact that no champion in the game has a stun for three seconds. Yeah that really isnt possible. and you would have to be in range for that to work and that would assume that she is alone. You can also say that same thing about any champion that has an ability for a duration. That is also assuming that you hit her at all. Yeah it probably is really hard to do what you are suggesting. Also you forget there are champions like Karthus who have way more mana drain per second that you can say the same thing about. Understand there are tons of champs in the league with similar abilities and Heidi's really aren't as overpowered as you think. You obviously cant read. Also know that in order to combat 30mana per second you would have to have a mana regen of over 150 in order to make it completely void because mana regen is on a mana per 5 seconds kind of deal. So that would mean she would have to be able to produce 150 mana every 5 seconds which I might add is 100 times her base mana regen.....Yeah...Umm I dont think there is any item or set of Items that can make you produce 100 times your base mana regen.....

I only really advise this from personal experience that sometimes the lore I have made doesn't say anything about the character which technically your lore here does not do that either. Only the synopsis really tells anything about Heidi and that could easily be redone to be an intro paragraph for the character proper.\n\nOkay, skipping over base stats since at best I could nitpick that all base magic resists are 30 not 30.5, Your innate is..weird to me. The having 2 innate powers seems very much akin to Yasuo whom is very well designed in that way that he has much duality to his kit, which in turn reflects the 2 sides of his story. Heidi's story though is more straightforward in being she is now, and pardon my pun, \"a rebel without a cause\" because her purpose in life before was avenging her father, and then protecting her farm. With her father already avenged though, and her farm long gone, she would seem to have no reason to go forward. Now if you tried to reduce your innate to just one of these passives then that would make it much easier to understand having them.\n\nTo look at the stats of the innate, the first one is actually fine on its own if a bit unorthodox in how it works (I'd just as soon say she gets a spell shield and tenacity, that's something nobody else has right now either). For the Rugged effect I'd say that you should flip it around and let health and mana supplement your armor and mr instead, as you could get more meaningful bonuses to them that way. Now if you are wanting to support building armor and mr because they increase other stats, and maybe you want to lea towards getting certain items, then I would change the numbers because 1 for 1 or 1 for 2 is too low to me for health and mana bonuses. One last thing is I would probably just drop one of these passives in favor of the other one so you can increase the power of it to be more effective.\n\nSooo, that is the only ability I can look at and honestly say I understand with any amount of ease. Your problem here seems to be the opposite of the problem with your reviews that most people have, being that your reviews are seen as too short and over simplified, but here you are way too specific. Now don't get me wrong, I do understand each of the abilities, and they actually look like that work really well when thinking of them altogether. But you need to simplify your explanations of them. Take a look at your q for instance:\n\n> Effect on enemy: Heidi throws out her lasso. Rope Em deals magic to the first enemy unit champion or minion hit and pulls them toward Heidi.\n> If Rope Em has been channeled for at least .5 seconds it additionally slows the enemy hit by a percentage per half second channeled for a duration two times the time channeled and stops increasing once Rope Em reaches maximum range.\n> The slow starts immediately after the pull is completed and does not apply to hay Bale.\n> \n> Effect on ally: Heidi throws out her lasso. If the first unit, champion, or minion hit is an ally, Heidi pulls herself to the ally.\n> If a Hay Bale is hit it is pulled to Heidi and all enemies that are caught in the path of the moving hay bale are knocked aside.\n> Damage is not dealt to allies or hay bale.\n> Additionally if Rope Em has been channeled for at least .5 seconds the ally effected gains bonus movement speed based on the amount of time channeled for a duration equal to two times the amount of time spent channeling and stops increacing once Rope Em reaches maximum range.\n> The movement speed bonus does not apply to Hay Bale and allies/Hay Bales effected by Rope Em do not take damage as a result of Heidi pulling them.That wall of text is just as easily understood when said like this:\n\nHeidi throws out her lasso and will have a differing effect depending on what she hits.\nEnemies: Take magic damage and are pulled toward Heidi. They are also slowed after being pulled for a time equal to double the time spent channeling.\nAllies: Heidi will pull herself to the ally and increase their movement speed afterwards for a duration equal to double the time spent channeling.Hay Bale: Heidi will pull the Hay Bale, and any ally or enemy inside it, to her location. No damage or speed increase/decrease is applied to champions inside a pulled Hay Bale (assuming this since you don't say).\n\nI highly doubt any human being is capable of hitting key so fast that your channel time is less than at lest .5 sec, so there is no need to state that as a minimum time. Additionally it can go without saying that you don't interrupt allies by pulling yourself to them or that you don't damage them or your immune to damage Hay Bale. And to cut off a potential counter point, it would also go without saying that pulling someone inside a Hay Bale would obviously interrupt channel times. (oddly enough you don't say what happens with the channel if you don't cast it or if the spell automatically goes off at full duration, something you actually had a problem with on my champion)\n\nAll of your abilities are suffering from these overly formal explanations and if you just simplified them a little you can get them across better. I wouldn't really make any changes to the abilities themselves except have your Torch go from a mana per sec, to a limited duration with a secondary cast and have Hay Bale only count as semi-passable terrain like brush is, but still be targetable by your abilities. Vayne Condemn and Poppy Heroic Charge don't actually apply to brush they apply to the walls behind them so you should make the appropriate changes to account for that. One thing I would definitely change about your description for the Hay bale is that there is a difference between the active range of say throwing the hay and then the size of the AoE that the hay covers.\n\nFor the stats of the abilities I have very little I can say with my limited experience. I do think your damage overall is very high considering that amount of hard CC and utility you have. You longest stun you can have on someone right now is 4 sec plus the time it takes to pull an enemy to you with your q. I'm pretty sure the closest equivalent is how long Blitzcrank can stop a person from spell casting by pulling, knocking up and then silencing a person, and that last part only applies to spells, not all actions entirely, so you may want to nerf that.\n\nOtherwise though I like your champion and would love to have her as a support, especially when I adc Ashe so that they could have such awesome synergy to make Ashe's quote, \"Escape my arrow? I think not.\", totally true!","replies":[{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2014-12-15T18:10:22.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Honestly this has been the most helpful and well thought review to date.

Paragraphs!\n\n---\n\n**Passive 1:** At best, this turns Heidi into a specialised counterpick that ruins certain champions but is a dead passive most of the time. At worst, they pick Janna and press R in every teamfight and lol all over your face. Or they pick Vayne/Poppy and now they have a point and click stun. Rammus isn't viable in the new jungle, there is no need for a passive that hoses him and him alone.\n\nWhy not make this work on all cc, reducing hard cc to soft cc?\n\n**Passive 2:** It's balanced, but it's also one of those double dip passives Riot wants to move away from, which is why Vlad sucks and Kayle received a rework. (Don't bring up Azir without considering what his build would look like without it)\n\n**Q:** I see someone plays Oracle in Dota. This spell may do a little too much, but let's just call it a CertainlyT spell and it's fine. The slow scaling seems almost pointless (it takes 500 AP to add the equivalent of one spell level) and the damage seems to start a tad too low compared to other spells with a 50 damage ramp.\n\nOh, and there's the ability to pull an ally across 1000 distance towards you without their permission. TROLOLOL.\n\n**W:** The description says you can use it on allies but the stats mention enemies? Assuming it can do both, it is insanely OP on solitary enemies (2 second impale + long range throw??) and duplicates Kalista's ult on allies. In both cases the 5% clause makes it useless in teamfights because that translates into about 150 damage *at most*. Preventing your ally from attacking just to spare them from 150 damage is pointless.\n\nWorse, if the incoming cc somehow does NOT break the spell, it actually ccs both of you - you're cc'd and your ally is stuck to you until they launch themselves. That's worse than useless.\n\nHaybale damage bonus is slightly above zero, though not enough to matter.\n\n**E:** The defensive toggle is fair and the anti-facecheck component is ok. Mana curve is weird: it goes up so slowly that the mana cost could easily become irrelevant later on if you have some mana regen items or blue buff, removing all counterplay.\n\nThe point target ability cannot work because pressing the button again turns the toggle back off (derp). Which is a good thing because it's rather special: long ranged point and click with **very** high level 1 damage (100+) but shit scaling and 0 mana cost. If this ability actually worked, you can bet I'd sit in lane and spamspamspam this over and over until the enemy dies. Even if it required the toggle to be active, you can just activate the toggle 0.1 seconds before you throw the torch, increasing the mana cost from 0 to 22-30. Oh noes.\n\nAlso, the burn field spawned when you hit a hay bale has 400 radius but the explosion aoe has a pointlessly small 100 radius. A melee attack is 125 (175 for spear wielders) and a Teemo is 62.5 units across. You physically can't hit more than two enemies with it and only if they're bumping up against each other's hitbox. Not happening.\n\n**R:** Drop the impassible terrain clause, unless you're cool with Vayne impaling a target to a haybale. Hell, if Poppy charges a target *inside* the haybale, it doesn't move them at all but immediately stuns them. This actually kind of negates her passive.\n\nYou did avoid an infinite stun loop, but you STILL have a fast moving AoE 2 second stun plus a completely unavoidable (500 radius) AoE 2.5 second blind every 12 seconds with enough CDR - the stack recharge rate is slower, but you can give yourself a stack back every 6 seconds so that doesn't matter. Technically it's only on par with Cho's Q, but most other cc tank ults have similar power on a much longer cooldown.\n\nThrowing haybales at your carry to prevent them from getting clicked on is pointless and hiding in a haybale to charge up Q in safety is pointless because the effect when thrown at enemies is so good that it eclipses everything else, which in turn mandates a cooldown, which nerfs the ability for all other purposes. Remove or greatly nerf the CC and then get rid of the cooldown to open up the ability to other uses.","replies":[{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2014-12-13T22:29:25.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2014-12-13T22:33:54.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vbunnie,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Z9NJTTfE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2014-12-13T22:29:25.116+0000)\n> Q: please read descriptions and notes before making blanket statements. If you read the description on the q you would realize that heidi does not pull allies instead she pulls herself to the allies. Meaning that person pushing too far...well heidi just joined the fight and picked them up so they could retreat or whatever they were wanting to do. Also note the damage and all of that was created from fusing all of the pulls and similar abilities in the game and is actually more similar to an adverage between thresh and Blitz pulls so yeah.\n> \n> \n> W: again read descriptions and notes on abiliites. You would realize there is a tidbit on allies and enemies and that they have very different effects. I know that the enemies section can be hard to see but I will fix that. Also note that the ally champion can attack while lifted. So yeah. Also note that heidi was created before kalista and actually has to be in melee range to pick up an ally unlike Kalista and that Heidi does have that issue of being able to be pulled and such, which makes it not an ult anymore and more in the normal ability range. It also has a huge manacost to compensate for this. \n> \n> E: with the changes to the current mana regen items and such it actually is a lot less easy to counter the cost then you could think. Also note that other abilities have similar costs. Also note that having it a toggle ability means you can turn it off but after three seconds of revealing an enemy it automatically turns into the second ability. Which isnt the same thing as a toggle. Yes you can toggle it on and off before that but then you lose the vision of the enemy which could be a  problem if you are not careful. \n> \n> R: The haybales have a vary long duration and can be interacted with her other abilities. You forget this. Yes at first I would definately suggest using it on an enemy but understand 650 range is not very far and only half of the inner circle can be exposed on cast. Also note that the 500 is diameter and not radius get your measurements right. Diameter is a measure fully across. Radius is a measure from the center to the most outer point.  That means it is not completely unavoidable and you need to go back and relearn geometry or take the time to read things.  Also note that other champions like graves have similar sized aoes so it is completely ok and can probably effect more than 2 people at a time assuming you use its sides. The stun might effect only one or two but the blind will probably effect more. This is also about the size of if not exactly the size of a Ziggs ult which can be avoided.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2014-12-13T14:23:01.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(character limit)\n\nGameplay has some nice aspects (haybales, Q) but she also contains a Kalista combo that works on everyone. There is a reason why Kalista's ult doesn't work on everyone, and that reason is that the oathbound knows he's going to get pulled while *everyone else knows they're not getting pulled* and don't need to worry about it.\n\nRecommendation: nerf the cc on R and remove the timer, then ditch W altogether for being both OP and useless at the same time and put something less wonky in its place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2014-12-07T06:58:04.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Took me awhile to find you :P anyway, let's with who she is as a person:\n\nI personally like the idea of Heidi, but she seems like your average rough-and-tumble cowgirl with a rather lacking story and personality which is kind of boring to be completely honest.

Yes I do understand that it is the end of an age. That is the point it is the end of the time where she came from. I never said it was a city. You are the one who thought it was a huge city Speaking of Cities Zaun was a huge City. That skyline was of Zaun and from Zaun you can see the skylines of the other cities if you travel far enough from the smog. All I said was it was a home, and I never said where it was either which could easily be and where I envisioned it to be in the forest somewhere between Zaun and The Institute of war. I also never said that this home was not there before. Nor did I mention that Mr. Rightheart used to be a Lumber Jack and butcher and that Mrs. RightHeart was a hunter. They were in the woods working. I also didn't mention that they the Revenge Corps was a group of Seige survivors living in the woods fighting back from any outside invader. You also seem to assume that they were just walking around when in all honesty the story makes sense you just have to draw conclusions based on the information provided.

But just to prevent these kinds of misunderstandings in the future, I'd recommend mentioning these things in the lore rather than leaving detail(that, for me and I'm sure others, is rather important) to interpretation.
