His early game damage is quite high and if he can in fact build a high ap or attack damage this can set him over his oponents in the late game. At late game this damage falls off but his cc is greatly improved to compensate. While Earl has high modifiers to his damage this is because his damage does not increase as he levels. This is to compensate for that and when compared to other similar champions when you take into account he is roughly even if not a little overpowered yet unreliably so. When you combine this with his long cooldowns they are roughly comparatively the same if not Ear is a little underpowered.\nEarl is best in mid bot or even top lanes if he needs to be he can pretty much go anywhere. \nEarl can do a large amount of damage by sustaining harrasment with his cooldown reduction, while he might not have upfront damage it is definately sustained damage.\nA good strategy when using earl would be to go for the q early game. Follow that with the w then go for the e. Leveling  up whatever you would like is fine but it is important to understand earls basic combo. What you do is place his e in desired locations. Wrack up opponents and properly fire that break so that you can send those enemies into your holes where you follow up with basic attacks and maintained damage and ult when needed alternatively a more complex combo would be to fire off that e. Then w the enemy into the e. Then time that q properly to pull them from the hole as the ability ends and then follow up with another w into a hole. \n\n\n\nAbilities:\nPassive: Cue Ball: Each Ability cast increases Earl's attack speed by 10% for 3 seconds and decreases his other ability cooldowns by 2 seconds.\n(Notes: This ability can stack on itself however each stack only lasts 3 seconds.  Enemies include champions, minions, pets, and structures other than turrets)\n\n\n\nQ: Wrack em up: ground targeted circular aoe \nExplanation:  Earl uses his power of gravity to create an area of high gravity that slows targets within it. After a short delay the area explodes dealing magic damage and pulling targets within the area to the center of it.\nCooldown: 16/15/14/13/12\nRange: 675\nDiameter of AOE: 350 target area\nSlow: 15/20/25/30/35 (+.04 per ap)%\nSlow Duration: 1.5/2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds\nDelay before explosion: .75/1/1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds\nDamage: 55/75/95/115/135(+50/60/70/80/90%AP) magic damage\nCost: 70/75/80/85/90mana\n\n\n\nW: Break: Linear collision skill shot with collision point knockback\nExplanation: Earl sends a bolt of force that slows down by 10/15/20/25/30 units every 50 units it travels in target direction. The first enemy hit and any enemies within a 325 diameter area around that target are damaged and knocked back away from the target in the direction they were to the target.   The knockback distance is reduced by 10/14/20/25/30 units every 50 units the skillshot travels before hitting a target. The original target is knocked back in the direction that the skillshot was traveling.\n(note tremor appears like a thin burrow beneath the earth in a linear form)\nCooldown: 14/13/12/11/10 seconds\nRange: 750 \nDamage: 70/90/110/130/150 (+30/35/40/45/50% total AP + 30/35/40/45/50% Total AD) physical Damage\nMaximum Knockback Distance: 400/500/600/700/800 units\nminimum knockback distance:250/275/300/325/350 units\nMaximum skillshot speed: 1400/1500/1600/1700/1800 units/sec\nMinimum skillshot speed: 1250/1275/1300/1325/1350  units/sec\nCost: 70/75/80/85/90 Mana\n\n\n\nE: Corner pocket: Circular persistant Ground targeted AOE.\nExplanation: Earl uses his powers to create hole in the ground at target location.  Enemy champions minions or nuetral monsters who walk into it or are knocked into it fall in. If they do fall and are stunned for a duration and dealt damage per second in the hole after which they are freed and moved 300 units in the direction of their cursor. Multiple targets can fall into the same hole. Holes must be at least 150 units apart and each hole lasts 60 seconds. Each hole takes .5 seconds to form before it becomes active. \nCooldown: 20/19/18/17/16\nStun duration: .5/.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds\nDuration in hole: .5/.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds \nDiameter of aoe: 300\nRange: 500\nDamage per second: 150(+30%AP) magic damage\nTotal Magic Damage: 75(+15%Ap)/112.5(+22.5%Ap)/150(+30%Ap)/187.5(+37.5%Ap)/225(+45%AP)\nCost: 65/70/75/80/85 mana\n(note: the damage per second takes into account the quarter and half seconds) \n\n\n\nR: Momentum/Maximum Velocity\nEarl begins the game with one rank in momentum and can increase it at levels 6, 11 and 16.\nMomentum: Passive stacking physical on hit effect\nExplanation: Basic attacks on hit add a stack of momentum increasing Earl&rsquo;s basic attack damage per stack and generating mana on hit. Velocity can only be activated when Earl has the maximum number of momentum stacks.\nMaximum stacks: 10/12/14/16\nAttack damage per stack: 3/4/5/6\nMana on hit: 3/4/5/6\nLoses 1 stack every 3/3.5/4/4.5 seconds\nMaximum Velocity: Active/self buff\nExplanation: Earl consumes all stacks of momentum to become ultra powerful for 5/6/7/8 seconds while in this state Earl gains 20/25/30/35% movement speed, is immune to all forms of cc, and his abilities have 0 mana cost, his basic attacks still generate mana on hit but do not generate momentum and instead deal 20/25/30/35%Ap as bonus magic damage. Maximum Velocity can only be activated once every 60 seconds and the cooldown occurs at the end of the duration. \nCost: 10/12/14/16 momentum stacks and 75/100/125/150 mana\n\n\nLore: \nEarl was born into the underbelly of the Noxian Crime Ring. At a young age he discovered he was an expert pool player and mildly talented in gravity and force magics.  His mother was an accomplished cheat and made her living in the underground Noxian gambling rings. She played whatever possible and would utilize her son&rsquo;s talents whenever possible. Earl loved to cheat and gamble just as much his mom did.\nAs Earl grew up so did his skills and his addiction to gambling. One day he decided to combine his talents and began conning people by making them think he was terrible at pool just to get them to bet against him in a game. He would then suddenly reveal his skills winning the game and stealing their money from under their noses, like a shark, earning the title he would hold till the day he died.\nEventually he went on to be known as one of the most competitive pool players of all time building his magic skills along the way. He thought he was the best pool player in the world and unbeatable. Wearing his ego on his sleaves he challenged anyone he could find winning many tournaments and lots of money.\nOne day he challenged Efren Reyes and bet his life savings that he could beat him. This challenger easily defeated Earl causing him to lose it all in a single match. Devistated Earl realized he let his addiction get the best of him and made the journey to Ionia seeking enlightenment in an attempt to cure his addiction to gambling. \nAfter many long months journeying from temple to temple Earl eventually cured his addiction. Now free of his vice the Earl planned to make his way back to Noxius to showcase his new self. \nThat was until Syndra came down from her perch and began attacking the temple Earl resided in. \nChanneling what power he had he heroicly tried to defend himself. In one fowl swoop Syndra destroyed the temple. Taking what little power he could muster he lifted his arm to protect himself from her final blow.  Somehow the attack just vanished but destroyed his arm in the process.  Confused and thankful he did not die Earl Vowed he would never let anyone else make him feel so helpless ever again.\nIn an attempt to make him-self stronger he commissioned one of the great scientists of all time Viktor to create for him a new arm in place of his old one. This arm was augmented with a momentum building gatling cannon that would harness his natural energy into balls of plasma and increase his and their natural speed over time. With it Earl vowed to destroy Syndra and anyone else who got in his path or threatened his life.\n\n\nAttitude: Snarky sarcastic and egotistical\nRecall animation: Fires energy balls into the air catches them in his other hand and starts jugling them.\n\n\nLink to Mccc: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/rB0U0mBo-january-2015-mccc-weapons-and-elements","replies":[{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-05-10T18:02:05.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok bump again also a slight edit to the cooldown of the e","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-05-10T00:04:58.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really?-8? for what honestly it isnt a bad concept it is really good and people be hating it for no fucking reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-05-04T18:44:13.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really -6 come on guys it isnt a bad concept","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-05-01T00:41:14.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"another bump please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-04-27T21:32:22.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump it up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-04-27T00:51:19.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"umm yeah bump again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-04-23T20:02:28.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yeah anyways bump i guess","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kamiroo Wolf","date":"2015-04-19T20:17:07.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus I think that thumbnail gives them nightmares.
