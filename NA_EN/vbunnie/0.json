{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-01-01T05:27:19.186+0000","title":"January 2015 MCCC Weapons and Elements","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"Welcome to the January MCCC and the first of the VBunnie challenges. The VBunnie challenges  will be a series of recurring monthly champion creation contest style challenges. The winner each month, will be awarded with a mention in the rest of the VBunnie challenges, plenty of bragging rights, and an entrance in the hall of fame.  I might throw in some Rp if I feel generous. And you might possibly get your own personalized custom gif. Past concepts are welcome as long as they adhere to the rules for that month’s challenge. \n\nYou can enter up to 2 champs per month. Concepts do not have to be new. You can use past concepts and fleshed out ones as much as you would want but you must adhere to the rules of that month’s contest. \n\nJudges can be entrants but cannot judge their own entry.  Judges must post their availability to judge by the end of the second week, the 14th. If you choose to volunteer as a judge or make some contribution to the contest in some way that is fitting and betters it you will be given 1 bonus point if you choose to enter.\n\nThis is a monthly contest and will be broken down as such:\n\n      Week 1: entrants can reserve their spot in the contest. (The first -7th of the month)  Entrants will be accepted till the conclusion of the second week of the contest but must have at least a rough draft of their concept by that time.\n\n       Week 2: entrants must have a rough draft of their concept by the conclusion of the 14th, the Eastern Standard Time. (Rough drafts must include a rough lore and ability set as well as fully fleshed out base stats) (The 8th of the month -14th of the month).  \n\n      Week 3: this is the time where entrants will spend tweaking their Ideas. During this month reviews are encouraged and must include an in-depth look at a fellow competitor’s concept. This means a breakdown of every single ability, lore, etc. \n\n.5 bonus points will be given to a competitor each time they make a valid review for a maximum of 5 bonus points. \n\nNames, lore, stats, and abilities can change during this period but must be locked in by the end of the week any entrants who do not have these things fully fleshed out with numbers including cool downs will be disqualified.  (15th-21st of the month)\n\n      Week 4: Judging week. Judges will take this time to judge. Judges will go over every entry and the winner with the best fleshed out idea and adheres to the rules of that month will be crowned the winner. Winners will be announced at the end of the week. (22nd- the end of the month)\n\nRequirements for Contest:\n\n     -One full \"**Lore**\" section- Sufficiently describes the entry's background, motives, and source of skill set. For the initial application a 7-10 sentence paragraph that summarizes the champion’s origin is all that is needed, however entries are advised to expand on their background as much as possible to let the League properly be able to represent them to other champions on the Fields of Justice.\n\n      -One full \"**Info**\" section- Supplies the entry's name, title, and a description of their physique or \"base stats\" (base stats are not required until the end of the second week, any additional info may be added at the attending summoner's discretion).\n\n      -One full \"**Abilities**\" section- Supplies the entry's five main skills to be used on the Fields of Justice. Those skills being separated into one \"Innate\" ability (passive), three \"common\" abilities (Q,W,E), and their final \"ultimate\" ability (R). \n\nEach ability will be given its own description of the method used (basic description required 1st and 2nd week) and have set limitations (stats, which can be given within first 2 weeks, but not needed until end of 3rd).\n\n     -One full \"**Challenges**\" section- In an effort to ease the judging process, all entries must list at the bottom of their application how they fulfill all \"\n1. challenges\" imposed on them. This is to show the entry understands how they are completing the challenges set to them and to not have this at the end of the 2nd week will mean disqualification.\n\n     Grading Rubric: To be used by judges only do not grade if you are reviewing a fellow competitor only provide ways they can improve their concept. But do feel free to go over the following criteria when you review. \n\n      Information: 5 points. This section consists of a champion’s entry name, title, and base stats. Do they make sense to both the challenge and themselves? Are they balanced? \n\n      Lore: 15 points this is our way to know who you champion is. We're looking primarily at writing quality, characterization and creativity. Please note somewhere if English is not your native language, if you feel that may affect the overall quality. Does the entry fully explain their background or are they too vague? You have to be able to understand your character's motives and where they are coming from, and not just metaphorically speaking. Also does the lore adhere to the rules set by the challenge? \n\n      Abilities: 25 points these include resources, an abilities stats, (aka the damage it deals and such) balance when compared to other abilities, ingenuity, and 'wow' factor. If you make random players want to play your champion, you will do well here. (Do all of the entries’ abilities work in conjunction or are they unable to be used as intended? Keep in mind what other champions can do in response to your champion's abilities. There must be counter play.)\n\n      Originality: 15 points simply put, if you copy a live champion you will not score well here. Make sure your champion is unique to him/her/itself and simply changing the numbers on abilities that were previously made or copying another champions skills will not cut it. You must do something different. It doesn’t have to be drastically different but different enough. In other words your champ can have a pull but it cannot be like any other pull in the game. It can copy some of the characteristics of another champions pull but it cannot be like an exact copy of a thresh or blitz pull and changing arms doesn’t count either. Must bring new content to the kit, must have cohesion, and must be thematic or clever to score well here. \n\nViability: 5 points Does the champion serve the stated role properly? And is there counter play?\n\n      Theme: 5 points (How well does the entry link abilities, lore, stats, and challenges all together? The key is to have it be cohesive and all tie in to one, or more, things that summarize the character.)\n\n      Gameplay: 5 points how well is the entry able to cooperate with other concurrent League champions or can they not? Are they grossly over or underpowered? Do their abilities make sense when used in tandem with other champions’ abilities? Do they fulfill the role of another champion already established in the game perfectly to the point where that other champion is obsolete? If yes to this last question fix something.\n\n      Effort: 15 points.  Even if the idea isn't the best, or you're not confident in your abilities, it's much easier than you think to tell who put more effort into their concept. This is not specifically length, but extras like recommended items, play style explanation, skin ideas, dialogue and others are a great start.\n\n      Bonus points: up to a maximum bonus of 5 points can be given to an entries score. These points can be earned by one of several ways. Assisting with judging or such will award a maximum of 1 bonus point. Reviewing can earn the total amount if you review 10 entries.  Alternatively you can earn up to 2 bonus points for completing both of the one point challenges. Or up to four bonus points for completing two of the two point challenges. Or any combination of the bonus point options but only a maximum of 5 bonus points can be earned no matter what. No more than that can be earned no matter how much you do. \n\n              Total points excluding bonus points: 90 \n              Total points including bonus points: 95\n\n      This month’s theme: elements and weapons.\n\n      The entrant must choose one element and one weapon; each providing their own challenges, unless the challenger elects to take on two elements or two weapons for bonus points. Or two of both if they are so daring. Alternatively the entrant can choose a more challenging element or weapon options instead of a normal, but this is only suggested for the most daring of contestants. The more challenging elements and weapons can be found in the two point challenges but only a maximum of two of the two point challenges can be chosen.  \n\n      The challenge is all of these choices must make sense both kit, lore, stats, and theme wise for this champion. The entrant can feel free to pick any of the following choices but remember it all has to tie together in the end and you must make a story that ties these choices together. Remember the setting is the currently established lore of Runeterra, and your champion’s lore must tell one of the following stories. \n\n 1.\tYou were found somewhere badly injured. Now tell the story of how you got there and who found you.\n 2.\tYou came here from another place. You are not a native mainlander and/or Runetarrian and/or native to a neighboring island.  Now tell the story of why you came to Runeterra and/or the mainland and/or a neighboring Island. \n 3.\tYou were sent on an urgent mission. What was the mission? Was it accomplished? And who sent you?\n 4.\tYou are cursed and/or blessed. What does this curse and/or blessing consist of? How did you receive this curse and/or blessing and why?\n 5.\tYou were created or created something. Who or what created you and/or who or what did you create? Why were you or what you made created? (Creation includes acquiring sentience or building something and any other version of creation. \n\nWeapons: choose 1.

(Because Science. Trust me if I were to break it down exactly how this works I would be teaching a college course. A conductor in this case the champion is only as strong as the elements that make him/her up and how well these elements hold to the amount of energy or power supplied to them and the ratios of such, because outgoing power is not always the same as incoming power.)\nSound: Must be able to silence an enemy and must be able to prevent silences. (because sound is so extreme it silences everything else.)\n      Life: must be able to summon something that lives and moves (like Tibbers or Zora’s plants) and must have a global ability (because life is all around us).\nTime: must be able to speed things up and must be able to slow things down\nSpace: Must be able to move things a long distance and must be able to move self a long distance\n       Gravity: must be able to lift things (this includes knockups and knockbacks) for a short time and must be able to move things a short distance \n       Ice: must have a negative stacking effect and must have a movement blocking ability\n       Mind: must have a forced action ability and must be able to free self from movement impairing effects\n       Nature: must be able to alter ability effects in some way (could be whether or not a certain buff or debuff is affecting a given target like with Brand, with alteration purchase like with Khazix, or with interaction like Zyra) and must be able to change form with new abilities (like Nidalee or Jayce)\n       Gems:  Must be able to increase the defenses of yourself and/or allies and must be able to increase either self or ally healing (like increased health regen or life steal or something) \nScience: Must be able to summon a trap or stationary defense like a turret and must have a stocking/ammo based ability\nDeath: must be able to deal more damage the less health a target has and must be able to summon some form of undead, ghost, or other non-living thing.

Alternatively you can elect to have a form change/ability change mechanic in which case you can have both like with Nidalee, Jayce, and Gnar)\nDual elements (pick two elements and follow the directions for both)\n\n            2 point challenges: (you can pick up to 2 of the 2 point challenges)\n \n      Cannon: instead of your normal weapon choice you must use a cannon, you must have at least one ranged ability, you must have a slow attack speed, and must do high upfront burst damage with basic attacks and abilities with a period of “reload/period of weakness” time in between, you must have a slow movement speed but high defenses and long cooldowns.

You can be of any role.\n\n     Gatling gun: instead of your normal weapon choice you must use a Gatling gun, you must have at least one ranged ability, you must have an attack speed that builds up over time, you must have a fairly high movement speed with low defenses, you must be able to build up damage over time but abilities cannot increase in base damage directly as they rank up. (Think long cool downs little damage at first but cool downs that decrease as you level and increase in either cooldown reduction or scaling or some other form but not in direct upfront damage. There are ways around this passive Example: if you have an ability that costs 6/7/8/9/10% of your total health and you deals damage equal to 100% the amount of health sacrificed this is fine as long as the ability does not increase that base damage of 100% if the ability was written costs 6/7/8/9/10% total health and dealt 50/60/70/80/90 damage this would not work because the base damage would increase by rank directly.) You can be of any role.\n\n       Diamond: Instead of your normal element choice you have diamond. You must be able to change form into a diamond form with new abilities within this form. In this form you must have high defenses and must be able to either absorb or reduce damage received while in this form. You must generate some form of positive effect to yourself on attacks or abilities cast within this form. You move slowly in this form. While out of this form you must follow the guidelines set by gems.\n\n(note: positive effects include stacks that you gain that help you, resource generation, Tenacity, shield, armor/magic gain, heals, bonus health regen,  immunity/ Freedom  from cc, armor pen, lifesteal, or even cooldown reduction)\n\n      Glass: Instead of your normal element choice you have glass. You must be able to change form into a glass form with new abilities within this form. In this form you must have low defenses and must be able to reflect damage and/or projectiles and redirect damage. You must inflict a negative effect to the enemy on attacks or abilities cast within this form.  You must move quickly in this form.

Now for assitance reasons please post your reviews on this thread if you have not already done so. It helps out a lot. I do not want to go over all 8 pages of some champions to find them. I will most likely miss some. At least make a link here to your  review. Now I have also seen some of you are missing your challenges section. I do not want to dq you over something so simple, which I will if i have to.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-01-22T14:15:49.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fine.

Shortly after i submitted Heidi the Wrangler to riot who was a farmer support/tank braum came out and some of his abilities were similar to that of heidi. The community does have influence. Riot has never openly accepted champ concepts, never, but if it is good enough you bet they might.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-01-22T19:09:47.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot did offer a chance to make a champion if you reffered 100 friends to play the game. And also you completely skipped over what I said. I said Riot does not accept champion concepts. I said nothing about influencing them. And I also did not want to influence them, I wanted to create a champion that would make it into the league, not give Riot an idea for a champion based off of my idea. So my point still stands. My champions will not get into league and thus I have no reason to continue making them. I will only post one more champion, and that is only because another community member had helped me make him and I don't want that person's time to have been completely wasted.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamur","date":"2015-01-22T19:56:03.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess there's no changing your mind.

To the contrary, I said they were easy by saying that I was going to make a concept that could fulfill all the challenges.\n\nP.S.; wrt Ranged / Melee Ability\n\nIn your opening post you defined that \"Ranged or Melee requirements only apply to Basic Attacks\". Pretty much verbatim.\n\nYou then later said that one needed a \"Ranged Ability\". This means simply 'An ability that has range'. Meaning it can't be auto-self-target or auto-target-all-valid, because an ability with 300 range (like, say, Kha'Zix' Taste Their Fear) has range. Unless, of course, a \"Ranged Ability\" exclusively refers to an ability that has a certain minimum amount of Range. \n\nBut does Kayle's E have Range? I'd say that it doesn't, but it increases Kayle's basic attack range. It could be argued that it is a \"+X range attack steroid\" and it wouldn't be an incorrect argument.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Elphrihaim","date":"2015-01-01T06:17:25.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":":V\n\nI told you it needed better formatting\n\nAlso look at your top of post and look at your title\n\nThey don't match up","replies":[{"poster":"Vbunnie","date":"2015-01-01T06:33:50.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elphrihaim,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=rB0U0mBo,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-01T06:17:25.080+0000)\n>\n> :V\n> \n> I told you it needed better formatting\n> \n> Also look at your top of post and look at your title\n> \n> They don't match up\n\nI have formatting but for some reason it wont show up also what title?
