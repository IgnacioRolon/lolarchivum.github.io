Even if they acknowledge the handling of it is bad, it seems like the company stands by with its decision. \n\nHey, Chromatic Eagle.\n\nOk, so my disagreements with ShadowStorm's opinions (Woo!  Opinion 'fight'!)  I went through the thread identifying bits and pieces to quote, but I think my overarching difference of opinion is that I think we need, at Riot, to do some proving of our intentions.  I believe that it would be very helpful if we were to take a contained story involving a champion (or more than two, ideally), in a rich, consistent, setting, and give it a beginning, middle and end.  \n\nThe rest of this is less about my disagreement with one or two of ShadowStorm's opinions, and more an elaboration on my position.  I agree with him on other bits though!  We're not going to come to blows, I hope!\n\nMaybe our plan is more of the slow establishing glimpses - but I think there's a lot of red on our ledger in terms of lore goodwill and that getting a fully formed story out in really short order would help more than most other actions would.  Maybe that messes up a long term plan - my (headstrong) attitude would be to damn the consequences and do something now*.  (Or as quickly as humanly possible.)\n\nI don't want to expose a champion and leave no room for future mysteries and stories - of course not - but I could read a Batman comic arc and feel that I had a full story, without precluding the opportunity for future Batman stories.  I could watch an episode of Doctor Who and feel that we had a conclusion - even if I will not be surprised to see the Daleks again, or discover that clues from that episode tie into the series finale.\n\nMy personal opinion is that we've been creating our cold-opens - the bit of a TV show before the opening credits kick in.  We've shown our main character, we get a glimpse of their world, we get a few character-establishing lines and then we leave it hanging.  The rest of the episode hasn't turned up yet.  Maybe if we take the long view, it'll all be great - we'll get the whole episode and more episodes besides!  But (as Ekko proves) timeliness does matter.  \n\nShadowStorm describes this as releasing chapter 1 - and that's a very good way of describing it.  I would rather we had lots of stories in different stages - a few that have finished book 1, a few half way through book 2, and a few that are only up to chapter 1, 6, or even 15.\n\nOf course, until we manage to release something that starts to prove that we can move beyond chapter 1, our ledger will continue to drip with red ink.  I hope we can start turning that around asap.\n\nAlso, I should note I am not as well read in the lore as ShadowStorm is.  I have _not_ read all the JoJ yet - I read it on a per-champion basis when I want to know more about that particular champion.  Especially if there's a lore thread about that champ, and I want to be able to follow along.  So he's more in the know than I am on any particular element.","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-05-19T01:39:37.299+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ok, so my disagreements with ShadowStorm's opinions (Woo!

Which is to say, he's right in the thick of working on the game, he sees all the people working on it and has a perceptive that because so much work is being done in front of him, it means a lot of *very visible* results are being put out even when they're actually not. He's coming to terms with the idea that a lot of work done behind the scenes doesn't necessarily equal tangible gains for the audience.\n\nFor a comparison that you'll be familiar with, nobody doubts that massive amounts of work were done on Bioshock Infinite. However, I'm also pretty sure you braced yourself for the initial taste of disappointment that came when the final game came out and people complained about it not being nearly as open-ended as initial promotional videos looked, and the whole Heavy Hitters system turning out to be merely a bunch of bosses. Yes, the amount of work done was overwhelming when looking from it on the inside, but that didn't keep people from feeling that the end result was pretty barebones.\n\n( I personally think the end result was exactly where it should've been, since I'm from the design school of ICO and Shadow of the Colossus that dictates that everything that doesn't provide a tangible weight to the player's experience should be chop-chopped.

He does have a very different position at the company to see all this from.  We're going to have a chat tomorrow, actually.\n\nJust as an insight to my personal development ethos from other game developments; I believe that it doesn't matter how many tears you weep, late nights you spend, or unexpected bugs that crop up, in the end, the player doesn't care.  It's very important that this is true - the player _shouldn't_ care.  What matters is the end result.  One should never think that giving excuses to a player will make them think your game is better, or that they will forgive you for a bad game.  \n\nIn the end, it only matters if what the players get to experience is good or not.  I have to stand by it, and do better next time.  :)\n\nThat's just my personal view I've developed over several years.","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-05-19T02:51:40.533+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, I absolutely agree. *I* care because I'm a designer; chewing through design decisions of a work makes me learn new techniques, while hearing stories about development makes me find out how they came to be.

They simply need to be given a work as complete and enjoyable as possible.\n\nHowever, Shadowstorm isn't the first developer to pop up on these boards and be baffled by the negative response, and I'm beginning to understand why. The League development team outside the lore department doesn't seem to realize that the game is in a terrible shape narratively and it's only a matter of time before it begins to impact their art direction.\n\nI do think Shadowstorm will come around to understanding exactly how the players feel about the game's state. That, I feel, is pretty much the core of why people on these boards have such a low opinion on the narrative team. It never felt like their arguments considered the players' perspective of the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Finnical","date":"2015-05-19T05:22:52.617+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, whenever I have read the posts of Rioters outside the lore department they never seem aware of just how bad things look from our end.

New or old lore.\n\nI have a fondness for Sona (despite her being pretty milquetoast) because I play her, and my headcanon has her connection to Ionia and her instrument being a rich source of story potential.  Didn't think much of her League Judgement, however.  (And yes, I go to the wiki a lot.)\n\nI also really like both Braum and Jinx - they're both just so strong personality archetypes that I can imagine how they might react in most situations.  I.e. the personalities live in my head enough to tell me what they'd do.  (Not so much for Sona).  I really wanted to love Bard, but as squishy looking as he is, I can't apply that same test successfully.  \n\nI also like the Diana/Leona relationship as it was explained to me (most enthusiastically) by another Rioter who is fairly Diana/Leona obsessed.\n\nI like Shurima - or rather, I like the Shurima I made in my head for the map.  There's a lot more background stuff I did to make the map that I didn't get a chance to surface, just so that I'd have a complete picture in mind (as well as who made it, who bought it, when it was made, what happened to it afterwards, how it resurfaced, etc.).  I realize that's unfair for me to talk about this all, and I apologize.  Hell, at one point I was writing traditional Shuriman nomad lullaby's as a form of folk-history of the time of the empire.  So I'm kind of invested.  (I actually started writing an ancient Shuriman ideogram system, but that was too nerdy even for me to feel comfortable showing to the rest of the map-making team.  There's nothing _quite_ as indulgent as making a con-lang!)\n\nAlso fancy Zaun and Bilgewater.  Never been much of a Demacia, Noxus, or Freljord fan.  Ionia intrigues me but it's too mysterious right now even for me.  Triple that for Bandle City.

ShadowStorm and I had a good long chat today over coffee about the boards here, the players who have been so poorly let down, and how Riot is going about lore in general, so I think I have a better handle on where he's at, and how he may have put his foot in his mouth at first.  He hangs his head in shame when he thinks about how flippant he was at first, despite having been a Story & Art lurker for a while.  Hard to really grok that it's a different perspective.\n\nMaybe if you explain what he said to disappoint you, I can help if it was one of those times where trying to communicate through text results in crossed wires.  Or, if it's not a misunderstanding, then we can look into that more deeply too.  Obviously, until more story content comes out, there'll be no _real_ improvement - I understand that.  \n\nI wish I could say I've heard there's at least _something_ coming in the next week or so - but I'm pretty sure I can't say.  And even if I were able to say something like that and it got pushed back, _I'd_ hate me more than the total combined disgust and outrage of the players hopes I'd be betraying on this board.  So just as well I can't say that.

All this hate/anger/frustration is 100% on Riot's side, yet those that seem to either be causing it (or if not causing it the only ones able to truthfully talk about it) never are here? \n\nOk, I was trying to reply to this with my somewhat uninformed knowledge of the situation, but one of my many bullet points turned into an essay, so I'll dive deep instead of broad.  This is one of the things that may be hindering the writing team from jumping in here - and may go some way to explain the \"Riot only does lore to sell us stuff\" accusation that sometimes gets mentioned.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's a bit of insight into how Riot works on the organizational side of things.\n\nRiot is a pretty big company, and that's awesome for a lot of reasons.  It's less awesome for other reasons.  For example, some companies like Riot spin up teams devoted to creating something - some tangible result at the end, instead of a fuzzy goal.  These are called 'products', even though sometimes that 'product' might not be something you buy.  It's like a quest objective - an achievable target that you can say is finished, so you can start the next thing.  Very useful in a living game development.\n\nSo everything that Riot release had a 'product team' behind it.  What product is planned determines what Rioters are assigned to make it happen - if there's no 'product', then there's no-one assigned to it, and there's no work done on it.  I.e. if you don't have a product, then it doesn't get made.  _Even if you made something in your own personal spare time_, it couldn't go up on the website or anything official, unless a product was generated so that it could be translated/localized, announced, given the proper web support, properly integrated into the release schedule, etc.  \n\n(There are no one-man jobs, though coming up with an idea for a future product (new champ idea, or skin idea, or event idea) is totally exciting and open to input from anyone.)\n---\n*Personal example - I worked on the Shurima map mostly in my spare time, with help from an artist and an outsourcer who were assigned to a less-product-oriented department.  It didn't have a product assigned to it, and it's possible it may never have been released to players - if it were not for the fact that the Rek'Sai launch story product came along, and we discussed including the map with it.  Synergy.*\n---\nWriters are assigned to new champ team products, and to new skin product teams, or to event team products, or to cinematic trailer products, or music video products, etc.  Even things like 'internal-use-only reference guide' product teams exist and have narrative time assigned to them.  As far as I know, there is not something as undefined as a 'release more lore' product, despite many people wanting to do just that.  This is why there's been a lot of accusations of \"You only release stuff when you're trying to sell us things!\" and that's sort of true and (maybe surprisingly) actually sort of false.  \n\nWhen we did the Harrowing/Black Mist event, that had a little story, a map, and a cinematic all to itself (those creepy puppets).  It didn't really have anything substantial to buy involved with it.  Until...  it did.  There was a Shadow Isles champ being developed roughly at the same time, so it made sense to bundle the two things together - and so we said hello to Kalista.  Now it looked to the cynic like the Harrowing just existed to push Kalista sales.  Would it make sense to avoid having Kalista released at the same time as the Harrowing?  Not really - they synergize really nicely and make the event seem better.  This sort of synergistic grouping happens quite often and I think is actually pretty cool.\n\n---------\n\nBehind the scenes (and remember - I am not privy to these conversations) there may well be discussions on how best to create a supplemental 'product' over and above the previous typical products (events, champs, skins, cinematics) that can have the right people assigned to it.  So that if there were content that had already been created, then it could get the support it needed to get out to players like us.  Ideally this is done without too negatively affecting the other product teams, and the currently understaffed writing team.\n\nNow, I don't want you to come away from this saying things like \"OMG - Riot won't make anything unless it's a product they can sell us!\" - that's not what the product system is.  And please don't even come away saying \"WTF - this 'product' organizational system is clearly the worst thing ever!\" because it's really not.  There's no perfect system, and this one works very well for many things, and very well for a game like League that isn't a 'ship it and run' development model.  Releasing lore in any form needs proper support from several departments - even if it's just text on a page.\n\nI had another bullet point that was all about how surprisingly time-intensive it is for a writer to be on a champ product team, but this is too long to read at this point, and I was up too late last night.  I am tired enough to beg that you don't tear me a new one about this too badly, if it is taken poorly.  That goes for you too, random Rioter reading this.","replies":[{"poster":"Neon Robot","date":"2015-05-20T07:24:52.063+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Whren","date":"2015-05-20T19:12:35.931+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Further; unless I deeply misunderstand you, if a product ear-marked as \"Core Lore\" whose sole goal is to establish the Lore that every other product on the market currently has doesn't surface, League won't ever actually have a functional Lore ever.\n\nWe kinda do -- it's called Foundations, and it is a product team, albeit an internal product (the tangible product is the guides and sheets Biolum. was talking about earlier).

You say you trust them, I don't think the players on the boards do any more (and they have little reason to, to be honest). You also basically said \"soonTM\".

Thanks for sticking through all of this.\n\nAnyway, to address your actual post: I do understand, but that still means Riot has spent literally years *choosing* to not assign writers to general lore updates and story progression. The product system is totally fine, and may be workable for lore, but we have *actual proof* (years of silence/stillness) that Riot has not, is not, and is unlikely to consider the production of a product that is exclusively or even mostly lore-centric (see: JoJ).\n\nNow, you may counter that the Freljord/Harrowing/Shurima events were largely lore-centric, but there are a few issues with that.\n\nFirst and foremost, those events included the deleting of champions, or at least fundamentally replacing their personalities and stories. Trundle is the most dramatic example, but Skarner and Xerath have some major issues as well, while Cassiopeia is in an iffy spot.\n\nSecond, those events always coincided with a champion release, and it seems more realistic than cynical to suspect that champion/skin scheduling is what's actually important to Riot when they consider adding to their strings-and-tape lore.\n\nFinally, all current lore updates are being made *without significant fan consideration or involvement*. When Riot makes big changes to Karma, Cassiopeia, even Udyr, and suddenly acts all astonished at fan backlash, the problem is that Riot is being excessively quiet and relying on shock reveals.\n\nThere has been proof *since Season 1* that silence and opacity are actively harmful for Riot in many instances, especially lore and champion updates, while transparency and dialogue are always helpful. Did Riot not learn from Magma Chamber? The stealth rework? Does the staff even remember those nightmares?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-05-20T08:48:16.009+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then why should I care?\n\nIf Riot's going to continue to use this product system, and they're not going to spend time and resources on lore that isn't 'well we have a new thing, so we need lore for it', why should I care about lore?

All you guys are doing are treating it like a way to sell things, so why should I treat it as anything else?\n\nHey, Hellioning,\n\nI realize my post was a wall of text, and written when I was a bit too tired to make clear points, but there are _good_ things in there about lore.  \n\nI mentioned an \"internal use only reference guide\" product - something like what Nastra Dark described as a \"Core Lore\" - this is the foundation work that is going on, and the 'product' is style and story guides for most of the world.  These being internal only sucks, of course, but it means that internal consistency should improve, and future lore shouldn't operate in a vacuum. (Often, someone important floats the idea that they get released as a player-facing thing - it's not been prioritized like that yet, mostly due to the fact that out of the 12 or so I think they're working on, only half are done - and I may be waaaay off on that estimate.  It would feel more like a reference guide than a story, however.).  \n\nI also mentioned that I worked with artists who were assigned to a less product-oriented department - that department has been incubating all sorts of things for a long time now, but while they get the freedom to try many many things, they do not have a deadline to release a clear product - sort of the opposite of the 'product' system.  It means that I personally have no vision on when anything they're working on will get published, or if it never will because it served its purpose internally.  A few cinematics have come out of this department, and they are keen to tell stories in different ways.\n\nEvents can be lore delivery mechanisms, and are ways of continuing the story of a location or of characters, and those fit within the product system quite happily.  Now, you could argue (and others in the comments here have) that the events are subpar, or that they break things they shouldn't do - and that would be a fair value judgement to give.  Events are huge deals and take a long time - so iteration is slow.  Much like ShadowStorm spurred a conversation about release stories, I could see a thread on what did and didn't go down well with events as an interesting topic.  I don't agree with someone here who implied that having skins associated with an event cheapens the event, turning it into an advert - maybe I am too excitable as a human being, but when I get excited about something, I want to own a piece of it.  Maybe that means 3d printing a Z-Drive for Ekko (I have done this) or making Bard cupcakes (I have done this) or maybe it means buying a ward skin for the Shurima event (I have done this).  Value judgements on the Shurima event notwithstanding.\n\nLastly, this lack of lore-specific (non-event) products is becoming more and more of an issue internally, which is why I said there were conversations going on.  Some people believed that the lore and story given out in champ launch stories, events, and the like was covering the narrative/story requirements (because they do contain some) and thus a dedicated product wasn't needed.  Clear, pointed, disagreements, both within and without Riot (hello), are showing that that is not true, and that those forms of story are not sufficient.  You could argue that it's been obvious forever that it wouldn't be enough - but when looking at everything that both Rioters and players want more of, and that we want to provide, it could have been quite reasonable to think that, just as players want more champions, players want more story - so ensure each new champion has a bit of story and go!  Story based products are becoming more obviously needed, and that just like continual balancing is required to keep a healthy game, so too is a continually enriched Runeterra narrative required to keep a healthy world.  It's a shift in how it is thought about.\n\ntl;dr - \n\n* There's an extensive lore guide being worked on, \n* There's a team that doesn't follow the product system who create story too, \n* Events _can_ be good story delivery mechanisms (there are improvements to make) and \n* The winds are shifting internally away from well intentioned misunderstanding about what lore needs.\n\nI am really regretful that I wrote that so late at night, and I know that it did not answer the question given.  I suck, and will come back to this to give my opinion on that.  (And I can only give my opinion - I can't answer conclusively what I don't know.)  I also wish I could answer every one of these replies individually, but I've bunched them into one answer.  Sorry.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
