I uninstalled league and redownloaded and tried reinstalling. At the end of the installer it'd say \"PVP.net kernel stopped working\". I tried multiple things like restarting my laptop, reinstalling league, and deleting Microsoft c++ 2005, and turning off my firewall. Nothing worked until I went into the Riot Games folder and launched the \"lol.launcher.admin\" application. I don't know if it'll work for everyone, but if anyone else is having the problem and nothing riot tells them helps, maybe try this method.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T19:31:29.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error is usually caused by a security setting blocking the patcher from launching.  Deleting products and files will end up causing you more trouble, and wouldn't recommend doing that.
