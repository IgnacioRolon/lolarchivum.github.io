Clear the contents of this file but **DO NOT** delete this file, if you do it will not be recreated. Just delete all of the content in the file then save it.\n\nIf the issue still persists, make sure to reply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Blinkfenix","date":"2015-02-06T07:00:56.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"issue still persists  during champ select and before it on the home screen (e.t.c) but not in game. chat is unavailable  but says \" connecting/reconnecting to chat services \"","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-02-06T22:00:49.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't seem like this is an issue with local files on your computer then.
