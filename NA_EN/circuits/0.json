I feel like this is a problem. TBH, I am not sure what the solution is. Either boost weaker champions base health or decrease this crazy assassin damage. I feel like if the champion your playing doesn't require at least two full combo's to bring an average adc from 100% health to death than something is wrong. Even a fed Vayne would require  two full combo's to bring an average adc from 100% health to death and adc's are supposed to be the damage dealers. Idk, what do you guys think.","replies":[{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-04-25T17:19:57.423+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"It isn't so much 1 shot, its kill pressure. Can they kill you with one rotation and at what hp is it possible. Zed and Talon are well known for their high kill pressure because they can 100-0 you in one skill rotation at level 2-3, as can Kat and several others within the assassin/adc/toplane group. Mages were rarely able to accomplish this so instead had ways to stop this from happening, as did tanks and supports. Now mages are about to be dead, tanks get wrecked early, and supports are the only ones left able to prevent this (against enemy adcs).\nThis means that champions with more kill pressure are becoming increasingly popular and only those that can mimic it will survive. Mages will take electrocute to achieve this as many already are (Syndra, Malz, Lissandra) or suffer the consequences. Tanks will sit under towers waiting for ganks or switch out for top-lane carries like Quinn and Kennen (I've seen so many more Quinn and Kennen toplanes recently), and supports will stop trying to  mitigate damage (tanks like Braum and Taric or enchanters like Janna and Saroka), and instead aim do damage themselves (Lux, Zyra, Annie).\n\nIn short someone is going to get fed, someone is going to feed, and jungle is going to be the deciding factor for the game. At that point snowball champions will naturally be best which means expect assassin's and adc's everywhere in every game (seen jhin and kai'sa midlane several times in the last two days).","replies":[{"poster":"Circuits","date":"2018-04-25T20:01:01.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds to me like all they would have to do to even things out is stop allowing champions to be killed in one rotation.

ADCs are supposed to be sustained damage dealers, but **not** THE damage dealers.\n2. A fed Vayne kills people within 4-5 AA, and if very fed she only needs 1 to 2 (not kidding, there are quite a few cases where people died to a very fed Vayne under 0.5 seconds because they basically died to a single AA).

If your argument for why kat should be able to press R and one shot an adc is: \"well that adc should have a galio who can swoop in just before the kat arrives and save her\" or \"vayne should have saved her condem so that she could knock kat out of her ult and run away\", well than I would retort: why can't vayne have a fair chance at outplaying the kat? Why must she run away? Why is kat's kit built to one shot in the first place when it should be built to make the user use her/his brain and still win in a sustained fight with any champion let alone an adc. I guess that was the point I was trying to get at. Champions, especially new ones, are designed to burst kill rather than fight prolonged battles and Rito's \"answer\" to balance the equation seems to be creating champions designed to cc other champions so that fights can be won with one shots by squishy champions. However, I feel that a better solution would be to stop designing champions to one shot or get one shot. Obviously, that is harder than it seems but that doesn't mean the solution does not exist. Just because you can't figure something out doesn't mean there is no solution right? No couple in the fact that those tank champions are actually dealing just as much damage as adc's and you have current meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"makkii","date":"2018-04-26T02:42:48.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can oneshot with half the roster nowadays.\n\nYou can do it with any assasin obviously, any mage with decent base damages can do it with sorcs into obli orb+ Either gun blade or ludens, adc’s can do it(esp Quinn) hell even some tanks can do it (chogath, ap malph etc)\n\nHell even some supports, like lichbane sona can do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirArran","date":"2018-04-26T01:25:41.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Zoe is OP apparently. or was","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bioness","date":"2018-04-26T00:54:26.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Could they increase the health of everyone?
