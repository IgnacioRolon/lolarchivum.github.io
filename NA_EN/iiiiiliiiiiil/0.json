We verify every build on a Mac and test on Macs as well. Unfortunately, we dropped the ball this time and will strive to do better next time for you guys!\n\nIn the meantime, I would like more information to help pinpoint what the potential issues are since it was clearly introduced in the most recent patch (4.17). In particular, I'd like to know the following:\n\nFor items 1-3, hit the Apple icon in the top left, then \"About this mac\", then \"More info\"\n1. What is your OSX version?\n2. What type of Mac are you running (Macbook, Macbook Pro, etc) + year number\n3. What graphics chipset are you running\n4. What is the rough frequency of the crash per game for each game mode/type?\n  - e.g. Custom 5v5 arams, matchmade 3v3 treeline, normal 5v5\n  - Don't try this in ranked and consider making a smurf to test matchmade games (but only if you don't already know the crash frequency for matchmade games)\n5. Do the crashes happen on PBE currently? (answer in a similar fashion to #4)\n\nAny information you can provide would be very useful. In addition, if you leave a summoner name, I may contact you on my LoL account (Riot3ous) to get more information.\n\nThanks,\nRiot3ous\n\nedit:\n\nThanks all for the updates so far. We're pulling more resources internally to address the problem.\n\nedit 2:\n\nAgain, thanks for your patience all. Still working ...\n\nedit 3:\n\nWe identified yesterday TWO sources of a large number of crashes that unfortunately managed to slip in on a single patch. Turns out, they caused Windows crashes as well. A hotfix has been deployed. Thanks all for your patience.","replies":[{"poster":"IIIIIlIIIIIIl","date":"2014-09-29T02:54:16.963+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quick update, messaging is on now I believe","replies":[{"poster":"Mike4Real","date":"2014-09-29T10:42:44.597+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":5,"body":"I would like to point out a couple things. The current message on the client states that, \"We are seeing problems with game crashes on MAC clients and are working to correct this\"\n\nI have had a discussion with Riot Triggs about this before but I see it has not made its way around to the rest of you guys. Now as when I told Triggs this, I don't want to sound like a jerk but I want to let you all know that its 'Mac' and not 'MAC' its not an acronym for anything, its just short for Macintosh. I don't mind if users get it wrong, but you guys are the company here and it would look better to the Mac user base if the developers of the game got it right in their communications with the players.\n\nSecondly I would like to point out that there exists a Mac subform and it has seemingly been forgotten about by employees. You guys who are looking for information and logs should look here:\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/forumdisplay.php?f=31\nI will link you all of the treads about the 4.17 crashing/bug splats, some of which contain logs (listed in order of most info provided):\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4879885 (lots of info and logs provided by this user)\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4900192 (3 pages, lots of users providing system specs)\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1923814 (EUW user, logs provided)\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4898777 \nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4901979\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4903874\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4886554\n\nHere I will add my experiences with the problem as quoted from one of these threads, \"I can also confirm that 4.17 is much worse in terms of bug splats on my Macbook. Prior to this patch I bug-splatted much more rarely. Yesterday I was playing in a pre made team of 5 with three of us playing on windows, and two of us playing on Macs. There was one instance where myself and the other Mac player both had a bug splat crash at the exact same time in the game. This also cost us the game despite us being able to reconnect.\" This occurred on my Mid 2010 White Unibody Macbook, which runs OS X 10.9.3. I can provide r3d logs if they are requested.\n\nLastly I would like to point out one more thing. While I am sad that the NA Mac sub forum is for some reason under used by Riot employees, with only Riot Brentmiester or Riot Dannamoth posting maybe every 2 months or so, there is something even worse occurring to our fellow summoners overseas. The EUNE and EUW equivalent of these subforms are ignored to an even greater extent than the NA sub forum. Perhaps you guys could post over there asking for info? It would make them feel a lot better. They have the same issues and threads as us, but never receive any information! I would post there myself if I had an account on those servers.\nhttp://forums.eune.leagueoflegends.com/board/forumdisplay.php?f=196\nhttp://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/forumdisplay.php?f=187\n\n**Other Mac bugs that are known that I'd like to draw some attention too:**\nMac Client freezing upon first death.

I will also try to keep EU in the loop although traditionally, Rioters participate primarily in the region they work in. Part of what makes this a challenge is that pretty much all the game engineers are based in the US with the exception of a few contractors maybe.

I've been having a huge problem with crashing and freezing in 5v5s and bot games as well. \n1. My processor is 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5\n2. I have a Macbook Air from 2012\n3. Intel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB\n4. I crash every game no matter the mode. I crash trying to connect into the game from the very beginning, sometimes I can't even connect to a game at all until my 4th or 5th try. I crash after 10 minutes, it's all very random. It crashes when I've just got into lane, or when I'm attacking a minion, it doesn't matter if I just died, it crashes whenever it wants. Normal 5v5s I can't even play anymore because of the amount of crashes I have each game.\n\nRiot recently sent me an email saying I was a level 1 Leaver and that's all because of the crashes. I keep trying to connect and it just doesn't work. My match history are a combination of defeats and leaves because I come back just when my team loses or I can never connect to the game. Please fix this Riot, it's really frustrating and it wastes a lot of my time trying to connect to something that'll lag right back out again.

Since the issue has sprung up, I usually start with a one-man custom Howling Abyss (vs bots) to check the stability. On this I will Bugsplat about every 4th attempt, usually at loading screen, after which I'm usually OK to rejoin. About every other game I will DC, to the point of having to shut down the client and restart. If I'm able to get through 3-4 bot matches in a row without incident, I'll try an ARAM, from which I DC every 3rd or 4th match. I have horrendous community Internet (God bless all-bills-included student apartment living), so I assume a lot of the DC issues are from the inconsistent connection I have, but some of the DCs feel different; more abrupt and sudden.\n\nThe largest crash I experienced was yesterday when I DC'ed 2 minutes into an ARAM. Upon trying to rejoin, the client Bugsplat. At this point, my computer's Wifi showed I was connected, but I couldn't even connect through a browser. The computer remained this way for about 10 minutes before the connection randomly came back up, and I was able to get back on to the client (the game had apparently finished though, as my match history stated I left the game).\n- I haven't been approved for PBE yet, sadly.
