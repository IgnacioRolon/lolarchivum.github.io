I think this could possibly help the so called (elo hell!) and help with the over lol community.If there is a better place to post to be heard or taken into consideration please let me know. ty!","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-05-22T03:07:49.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm locking this post due to its age as well as involving the OP arguing with other posters..\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification) or [Discuss the Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation).","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-04-18T05:10:53.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its the players own decisions.\n\nand if you are being matched with new players, you might want to rank up.","replies":[{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2018-04-18T05:24:17.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not understanding the post. When people tell people to rank up, its just not that simple if you are constantly matched with people fresh new to ranked play.\n\nNot everyone plays carry champs. If you are a support..no matter how many right plays you make if you have people running around not knowing what to do..understanding where to be when key objectives are about to respawn, you are going to lose.\n\nIf you have that 1 master yi who no matter how far behind he is he still going to ult and dive into the enemy 1v5 because he thinks the 5th time will be the charm you are going to lose.\n\nif i mid i play control mages like Ziggs and Zyra. i dont play champs like Yasuo or Zed.......im not really going to carry even if i go 5-1 in lane.....if the rest of the team gets behind we are going to lose.\n\nI main support but dont even que up support because im getting people that when i check their history they are playing champs they dont use....taking teleport on adc for whatever reason. Or building beserker boots and hurricane as their 1st 2 items. Or adcs that frontline and attack from melee range like they are the tank.","replies":[{"poster":"TissTheKip","date":"2018-05-21T04:03:48.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"VvVVvV","date":"2018-05-21T13:54:42.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really? lol ....grown ass man looking up old posts just to send someone a message lol.\n\nSeriously....

LOSE THE SAME RIGHT BACK AGAIN it is insane!Placements shouldn't just relay on wins and loses only.Yes that player that got carried and placed higher then they should will lose and be where they should be,but in the matches they lose they bring down the players that are in elo hell!PLEASE THERE HAS TO BE A NEW SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED FOR RANKED AND PLACEMENTS TO IMPROVE LOL!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TissTheKip","date":"2018-04-18T20:39:21.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I WISH IT WAS THAT EASY!Even top streamers complain that one person let alone 2 or even 3 feeders or purposefully unhelpful players can lose a match so ez.You can be fed get 20 plus kills and still lose it happens all the time its unbearable.I have had matches where I carry on kills and do up to 80 k plus damage to champs in a 40 min plus game and still lose,our team will do twice the damage as theres but because they have 2 to 3 tanks and cc BAM!
