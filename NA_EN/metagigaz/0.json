This certain topic was supposed to be 'in character', so, I had to be a raging southern a-hole that swore a lot. For some reason now, I can't see any forums even if I log out. I'm not sure if it's because I'm on mobile or anything, but if someone reported me for that, I honestly will be mad. I didn't even pull out the big ones. I don't know if this'll get through or not, but if this is an unjust forum ban, I can assure you that it's justified, even if it is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"MetaGigaZ","date":"2017-11-11T21:46:52.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine now. It was weird though.

Might just be the mobile version!  Are you still having issues with this?","replies":[]}]}
