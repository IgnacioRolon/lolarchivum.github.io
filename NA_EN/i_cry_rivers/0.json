I have no problems with other games whatsoever. In LoL, my game lags beyond what can be controlled every minute for about 10 seconds. Does anyone know how to fix this or does DoTa have this issue too? I'm kind of getting tired of this game. I just want to play this weekend because they've made THE perfect gamemode.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T23:22:05.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you give me a bit more detail on this? *Lag* is a catch-all phrase for a lot of issues, so if you can give me specific behavior, observations such as changes in latency or FPS, it will give me a better idea of what's going on.","replies":[{"poster":"I Cry Rivers","date":"2016-09-26T00:13:02.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll tell you more once it happens again. It's strange, it didn't happen last 3 games. When it happens, the screen moves every 2 seconds only and the mouse becomes close to unmovable for about 10 seconds. I don't know about FPS drop, haven't looked at it, but it probably drops very low, I'll check it tomorrow.","replies":[]}]}]}
