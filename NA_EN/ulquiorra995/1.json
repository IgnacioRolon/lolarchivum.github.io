I understand Riot wanted for him to have it available every fight provided he meets the restriction, but seeing how everyone and their mother gets a knock up lately that \"restriction\" means shit once teamfights break.\n\nMy suggestions are to either:\n-Massively increase his ultimate CD if he triggers it on someone else's knock up. This way he actually needs to hit a skillshot to have his nukesteroidgapclosershield on an absurdly low CD.\n-Massively decrease the range if he triggers it on someone else. Meaning he can't jump on your squishy from 1000 range because one of 3 knock ups in your team landed on someone.\n-Only allow it on true knock ups(no displacements or pulls). This reduces amount of champs he can (ab)use.\n\nNote how his own Q trigger is unchanged. But look at popular picks: Your support is likely to be Janna, Thresh or Braum, maybe Nami. Your junglier is highly possible to be Lee, Vi or Jarvan. Your mid has a very high chance of being Fizz, Syndra or Orianna. Hell, even their latest ADC has a knock up.\nHIs ult needs serious nerf in ability to trigger it of someone else, period.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-11-28T22:53:00.266+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">-Only allow it on true knock ups(no displacements or pulls).
