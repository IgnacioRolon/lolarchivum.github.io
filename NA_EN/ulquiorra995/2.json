With all the utility he brings Lee absolutely shouldn't do comparable damage as assassins. Assassin's job is, well... assassinating by dealing extremely high and fast single target damage. If we have a generalist with no real weakness doing assassin level damage - well, we have a problem.\n\nSure, you won't see Lee build full assassin. But with that he will assassinate people early game. He will be impossible to outduel if you are even with him, and impossible to outrun because of his kit. He will be able to outdamage you even when behind. Lee is extremely hard to shut down due to his broken mobility and CC, and even if you manage to you won't be properly rewarded since his insane bases and scalings will allow him to stand head-to-head with you even when behind in gold and levels.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-02-11T22:41:33.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulquiorra995,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pc7o4Lg6,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-11T19:58:23.174+0000)\n>\n> Lee's QQER: 1140 + 480% AD + 8% missing HP\n> \n> Zed's RWQE, considering 50% damage amplification, 2 shrunken hits and passive:  948 + 415% AD + 6-10% max HP\n> \n> Talon's EQWR, considering 15% damage amplification: 1035 + 400% AD\n> \n> That's right.
