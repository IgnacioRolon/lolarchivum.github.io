Also, as i mentionned earlier, Jarvan gets more from shield, and since shield is literally temporary hp, it means that getting more of the other defensive stats (armor and resist),  are more effective.\n\n26% armor reduction relies entirely upon the armor the individual has built up to that point. While it helps keep his damage relevant, it doesn't necessarily mean his damage will be higher unless the target has a significant amount of armor which only 1 or 2 champions will possess. In which cae, focus falls upon CCing those targets, rather than trying to kill them.\n\nJarvan's ult is good, but you must also consider that the mjority of champions played in the meta can escape it without using flash, and will typically dos o.\nThis is part of why Lee Sin dominated during s4. Up until the changes to Jarvan's ult, it wasn't that much better.\n\nFurthermore, 10% HP is only on CURRENT health.\nLee Sin's Q executes based on 8% missing health, meaning it will be better as the fight continues whre as Jarvan's relies entirely upo how much of their pool exists.\nLee Sin also gets an innate 40% AS boost, which makes up for th 10% damage thatJarvan gets on his passive, especially for jungle clearing.\nLee Sin's ult is arguably better than Jarvan's.\nIt cannot be escaped as it is point and click, it disables multiple champs and does not require a 2nd party to create hard CC. If you noticed the game where the gnarvan combo was being utilized, it required much more set up and was hard to utilize under pressure. \nLee Sin can merely safequard ult the ADC, then Q to escape or vice versa.\n\nNO risk involved compared to the gnarvan combo.\nWhile Jarvan can get more from his shield, this is making the assumption that he will, and at most we really only see 1-2 champs being aura'ed unless it is in the jungle.\n\n\n\n> \n> Jarvan scale better then Lee in teamfight, which means he is better in the mid/late game. Call me ignorant if you want, but it doesn't add anything to your argument and surely doesn't mean that lee scales better.\n\nThe only aspect where Jarvan scales \"better\" than lee sin is through his tankiness through his shield which is at best, 200 more hp.\nUtility? Lee Sin maintains it.\nDamage? Lee Sin ALWAYS does more.\nPlay set ups? Lee Sin does it much more easily and does NOT require a second champion to crete hard CC on multiple targets.\nIf you are suggesting that he scales better defensively?\nYes. He does, but only due to his shield and even then, not significantly enough to say flat out that Jarvan is absolutely more tanky. \n\n\n\n> \n> Actually, jarvan has seen play before gnar has. the combo just added up to the priority of the jarvan pick.

That isn't good for play, you want flexibility so you can pick and choose when to fight rather than being so reliant on the rest of the team.\n\n\n> \n> You will excuse me if i dont understand the point of making a reply and expecting it to just be ignored, although, as you said you just spend most of it just calling me ignorant, because you believe i'm wrong, instead of just making a solid argument to show me that i've made a mistake.

Lee Sin, point for point, gets more out of damage items than Jarvan ever will. This is a fact.\nTank wise? Jarvan has a slight edge.\nUtility wise? Lee Sin retains it constantly. He doesn't need someone to set up a play, he can do it on the spot. Knocking up the entire team and ripping half the health off an ADC with your ult AND pushing them to be in front of your team is amazing, and as we saw in S4, it could be done consistently.\n\nJarvan combos? More rewarding but extremely hard to get done.\n\nThere is no reason to ever consider Jarvan more of an issue than Lee Sin.","replies":[{"poster":"Risurin","date":"2015-02-20T05:35:06.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Annoth84,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mLuAOGbt,comment-id=0001000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-19T21:41:58.504+0000)\n>\n> Lee Sin builds sight stone not because he needs it for full kit potential, but primarily because he is one of the few champions capable of affording a sightstone without a significant loss in terms of stats. It is part of what makes him such a great jungler.\n> He doesn't need to immediately build tanky or build damage.\n> He has high enough base damage, and he has the tools and capabilityof getting in and out of a fight.\n> Jarvan does not have the same tools, and thus, will build a randuin's instead because once he goes into a fight, he isn't expected to escape it lke Lee Sin.\n> Their build paths are different because of what they can do.\n> Lee Sin can escape, Jarvan cannot.\n\nJarvan can esscape. And btw, in competitive, you will often see Jarvan/vi/etc get the sightstone as a jungler because of the vision, and to match the vision the enemy jungler with a sightstone can provide. we even seen khazix with a sightstone during world championship, and he didnt look any weak. Sightstone jarvan is nothing new, he can afford it and it doesnt make him any worse.\n\n> When you make an ambigous statement, you cannot blame an individual for assuming such.\n\na champion doesnt only scale with ratios. Mundo doesnt have that many good ratio, yet he scale into late game verywell. A champion scale depending on what his kit does.\n \n> 26% armor reduction relies entirely upon the armor the individual has built up to that point. While it helps keep his damage relevant, it doesn't necessarily mean his damage will be higher unless the target has a significant amount of armor which only 1 or 2 champions will possess. In which cae, focus falls upon CCing those targets, rather than trying to kill them.\n\nthe difference between 100 and 74 armor is 7% damage, at lvl 8 a champion like lissandra, with obviously Hourglass and lets say armor run has 100 armor. The difference is thru a debuff so it upgrade all sources of AD damage your team does, including your ADC. dont forget you boost his damage already with you AS aura. \n\n> Jarvan's ult is good, but you must also consider that the mjority of champions played in the meta can escape it without using flash, and will typically dos o.\n> This is part of why Lee Sin dominated during s4. Up until the changes to Jarvan's ult, it wasn't that much better.\n\na good jarvan ult, is also significally easier to land then a lee ult, and it can trap more then one champion in it. My favorite demonstration of this, is IEM Sanjose, when Cloud9 deleted 2 played because of flash jarvan ult into E Q, the lock was real.\n\nWhen i think about Season 4 jungle dominance, i think about kha'zix, not lee.\n\n> Furthermore, 10% HP is only on CURRENT health.\n> Lee Sin's Q executes based on 8% missing health, meaning it will be better as the fight continues whre as Jarvan's relies entirely upo how much of their pool exists.\n> Lee Sin also gets an innate 40% AS boost, which makes up for th 10% damage thatJarvan gets on his passive, especially for jungle clearing.\n> Lee Sin's ult is arguably better than Jarvan's.\n> It cannot be escaped as it is point and click, it disables multiple champs and does not require a 2nd party to create hard CC. If you noticed the game where the gnarvan combo was being utilized, it required much more set up and was hard to utilize under pressure. \n> Lee Sin can merely safequard ult the ADC, then Q to escape or vice versa.\n\nThing is if he only need safeguard to ult an ADC, either the adc is horribly out of position, either the enemy team are more blind then lee himself xD in reality, lee will usually need his Q to get in, W to get in position R to push the adc into his team, and suprise factor + flash to get away\nif we going with bonus AS well instead of 2sec 40% as on spell cast, jarvan get 22% passive AS +22% when he toss his flag. Also, dont forget again he has armor shred! its clear lee will do more damage early on his own, but later on, jarvan, will do a lot more then lee for far less work in a teamfight.\n\n\n> NO risk involved compared to the gnarvan combo.\n> While Jarvan can get more from his shield, this is making the assumption that he will, and at most we really only see 1-2 champs being aura'ed unless it is in the jungle.\n\nthe onyl risk of gnarvan combo, is that you miss the combo...there are still two tanky guy in the front line lol. i think 2-3 hits with shield in teamfight is pretty reasonable, and its already a lot better then lee selfshield\n\n> The only aspect where Jarvan scales \"better\" than lee sin is through his tankiness through his shield which is at best, 200 more hp.\n> Utility? Lee Sin maintains it.\n> Damage? Lee Sin ALWAYS does more.\n> Play set ups? Lee Sin does it much more easily and does NOT require a second champion to crete hard CC on multiple targets.\n> If you are suggesting that he scales better defensively?\n> Yes. He does, but only due to his shield and even then, not significantly enough to say flat out that Jarvan is absolutely more tanky. \n\nearly game, sure lee can be stronger then jarvan, thats basically what lee is, strong early game. but later on jarvan mobility isnt far inferior, his utility is far better and more diverse, his damage output should even be stronger (26% armor shred hurt even squishies, specially followed by a 10% hp dmg and a knock up in the mix, and easy target for slow and ulti. Also, while i agree 26% armor shred is the bestest, its still better then not penetration at all, and lee doesnt have any, so as the game progress, as champion get natural armor with levels, and items (even carries with the like of hourglass and GA)  Jarvan ulti is also a point and click, and you can lock so much champion in it and its far mroe easy to execute and land then an \"insec\".  jarvan does so much more then lee.\n\nThere is a reason why jarvan ban rate is 53%+ while lee is a bit less then 3%. There is a reason why jarvan win rate is also 53% while lee is at 46%.\n\n> Not necessarily, again, you are focusing on a champion such as Xerath, his low mobility means he is easy prey for any of the meta junglers at the time such as Kha'zix, elise, etc etc.\n> Lee SIn can just as easily work well with Lissandra's kit, Grave ult, azir ult, maokai snare, nidalee/ahri/corki.\n> Primarily because even if they attempt to escape, Lee Sin CAN and WILL stick to them.\n> Jarvan cannot catch a Kallista.\n> Lee Sin will catch her and kick her back to the front line and prevent her from decimating your team and allow your team to catch her.\n> Lee Sin can easily separate a champ, and due to the low cd and damageof it, he is more likely to leave them in a state where they are less likely to escape.\n\nIts always better to lock someone so that your team can follow up, then ahving 1 guy being able to solo follow across the map. Against Kalista, both the champions arent the best choice. Vi is. pantheon and wukong probably would do better as well although they arent as high tier pick. at that point its draft phase decision more then anything. And yes Lee can work well with these champion as well, but Jarvan set them up so much easier and better then lee does. \n \n> Jarvan's ult has stronger potential yes, but the set up required is often too difficult and requires certain scenarios. That isn't good for play, you want flexibility so you can pick and choose when to fight rather than being so reliant on the rest of the team.\n\nE+Q +R, you can even just flash+R and you have your lock, its a point and click as well. He just need teams to be teamfighting and of course to make sure he ult when follow up is possible. your argument kinda goes against lee sin too, because he literally jump into the enemy team to displace 1 guy. if it goes poorly he literally suicided for free.\n\n> Really?\n> You made the statement that anyone who sees a problem with Lee Sin is an individual who had issues with the champion and is thusly biased.\n> That is being ignorant and insulting.\n> Your statement could be used for any champion, Jarvan, vi, etc etc.\n> So yes, being called ignorant fits you perfectly.\n> Do not act indignant when your behavior has been pointed out.\n\ntbh honest, the first time around i though you were just genually calling your own post an ad hominen, since you were calling me ignorant multiple time in it. misread that (english is the 4th language, i'm still learning) \n\nWhat i said back there, is basically how i cant, but feel how the post are made under these conditions. not that they are necessary. That is because a lot of them dont have any solid argument other then the natural \"lee is too stronk\" and  \"his kit does X Y Z\" said in a way to make it sound more overwhelming then they do, which is seen often in these kind of posts. makes me feel liek the posts were made quickly without enough though put into them, which makes me consider they were maybe made out of recent soloq misadventure. Then i followed with the natural statement that its more productive to look for solution to your game difficulties, then just posting in a forum in hope to create enough riot against a champion. As i said, its how i perceive these post, and sometimes i do even make fun of it, but its not like i can verify it. no need to take how i feel like a direct attack lol,","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-18T14:20:21.931+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":9,"body":"He doesn't need a nerf, no.\n\n**This man needs a rework**, clearly his design was poorly thought out as he was meant to be just an Apirl Fools Joke in the first place.

Well what does Lee have? His passive is strong, thats true, (it was nerfed before ) and honestly the only thing i see future nerfs. He has a skillshot execute on his q, his best ability by far. His w is a mediocre shield, especially since it procs only on ally cast ( another nerf ). The lifesteal on his w is great tho. His e used to be good, when it would slow attack speed as well, making it a relevant ability lategame, but now its one of the worst slows  (20% / 30% / 40% / 50% / 60%) and even decays pretty fast. His ult is a nuke, and can screw your whole team over if used incorrectly. \n\nSo we have: Burst Damage\n                      Sustain\n                      Mobility \n                      CC (only if Ult is used properly)\n\nMany Champions posses these traits aswell, sometimes trading in the mobility for Tankiness, which Lee** does not **have. Lee is squishy as hell before he gets his tank items, and even then, he drops super quickly, since none of his abilities scale of tankiness. Additionally, contrary to what people say, lee is** heavily** gated by energy, not being able to do a full rotation without the use of his passive, which, especially late game, is hard to trigger since you wont stay in a fight long enough to consecutivly auto. \nI heard someone say : \"Lee does as much damage as an assassin\", well that is because Lee** is** and assassin. he has the exact skillset off an assassin and therefore should be treated as one. Only that his burst is unreliable ( late game, try to hit that adc in the middle of his team ) making him a crappy assassin.\nHe is played as an Kick bot, his only play late game is to insec someone, or kick someone away.

The utility he provided lategame was NOT ENOUGH to overcome his need to build tank and stop doing damage.\n\nDo you know what has happened since that point? Every single different type of jungle that isn't an early duelist has been nerfed into competitive inviability. And all the other early duelists have been nerfed as well.\n\nLee isn't a generalist. He's simply the last one standing after literally every other style of play has been nerfed. His lack of lategame used to be overcome by better scaling champion's strengths. That simply isn't the case anymore, as all competition has been removed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Respakt","date":"2015-02-19T02:29:56.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps Lee Sin himself wields the legendary nerf bat, randomly nerfing those such as Sona while lightly tapping his friends Zed, Kat and others and of course never himself. When other junglers dare challenge his \"power deserved by his high skill cap\", he repeatedly hits them all the way to the bottom (Elise, soon Jarvan IV).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Philbo Baggins","date":"2015-02-18T18:39:26.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lv. 18 account... trollin.","replies":[{"poster":"The DJ Pon3","date":"2015-02-19T02:19:58.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm only a level 19.
