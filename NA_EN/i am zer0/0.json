It&#039;s called &quot;Perseverance&quot; and even reflected on one of his quotes - &quot;I will fight as long as I stand!&quot;. But currently, once he gets low on health he escapes from the battlefield like a coward and safely regenerates his HP away from danger. After all, it&#039;s just Warmog&#039;s Armor passive mechanic...\r\nIn my understanding, Garen is a man who will fight till the last breath. He will never run away from the battlefield, never cease to fight, never give up. The only thing that could stop him - is death.\r\nTherefore, i think that we can change it into something like: &quot;Garen regenerates 1 / 2 / 3% of MISSING health every second&quot;. (monsters/minions restricts still apply).\r\n\r\nI hope you will reply to my post :)\r\n\r\nP.S. I apologize for my bad English, not a native speaker :(","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-12T00:42:40.863+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Something like this might be a good change for the future if we felt we ever needed to look at Garen's passive, because it would probably make a little more thematic sense at least.\n\nThat said, one of the things with doing updates to champions is that it can sometimes be the right call to leave slightly suboptimal mechanics/tunings in kits if they aren't currently compromising the kit. As much as possible, we want to avoid \"change for the sake of change,\" though sometimes things can still come off that way.","replies":[{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-08-12T02:21:35.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wanted to reward Garen for \"Perservering\" what are your thoughts on him regaining HP when damaged? How it scales and where it comes from is trivial, but the idea of pushing through a heavy front line, regaining HP because you're a Juggernaut and will not quit until the Villain is dead sounds fun and themeatically fitting. \n\nIMO Standing in brush and taking a quick glance at your wrist for time until you regen is not Perseverance. And you want Garen to stay simpler right? What's more simple than being able to fight AND heal at the same time for free?\n\nAnd it lets Garen utilize his full kit during his main purpose of fighting. I always disliked how Garen lost a passive slot when he started actually doing his main purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"I am ZER0","date":"2015-08-12T05:23:32.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what i'm talking about! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wingling","date":"2015-08-12T13:38:30.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, and I totally agree that changing it is not really worthwhile.  His passive is critical to his lane phase, and changing it for thematics is short-sighted.  That said, since all the suggestions are along the lines of perseverance in battle, what if his W prevented his passive from being removed?  It gives him skillful ways to improve his lane matchups, potentially lets him persevere through kiting, and makes his W more satisfying since the removal of tenacity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LambGotTheCakes","date":"2015-08-12T11:10:52.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EeTXVW5i,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-12T00:42:40.863+0000)\n>we want to avoid \"change for the sake of change,\"\n\nBut Chaotic Alignments are the best ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tikail","date":"2015-08-12T02:35:15.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a passive increase to health regen when he damages an enemy champ or minion?\n\nLike his normal passive regens 1/2/3% of his health.
