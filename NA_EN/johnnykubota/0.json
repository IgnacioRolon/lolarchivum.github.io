It still hasn't solved my problem. \r\n\r\nHere's my case:\r\n\r\nWhen I download and install LOL on my macbook, it opens once, while installing the game. whenever I shut the client down, it will not open again. I have read about deleting lock file, I have had this problem before and it worked but now I have no lock file so not working. \r\n\r\nThen I read about user kernel in RADS folder. I have checked everywhere but I can't find a rads folder or a user kernel file. maybe this is out dated and there is no such file anymore in the new patch idk? \r\n\r\nI tried installing the game and duplicating the files straight away after installing, then tried swapping them.. still not working. \r\n\r\nI need to reinstall the game every time I want to play.. very annoying\r\n\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me please? \r\n\r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Riot BlueMonday","date":"2020-02-25T23:32:56.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you reach out to player support?
