It's perfectly fine when nothing's really going on, or I'm farming, but the moment I hit a teamfight, or there's more than 3 people fighting at once they go down almost completely. It normally fixes a week after the patch hits live, but I'm getting pretty sick of this. Is there a permanent fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-28T18:19:51.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS issues are commonly caused by driver problems or hardware failure.
