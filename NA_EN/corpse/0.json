When the new honor system came out you couldn't get to honor 3 for a couple of weeks, maybe even a month or two, don't remember. In that time I got demoted to honor 0 a couple of days before they actually updated the honor system and let people become honor 3, which sucked. But ever since I've been stuck in honor 0. I'm almost certain it's bugged, and you can't get out of honor 0. I legit haven't been toxic for at least a month and am still honor level 0.. hope they fix it sometime soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T01:36:19.656+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like when honor launched, you did actually start out at honor rank 2 like everyone else. After the launch, there was one instance that dropped you to honor rank 1, and then another following that which dropped you to rank 0. Since they were two separate punishments that dropped you each time, that's most likely why it's taking awhile to rank back up. The progress you were making towards rank 2 might have been nullified by the punishment that dropped you to rank 0.","replies":[{"poster":"Sles123","date":"2017-09-19T00:41:33.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if I got banned 2 weeks ago, does it mean I'm not receiving the end of season rewards (not this account, but my EUW main)?

(as I said, account was clean - never toxic, one time when I had a bad day I just snapped and I get punished with this...) Given the time I invested in this game in order to reach Diamond 3, as well as the thousands of euros of skins, icons, etc. over the years.. I'd say it's quite a nefarious act against me.. taking my season end rewards too..

I do believe there are going to be new end of season rewards for those that have a certain level of Honor, but we still need to wait for all of those details.\n\nI have a question about my situation. I received a  two week ban for a game that I broke the rule in July. I'm aware of what I did but I felt this was put off really bad. Riot issued the ban two months later when the new honor system came out. I was unaware of the consequences and feel like I've been punished harshly. My honor level dropped to 0 and I can no longer earn keys. This is real frustrating for me because later on I was notified that my cap was unlocked and now able to receive honor again. However I've been playing for 2 months now on a daily basis and these honors that I receive postgame seems like it has no effect. I can't seem to earn rewards and being left out, and a ban being issued 2 months later when coincidentally the new honor system came out seems a bit shady. I just can't seem to shake of this feeling that being told to keep \"casually playing\" will increase my honor when nothing is changing.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T21:04:00.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just pulled up your account to double check for you. Your Honor *is* progressing at a normal rate now. But it's important to keep in mind that everyone will progress through the ranks at a different pace. It all depends on a number of games you're playing as well as the number of times you get honored. You may want to look at others and say \"Why did they rank up before me?\", but the system isn't designed to compare yourself to others simply because everyone plays at different rates.","replies":[{"poster":"Chunin","date":"2017-12-03T13:18:01.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\nI have been playing roughly 170+ games since my 2 weak suspension (i counted them) and i was eligible to earn rewards again after about 50 games.
