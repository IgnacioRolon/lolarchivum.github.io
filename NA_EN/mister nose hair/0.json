Issue and Temp Fix","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SO lately I had noticed my fps was lower than usual around 50-70 fps, my laptop is a Alienware 17 with a GTX970m So Im used to being around 200-300 fps, So what I did was Re-install NVIDIA and optimized the game again and it went back to actually even higher fps around 300-350 but my character was like spiking wherever I would command to go to. So I Reinstalled the game and still same issues. My Ping is always good around 50-55 ms. So then I was fed up and started messing with the FPS capping and I put it at  144 and it fixed it, everything seems to be okay. But seriously Why am I having to go down to such low fps??? I don't like this. anyone else know what could've happened?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T17:40:10.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your PC might just be too good, to be honest.
