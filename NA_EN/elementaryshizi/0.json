The internet problem happens only whenever I play the game and all my internet lags. I can't even open the google webpage during the game processes. \r\n\r\n* When I try to ping \"na.leagueofelegends.com\" with the command promptï¼Œit shows 20 ms out of the game and 3000 ms during the game. Also, I've tried to ping other thing like goole or Facebook in the same way during the game and out of the game, the problem rests the same.\r\n\r\n It bothers me so, not only that I can not play this game but also that I don't know the reason. I'm wondering that if it is the problem for my internet settings, the problem with this game or with my internet condition.\r\n\r\nCan anyone helps me with this condition? Thank you a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-25T17:18:49.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having a network issue or packet loss that would result in sudden ping spikes, or input delays.
