I basically didn't listen to any at all before I made my first song except what I might have heard occasionally on the radio. As for my style of rapping I think it is just what comes naturally to me as a person who enjoys music.  I play the guitar and the drums so rhythm is not an issue.  My first few songs were parody style and I basically ripped off the feel of the original song.  While not exactly the same like the word replace parodies you see from someone like Instalok or Plentakill the flows I was using weren't exactly original either.  Over time my style grew naturally out of the songs I was creating and at a certain point I began to feel confined by the feel of parodies more than helped by the established flow within them.  So I basically stopped doing parodies and my natural rhythm took over from there.\n\nLately I've been more focused on having good rhymes in addition to having good lyrics which aren't necessarily the same thing.  While league fans and fans of lyrics were enjoying my songs I wouldn't say that fans of rap in general wouldn't have found them too enjoyable up until my last 10 or so because of a lack of multis and more complex rhymes.\n\nAll in all it's just a natural progression as I gain experience.  As people expect more from me I put in more effort and my past experiences allow me to sound more polished.  Where I might have spent two hours writing a whole song before I now sometimes spend two hours writing four lines.  This is basically the reason I don't get songs out as often as I used to.  I am trying to avoid the comment \"this song is not as good as your other songs\", it's the worst thing to see as a content creator.\n\nDo you really get up at 5am during playoffs?
