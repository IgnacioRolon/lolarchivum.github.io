That literally destroys any hope of you being able to play a champ you enjoy , that scales.\n4. The community seems to lack basic common sense.

Individual champions are not the offenders, damage is rampant and some champs are just able to take advantage of that more than others, some in a very straight forward way others in less direct ways.\n\nYou can't wait for them to tune 100+ champions to the current game state.  Just shave off the damage from runes.\n\nI've been saying this SINCE NOVEMBER.  You gutted defensive stats.  You gave some champions a pittance back as recompense.  This is why the games damage is so high.  I have been downvoted for all the threads I make on this, but I still think I'm right.  \n\nGive champions the 9 armor and 12 magic that was basically universal from old runes, because champions for how many years had been tuned around those defensive stats existing in play testing and live servers, and then see how the game goes.  You cannot remove what is 10-15% damge reduction in physical and magic damage and not expect things to get ridiculous, because let's face it the Resolve tree is a joke.  Hell one of the Resolve tree runes is to do aoe magic damage ffs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wínters Dawn","date":"2018-07-10T08:03:35.841+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":25,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Shuriman Curator","date":"2018-07-10T10:13:33.894+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wínters Dawn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=H2PtEcOR,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-07-10T08:03:35.841+0000)\n>\n> Cant stop playing a game without telling the world? \n> If the got a new team to balance the game you&#x27;d still cry.

I feel like no matter what a company does people will still cry, because they don't understand that the company is not listening and will not listen... I used to be a toxic arsehole and then just realized it is not worth it to take League seriously. With the way the game is, combined with matchmaking being completely horrendous, to the fact that my gameplay very rarely matters in the game: we arrived at a state where taking the game seriously is just not worth it. I take Golf It more serious than I do League lmao. This game has just gone to crap, and that is fine, it is Riot's direction, it is what they want. What do they care that there is a vast majority of their community that dislikes it? They don't. I play to play with friends. You know I used to actually take this smurf seriously to get it into gold and get there fairly easily, I tried taking it seriously for a single game this season and I just rolled the game with no contest, but I didn't enjoy myself doing it, so now I just play everything I don't normally play and just do what I can. \n\nThis game lost its mojo in season 5 when it became apparent that the company didn't care about the community/playerbase. Nobody, and I mean nobody wanted that group of bruiser reworks, they did it anyways. Everyone complained about the fact they were overtuned, their reaction was to rework more things. Their priority has always been skins, and making money, as a business should be. But its a shame they used to be humble and used to listen. They are not either of these things anymore. \n\nDon't cry about the game because they don't care. Just stop taking it seriously, troll pick in your games and try to make it work.

What does balance mean to me? It means that every champion should be viable and that isn't the case at all. Riot fixes the champions that they like, but does nothing do the champions they don't (case in point Mordekaiser, who has over 180 well documented bugs- who is coding this game, interns from the local high school?)\n\nThe second thing is that the development team keeps flip flopping and being hypocritical- first they don't like burst damage, then they like it and then they have made it absurd to where you can easily get one shotted- in the past they did not condone these gameplay mechanics. Then there was the tank meta where tanks would not only soak up damage, but they would deal out ridiculous amounts of damage and it was not unusual to find tanks such as Sion and Dr. Mundo on the top of damage leader boards. The whole purpose of a tank is to soak of damage and provide utility for the team, not to one shot squishies.\n\nRiot also refuses to address serious issues like the toxicity of the community and smurf accounts- how is it fair for a Platinum player to be decimating people in ranked Bronze matches? Then there is the argument of well Riot can't do anything about this, and sure they can- make the game B2P. If the game actually cost something perhaps that would deter people from creating multiple accounts- every time you want to make a new account you have to rebuy the game.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem is that Riot doesn't seem to ever be satisfied with the game- they need to have a clear end date to where they will no longer release champions, but the problem is that they are now all about the money and they don't care how screwed up the game is, just as long as they can release a new champion where they can sell a bunch of new skins at a premium price.\n\nThese are all serious issues and concerns, but Riot downright refuses to acknowledge them.","replies":[{"poster":"Wínters Dawn","date":"2018-07-11T21:28:36.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt say the game was balanced. what I'm saying is there are fans from multiple games saying their respective company is \"failing\" at overall balance. \nand if you think this non stop release of champs and this non existent end date is a recent thing YOU m friend are delusional. \nthere is NO end game for league.
