It does encourage me a bit to try out some of the champs picked out for me and try them out in the jungle, so I can see that being an incentive for a special price.  \n\nHere's there really awesome thing about the shop that some might have missed:  [Those personalized skins are bundled with the champion.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-710-notes#patch-your-shop)  You might not own Twisted Fate, Corki, or Katarina now...but if you want to try them there's a solid bundle discount.  Nice.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Dawnbrınger","date":"2017-05-19T16:57:49.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, ive played every champ in the game and im stuck on the fact that i onetrick riven. I'd be happy with a gangplank, yasuo, vayne, rengar, riven and jhin skin but i got only riven and its my least fave skin for her bar redeemed. It'd be nice if my old account wasnt banmed because of hackers and i'd get it back but i was never listend too and they assumed i was the hacker. But i literally hate all 5 of those champs and all the skins with them. I'd be super happy if i could get just a single reroll or even close my shop and give me like dragonblade riven i'd so do that. Maybe make it based off of your last played champions with the winrates then find the highest rated skin? maybe if you onetrick a champ you have a higher chance to get a legacy skin? just some ideas","replies":[{"poster":"Dawnbrınger","date":"2017-05-19T16:59:49.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For us onetricks this store really isnt too good, maybe if you almost completely have only that champs games on your account then it can give you 2+ skins for that champ? i remember the 2015 snowdown shop was amazing and i bought everything on there because it gave me all the skins i wanted. same happened for my friends at the time. the 2015 snowdown bot was amazing","replies":[]}]}]}]}
