Vlad was nerfed because his kit is amazing in a coordinated team comp. If {{item:3123}} was not an item he would have a better time as well I am guessing. I find his problem now is that you have to build him more glass cannon for doing damage, and due to the fact you have to be in the danger zone to do damage really hurts him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-29T00:25:28.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His.. damage is... weak?\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nHe does way too much damage for a champion that is borderline unkillable if he gets slightly ahead, and his laning damage is very high for a manaless ranged champion with insane sustain.
