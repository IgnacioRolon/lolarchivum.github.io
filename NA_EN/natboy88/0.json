Basically, they played a game of Ascension (if you aren&#039;t living under a rock you would know of the gamemode riot is pumping out every week) where they would force the enemy team to surrender because they couldn&#039;t go back to base to buy items. The premade basically stopped the enemy from capturing relics with Sunfire Capes and them being too tanky to kill after a while. Watch the video for more information. I constantly play Ascension to rack up IP and play stupid shit against real people, and when i saw this strategy I wanted to play in a premade 5 and try it out. But now I&#039;m not so sure that I should because me or my friends may get banned.

I would assume they understood that the game would drag on and they knew that they weren't going to be able to capture relics. In my (silver 1) opinion this is almost the same as playing against someone who counter jg's you and hides in bushes forcibly tilting you hard. Or laning against Darius. And let's not forget the amount of bots that flood into these Ascension games in the first place. If these gamemodes are supposed to be short then enforce it. You could put a limit of how long a game is supposed to be like in the practice tool.\n\nOr you could put other gamemodes back on the rotation.\n\ncough One for All cough Black Market Brawlers","replies":[{"poster":"Auld","date":"2018-03-26T22:20:54.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please do not necro old threads.

Is this strategy cancerous? Of course it is because it completely gets rid of any meaningful progress in this game mode, but is it ban worthy? Not really, at least not at this point. If these guys had played 10 or 20 games of this and potentially hindered the enjoyment of 50 to 100 players then I could see it, but just a few games worth should have warranted a warning sent out to each of these players stating exactly why they were in trouble.\n\nRiot should have directly addressed this issue and worked on a hotfix or disable the queue until they are able to patch it. This leads us to the real question. Why did Riot need to ban these players when the responsibility for this oversight is Riots? A ban fixes this for a small group of players, but has opened the strategy up for thousands of players to abuse, which is going to create a massive influx of games that are ruined.\n\nI don't really think this strategy should be allowed, but to ban someone (let alone a group of people) for finding an exploit in your own system that you advertise as pretty much perfect is ignorant at best.\n\nAlso please don't come at me with stuff like \"Remember Jordan Belfort? He did this exact thing in real life and we all think he should have been thrown in jail!!??\" because that isn't a comparable situation.

You're being an assholes.  Riots main rules with chat is to NOT be an asshole.  \n\nYou can have your own opinion on the matter but I will personally continue to report each and every person who says \"ez\".\n\nIt's then up to Riot to determine if they should be punished or not.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Squidwards House","date":"2017-08-09T00:28:07.813+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"why would you ban them? \"they ruined the fun\" when you'd have to ban me aswell cause as soon as an enemy flames in all chat i camp this sucker till he smashes his fucking pc. because i wanna win and the more this guy rages the worse he will play and the higher is our teams chance of winning. dont ban them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Cat Tosha","date":"2017-08-09T11:09:54.671+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am honestly surprised by all the outrage about the ban.
