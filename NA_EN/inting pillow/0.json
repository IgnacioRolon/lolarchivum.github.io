With a shield whatever damage reduction they have won&#039;t matter cause the shield will stop the damage from ever happening! \n\nAnd ADCs won&#039;t have consistent damage anymore! Because now whenever they attack, for 3-10 seconds they get 60% bonus attack speed! That means that they will deal more damage than usual, why does this matter? Because for 3-10 seconds you will have inconsistent damage! Thank you Riot! You listened and delivered just what we wanted!","replies":[{"poster":"ananke","date":"2017-06-23T23:52:13.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-24T00:42:03.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if overheal's shield will apply to lifesteal.
