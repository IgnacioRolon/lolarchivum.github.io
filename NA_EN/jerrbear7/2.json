Riot has confirmed multiple times that LSI has the same status as most other 3rd party services such as LoL Replay, lolking, quickfind, lolnexus etc.; meaning that while they _**might impose a violation of the terms of use**_ Riot is aware of that and chose not to enforce.** Obviously use is at your own risk though; neither Riot nor LSI can be held liable for any unexpected side effects.**\n\nI mainly want to use this for the Champion filters and possibly item sets. As far as I can tell this program is legal but I wanted to make sure just in case I get myself into a bad situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-21T22:03:50.243+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't officially support any 3rd party programs or modifications, and doing so would be at your own risk.

Props to you guys.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-22T00:59:22.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That being said, the quote from LSI website is right. Riot *could* deem it illegal, but LSI doesn't provide any competitive edge in-game, so Riot doesn't do it. I used this program for more than a year, and everything's fine. Champ filters and itemsets are just helpful BEFORE the game actually starts, they don't provide anything IN-game.\n\nAll of that is true only for the current version, though, and LSI could decide to add a feature that Riot would disagree with in the next version, but they have no reason to do that and it's pretty unlikely to ever happen. Just make sure to check the changelog before updating to a new version, and check they don't add feature that provide an unfair advantage ingame.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JerrBear7","date":"2016-07-21T21:46:53.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason I ask is that I do not want to lose access to my account (I spent alot of time & money on this account) and I dislike how it says that they are not responsible for anything that happens to my account however I could see how they would do it for legal reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-22T00:55:47.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, no, that's a standard clause in ALL EULA.

(For example, I hired a guy to work on my roof and he wasn't wearing the proper safety equipment. He ended up trying to sue me.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
