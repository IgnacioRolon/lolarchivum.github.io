I have a 1440p monitor currently. I doubt I will upgrade soon since this monitor is expensive and I can't afford nor do I need another. (Nvidia please lower the cost of G-Sync!!!)\n\nI just saw an awesome looking monitor at Computex 2017 over [here](https://rog.asus.com/articles/gaming-monitors/the-35-rog-swift-pg35vq-gaming-monitor-turns-hdr-and-quantum-dots-up-to-200hz/) and it made me wonder about League since some YouTube videos of it mention e-sports (since the back of the monitor has RGB lighting for supposedly e-sports crowds?).","replies":[]}]}]}
