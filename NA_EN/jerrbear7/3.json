I don't know what else to say other than it goes not responding randomly.\r\nI am NOT running the client as administrator (when I do there is no more crashes), as I have standard account privileges for security's sake. I have the admin password when I need it.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get League always run as administrator without typing in the password every time. Will the new Alpha Client not require to run as administrator?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T23:12:17.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The patcher requires permission to access files and launch.
