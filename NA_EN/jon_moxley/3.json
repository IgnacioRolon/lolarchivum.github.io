If i play a game badly, let&#039;s say i&#039;m 0/5/0, and i win the game because my top laner stomped on enemy top and now he&#039;s doing 1v5, to me that&#039;s worst than a loss. I&#039;d rather lose a game where i played good, like today i lost a game where i was 4/1/13 Lulu supp because my top and mid fed their as* off in lane, but i wasn&#039;t salty. I did my job and i did it good, that&#039;s all it matters to me.","replies":[]}
