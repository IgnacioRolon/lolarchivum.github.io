When I say It's useless other than in super low elo. I'm saying because the matches are longer and as the matches get longer, the more health champions have and the more health you have, the more health you regenerate out of combat from the buff. \n\nAdding a little to that, I am very aware that low elo players don't know how to properly disengage fights, but another thing they are inexperienced with is health maintenance and knowing when to recall. Especially after objectives like drakes and baron. This drake helps them with that.\n\nSomething I'd like to point out in your argument is that you brought up pro play. Solo queue tends to be a little bit different than proplay, especially the types of champions and strategies that are viable. \n\nIn solo queue, people like to play high damage fighters, assassins and sometimes juggernauts. In proplay, you see alot of tanks, cc bots and utility. In solo queue, tanks are almost non existent due to conqueror and more lack of team coordination and communication. Them having more tanks and com lines allows that drake to be more useful.\n\nTanks = cc and disruption.\n\nComms = better team play execution \n\nI'm not saying that solo queue has no way of disengaging fights, but it's much more limited both in characters to enable the disengage and the type of communication which makes the dragon such a low priority for junglers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2019-02-04T11:38:11.444+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Taliyah player I literally get wet whenever I see an ocean drake. \n\nI'm sure Anivia and Cass players feel the same.","replies":[{"poster":"IainG10","date":"2019-02-04T16:40:39.991+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"And Blitz!","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2019-02-05T06:56:19.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poor metal mans Q uses like a third of his mana pool per cast lmao","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jon Moxley","date":"2019-02-04T13:15:22.984+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wilk Łucznik,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sOw0kEOZ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-02-04T04:16:35.263+0000)\n>\n> People seriously think ocean drake is useless?
