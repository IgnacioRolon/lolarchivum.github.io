These macros however only affect the keyboard and does not interfere with the game itself. I was wondering if i am allowed to actually make a macro that allows me to spam ctrl+3 or ctrl+2 just for the heck of it. Will i get banned for this? I would really like to know from a Rioter. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2017-07-05T18:23:43.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to have /joke /taunt /laugh /dance on ctrl+1,2,3,4\nI have mine on J, K, L, ; keys, you can change them in-game to that.\n\nI think, personally, I wouldn't risk having a macro do ctrl+3, as that is tec 2 key presses with 1 button.\nBut that's just my personal opinion.\n\nNot worth getting banned over tec. \"scripting\", just to do something silly like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-05T16:55:32.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not part of the player behavior team, but my understanding is that you can remap your keys but not combine multiple keypresses.  Trying to macro keypresses to do things for you, like ward hopping, could spell trouble.  You should be okay to bind your emotes, though.  I recommend hitting up the Player Behavior team in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to check if your specific bindings are okay to use.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
