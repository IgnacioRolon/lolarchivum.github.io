Everything went normal until our jungler tried to lock in. The timer was stuck at 0. My teammates did not have this error only me. Im kinda afraid to hop into another queue. Ill try again now wish me luck! Ill provide a link to a video supporting this, sorry for the excessive cursing. Sorry i wasn't fast enough to pull out the cam though. This time ill keep it open to try to catch it again if it happens.\nThis happend in latest patch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvbOFO6Bhwo&amp;feature=youtu.be\nEdit: I got into a game now! Such a shame i had to wait 5 minutes for the ban to get over!
