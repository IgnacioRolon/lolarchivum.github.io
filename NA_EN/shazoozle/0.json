I tried going into Riot folder, config folder, opening game.cfg in notepad and checking the height and width of resolution, which matches my screen (1920*1080), because somewhere online someone says if the resolutions don't match then this may happen. However this is not the case for me so I am having the same problem as you as of right now.
