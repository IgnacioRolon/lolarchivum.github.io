Sometimes i have to alt F4 or end task but in the situations that i don't, it will start responding again after 10-20 seconds. When this happens during champ select i dodge which is out of my control.

I've been playing the game since 2009 and from then to now, this has just started happening as of post 7.18. So last month, yes all my drivers and shit are up to date as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T01:06:49.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a program go completely unresponsive like that is most often the cause of your pc being unable to handle what the program was doing along with everything else running in the background.
