He stacks fervor to full in two spells. Tank masteries are terribly underpowered and windspeakers gives you a percentage of his very very small heals. Even counting the extra armor and tiny bit of MR, its not even worth it compared to the increased damage output from Iceborn/Fervor. Not to mention, going Windspeakers means you do no damage, still run out of mana, heal for nothing and you're squishy.\n\nI find it extremely easy to out damage other bruisers on my team and be a massive damage threat to protect my carries.

His best items are ones that double dip armor and other stats. Mana pendant isn't nearly enough to fight off 4 man dives and constant harass. It often feels like it is very hard to wait for 3 stars to get a decent heal while your ADC is being hammered. Coin and Shield both have HP or Armor, not both, so they end up being slot inefficient. \n\nEternity is a great passive that Taric could use if its final builds were less awkward for him. It feels like tanks that can't deal damage are worthless in the current game. Stunning things like ekko etc won't save my carry unless I'm a large enough threat to throw them off target. Pure tanks melt pretty fast, I've tried it a few times on Taric, had better results mixing damage in. \n\nI personally don't think Taric is underpowered or OP. His heal is just godawful early for the cost. I basically just use it for Bravado.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-08-27T22:38:40.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skias,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IsRkJ84O,comment-id=0001000000010000,timestamp=2016-08-27T22:10:07.432+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s sort of the problem.

You are probably misusing his heal and that's why you keep runing out of mana, you are not soraka or alistar so you shouldn't use your heal to keep your adc on lane ever (unless you are against a fairly passive lane and can afford the mana). Both his shield and heal are meant to be used during the trade to mitigate damage and not a follow up after the trade. \n\nAnyway if you are set on such offensive build with Gaunlets and the Infinity passive I will suggest you woudl go something like {{item:3069}} {{item:2049}} {{item:3025}} and then go for high HP items, I really don't recomend it since you will be fairly squishy midgame due to the lack of HP. Alternatively you could stop on the {{item:3096}} and go something like {{item:3096}} {{item:2049}} {{item:3025}} {{item:1011}} /{{item:3067}} {{item:3069}} or even complete your full HP item and get talisman as your 5th item. \n\nPersonally I don't think the damage coming out of bravado is significant enough to build him so offensively, add to that the fact that you need bravado to achieve decent as making you burn though your mana pool so fast and missusing your spells just to grab another bravado.... Maybe you should think of playing him jungle instead, it woudl fit more into your playstyle","replies":[{"poster":"Skias","date":"2016-08-28T06:55:42.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RogueWill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IsRkJ84O,comment-id=00010000000100000000,timestamp=2016-08-27T22:38:40.471+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t know how can you think Runic Armor is bad on Taric, his W scale of % max HP so an extra 8% is kinda  a big deal when you are building him with a fairly tank build.

I said, That is one of the only two uses it has. Triforce is ok if you have a huge lead in the jungle, and you can't afford to have manamune because of it's lack of defense stats. This is my point exactly. AP is meh on him, his ratios aren't amazing. \n\nCatalyst itself would be great for him to build but the tank option for it is rather lackluster compared to the vastly superior GLP-800 and RoA.\n\nThe reason I don't play him bot is his inability to keep up with the popular 4-man collapse. I wasn't really advocating for buffs to Taric himself, moreso to make Catalyst a better purchase for him without having to waste gold on AP.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2016-08-27T22:13:27.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RogueWill,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IsRkJ84O,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2016-08-27T16:06:46.028+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t go windspeakers....

The heal is negligible and its damage is extremely low. Even runic armor is a percentage of such a very low value on Taric, it ends up doing next to nothing. \n\nYou should be autoing a lot, damage tree gives higher yields in combat whenbyou can actually fight champs like trundle and Darius head on and win.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-08-28T18:27:51.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he operates just fine once you get the Glacial Shroud on him.
