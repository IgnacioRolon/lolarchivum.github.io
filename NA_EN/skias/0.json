I mean, you're saying that Taric being a top means you'd HAVE to play him. Which simply isn't true. He's got a 52 to 58% winrate now. He's just strong in the hands of people that have good timing in team fights.

His late game especially is really strong.\n\nThank you so much for responding, I love having this insight. I think a lot of it is the curve that his Q mana costs increases vs how fast he can itemize mana. It is extremely punishing to level Q without 500 bonus mana or so. I definitely feel his overall performance is right where it should be, its just his early game is super rough, maybe tougher than it should be. \n\nI don't think a small cost reduction would fling him into orbit, but you guys know best.\n\nThanks again for popping in!\n\nEdit: is there a chance Righteous Glory will get a more attractive stat profile soon? I'd love to build Catalyst on Gem man, but all the final items feel bad on him in a build. If Righteous Glory had armor or something, it would definitely be far better.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2016-11-16T23:46:26.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a cost reduction if he is alone?\n\nTop Taric could really use it.","replies":[{"poster":"Skias","date":"2016-11-17T00:54:05.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Voluug13,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UE2BI77B,comment-id=000300060000,timestamp=2016-11-16T23:46:26.583+0000)\n>\n> How about a cost reduction if he is alone?\n> \n> Top Taric could really use it.\n\nRepetoir just mentioned they were willing to give him some help if they are able, but he's in a good spot for the most part.

I've played a ton of Taric, gotten mastery 7 and I've got almost 300k mastery with him. Took him to gold. This is the one spot that I think he could be rounded off to make his Q less punishing to level up. The costs would still be super high if you just try and sit back to heal with it. This would make it cheaper if you are using it in its intended combat condition.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-11-15T22:33:34.704+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Son I am disappointed in you.
