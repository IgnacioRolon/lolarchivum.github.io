Playing every game on a hope and a prayer that your ADC and Mid don&#039;t feed is a miserable feeling. The game is so entirely team dependent that a single player&#039;s impact and agency is pretty much moot unless you can get the entire team to not feed. 4 people aren&#039;t enough. I understand teamwork is great to encourage, but your team should not immediately sink because of one person if everyone else is doing well.\n\nWe keep hearing there are changes to top lane and turrets have been mentioned, but these changes are moving at a snail's pace. Are we not going to see fixes until the season is over?","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-02-13T06:58:38.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Take TP, play a tank and roam frequently.\n\nCongrats, you have a direct impact on the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Rootlo","date":"2018-02-13T19:34:35.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Attticus Finch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IAVgqTaB,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-02-13T06:58:38.920+0000)\n>\n> Take TP, play a tank and roam frequently.\n> \n> Congrats, you have a direct impact on the game.\n\nYeah, except playing Maokai/Ornn everygame is boring.

It's not top lane making an impact, its TP making an impact. Top lane itself does nothing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zarxus1234","date":"2018-02-13T19:42:05.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Top lane may suck to play... but saying it doesn't have an impact on the game is just ridiculous. \n\nYour complaints literally apply to every player in the game.
