It doesn't matter how well you do against a Nasus in lane. He will eventually get to the point where he's tanky as hell (because literally every item he has built is a tank item save for trinity force) yet he does more damage than anybody on your team. Nobody can 1v1 him at that point, and few teams even have the tools to 2v1 him without him *still* getting a kill, simply because of how tanky he is. Other champions have to build damage to do damage, and when they don't, people complain that they're broken. He is capable of doing insane amounts of damage to towers while barely taking any himself - he's a champion that requires so many of your team's resources to deal with, that the rest of Nasus's team can do whatever they please in the meantime. Other pushers and burst-melees can be killed, other tanks can be kited, Nasus gets the best of both worlds.\n\nThey should make his Q work like Thresh's souls - infinite stacking, but diminishing returns, with an ideal threshold (no pun intended) for his stacks at a certain point in the game. There is no reason why a champion who builds no damage should have the same DPS as someone who did - otherwise, what is even the point?\n\nI don't want Nasus to be gutted and unplayable. I want him to be fair. Every champion in a competitive PvP game should be fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2015-03-07T20:09:17.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unlimited power if the game goes past 50 minutes.

Using your logic, Veigar is OP because he also has unlimited late game power....\n\nThere is a reason Veigar was just nerfed. I believe full-heartedly that Veigar was OP, and I still believe that infinite stacking is OP - it's only acceptable on Thresh because he doesn't get armor per level, and acceptable on Sion because of his low base health. Their infinite stackings come with compromises in the rest of their kit.\n\nYou have to answer Nasus. He doesn't need to farm for 50 minutes to be a threat. If he stays top and goes Tryndamere mode, he can easily take your towers and inhibitors by himself. If he decides to join the teamfights, he can absorb all the damage you can ask of a tank - and you have to answer it, because otherwise he'll stroll straight to your backline and 1 or 2-shot one of your carries. *Again*, carries that spent the whole game building damage, because that's what is expected of them. Nasus, who built none, outdamages them. Just like Tryndamere, he is incredibly good at pushing because almost nobody can 1v1 him - and if you send more than one person to stop him from taking your base, that leaves the rest of his team at an advantage.\n\nIt's not hard to completely avoid the enemy team and farm all game as Nasus, and then come out of the fog of war and stomp all over your team like Godzilla. You CAN fight people early and mid-game as Nasus, and if you're having a problem against your lane as Nasus, all you need to do is call your jungle to babysit - he doesn't even have to get a kill out of it, because as has been pointed out multiple times, Nasus doesn't *have* to interact with the enemy team at all to get fed. He is a PvE champion in a PvP game. That just isn't fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2015-03-07T21:45:13.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"sooooooooooooooooooo many things wrong with this.\n\n> I believe full-heartedly that Veigar was OP\n\nI don't even.... not even going to bother arguing this\n\n> If he stays top and goes Tryndamere mode, he can easily take your towers and inhibitors by himself.\n\nyet a mid-late game Trydamere will out duel him (provided ult is up) and is a better split pusher for his duel potential and ability to escape over walls etc. Speaking of which, Nasus has no escape what-so-ever.

You just focused and wasted all of your CC on the tank. Have fun while his team's carries do exactly what he was about to do instead.\n\nTryndamere being able to out-duel him means nothing, pretty much everybody here who has mentioned him seems to be in agreement that Tryndamere is OP. Invulnerability is OP. So is the absurd amount of free stats that Nasus gets.\n\nNot 4 seconds. 2.4 seconds. If you're not maxing CDR as Nasus, you're building him wrong. Also, don't act like Nasus isn't one of the hardest counters to ADCs in the game, there's no \"in their favor\" unless it's a hyper-fed vayne or kog'maw.\n\nHe is basically immortal. The only people who can survive a duel against him are tanks, and they don't have the damage to kill him. Again, because he doesn't need to build damage to do damage.\n\nNasus is not \"weak\" early game. Only a couple champions in the game can keep him from farming. Since he's a tank, he doesn't NEED to have a billion stacks to be useful. His Q isn't his entire kit, it's just a MASSIVE bonus on top of an already decent kit. Nasus starts the game with more sustain than a vamp scepter gives, allowing him to sit under tower and farm all day. If you stand on his minions and harass him away from them, you're eventually going to end up pushed to the tower. Denying him stacks doesn't automatically beat him, and a half-decent Nasus player knows how to get stacks despite the efforts of the enemy team.\n\nYou seem to be operating under the assumption that Nasus doesn't know how to play Nasus, yet the enemy team knows how to play against him. Nasus players know what counters them, and how to completely avoid that until there's simply too many stats on him for anyone to do anything to him.\n\n[ Look at this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfi9yAGOaf0) Name all the champions that are capable of doing this, at any point in the game - tanking an entire team and dishing out the damage to kill them - and tell me that those champions aren't completely broken. An entire team of people didn't have the resources to kill a single champion solely because of his absurd amount of stats.\n\nAgain, it is never fun to play against Nasus. There is no outplaying him, just poking him in lane and hoping that he's too stupid to know how to deal with it. Pretty much every game I've seen a Nasus lose, it was because of his team. Even though your PvE god tank/dps/pusher isn't strong enough to carry four complete morons, he's still completely busted. \n\n\"I don't even.... not even going to bother arguing this\" - Then I'll argue it. Amumu gets an instant AoE root on his ult. Veigar had an instant AoE stun on a basic ability, and was able to literally kill people from full health to nothing with a single point and click ability. Veigar was OP. Deal with it.

The ezreal one definitely wasn't a 1v5, yi killed them all one by one while taking no damage, kayle was cleaning up a low-health team in her own base while full health (also I already said that invulnerability is OP). If they tried just walking into five people and doing what Nasus can do, they would be killed before they could do anything. Once again, it's no the fact that NASUS DOES DAMAGE that's OP, it's that he GETS TOO MUCH DAMAGE FOR FREE. He is perfectly free to build one way, and get a second build's DPS for free.\n\nYou people are so freaking dense when it comes to your own champions. A nerf wouldn't kill Nasus and make him unplayable. All they would have to do is make his Q give him less damage per minions, or implement diminishing returns like Thresh. Even when I love a champion and have fun playing them, I'm perfectly willing to admit when they're OP.

This discussion isn't about them. My point is, and has been during this entire discussion, that Nasus gets too many free stats. Being dumped on early is completely irrelevant when the early game only makes up about ten minutes of a game that frequently reaches between thirty and forty minutes, and sometimes up to an hour. All of that time can be spent by Nasus farming as he sees fit, and then kill pretty much anybody despite being \"dumped on\". While there are plenty of things you can do wrong against Nasus, there are far too few things you can do *right*.\n\n80% of the time Nasus loses, it's because of his team. That's because his response to everything is to ignore all interaction with the enemy.

It's just that the current combination of his sustain and teleport means he gets to the point where he doesn't have to care about mitigating and can just tank and heal through harass.\n\nAlso I wouldn't want \"cop and nasus\" to be the main laning pattern instead of \"two guys trying to kill each other\", just something specific to the champion. Thing is right now a lot of other champions are sit tight, farm, and scale laners like irelia and mao. Passivity is too incentivized in general.\n\nBtw somewhere else you said riot admitted tp was overbearing right now. Can you link that?

It would encourage Nasus to fight the enemy top laner. He'd require a nerf elsewhere, maybe a reduction in his passive lifesteal?

He is a tank who gets an entire build's DPS for free, all on one ability with an incredibly short cooldown.\n\nLet's pretend that Nasus's Q didn't stack upon minion kills, and only had its base damage to go off of. At max rank, it is adding 110 damage to his total AD. Compare this to Jax, who actually has to build damage to do damage. Nasus's Siphoning Strike has a four second cooldown to Empower's three seconds. Assuming that Jax has a trinity force, his W is only doing 88 more damage than Nasus's Q. Jax is a champion who is rewarded for jumping into dangerous situations, his E and ult are there to keep him alive because his build prioritizes damage before tank stats. Even with this additional survivability, Jax can be outplayed, and he can be killed. It is within the realm of possibility to 2v1 a late-game Jax without somebody dying. Nasus's Q with zero stacks is doing a fairly close amount of damage to Jax's E, and this is on a tank. \n\nNow let's add back all those stacks we conveniently forgot about. Assume Nasus has 400 stacks, and now his Q (with basically the same cooldown as Jax's E) is doing 312 more damage than Empower. Assume it's 600 stacks, and that Nasus has a Trinity Force. With 119 base AD, Nasus just hit you for 987 damage, before armor reduction. This is on a champion who has built basically nothing but health and resistances, whose build path conveniently allows him to build CDR as well. This champion will only become more and more of a problem as the game goes on. You can't stop him from farming, because he can and will just ignore you as OP pointed out.\n\nNasus gets an entire build's worth of damage for free, on a single ability with a ridiculously short cooldown (2.4 seconds with 40% CDR). He still gets the same amount of gold for farming as everyone else does, he's just given twice the reward. Everyone in the game needs gold, Nasus does nothing special to get the benefits he gets. He is a great tank, thanks to his instant 600 HP boost and a stronger version of exhaust (with a 1.6 second down time with 40% cdr, coincidentally making him impossible to escape). He can also one-shot your carries just as effectively as a LeBlanc, who has half his health and a third of his armor/MR.\n\nThis champion simply gets way too much for free. This is a problem that all of the most broken champions have (*cough* Riven *cough*) and needs to be addressed. The only reason Nasus isn't played competitively is because it takes LCS-level coordination to prevent him from single-handedly winning the game, something that's quite conveniently present in LCS games and absent from solo-queue.\n\nEDIT: Unless you're Rumble... but Rumble is Rumble.\nEDIT 2: Let's not forget his passive, as well. A flat life-steal bonus, giving him the equivalent of a free vampiric scepter, which becomes two free vampiric scepters later on. Even more free stats that make a champion designed to sit and farm all game have an even easier time doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Skias","date":"2015-03-07T16:18:58.217+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult is completely automatic reward as well.

Nobody is throwing you a pity party for your weak early game... and nobody feels like you earned the power you got by late game... Nasus is lame all around.

Not that he's the only one with a retarded laning phase; Tryndamere, \"build full fury and then win the lane off a couple BS crits.\" and Vladimir \"I got my revolver without feeding.\" are both pretty retarded as well. \n\nBut, Nasus is still worse than either of them because not only does he win lane extremely easily because of his stupidly easy lane win condition, he also gets massively rewarded for doing so because he gets disproportionately more value for each CS than any other champion. Tbh, if Nasus didn't have such a meh kit other than that, he would be the most broken champion in the game. I don't even think Nasus is OP, just extremely annoying to deal with an a solo q environment.
