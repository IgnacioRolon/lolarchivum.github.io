HE was the one who could ensure that his bounties were pride of place in the middle of the bounty board - DARING someone to come at him.  In his mind, no-one would be stupid enough - and so it added to his legend.\n\nWhen the Harrowing came, every ship and able seafarer was needed.  Every weapon and warm body.  Miss Fortune had weapons, ships, and manpower.  Gangplank had weapons, ships, manpower, and influence.  Of course, Gangplank appearing to need help to fight off the Harrowing would be a sign of weakness, so I like to imagine that he made a great show of 'inviting' people like Miss Fortune and her forces to come along and watch his victory.\n\nMiss Fortune, burning with secret hate for Gangplank, would know how dangerous the Harrowing was, and that it would need _every_ able-bodied soul to fight off.\n\nBecause of the terrible danger, Gangplank would have 'generously' invited Miss Fortune to attend.  Miss Fortune would have put on her best fake smile, and accepted the invitation.  \n\nBecause if they didn't - the town they both call home would have been full of nothing but wailing spirits within the week.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-08-28T23:03:33.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just curious, and I'm not saying that you're not welcome here (you totally are <3), but is there a Rioter from narrative team interacting with the board?\nBecause I don't think I've seen one before, at least on Story & Art.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-08-28T23:10:28.806+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=5000000000000000,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=hO9dfE5p,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2015-08-28T23:03:33.993+0000)\n>\n> Just curious, and I'm not saying that you're not welcome here (you totally are <3), but is there a Rioter from narrative team interacting with the board?\n> Because I don't think I've seen one before, at least on Story & Art.\n\nYep - both Jaredan and Ant in Oz post here.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Jaredan\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Ant%20in%20Oz","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-08-28T23:14:49.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you!

Gangplank's not a dumb man; he wouldn't just send people after he constantly; he'd have made a plan to deal with her. Lull her in to a false sense of security so he can take her out in one go, of course with MF being a secretive lass it didn't help those plans.\n\nAnd of course what does he gain from killing a single bounty hunter? Not much really. Even if she is reputable he'd only really take offense if MF had gone out of her way to piss him off, but she clearly didn't because her goal was to murder him later. Not to mention the fact that allowing Bounty Hunters to get rid of potential rivals of his actually helps him out in the long run. \n\nIn the end I'd say that MF made her name and fame in such a way that Gangplank knew of her as a bounty hunter but wasn't pissed off by her personally so he didn't make a fuss of it; what's one more bounty hunter in Bilgewater? There's hundreds. If she started barking up his tree he'd shoot her without a second thought, but MF was careful enough to not do that, so when she came to Gangplank (or the other way around; don't know who wanted the truce to begin with) in GPs eyes she was someone who could actually help out the cause; he could dispose of her another time but right then and there she was useful. \n\nI feel like you're looking at this too simply. Gangplank's not a mindless murdering psychopath and MF's not a crazy murdering psychopath either. They're intelligent people who're smart enough to work around other people to get what they want. And if you're still hung on about the \"uneasy truce\" deal; it's bounty hunters and pirates working together. Of course the truce is uneasy. Those two things don't exactly work together all that well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-08-28T21:04:18.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She was dangerous (like many people in Bilgewater are).
