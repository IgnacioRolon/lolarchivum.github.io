Their concept isn't actually fun and lacks reactive counterplay, something that is a core component to the game.**\n\n\n\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I think the balance team is fundamentally good at their jobs.  I think they do a great job almost all of the time in creating fun gameplay, and delivering statistical balance over all.  If there are any Riot staff that I offend, I'm sorry, this is still just my opinion based on what I have observed about the game.  \n\n\n\tSo, balance.  Who do you balance for, what do you balance around, how do you balance strong kits, new mechanics, old mechanics, etc.  Well, the truth of it is, you do it by seeing things that people hate, or can't respond to, and changing them.  And I'm not going to bring up things like Lee Sin's issues or how simply being a bruiser is comparably worse than being a ranged champ.  Those topics are debatable, and while I do have many ideas about them, this isn't about that.  This is about the assassin class in particular, and what it means to balance it in terms of the game.\n\tNow I'm a fan of assassins, I love the style of them both to play as and against.  But I like every class in the game, and I think this game is by far one of the most fun to play and the most balanced among MOBAs and PVP in any sort of RPG style.  I think it does the best job of creating a good viewer experience – it has little to no backwards or unreadable mechanics.  And while I've thought of things that would be fun to have in the game, those things really aren't needed and are sort of just artificial depth.  \n\tHowever assassins are a class that the idea of balance that is currently being adhered to does not allow for.  Riot, I get you want clarity and counterplay, and a good experience for everyone in a match, but you can't combine that with the idea of an assassin and try to change them the way you are now.  It just ends up with gutted champions that don't see a lot of play.  Talon, as a prime example; he was OP, then he was gone, then he came back for a week, and now he's gone again.  I can't remember the post, but I remember there being talk about wanting to change or rework Talon's “blow up a target or do nothing” playstyle.  \n\tWhat I want to ask first is, why?  Why would you want to change the way an assassin like that works?  The answer: “It's not fun to play against.”  Well, you're right.  It's not.  Playing against someone who can remove your health bar is not fun – regardless of how flashy it is.  And it's not always fun to play, seeing that your target isn't alone, or that they are playing just a little too cautious for you to jump on them.  That's the counterplay to an assassin, don't get caught.\n\n\tI've got an example.  I asked my sister and my mother the same question, and got the same answer from both.  Neither of them are gamers, and neither of them would think of it in terms of a game.\n\tSay you've got 5 guys on a team, one with a shield, one with a club, one with a bow and arrows, one with medical supplies, and one with a knife.  Assume all of them know what to do with their items, of course.  What's the role of each?\n**Shield:**  to block enemies, and prevent allies from taking damage.\n**Club:**  to try and break through and deal a lot of sustained damage to enemies when he gets close.\n**Bow:**  to deal damage from a distance, staying safe by being out of harm's way.\n**Medical:**  to restore or support teammates by restoring damage dealt to them.\n**Knife:**  to kill enemies once he gets close.\n\tSee where this is going?  Obviously not every team is going to be like this, but those roles are pretty much how it works.  Tanks soak damage and peel for those behind them; bruisers smack whatever they can if they can get in the fight; Archers use their range advantage to stay safe from whatever they can and try to pick off targets they can aim at; Medics heal their team once they do take damage, as long as they can stay safe themselves.  But the guy with the knife, he doesn't charge your tank and try to dig it through the shield.  He doesn't – always – jump into the middle of the fight and try to slash everyone's guts, that'd be dangerous, there's a crazy guy with a club in there.  \n\tSo what does he do?  He waits.  He sits somewhere close but out of sight, and he waits for them to be isolated or step just a little too far from their safe point.  Then he uses his knife, and he takes out the enemy archer or medic, and he gets out.  Or, he stalks one of them through the woods and kills them while they're alone.  If he's smart, that's what he does.  How else would he get through fights against bigger better weapons with a knife?  The enemy knows that you are dangerous, and they don't want you getting to their high priority targets.  \n\tThat's how an assassin works.  There's no counterplay once they get to you, the counterplay is making sure they don't get to you.  You can't heal a knife in the throat, and a shield only blocks so much.  And an archer isn't worth as much when a target surprises you in melee range – archers are not meant to defend themselves from knives, neither are medics.  And if you had someone tossing molotovs instead of a guy with a club, he's also not equipped to deal with the assassin.\n\n\tThis applies to any assassin.  This is why I think Talon's playstyle is one of the best for an assassin.  Same with Kha'Zix and Shaco.  They don't attempt to brute force their way into a fight – and if they do they don't expect to survive every time, they really never should expect to in that situation.  Assassins are supposed to kill a target before they can respond or defend themselves.  They are this way because if they don't do that, they fail, and likely die themselves.  That's how they work. \n\tTalon hops on one target, tosses out a bunch of blades, stabs the target a few times, and runs away if he can.  Shaco pops out, sneaks up behind someone, stabs, tosses knives, slashes, and then runs away if he can.  Kha''Zix waits for someone to be just a little too far from their allies, hops on them, slashes them, runs away.  If they don't kill or mortally wound their target, they failed.  If they get greedy, or caught, they die.  \n\t\n\n\n\n\tSo why does Riot hate them so much, without knowing (or publicly acknowledging) it?  Because it's a not balanced.  Not to say the champions are broken, but the actual concept of a proper assassin is not balanced.  There is no active counterplay, you simply don't let yourself get caught.  Ward, group, don't overextend.  Every game, you accept what your role is and what you're playing against.  Accept that you're not going to beat a bruiser in a duel, accept that you may die before you ever reach their marksman, accept that their tank will take a lot more effort and time to kill, accept that your damage may be healed up, accept that your minions might disappear before they help you do anything, and accept that you will be destroyed if you're available to be assassinated.  \n\tDoes that sound all that fun to be on the losing side of?  No, and it never does.  Losing sucks.  Not being able to stop something feels terrible.  But to keep the actual idea of what an assassin does alive, it would have to be more broken than it is now.  \n\tI truly believe that the designers of the game and of every champion like the idea of flashy high damage dealers that use a lot of cool mechanics.  The game isn't made in such a way that assassins will ever be “healthy” to have in it.  Not with the current idea of health or balance or counterplay.  You're not working together to fight baron in this game, you're working to defeat another team of people.  The guy with the shield can't AOE taunt the whole other team for the entire fight, and it's not a case of a boss and his adds.  You don't just give the archer and the assassin the same dps but give the assassin some cool utility and burst instead of safe reliable shots.  These can happen, yes, but there's other things in the game that can be used for or against an enemy team.  More strategic and tactical advantages than just numbers to raise.\n\t\n\tIn my opinion, assassins should be either incredibly hard to play, or incredibly high risk.  By this I mean, either it's really hard to use the champion in order to kill your target, or if you screw up (miss your spell, whatever) you're useless for a good while.   But that's only IF assassins are ever going to be true to their concept.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2015-02-03T20:47:10.750+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"We've been talking about the assassin role a lot lately, as you can probably imagine as part of the whole DFG discussion.\n\nWhile counterplay is a League design value, assassins probably deliver on it less than some roles, and to some extent that's okay.

What is the laning phase? It's giving one (or two) person an area with which to obtain gold and attempt to prevent the opponent by obtaining gold by killing them or driving them away from the minions. It's usually pretty solitary; there's the occasional jungler gank or lane roam, but you tend to be 1v1 a lot (or 2v2).\n\nWhat are assassins best at? 1v1ing a squishy target, of course! This means that, for a squishy opponent in the assassin's lane, their only hope is to be massively ahead of the assassin at all points, or have an ally help them out whenever the assassin tries to go in; otherwise, the assassin will have the advantage; not unbeatable, mind, but I'd bet on the Zed against the Brand anytime.\n\nTherefore, an assassin tends to seem overpowered or incredibly annoying to deal with if they are resistant to the normal assassin weaknesses in lane: the enemy outfarming them, or getting ganked. This is why Zed is getting a lot of complaints; he has great farming (being energy based, having several AoE skills that are easy to use against a minion wave, having a passive that helps him CS at no cost) and he is difficult to gank (since he should always have his dash up if he is playing smart).\n\nEven when an assassin is weak to those traditional laning weaknesses, it can be frustrating to play against; you have a lot of pressure on you to not let them snowball, and it's on you to scare them away enough that they are behind you in farm at all times. Even if you do succeed in beating them in lane, they can roam, and it only takes a kill or two for them to snowball. \n\nI generally feel that every assassin needs a look over, because if Riot is going to continue to see the laning phase as sacrosanct, they need to build assassins so that they have weaknesses during the laning phase that are more easily exploited. Because when a class of champions have 'is very good at 1v1ing a squishy target' as a primary strength, they're going to do well in a situation where they are almost always in a 1v1 with a squishy target.\n\n(That's not even getting into how feast and famine several of these champs are; I don't play assassins as a general rule, but I can imagine how painful it must be to be a LeBlanc that can't burst people.)","replies":[{"poster":"Envy Sin","date":"2015-02-06T03:20:16.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think LB is one of the more balanced Assassins at this point.\n-She has a hard time farming without jump, Which if she uses to farm it's easy to gank her.\n-Build any MR items and she has a had time 100-0ing you (Unlike Zed whom even when you have 300 armor and 4k hp somehow manages to burst you into nothingness.)\n-She has MANY champions that do well against her, Combat her playstyle.

You can carry as support Thresh or Janna, just by making situations swing your way.  The Carry role is defined by current meta and playstyle, if a champion without the carry sub-class.  I just personally can't think of it that way.\n\nI didn't say Carry was a good label. It's just what they call the role.  When I say \"Carry\", I mean the person doing 500~700+ damage a second. Vayne, Tristana, Jinx, Anivia, Brand, Karthus. These are the people who will be supplying 40% or more of your raw killing power in a team fight.\n\n>And then there's just traits to them all.  Mobility, Burst, Disruption/CC, Support, Sustain,\n\nNocturne is more mobile than Darious, but Darius is more disruptive and damaging. The sub classes are not hard coded, but they do tend to leans more towards them. Such as Nocturne's ult being an extremely large targeted gap closer, while Darius's is shorter but far more damaging.\n\n>were to get ahead would they suddenly fit into a different sub-class than they're supposed to?\n\nPossibly. Morgana can be played as a Support for her shield, but she wont have as much Support power to her kit over say, Soraka and her team wide Wish or Sona's multi champion shield.\n\nImagine Ahri being rated as:\n(Mobility) Assassin 10/10\n(DPS) Carry 5/10\n(CC) Disruptor 3/10\n(Team Aid) Support 0/10\n\nYou can aim to use her as a Carry or Disruport, but it isn't her optimal tactic because her dps is on the lower side and her CC is kind of lacking beyond that initial taunt. She would have to try harder and need more gold than say, Vayne Carry or Alistar Disruptor in order to perform at the same level. She can't Support at all due to lacking any abilities to aid her team.","replies":[{"poster":"Shouju","date":"2015-02-03T07:43:58.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're coming off as a little aggressive to me at the moment, so if I've struck a nerve somehow I'm sorry.

Once again, they just like to go bottom because they work well there. They have nothing in common with Sona, Soraka, or Janna.

When he's strongest - in the early game - if being played as an assassin - this leads to a large amount of initial damage, and some decent sustained damage if he can stick around for some backstabs.  He does fall off though, unless very ahead, and then ends up becoming more of a fighter from that point on.\n\nSure, Noc is an assassin.  Secondary class is fighter.  I just don't really see him as a great example of an assassin, so I don't agree with you or the designers on that classification.\nJax is an assassin secondary, mind you.  Trundle is just a fighter, he doesn't have much by way of other traits.  Jax I feel could be a better assassin than Nocturne outside of the period of surprise his ult gives you.  And that doesn't change that Noc's damage is still mostly sustained, Jax can combo into some pretty crazy burst.\n\nVeigar is more an assassin than fighter, which is what I was using that classification to differentiate between.  He's still a mage, just really bursty and not made for kiting.\n\n\nThey are, but Ahri's mobility is **mostly** linked to her ult, as I said before.  It's not a tool you can use for roaming so much, it's more suited to skirmishes kiting.  \n\nAssassins are allowed to deal sustained damage, sure.  They can auto attack, they can chain their spells over time, whatever they're going to do.  But compare Leblanc's kit to Ahri's kit.  \nAhri is rewarded for using spells almost on cooldown in a fight, to charge up her passive.  Yes, she can use them all at once to play more like an assassin, and hope she does the damage to kill her target in her burst, but she's not as suited for it.\nLeblanc is rewarded for using her skills all at once, in a combo, waiting, and doing it again.  She could do the same thing as Ahri, and use one at a time to deal some damage through the fight, but it would be denying a lot of the potential in her kit.\n\nGreat, the game classifies carries different than I do.  I don't see carry linked to anything but the idea of meta roles, but I disagree with the idea of a carry in that sense.\n\nYes, Nocturne and Darius have different skills.  Noc's ult is a large gap closer, and Darius's is based around doing damage.  That doesn't change the fact that I feel carry is not an appropriate classification for high sources of dps, and that simply being able to close a large gap makes you an assassin.  \n\nOkay, sure.  One's disruptive, one does more damage.\n\nI like Morg's kit personally, it could be something else, but it's a fine kit for her 'fallen angel' thing.  Same as her sister, Kayle could have a different kit, but it's still a fine kit for her theme.\n\nNo, her mobility is still mostly restricted to her ult.  Q won't get you over that wall.  Q won't get you out of the Veigar stun/meteor combo.  Q won't get you out of that group of minions you're being blocked by.  Being fast isn't the same as mobility, but it does make her more slippery in combat.  \n\nShe can be, for the duration of her ult.  Fizz is more mobile overall, given he has two gap closers in his kit that aren't on minute long cooldowns.\n\nAlright, that's how you classify them.  I think it's clear that I don't think about them the same way you do.  Carries enable victory, that's not restricted to dps in my opinion.  Supports enable someone else to gain gold, that's not restricted to buffs, healing, or shields, in my opinion.\n\nOf course you would think your way brings more clarity, it's your way.  You understand it, it's your own opinion, that's how you think.  Maybe that's how a good number of other people think too, I don't know.  I would see Annie as a mage with disruptive and sustained damage traits, and Soraka as a mage with support/sustain and some minor disruption.  \n\nEither way, this isn't going anywhere, so I'm probably not going to reply again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-02-03T04:43:38.825+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shouju,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y1ZzE1o0,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-03T04:39:10.169+0000)\n>\n> Kha'Zix [...] [doesn't] attempt to brute force [his] way into a fight – and if [he does he shouldn't] expect to survive every time, [he] really never should expect to in that situation.\n\nActually, one of Kha'Zix's small scale reworks was targeted specifically at this.

I think a lot of the complaints about assassins is because most of them really don't have that weakness. Riot enjoys giving people 'fallback' patterns in case they're not doing so great, and to be sure assassins are some of the most binary in the game (either you can kill someone in one combo or you can't) so they're the ones that need it the most. However, this can go overboard:\n\n>This is why Zed is getting a lot of complaints; he has great farming (being energy based, having several AoE skills that are easy to use against a minion wave, having a passive that helps him CS at no cost) and he is difficult to gank (since he should always have his dash up if he is playing smart).\n\nI think this is why Fizz has such a low winrate right now; he needed to be able to delete people starting at six, because his laning isn't that great (mana hungry, especially if he wants to waveclear, which is also his escape, etc.) Most of the popular assassins, though (Zed, LB, Talon to an extent) can farm relatively easily, meaning that it's difficult to obtain the gold advantage that a mage needs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zahz","date":"2015-02-03T22:51:11.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say the proper counterplay to assassins is Ward positioning. one ward in the right place can completely shut down any attempt for the assassin to gt into positiong.

Now, the reason why I voted \"some do, others not so much\" is because of those \"assassins\" that invest more in defensive stats in favor of survivability and a better tendency to dish out sustained damage (nocturne AAs a lot, so does AD shaco, Evelynn Q your finger off, and kha relies upon a few qs and autos in some cases).

Not necessarily buffs but maybe mechanic changes to make it easier to identify their role in fights, because they can't just shunpo/cutthroat etc. in and kill someone before their target sees someones there, they are almost hybrids between bruisers and assassins. I am by no means good at this game just my 2 cents from playing assassins mostly haha.","replies":[{"poster":"Shouju","date":"2015-02-03T05:56:33.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see Kat be a little more glass cannon, take away her damage reduction I say!  =P\nNocturne and Evelynn I don't personally think of so much as assassins, more of fighters that can just pop out at you.

But if I did I simply was referring to nocturne, shaco, and evelynn's tendency to survive if caught moreso than those glass cannons. Evelynn: shield Noct: spellshield, ms steroid, Shaco: a freaking clone such a broken ability lol, and his boxes can save his own ass easy. whereas if Kat doesnt have that reset, no escape, fizz troll poll is down? yer facked.

I' m a bit of hurry so let' s talk.\n\nI don' t want to talk immediately about utility, but rather damage patters. Riot says that Zed is an healthy assassin mostly for this aspect, i believe, because their burst pattern is divided in 2 sides:\n\n- A part of **burst**, where the assassins kicks hard and strong, either at the engagement or immediately after/via damage over time/ disengagement, uncounterable or not, is damage that is queued in and that can dealt almost immediately ( an example is every talon' s skill, ulti included).\n\n-A part of **aftermath**, where the champion finished his damage burst but has a window of commitment for extra damage that he can risk through before disengaging. The commitment is done under special effects or conditions that makes the assassin in a favorable position, like avoidance or extra damage.\n\nNow we know reality is a bit different, so let me put it in a more abstract way: let' s put we have assassin X, that is able to deal 50% hp damage to a squishy with busts and 50% damage through aftermath. This X flanks, roams, does the possible to have a good engagement spot and has generical utilities that allows him to strike. What can he do?\n\nIf he meets an enemy carry, for example, that by definition deal more damage the more the fight endures, he is able to dispatch them in duel because he can strike hard and kill them before the can ramp up damage ( remember, we are talking abstractly and we don' t consider outplays and kit utility disposition). With different classes may happen differently, up to not be able to kill them or get killed instead!\nIf said carry is in a teamfight and he engages him he deals the burst, that i placed at 50%, but in order to kill him he has to commit itself for that additional 50%, a time where he risks so much to get crushed by the other enemies that is almost impracticable.\nThen how does our X kill the enemy squishy? With the aid of team mates: by poking, by engaging, by peeling they can weaken up or disperse enemy fronts so much that our assassin, when he engages, deals the burst of damage and if he does not kill has a reduced commitment time to finish off the target. For example the allied Xerath shreds 25% hp of the carry and when X engages he has only to commit for 25%. Will that be enough to kill the target and survive? Probably yes, probably not, but for sure he will risk far and far less more than targeting one with full life. This does not only make then interactive in fight, but also gives them a determined dueling power.\n\nThis is how i would like to see the Assassins, damage wise. Zed has a burst component, but his passive and the extra damage of the ulti consists of a commitment part where the assassin can be countered, keeping in mind that the assassin has an upper hand on the victim that might be decisive or not, rather being a close-combat flanking mages with AD: the AD increases auto-attack damage, and while they are not carries they shoud make use for that. In this context i really imagine to see at work a reworked critical strike, since i believe it does so much makes part of an assassin.\n\nThe numbers are purely indicative, but that' s how i would like to see more assassins; the pattern might be a little different, with different utilities or approaches, but the core concept around this.","replies":[{"poster":"Shouju","date":"2015-02-04T00:43:10.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's exactly why riot - and myself - find Zed to be a healthy assassin in terms of gameplay.  It's not just that he ults you and you're dead, it's that he ults you and commits himself to dealing damage and you're dead. \nMy point was meant to explain that Riot does hate that assassins - realistically - should not be counterable by reacting to gameplay at the time.  And everyone hates that, no one likes being blown up for nothing.  That's not healthy gameplay, but that's realistic assassination.  \n\nI would also like to see more assassins that have the same sort of playstyle commitment emphasis.  Or, conversely, assassins that have ridiculous opportunity to kill a single target, but are heavily burdened if they don't manage to.  Skillshots, or a reliance on a full combo - without the safety of return if you don't get the kill - looking at you, Leblanc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-02-06T01:23:17.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like an assassin jumping onto a target and straight up killing them is fine if the assassin telegraphs it properly. That is the biggest problem with a lot of assassins, as many of them just immediately jump onto a target and blow them up, and the champ you just blew up had no time to react.\n\nThat is the reason why Riot considers Zed a healthy assassin: when he goes to kill you, he tells you he's going to kill you by activating his ultimate, and you at least have the chance to react to this by better repositioning your self to mitigate the damage he deals or increase the risk that Zed has to take to kill you, and possibly get the kill on Zed to punish him for his risk. After 5.2, Fizz is largely the same way, except he doesn't have many of the BS mechanics that Zed has, because he telegraphs his kill combo with his shark.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mirage Night","date":"2015-02-05T07:56:56.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you take Zed an Example for my above statement\n\nThings I like\n\n1.

He really only have a soft CC.\n3. He has the type of mobility that makes an assassin identifiable.\n\nThings that I do not like\n\n1. His Q passes through minions and is not block able, giving him decent poke and helps his wave clear. It also his AoE potential a bit higher then it should\n2. His Energy regeneration feels too high, for when he completes his rotation it feels like he isnt very vulnerable.\n3.
