But when I went to the league client to complete the mission and get my icon, it still has me listed as not having completed the mission(which has a threshold of 34 points)\r\n\r\nWill I have to wait until the end of Worlds to get it, or is it just taking an inordinate amount of time to update my progress?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T15:21:17.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, grats!  There's currently a delay with pick em's mission completing for some players.  Give it some time, and the update should pull through and complete for you.  Hang tight!","replies":[]}]}
