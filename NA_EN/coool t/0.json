I would love to see this as an old fiddlesticks main this has been one of my greatest ideas.\n\nOk I can see some of you can’t imagine what he’ll look like. Well I imagined hime to be made of pool noodles and beach umbrellas. He would have seagulls instead of crows. It will of course change because of the visual update but I came off with this about one and  a half years ago ,so cut me some slack.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanSolution247","date":"2019-07-27T19:28:58.261+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea wait for the rework but still, that would be sick.","replies":[{"poster":"Coool T","date":"2019-08-16T03:37:09.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well of course but it’s a good time, a lot of reworked champs get new skins at release or a few months latter so if we get the idea around maybe we’ll have a chance of getting it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-07-27T23:14:27.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Um......ok?\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \n\nCare to explain how that would work? How would he look? What would the abilities be like?\n\nThough since he's getting a full VGU, creating a pool party skin concept based on his current design &amp; kit would be a waste of time. Regardless, you got to do more than \"Pool Party Fiddlesticks\" if you want to sell me on this fantasy.","replies":[{"poster":"Coool T","date":"2019-08-16T03:35:31.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So his crow is a seagull, his drain is a huge water water beam, his fear is a boo with water affect and his ult is a swimming pool with seagulls flying around","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FSRER","date":"2019-07-28T09:24:34.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would the crow be?
