And you can't do a damn thing about it \r\n(RiotGames live a Dictatorship life, and they influence that into all their Employees/Staff/MODs etc) \r\n--------------------\r\nNB3 uses his influence to get this troll Nubrac ban, I mean he should be ban for what he's doing but not the way it went like this.\r\ntrolling is fucking difference from off meta playing\r\n\r\nTyler1 the most toxic player in League history, RiotGames ban all his account but then what happen? They decided he has so much influence on their game, they invited him to play on the LCS Stage, funny right. RiotGames are all about no toxicity but lol\r\n\r\nAnd then there's also the situation long time ago, where a girl who use to work for RiotGames youtube channel. She goes by Melonie Mac something, her account got ban, and guess what, RiotGames decided to unban her LMAO \r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly a Rioter told me, any \"BAN ACCOUNT ARE NOT UNBANNABLE\" no matter the situation, and yeah.\r\n---------------\r\nBut we live in a World where if you're a no one, you don't fucking matter and your attention and problem come last. But if you're someone with Influence and is popular, oh yeah we give you attention first and we take action immediately LMAO \r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}
