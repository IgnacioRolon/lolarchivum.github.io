If the topic is not something you should talk about or even talk about. You get a warning for it\r\n\r\nOr rather this is what Rioters would tell \r\n\r\n\"There's other site and place for that kinda thing so take it there\"\r\n--------------\r\nLike if it was you or me, you know we get ban or some shit from RiotGames","replies":[]}
