Run out of mana because i have SHIT regen\nB.) Have less defense because I have less AP (shields, heals, etc.)\nC.) I have to get HIT to get mana back (the fuck is this one?? this is definitely meant for... who? vlad and chogath?)\nD.) All of the above\n\nMeanwhile: AD mids or even champs like fizz don&#039;t give a shit anymore, just blast right through the enemy midlaner because they&#039;re just straight up fucked. That extra 10% CDR on a trashed version of Zhonya&#039;s isn&#039;t gonna save you lol\n\nWhy don&#039;t you nerf some AD items while you&#039;re at it? Because Mid lane is gonna be one sided as hell with all these Zed&#039;s running rampant (talon too honestly)\n**\nEdit: So a couple points here, now that im more calm. **\n\n1.) These don't feel like good tradeoffs. A good tradeoff is something like Abyssal, the new version is actually a well rounded item. A bad tradeoff, however, is saying \"oh, look, we made zhonya's cheaper and added a little cdr! we took a whole chunk of ap and made the active have a longer cooldown, but it's better!\"\n\n2.) You talk about significance in trade-offs, but mages pay for more than AD champions. Mages have to sacrifice one thing for another, but i don't see where any AD champ picking up items that offer ways around weaknesses (Maw vs burst, scimitar vs cc, etc) is considered a 'tradeoff.' They get their primary offensive stat, they get their defense, they win their lane. Meanwhile, Mages struggle to squeeze out mana from anything they can, from buying RoA and waiting 15 minutes, to runes and masteries. Masteries like damage versus regen. That makes sense, I get that one. But when an AD champ has to choose between damage and lifesteal, well shit. Man, that's the biggest tradeoff in the world! They either do more damage and heal less, or heal more with a bit less damage. That sucks, doesn't it? Especially when they have like 4 or 5 lifesteal items, and runes/masteries that also offer more (warlord's) as well as BOTH._ Boo god damn hoo. _\n\nThere's no real logical tradeoffs here, mages indeed pay more for what they need, and this update is really making it apparent that Riot maybe thinks that, somehow, Mages don't pay enough. And that's what people are upset about. They're not upset that you're trying to make things more interesting, or even that you're taking away AP from items. **They're upset that you're subverting so many solid foundations and exclaiming that mages need more 'meaningful trade-offs' while shit like Zed picking up hexdrinker and winning lane by default- because you ran out of spells trying to either stop him from cs'ing or defending yourself- is more acceptable.**","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-04-07T22:40:12.779+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":111,"body":"> Why don't you nerf some AD items while you're at it?

Though it must be frustraiting too.\n\nIf I may add my 2 cents for what is disappointing me personally (and I have read some of your posts about this), is that mages are being forced to get flat-mana items while supports gain the mp5 ones. There is no middle ground for these.\n\nBut first a bright point: while lost chapter seems like a nice addition to offensive mages but I want to know if the passive carries over to the new Morellonomicon in some way. It's almost like the new RoA for me since the \"level up and heal + mana back\" passive is what I often went for while building it. It goes great with meditation, but I want to know if this passive gets carried over from LC to Mor.\n\nAnd that's where the disappointment begins. That's about the only way to get mana back (at least somewhat safely). Is to get LC and level up. The new catalyst forces us to open ourselves to damage and if we're beind trying to get some health, this new battle damage passive won't help.\n\nWe have no \"true\" mp5 items. Or at least one where there's some tradeoff like lower damage, or more expensive total cost. It's a flat mana increase with little to no meaningful tradeoffs. Sure, I can take the new Mor but if I'm behind and need to spam spells to try and keep up in lane I can't do that anymore by buying the old chalice.\n\nAnd to top it off some of these have lower AP overall (grail, ZHG, and AbS). Something I thought was trying to be fixed in last year's update yet it seems to be undone. A personal fav of mine if I was on the defence (unholy grail) is now basically unavailable if I'm anything but a support. These I took if I was playing defence and now I can't fight back as well if I wanted to.\n\nAlso honestly my whole post is everywhere because I'm kinda delirious with this head cold I've had for the past week but I figured I better get my \"somewhat\" understandable thoughts out in the open for you to hopefully read. Again sorry if this post is I train wreck. I think I'll go back some soup with pb&j sandwiches now :/\n\nPS. While some may be afraid of the 6 mage updates coming now, I'm actually quite intriqued as to how they'll play out with these new items.

To be clear, it IS gutting when you heavily nerf an entire class of champs without proper compensation.
