Zed can get more energy back than his counterparts and his spells cost less. That's my point. You also missed Shen whose combo costs 210 at all ranks and he can only return 40/champion hit if he lands his taunt. In teamfights Shens energy returns are stronger provided that the enemy is lining up for him, but in the laning phase or in small skirmishes it is weaker. \n\n> You can't have it both ways.  Your previous comment stated that due to his ultimate's high counterability his power budget is far lower in that area, now we're discussing how much stronger it makes him?\n> \n\nContext is everything here, if you want me to argue how strong zed is without his w shadow and without his ult then you've removed a good portion of his kit. It's just disingenuous to expect that. \n\n> What sort of rework would you propose?\n\nTo be honest i'm not entirely sure. A complete champion rework could be in order but that is a pretty large scale project with a lot involved. His shadows are a core part to zed so his ult and w would have to remain basically untouched. I've had/heard a lot of ideas but most of them just end up gutting zed which isn't a good solution. A few ideas here, some ok, some bad, idk. \n\n1) One popular idea is to reduce his waveclear by halving the damage on his e and q to minions. \n\n2) Another popular idea is to remove his passive effects on minions to force him to last hit to farm. \n\n3) A lot of people want to remove the ad boost on his w passive. \n\n4) One change i read was that he could only port back to his shadow on command once, so he couldn't switch back and forth over and over.\n\n5) He can switch with his w as much as he wants but can't switch to his ults shadow or vice versa. \n\n6) Maybe the passive on his w is only active if the w is off cd. His w can be used to escape but then the death mark doesn't get the 25% ad boost so it encourages him to stay until the enemy is dead without requiring him to stay until zed is dead. If he uses his w to waveclear then he automatically does less damage to the minions. \n\n7) Make it so he only gets energy return on one of the mimiced casts when he uses his weq combo but raise the amount so he only gets, say, 30/50 energy returned at rank 1/5 instead of 20/40 doubled to 40/80. \n\n8) Remove the energy return on minions so he has to hit his skillshots on enemy champions to get the energy returns. \n\n9) Replace the %ad scaling with a flat damage value on his ult so he doesn't get his damage amplified from his w, and the ad scaling on his ult, and the 50% damage dealt from his ult. This moderates the exponential growth on his building ad. \n\n10) Raise the %ad scaling but remove the 50% damage dealt part. Same idea as 9 but in a different and (imo) worse way. \n\nPersonally i think 1,2,6,7,or 8 are reasonable ideas if paired with some appropriate compensation buffs. I've been thinking about 6 for a bit now and it seems like the best option to accentuate his moments of weakness while not gutting him too hard.

Kennen can ration out his energy so that he never dips below 80%, especially since autoattacks are involved in his primary regeneration mechanic.\n\nZed, on the other hand, has to toss out his entire kit almost simultaneously to get the benefits of his regeneration mechanic, and unlike Kennen or Akali he only has the opportunity to do this once every 14-18 seconds within a four second window.\n\n>Kennen gets back 65, Akali gets back 40-60, Zed gets back 40-80. Zed can get more energy back than his counterparts and his spells cost less. That's my point. \n\nKennen gets back 25 every time he gets a passive proc, which can happen three times within five seconds if the player is particularly skilled and uses his ultimate effectively.  Akali refunds the entire cost of her primary damage ability every time she detonates the mark.\n\nEach of Zed's individual spells cost less, but in order to get the benefit of his regeneration mechanic he has to use them all at the same time.  His initial energy investment for the return is far higher than either Akali or Kennen, it's actually on par with Shen. \n\nAkali only needs to spend 60 energy to gain 40 back, whereas Zed has to expend well over half his energy pool to accomplish the same.\n\n>You also missed Shen whose combo costs 210 at all ranks and he can only return 40/champion hit if he lands his taunt.\n\nI didn't include Shen because his energy restoration and role in general function very differently from other energy users.  He is also widely considered to have overly punishing costs, so he isn't necessarily relevant to this discussion.\n\n>1) One popular idea is to reduce his waveclear by halving the damage on his e and q to minions.\n\nThe damage is already heavily reduced by the innate pass-through mechanics on Q, and E does very mediocre damage until roughly level 8-10.  A possible alternative might be to make the pass-through affect minions differently than champions, but it's important to consider burden of knowledge with a change like that.\n\n>2) Another popular idea is to remove his passive effects on minions to force him to last hit to farm.\n\nThis would render his passive almost useless, because he very rarely has time to autoattack his champion target within that health window.  \n\n>4) One change i read was that he could only port back to his shadow on command once, so he couldn't switch back and forth over and over.\n>5) He can switch with his w as much as he wants but can't switch to his ults shadow or vice versa.\n\nI really hope I'm reading this wrong, because if this discussion is based on the assumption Zed can infinitely swap shadows...\n\n Zed can't switch more than once to any of his shadows; he can switch to his W once or to his R once, that's it.  Once he switches there's no return.\n\n>Maybe the passive on his w is only active if the w is off cd. His w can be used to escape but then the death mark doesn't get the 25% ad boost so it encourages him to stay until the enemy is dead without requiring him to stay until zed is dead. If he uses his w to waveclear then he automatically does less damage to the minions.\n\nTo clarify, when his W is available to be cast he would have the boost but not when it's out?  This is directly counter-intuitive to the mechanics and pattern of the champion; he's designed to be at his strongest when he can use his W to amplify his damage through multiple casts.  It would be a bit of a design conflict for him to lose damage when his main damage amplification ability is in use.\n\n>7) Make it so he only gets energy return on one of the mimiced casts when he uses his weq combo but raise the amount so he only gets, say, 30/50 energy returned at rank 1/5 instead of 20/40 doubled to 40/80.\n\nTheoretically, this would increase the reward of hitting the much easier E double proc and devalue the benefit of double hitting Q.  That amount of energy regeneration may also be disproportionate to the costs and availability of said regen mechanic.\n\n>8) Remove the energy return on minions so he has to hit his skillshots on enemy champions to get the energy returns.\n\nThis would likely make him extremely feast or famine, and run him completely dry on energy almost permanently.  He would also basically never land the mimicked E, because it's melee range from two separate characters 550 units apart.\n\nHe would also no longer be able to jungle or even really farm at all, let alone split push.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-04-22T20:04:13.954+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali: yes she can use just her q but that's only one part of his kit, zed can do that with his entire kit. A lot of Akali's damage comes from this, but she has other substantial parts of her kit that she wants to use. It also is much less effective as a waveclear method. \n\nKennen: Auto attacks don't regenerate Kennen's energy. His passive procs off abilities only and his e actually prevents him from AA. He has solid energy refunds as well but aa aren't part of that. since he has to hit three abilities to do this then it can only happen if he uses all of his abilities, just like zed. Also just like Zed he can use his ult to regenerate energy, which probably makes him too strong in the energy refunding department as well.

A more fair question would have been \"Do you think if we removed all the ults from the game Zed would still be picked\" and in that case you bet Zed would be a top tier pick.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Father Cthulhu","date":"2015-04-22T17:28:05.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To do his job, and 100-0 you, he HAS to have his R.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-04-22T17:44:59.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed's job is more than assassinating, his primary function is split pushing while assassinating is a close second.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-04-22T17:16:08.924+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3102}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3140}}\n\nThe list of champions that have ultimates countered by at least 2/3 of these is a lot longer than \"Zed\";.","replies":[{"poster":"TheEloGoblin","date":"2015-04-22T20:29:10.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp time to buy MR vs zed as a AD mid or completely forgot my build to rush hourglass as a Ap mid shame i really need mana regen but i have to rush hourglass because Zed told me too.","replies":[{"poster":"Father Cthulhu","date":"2015-04-23T16:02:07.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So counterbuilding isn't a thing anymore?
