Very few people complained about her until a couple of weeks ago, and I have no clue as to why.

I almost never play Ahri, I'm more used to dps mages like Cassiopeia that actually requires endeavor to use and has a lot of counterplay window, Ahri on the other hand, is just too much. I'm saying this because even though I don't use her much, when I do (a few days ago I used her) I steamed roll like crazy, I was like \"omg this champ is so broken and such a piece of cake\" Come on, 17% pick rate and a 54% win rate? If cassio gets those statistics she would be nerfed HARD, like rito has done already, but again Ahri is everyone favorites because she is a slutty fox, sex sells darling.","replies":[{"poster":"WyvernEgg","date":"2015-08-04T23:31:30.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By your logic urgot should be unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-08-04T23:51:50.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WyvernEgg,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=VYlguaJ5,comment-id=0008000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-04T23:31:30.553+0000)\n>\n> By your logic urgot should be unplayable.\n\nMy logic?
