All dark and spoooooky. And the Christmas map all snowy and neat. \r\nAnd I don not think can **possibly** forget the map we had before the new, shiny, and more detailed season five map.\r\nMap skins would behave just like regular skins where you can unlock them all or just one that you like and *you* play on that but only you can see the difference. I was also thinking that when you unlock one you get a special summoner icon for others to see you have made the purchase... Like how when you have a legendary skin (Spirt Guard {{champion:77}} , Pulsefire {{champion:81}} , or DJ {{champion:37}} you get a unique icon that shows you have the skin.\r\nI had a chance to think about how you could unlock them:\r\nAbout 6300 ip- Just so some of the newer players could use this feature.\r\nTON of ip- This could be just for people who have at least 10k ip stored up that they never use because they already have all the champions and runes. This would give them something to get that is new.\r\nI have seen many youtube videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XKjGvjY9pg) *not taking any credit for this video or anything... just something I saw* \r\nIn just the first 12 seconds Uberdanger states how League of Legends does not reward you. How after you unlock all the champions and runes there is nothing else you can unlock. Map skins would solve this problem at least somewhat because you could have something to wrok towards that show other players &quot;Yea I&#039;ve been around awhile&quot;.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think. This is just a rough Idea and i would love suggestions.\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-10-29T01:09:01.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanted somethin like this for a long time now. The reason they stopped after doing it the first time was they got a lot of complaints from ppl who didnt like it, or thought it was too bright and distracting.         What they should do this time is not force it upon ppl, but give us the option to buy them. That way only the purchaser can see it/use it. Or they could do like dota2 and let users share your map skins with other users in game","replies":[{"poster":"Ace Ham","date":"2015-10-29T22:56:58.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that was exactly my idea...
