It used to me that unless you were a tank jungle doing blue and red without backing was unthinkable, now assassin junglers not only can do both but can come out the jungle ganking near/at full hp.\n\nAssassins getting kills is irrelevant if you can CC and burst them down in teamfights, mages on the other hand have the ability to keep the ADC alive whille Assassins cannot. Much worse the ability to peel for the ADC has increased tremendously with how strong supports are now and how much more gold and items they can get early.

It&#x27;s not some conspiracy to make mage players suffer for two weeks, you know.\n\nActually nerfing ADCs before Mages wouldn't make them anymore dominant because the whole reason they are so dominant is because bot lane is so strong. Nerfing mana is not going to stop mages from being used but nerfing bot lane will have a much better chance of bringing Assassins back. Assassins cannot do their jobs because bot is too strong, not because mages are too strong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2018-04-19T22:51:40.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Btw does anyone know where that quote even comes from\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time a quote was cherry-picked out of context, exaggerated, or repeated incorrectly if there's no source, I've skimmed over the Reddit, penguin's twitter, reverse searched the quote...

And being upset with dematerializer after nerfing waveclear with those baron nerfs?  It seems they're pretty out of the loop, or not thinking very hard on these changes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2018-04-19T22:32:21.107+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because ADC are not getting the same treatment and it feels like they are getting virtually no nerfs and tweaks done to them.
