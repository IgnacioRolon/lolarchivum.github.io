I find it funny that if i decide to play a game with people on my friend-list(because riot encourages it and punishes solo play) and they DC it is somehow my fault. Not only that but this system promotes abuse by forcing the pre-made that didn&#039;t DC to say no since they will lose LP 100%.

They have the same control over a pre-made DCing as a solo player does yet leagues \"dynamic queue\" promotes grouping with friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2016-04-26T20:28:09.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a history with this person and are well aware that they don't usually have internet issues, than the instance in which it does happen will be a rare chance.
