Why you think Zac has no skins? No one plays him, and why someone like Ez has several. If the champion is played a lot, there will be more skins for them since more customers.

They had a perfect idea for Rek'sai that fit in with the pool party theme, so they made the skin.\n\nAlso, some champions are extremely hard to make skins for. Zyra, Udyr, Zac, and Zed are on that list. This is either because there is a lot of work involved(Udyr/Zyra/Zac) or the theme is fairly limited in adaptability(Zac/Zed) that doesn't go into copyright territory.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leon Etoile","date":"2015-06-12T15:52:20.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is one of the most played champs so her visibility is pretty high (in terms of professional play).
