Typically it happens so fast after i login that I never even see the lobby/news screen, but occasionally it lasts just long enough to get to that screen before crashing- and something I've noticed is that my friendlist is never connected before I crash, if that helps.\r\n\r\nOddly, the legacy client seems to work just fine, its strictly the LCU that seems to be 'broken' for me. I've tried repairing the client and fully clean reinstalling the game, but neither have helped the problem at all, it starts crashing again as if nothing was changed. I've also tried toggling low spec mode and disabling all animations before logging in in case somehow that was related at all, but that didn't help either.\r\n\r\nWhile technically this isn't that big of an issue since I can just use the legacy client, its still rather annoying, and some help would be appreciated. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T03:30:10.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm... Given the context you've provided, especially because you see that your social panel (friends list, etc) doesn't ever load up, I suspect this is caused by an *unstable connection* to the servers/services that operate the New Client platform. We typically see this happen if there are certain network settings that conflict with your ability to connect to some of our servers. Our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) will walk you through some of the steps that I recommend taking to ensure your network settings are compatible with League.\n\nJust hit me up in a reply if you still encounter issues once you've taken those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HF GL AMK","date":"2017-01-12T15:29:30.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, tried Hextech Repair tool and even did a clean reinstall - Still didnt solve my problem.
