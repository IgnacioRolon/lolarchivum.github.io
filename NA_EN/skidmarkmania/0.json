I have two queries for you guys and gals today.\r\n\r\n_First_, I'm aware RP can be gifted, and I'm positive I have some still on my suspended account; can I get it gifted **to** my Alt?\r\n\r\n_Second_, there was a large laaaarge amount of IP on this suspended account, is it at all possible with the new system to gift that to my Alt so that I could take advantage of that IP/BE just sitting there? If not, wouldn't that be super cool?!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's all I have. Thanks!

The only way to gift RP is to buy the RP *as a gift*. You can't send RP you already have as a gift, and we can't transfer content between accounts at all.","replies":[]}]}]}
