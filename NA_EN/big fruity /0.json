It happens every few games or so and renders the match unplayable.  The game acts fine if I am just running around but when I pan the camera to any fights, minions clashing or use any abilities I experience the lag.  It felt like FPS or a ping issue however, my connection remained stable and FPS was fine as well.  I'm reluctant to play any further matches since this will just result in me being dead weight and most likely a loss.  Still, I don't understand where this is coming from, could it be server side?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T18:17:07.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have good ping but suffering from something like packet loss which can cause input delays.  To really know for sure and rule out possibilities like FPS, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader).

Game client would state my ping and FPS as fine but occasionally I'll hit a spike where everything is delayed.
