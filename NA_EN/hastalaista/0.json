[Here is a video of the german sound files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2st8gjPZAE4). Skip to the middle of the video and listen to the background music. It&#039;s like ... just some generic noise from a syntesizer.\r\n\r\nHere is a (hopefully) complete list of localizations:\r\n\r\n* [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwQ3i9L0j74)\r\n* [French](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58YS12t61gg)\r\n* [Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqu4KLXRgB0)\r\n* [Latin American Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-efB4JS0RqY)\r\n* [Italian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6heL1G1pULc)\r\n* [Czech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3N-VKxPX0w)\r\n* [Russian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYXPabG1olk)\r\n* [Romanian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p1ZyMbOnME)\r\n* [Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OualIRBLvOc)\r\n* [Brazilian Portuguese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpGbyoF631U)\r\n* [Turkish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTdKQ6wvhg)\r\n* [Korean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5S8fFhLbZQ)\r\n* [Greek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1WLKECI86E)\r\n* [Polish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5DkjOXar9Q)\r\n* [Hungarian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sihVTueifJo)\r\n\r\nSo **out of 16** languages **only** the german one hasn&#039;t got this awesome chorus. It&#039;s a real bummer. Jhin is one of the best champions quality wise in SFX and the music department has made a lot of effort to make this happen.\r\nAnd in german only Riot failed to make the voice over ... perfect.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this. :(","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-02T18:23:27.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya hastalaIsta! \n\nThanks for the awesome bug report!
