Can confirm 100% replication when double tapping R.\n\nTalon&#039;s ultimate is only supposed to take 100 mana on the first R tap (blades out), but cost ZERO on the second tap.  You can see clearly it takes 100 mana both times, which is a bug.  If you cancel his ulti through any normal means (W, Q, autoattack, ignite, tiamat), then the blades will close and NOT take the additional bugged mana cost.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-04T17:43:13.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TheJoeKage -\n\nThanks for the report! ^-^ The team is aware of the issue and are working on a fix!","replies":[]}]}
