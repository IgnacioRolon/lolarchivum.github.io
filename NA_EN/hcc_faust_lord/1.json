For damage, there are 3 distinct types - Physical, Magic, and True. 1 point of damage is always 1 point of damage. \n\nA stun doesnt always mean they would be running the entire time. They could be stutter stepping. They could be rooted for animations. As for slows, some champions get wreaked by them, as their \"walk\" is their only movement ability. Does Kassadin take the same amount from a slow as Darius? Cause if Kassadin is slowed, he can riftwalk to travel faster than walking. Same with LB. \n\nThen there are little considerations: \n1. Does canceling a homeguard give you bonus movement speed reduction? \n2. How about when CC or slows are improperly chained? (so 2 cc on the same target that overlap in duration.) Do both get it? One? Neither? Split? And if its split, how does it split? Does the slow get the same amount of \"movement speed imparied\" as the stun? Does a root get the same as a stun? \n3. How do knockbacks work? Do you calculate the length of the of the knockback or the distance it went?\n\n If the \"movement speed impaired\" number automatically defaults to \"maximum potential for movement speed impaired\", then it might not be as useful. I mean, how much use is a \"potential damage\" stat? \n\n_____________________________________________\nIts harder to calculate a stat that has a range of effectiveness from knockback>knockup>supression>stun>charm>fear>entangle>polymorph>root>slow than damage, where 1 point of damage is always 1 point of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-01-18T22:52:22.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fact it doesn't get catalogued correctly seen any of the death recaps lately?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sand Clone","date":"2016-01-20T04:34:35.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Puddinglax,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QEHvz9Bp,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-01-18T19:30:40.607+0000)\n>\n> almost every champion can cause damage and with items it becomes every champion.

Armor and Magic Resist already passively reduce damage, so the numbers would be crazy-high for everybody in a medium-length match. Damaged SHIELDED, on the other hand, is perfect for what you're describing: a stat that shows just how much damage we've prevented with champions like Janna and Lulu (also Face of the Mountain exists).\n\nStill, upvote because I agree with the idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaoBushido","date":"2016-01-18T00:40:16.104+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the new Shen coming out this could be an interesting stat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shockrew","date":"2016-01-18T21:31:21.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You have no idea how broken that would be.
