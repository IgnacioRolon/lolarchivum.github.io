This is a team-oriented game that is centered around one goal: winning by destroying the other team&#039;s nexus. Nobody enjoys losing this game. If you do, don&#039;t bother reading the rest of this because you&#039;re clearly too dense to understand where I&#039;m coming from. For every self-described &quot;casual&quot; gamer out there, this is not a casual game. This is a highly competitive game which requires your utmost attention for 30-35 minutes on average. If you cannot sit down and commit to that, you do not need to play this game. It&#039;s just that simple. If you want a casual game, go play Minecraft. Go play Lego Star Wars. You can even fire up Fruit Ninja and I&#039;d love to play with you. League of Legends is not a casual game. Accusing someone of &quot;tryharding&quot; is absolutely insane. You play this game to win. That&#039;s why there is a ranked system based off of winning and losing games. You don&#039;t play a game to lose. You don&#039;t play a game for fun. You play to prove you&#039;re better than your opponent and to win the game. Is it fun making awesome plays? Yes! I&#039;m not saying this game isn&#039;t fun. I&#039;m saying that you don&#039;t play this game for fun. You play it to win and get better. So don&#039;t bring your &quot;casual gamer&quot; mentality into my lobby. That is not what this game is about. If that&#039;s what you think it is, you should strongly reconsider your approach to competitive online gaming.","replies":[]}
