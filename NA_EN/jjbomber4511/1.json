Riot just needs to put some effort into their skins. Riot, 1st of all, we need a dunk in one of the abilities. Also, why not give him at least 1 new line and make him dribble the ball like Darius. I think Daisy's final hit should be a dunk and then pillars of stone with basketball cut outs for the knockup line. Ivern could throw the ball to Daisy when he uses ult and bam, that is where the basketball for the dunk comes from. The rest of the abilities can stay but I think this Ivern skin needs to look a little more unique, the skin looks like a tall jungling Heimerdinger. I like the camp complete sound effect though. Riot, just give a little more effort and you could make a great skin.","replies":[]}
