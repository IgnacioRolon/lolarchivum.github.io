We can't directly test a dog and a cat because, as you said, cats won't let themselves be tested, but Ornn is literally a demigod and, it seems, an inordinately strong one able to headbutt giant elemental rams so hard they fly in the opposite direction.\n\nI feel like from a purely in-lore standpoint Ornn wins, even if its not by as much as he'd expect. :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2017-09-15T18:28:17.488+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ornn has the advantage of being able to build more benches as he presses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2017-09-15T22:14:48.833+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who can bench press more?
