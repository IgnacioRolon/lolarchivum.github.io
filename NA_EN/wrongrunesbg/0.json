As far as him not being an LCS tier ADC, he went 5-1, 3-0 against the top 2 teams in NA. He has an average of 7.8 KDA in those games.\n\nMeanwhile with Piglet, who has an 3.0 KDA, they are 3-8.

While he is undoubtedly a very skilled ADC, he has a very defeatist attitude.

I honestly have never seen any pro players regularly call for surrender while streaming except piglet.
