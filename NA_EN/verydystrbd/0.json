Also, my client has been extraordinarily slow too, I know it's not my pc since it is only about 4 months old and has no other performance issues on any programs other than league. Can someone help me please?","replies":[{"poster":"Peak Ace","date":"2016-05-11T02:13:50.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this same issue. When in big team fights, usually 8 man or larger, I get a consistent frame drop to 35 fps down from 60. Oddly enough my ping will also double, from 80 to 160+. However it isn't stable, it'll go down for half a second then back up, then back down, and keep yo-yoing till the fight ends.\n\nI've ruled out everything on the FPS troubleshooting guide and haven't seen any improvement. I've even had task manager running to keep and eye on the performance of the machine during big fights and it doens't spike at all, at most it'll hit 33% CPU usage and sub 30% memory. I've also tried reinstalling the game as well as repairing the fresh install, with no success.\n\nAll my drivers are up to date, I even check daily to see if there has been a new one that might fix the issue. I've also checked to see if it could be a network issue and I can't see anything on my end that could be causing issues.\n\n[Here is a dxdiag file](http://www.filedropper.com/dxdiag_13), hopefully this will help lead to answers regarding this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T00:01:55.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmm...It definitely seems odd that not only do you experience drops in FPS, but your client also has performance issues.  It's hard to say whether they are directly related, but we do need to start ruling out some possible root causes.
