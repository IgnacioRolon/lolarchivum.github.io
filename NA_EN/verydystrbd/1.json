I'm on free camera mode and everything, and can move my screen in every other direction just fine, but just not down. As you see there's a little bit of my HUD cut off at the bottom of the screen too, and it seems that the bar at the top shifted the whole screen down, so my cursor can't reach the edge of the screen, therefore not letting me move my screen in that direction either. I've tried restarting my PC, my client, everything I can think of but it still keeps happening. My next thing I'll try is just reinstall LoL but I'd rather avoid that if possible because with my internet it'll take forever. If anyone has any ideas or possible solutions the help would be greatly appreciated! thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-21T21:27:49.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you have the game set to Windowed.
