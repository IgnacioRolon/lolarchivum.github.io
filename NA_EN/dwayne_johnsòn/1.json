We do review name reports, and will change names if necessary.  In extreme cases or consistency, we may permanently ban an account as well.  Feel free to get a pulse check from the community directly, and ask about this on the [PB boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) as well!","replies":[]}]}
