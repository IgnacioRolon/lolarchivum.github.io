My friend and I want to gift each other back mystery gifts so we can get the skins we desire, but we have to wait one more day before we can gift each other anything. What we did was make a new account ( one for each of us ) and buy one champion who has the skin we want and then we would start gifting each other on our first accounts untill we both get the skins we want. I' ve been looking around at rules of mystery gifting skins and sometimes it says that you need at least 10 skins that you can require from gifting . Then I looked at another source which was a guy saying something related to this idea and all the comments said '' There was one point when you could mystery gift yourself'' but i didn't play league at the time :(. Please let me know if you tried this or know the answer if it works or not because I don't want to waste money on rp that im not going to use. btw Hextech could get me the skins i want but it is a really low chance and it takes longer to obtain fragments and chests.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T22:52:32.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The time limit before gifting enables exists as a safety precaution for players.  While it's possible to gift normal champions and skins, a mystery gift requires at least 10 to make it a mystery.  If you only have one champion and try to mystery gift a skin, it defeats the purpose of being a mystery.
