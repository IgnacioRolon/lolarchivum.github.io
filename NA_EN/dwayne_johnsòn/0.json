I noticed that my league has been glitching more than usual, but I never crashed before.  How am I suppose to fix this? I already got demoted twice and now I'm stuck in Bronze 3 and the fact that I can't climb because of this DirectX Error thing bothers me a lot.  Please respond quickly so that I can get this thing fix and start climbing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-12T20:37:31.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashing definitely doesn't help your goal, but I'd like to help!  A driver or some setting would cause a crash like this.  Did it come along with a bugsplat?
