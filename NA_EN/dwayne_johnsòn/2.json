I am mastery 5 needing one more token for mastery 6, but to my surprise the grade I received was an A . This got me wondering what are the requirements of getting an S- or Higher ? I have been getting quite the decent scores such as 13/6/16(Victory) and 13/6/8(Defeat) and I got an A- for both of them . This leads me to think that assist don't matter for grades am I right Rito plz respond .","replies":[{"poster":"tyrell briggs","date":"2017-08-03T19:35:54.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you.

And that idea of Riot hiding the grading formula so we don't \"game\" the system does makes sense . But they should at least give us some pointers if that's what they are going for .","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-08-03T20:30:22.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cs well if you are in a non-support role.\n\nContribute to objectives.\n\nDo damage to others.\n\nWard and clear wards (high vision score).\n\nHit your skill shots.\n\nTake alot of dmg but not die. \n\nThese are all metrics that compare yourself to other players playing that champ in the same role.\n\nThere are other metrics, but those are the major ones.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-03T20:16:15.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't really have a specific formula to give, honestly.
