This instantly made me think of League because of the way it was phrased. \r\n\r\nThe question I present to you all is which characters tend to have the most understanding, caring and enjoyable to play with people from your experience? I already know there are going to be people who bring up the Yas, Zed, Riven mains as the worst but I want to hear about experiences with people who play a certain champion.\r\n\r\nExample: I have found that people who play {{champion:83}} tend to be pretty reserved in game but are very nice when they do communicate. I have also found that people who play {{champion:50}}  have a similar demeanor.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:galio-happy}} \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Sillae","date":"2018-12-14T18:24:47.342+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum players always tend to be nice","replies":[{"poster":"Pentapod","date":"2018-12-14T18:29:21.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I second this.
