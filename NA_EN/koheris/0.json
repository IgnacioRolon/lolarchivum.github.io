That being said, I was really hoping to hear when will the server accept new accounts, as I have just known from another post (correct me if I got it wrong), that PBE is not accepting new users.\r\n\r\nI understand that those who get PBE accounts are those players who play with the things currently beeing devveloped or investigated, and I also get that accounts are very limited, just for that.\r\n\r\nI'm not addressing this post to claim a PBE account, I am just in the seek of knowledge from when may (or not) I be selected to have an account.\r\nIf anyone could give me some information, any hint or tip about that information, it would really be appreciated. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T22:17:27.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm assuming you're referencing [**this post**](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/EGhTBUV6-pbe-signups-are-closed), but essentially yes PBE signups are down. Those who have already gotten their applications in could still potentially be accepted, and the pbe servers are in fact still running. Be sure to check your e-mail for a possible pbe invitation, and also check the [**status page**](http://status.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/#pbe) for updates on when the signups will be back!","replies":[]}]}
