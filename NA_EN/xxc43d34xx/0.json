But I specifically remember that **they had changed the bleed to NOT interrupt recalls**, at least if the bleed was from a minion/monster. \n\nI wanted to see if I was crazy or not, so I looked at the patch history for the item on Lolwiki\nPatch 7.6, according to the source, _&quot;Bleed effect now doesn&#039;t cancel Recall Recall.&quot;_\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Death%27s_Dance\nUnfortunately, the change is labeled to be &quot;undocumented,&quot; which makes sense, because I checked the official patch 7.6, and didn&#039;t find anything on Death&#039;s Dance. \n\nEither way, there is no documentation on the Lolwiki about RIOT changing/reverting this after patch 7.6. So either the lolwiki is outdated/false - which is entirely plausible - or my memory is still intact after all.\n\nSo I&#039;d like some confirmation, if anybody can find the specific instance where Riot changed Death&#039;s Dance bleed to stop/not stop recalls. That way it can be deduced whether this is a bug or not - or if I was making up stuff in my mind the whole time.","replies":[{"poster":"Rester","date":"2017-12-22T06:43:52.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible something broke several patches later.

But I would have thought somebody would have noticed it by now. Because \"Several\" seems quite literal in this case. I mean - it is such a small \"bug\" so I guess that's how it gets unnoticed. But it can really screw you up when you are backing after a baron take and you get caught in the pit because you can't back from the bleed haha.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2017-12-23T11:25:01.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah... we refactor Recall a while back, that might have gotten lost in the refactor.\nunfortunate........","replies":[{"poster":"Retrazhao","date":"2018-01-10T10:32:33.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So will you fix it or..?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-12-24T10:26:25.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering why last patch recall wasn't cancelled and this patch it is lol","replies":[]}]}
