There are only 2 6300 IP champs I don't own (yas and illaoi) so i was excited to get to maybe try Illaoi today a little later i hit 6290. I remember this specifically because it was so close to 6300. I forgot about it and now a couple games later I'm only at 3400 IP... So i'm just like wtf. I know for a fact I haven't bought anything because the purchase history shows my last purchase like 4 days ago and it was for a single quint rune. Do i need to submit a ticket? Or does this happen often and my IP will mysteriously show back up randomly?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-01T20:45:09.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes the server and client don't sync properly when you purchase something and your IP balance won't update until a while later or if you try to purchase something else, which forces a resync of your IP balance. It seems the quint you purchased a few days ago must not have been updated in your IP balance until very recently. This is purely a visual bug and your IP didn't run away from you.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
