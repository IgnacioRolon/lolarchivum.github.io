I'd argue that God Emperor was more of a struggle, though that's just if you dislikes talking, since there was a -lot- of that in Emperor. In contrast, Children has so many things going on at once. Alia falling to her grandfather, Duncan contemplating sacrificing himself again, Preacher doing his thing, and all the plotting happening. \n\nPlus, 'My skin is not my own' Leto doing what his father never dared.\n\nOh, and are you also responsible for Lissandra's 'Plans within plans' or was that someone else?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-12-08T18:16:29.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually like God Emperor for really deconstructing the themes of the first two books.
