But we should have a certian amount of honor you get you get a box or a key for crafting or even crafting dust. This would promote being a more sportsman like person.  But when honored everything for the crafting boxes you must be honored by unique people they cant be the same person over and over. This would stop friends from honoring each other over and over just for boxes. As well anyone below level 30&#039;s honor doesnt count so they cant just make smurfs and honor themselves or friends in a bot game or otherwise. THis isnt flawless please critique my idea to make sure it cant be exploited","replies":[{"poster":"cope moment","date":"2016-11-12T23:14:46.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem is, nobody actually honors (at least in my games) .

I try to stay positive, tell people when they do a good job, never flame, and tell the enemy good fight if we had a close 1 v 1.  \nBut I feel like I never get honors. So I'd just he boxless forever. \n\nAlso, I feel like itd discourage people from honoring. Salty your team lost? No honors. Salty your junglers red buff last hit a kill? No honor. Someone lost lane even with a late game champ? No honor. Feel like everybody sucks but you on your team? No honor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-12T23:00:52.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could work and limiting the amount one can give out would incentivize people to honor those that are actually honorable not the people who just ask for it.\n\nReally like this idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2016-11-12T23:03:39.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only problem i see is the potential to absolutely hoard keys.
