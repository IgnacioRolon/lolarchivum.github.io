Because I feel like she just got Karma'd. The lore overall feels less detailed than before, and takes out many of the more impactful moments (Is \"Flesh and Stone\" not canon anymore? God, I hope not. That is _easily_ one of the most touching and impactful stories League has). I feel like this was done in order to retcon out the Radiant Ones in order to makeway for Sylas's story, but if you ask me I feel that you guys could have easily made them coexist.\n\nI defend the choices you guys make a lot, but IMO this was a _huge_ step in the wrong direction, and not just because it retcons already-retconned lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2019-01-25T19:42:36.095+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Everything on Universe can be considered canon. 'Flesh and Stone' is still on Universe. :-)\n\nThe \"walking back\" of the Radiant Ones is not a retcon, it's more trying to place \"when is now?\" in Runeterra. Lux already met Kahina, for example, by the time Sylas breaks out... but she appears not yet to be aware of any mysterious magical group within Demacia. Such a group would almost certainly be in conflict with the mageseekers, which is not a story we're ready to place at this time.\n\nSo a lot of stuff is still canon (or will be canon) but it \"hasn't happened yet\". That's the best way to think about it.\n\nOverwhelmingly, players have requested story progression and a sense of time in the lore. We can't do that if all champions exist in conflicting states of knowledge, or if all stories just exist in a timeless splurge of perpetual \"now\".\n\nCycling up to big stories and meaningful progression of the lore requires us to evaluate where (and when) every champion exists, \"now\".\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2019-01-25T20:08:48.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"From what I can tell the update changed or straight up removed a lot of story telling qualities/elements that her update previously had.

I can make my peace with Lux/Demacia being walked back timeline-wise, but I still feel that the new bio is written very... _dryly_, for lack of a better word. Just compare the previous description of when Lux was attacked by the sabrewolves:\n\n>As the last light of day sank in the west, her horse lost its footing on a patch of ice and fell, breaking its foreleg. Lux was stranded; too far from the nearest town to reach it before nightfall, and too distraught at her mount's pain to leave him. She knew what Garen would say: kill the horse swiftly to end its suffering. But Lux couldn't bring herself to kill a mount she had ridden since she was a child. As Lux prepared for a night alone on the mountain, a lean and hungry sabrewulf pack, scenting the horse's blood, descended from their dens in search of fresh meat.\n>\n>As night fell and Lux had still not returned home, her father and Garen rode out to find her. They searched all night, and eventually found her the next morning, shivering and alone next to her frightened horse. The corpses of six sabrewulfs surrounded her, their fur scorched and flesh seared. Lux refused to speak of what happened and begged her father to rescue her beloved steed. A wagon was dispatched from the family home, and the horse was saved as Lux nursed it back to health.\n>\n>Since that night, Lux knew she possessed abilities beyond those of everyone around her: abilities the people of magic-averse Demacia would view with hatred. Since a babe in arms, Lux had been taught that magic had once brought Runeterra to the edge of annihilation. Her own uncle had been slain by a mage, and Demacia's folktales were replete with stories portraying sorcerers as twisted servants of evil, that told of how even the purest heart could be corrupted by magic. Would she become evil? Was she an abomination to be killed or exiled beyond the great wall? Fear and doubt gnawed at Lux, and she spent many nights squeezing her eyes closed, clenching her fists to stop the light rippling from her skin.\n\nTo the new one:\n\n>Riding home one fateful night, Lux and her horse were attacked by a ravenous sabrewulf pack. In a moment of fear and desperation, the young girl let loose a torrent of magical light from deep within her, routing the beasts but leaving her shivering in fear. Magic, the terror of Demacian myths, was as much a part of Lux as her Crownguard lineage.\n>\n>Fear and doubt gnawed at her. Would she become evil? Was she an abomination, to be imprisoned or exiled? At the very least, if her powers were discovered, it would see the Crownguard name disgraced forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2019-01-25T21:17:08.553+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have word limits, and we are now working to quite strict style guides that place a very clear separation between bios and stories.\n\nA bio should be informative, like a characterful encyclopedia of that champion to help onboard people.

The boards is kind of like Ascension, there are a passionate base of people on here who love the game and discussion about the game, but also like Ascension, it doesn’t receive  the love and care that other places get and then it’s viewed negatively by the people who should be caring for it. \n\nThis is pretty simple. We know you’re “here” our concern is that the number of posts with legitimate, well-researched, and politely worded questions and concerns (particularly about balance) are ignored and never acknowledged (maybe they’re seen). \n\nI, like you, want the boards to be a vibrant, lively place and not just a cesspool of criticism but Riot has to do things that actively invite people to the boards I.e.(announce in client that you’re having a Syria’s AMA, consistently acknowledge posts that aren’t specifically there to praise your skin team for another Sailor Moon Lux,Ahri,Soraka skin, do more frequent and well moderated AMAs with other sections of Riot team members)","replies":[{"poster":"DyQuill","date":"2019-02-01T01:38:26.951+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but also like Ascension, it doesn’t receive the love and care that other places get and then it’s viewed negatively by the people who should be caring for it.\n\nYeah, that's fair. I don't think we've done a great job communicating our intentions / expectations / plans / whatever when it comes to Boards (there was more a while back, but as someone else commented below, the follow-up from the initial launch has been...lacking). \n\n>We know you’re “here” our concern is that the number of posts with legitimate, well-researched, and politely worded questions and concerns (particularly about balance) are ignored and never acknowledged (maybe they’re seen).\n\nI'll be super honest - takes a lot more sifting to find those compared to a place like Reddit, which naturally filters it to the top. I'm also aware a ton of Boards posters disagree with me on this (i.e. that Reddit upvotes the best discussions, or that Boards has as bad of a mud-to-gold ratio as I'm making it out to be). What I can say is that it's way more not seeing/finding the good ones than it is flat out ignoring them. \n\n>I, like you, want the boards to be a vibrant, lively place and not just a cesspool of criticism but Riot has to do things that actively invite people to the boards\n\nThat's fair too. Will respond to each of your suggestions, but first a note and a request: we can do a lot to increase traffic, but Boards has to take a hard look at itself. I can't recall ever posting on here without at least one person posting vitriolic if not downright hateful comments (and being upvoted for it). I've got pretty thick skin so I don't take it personal, but it's exhausting to deal with, and not something I'm gonna recommend us to direct traffic to so long as that's the accepted culture. I'd love your help in fixing that. \n\n>announce in client that you’re having a Syria’s AMA\n\nWe stopped doing this for both reddit and boards because the timing window is so small that it felt bad for players to show up to something that was already over. Additionally, on our end the overall impact just isn't enough (compared to other things like a gameplay trailer or esports announcement); every team at Riot shares the same space in client, so we have to make some tough calls. That being said, there's probably other ways of promoting AMA-type content we're looking into. \n\n>consistently acknowledge posts that aren’t specifically there to praise your skin team for another Sailor Moon Lux,Ahri,Soraka skin,\n\nThis is mainly covered by the comment I made above re: Boards comment culture. I'd say there's a good mix of Rioters replying to suggestions, feedback, and outright criticism on reddit, but that's also because the temperament is drastically different. That doesn't excuse us ignoring Boards, tho. \n\nAll I can say is that Rioters jump into these discussion of their own volition, for their own reasons. Many aren't interested in super negative criticism, and none of them have it in their job description that they're required to comment on it. My advice to anyone who wants a Riot response? You can be absolutely livid, but keep it classy and articulate and it's way more likely to get a reply. Your comment (which I wouldn't say is livid, but has some criticism), is a perfect example of how to do this well. \n\n> do more frequent and well moderated AMAs with other sections of Riot team members\n\nLong story short - we've had tons of conversations about how to maximize the impact and quality of AMA-type content. For a bunch of reasons, only some of which I've mentioned above, it's tricky. Some other reasons I didn't mention: taking time out of all those Rioters' days (remember, they gotta make the stuff too), finding a good day to do it when not too much else is going on, getting good questions, coordinating good, robust responses, and the inherent fact that even in a great AMA, 90% of commenters will not get their questions answered (unless it's a real small crowd, in which case, probably not the best use of time). \n\nI think there's something to the voting / collection method (that's the origin of Ask Riot), and I think there are some other similar formats that might be an improvement. However - there's a good chance the frequency of AMAs stays exactly the same, or even drops. Riot isn't a monolithic entity; it really depends on the team, the thing they make, how much they redpost already. Those of us that can will be around as much as possible, and I'll try to keep it real with all of you. \n\nThanks for playing, and for posting.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2019-02-01T05:49:39.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">What I can say is that it's way more not seeing/finding the good ones than it is flat out ignoring them. \n\nYou already have mods filtering these into Gameplay+, an entire section dedicated to this filtering and accessibility. Also, lots of in-depth posts on Meddler's gameplay updates.\n\n>I'm also aware a ton of Boards posters disagree with me on this (i.e. that Reddit upvotes the best discussions)\n\nHard to argue that the boards are wrong about that. There are many excellent posts that don't get upvotes just because they happen to be about unpopular or polarizing champs. Or they're addressing design issues for champs with win rates on the high end. \n\n>This is mainly covered by the comment I made above re: Boards comment culture. I'd say there's a good mix of Rioters replying to suggestions, feedback, and outright criticism on reddit, but that's also because the temperament is drastically different.\n\nThis is because they have stricter rules, more moderation, and more Riot interaction.

Your comment (which I wouldn't say is livid, but has some criticism), is a perfect example of how to do this well.\n\nIt also helps to ask short, broad, open-ended questions, like \"what are your thoughts on X?\"\n\nIn my experience, it's actually quite easy to form a question that hooks a Rioter. Also in my experience, very specific questions will almost never be answered, regardless of how you go about it. I hate that because it's the same deal you face with Reddit - small-audience questions just don't get attention.\n\nFor example, I've had very long exchanges with Rioters that opened with super-broad questions about rate of change or AP starting items for manaless champs. Very specific questions don't really fly. Examples:\n\n* Are Katarina and Akali too pigeonholed to Gunblade rush?\n* Is a fix for Zyra plant 1-shots in the works still?\n* What is the range on Lissandra's passive? Is there any data on its average damage per game?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2019-01-25T23:41:45.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tbh, and I know this has nothing to do with you, the reason this post got downvoted initially is bc the ama is on Reddit.
