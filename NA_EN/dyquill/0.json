After the teasing and the hype and the spotlights, we want players to be able to try the champion out right away. For players whose primary way to engage in League is through ranked (and that’s a lot of players) a week can feel like a long time, especially since the champion will have been on the PBE before that.\n\n> However, we sympathize with the basic problem you’re hinting at, of someone going into ranked with a champion they have never played before, and having your team possibly pay the price. While we think the new Practice Mode will help some with this problem, we also have discussed requiring you to play with the champion – even if it’s as little as one game – before you take him or her into ranked. No concrete plans at the moment, but it’s something we’ll keep on our radar.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-03-08T22:29:53.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I think about it, wouldn't it be easier to have people play in blind pick?

This is to anyone who's choice it is.\n\nThe answer of \"people want to play it, but also don't want to play non ranked games\" is not remotely good enough. Especially because those very people often also have a terrible experience when they in fact do this, in addition to ruining things for everyone else. I think the main reason this still goes on is because new stuff sells and not allowing the new champion in ranked for a week would hurt sales in a very clear, measurable, though short term way. Whereas the cost of doing so is much more long term, nearly impossible to measure, and probably pretty damn small anyways. Why have a better player experience when you can just not and make more money? I also wouldn't be surprised if this is the sort of thing where that decision happened long ago for that greedy reason, but if it were a new problem Riot wouldn't do it that way now and the main thing preventing change is the inertia of the situation.\n\nAs Ghostcrawler said, the practice tool (and now the much more open PBE) likely mitigate this a good amount. I just got done playing a ranked game where the adc on my team was Kai'Sa. They did well enough and as a team we crushed our opponents. But I still think letting people play brand new champions out the game with no requirement in ranked is stupid and overall makes the game worse. I also think there are better solutions than simply making people wait a week though and I hope Riot gives this some real thought and effort and makes a change. Sure we won and our Kai'Sa's record looks good (6/2/5) but her damage was actually pretty bad, even lower than the enemy adc (who went 1/2/2), and her other contributions to the team were minimal at best. Regardless of the anecdote of this one experience, I'm pretty sure the evidence is strong that change should happen here.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-03-08T21:20:52.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"should be two weeks honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-08T21:33:58.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe, but I'm setting my goals lower so as to not be rude or create high expectations.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-03-08T21:36:16.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not rude to stop people from intentionally being liabilities in a ranked game.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-08T21:40:07.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I’m with you, but the situation is fraught\nYou’ve got to be carefully taught\nIf you talk, you’re gonna get shot\" [down]\n\n-Aaron Burr, in \"My Shot\" from the play Hamilton","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2018-03-08T22:53:14.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if designy questions can go here, and that if I'm already too late to the questions, but...\n\nHow come Kai'Sa still looks \"pretty\" under that suit?

I've found it rather difficult in practice to determine exactly how much of my damage will go to any one given target (or how many will hit my primary target in the case of multiple enemies), which is frustrating when using her ult to finish off someone with a dive-- something that feels intended by her design, but often ruined by Q suddenly fragmenting into a minion wave.
