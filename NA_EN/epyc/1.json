While loading my last game right after champ select I received a Bug Splat and I could not load the game. When I tried logging back in, it made me run a patch. After patching and now every time I try to load the game I receive the error message \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working.\" I completely uninstalled and reinstalled the game and that did not help at all.
