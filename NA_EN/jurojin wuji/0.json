He engaged in the use of language such as &quot;dumb ass&quot; and &quot;go fuck yourself&quot; without any just cause. Shyvanna went into enemy jgl, i pinged the MIA mid immediately, yet Shyv did not back off and died to them converging on her; I was too low to follow without getting one shot from a bush.\n\nI was carrying either way. After the harassment began (and proceeded into all chat), i no longer wanted to carry anymore. i didnt not feel like playing. this use of language was further supported by a Trynd player. The trynd proceeded to call me a &quot;privileged sensitive bitch&quot;.\n\nI was triggered. I do not feel it is appropriate to share my personal information on the internet but i was the victim of a long term sexually and verbally abusive situation in my childhood. \n\nI was triggered.\n\nI am still triggered.\n\nUse of that language had no purpose in that game. it had no purpose in league. I do not understand how behavior like this is acceptable by anyone. I was hoping to make it to gold before the season ended; i do not think i will be playing again anytime soon.\n\nRiot, that wasn&#039;t toxic; it was triggering. It is enabling to dismiss that with a warning. I felt myself wanting to cry during the game.\n\nThe profound shock of it continuing in all chat made me want to D/C. i felt bad for the bot lane i was playing with. but engaging teammates in such a way is unhealthy.\n\nNo one deserves to be treated in such a way. it happening on the internet does not give anyone the excuse. real friends are made here. real feelings are hurt.\n\n**EDIT:** Reposting the blog because i do not know why it was taken down. I took the names out (against my better judgment -- destructively harmful/negative behavior should always be ostracized), and took cuss words out of the title.\n\nA moderator suggested i report the players. that is all. sigh. Why can we not reply to the messages they send us?\n\nis it even possible to report anyone outside of the end of game window? I would like to do that, if possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-15T19:06:44.178+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Use of that language had no purpose in that game. it had no purpose in league.

They obviously don't want to use chat for anything useful, or are at least doing more harm than good, so they can just rely on pings to communicate. When the game is over you can report them, and a report for this kind of behavior is certainly a punishable offense, so if they do this frequently and are consistently reported they will get their punishment so that you can help prevent other players from dealing with it.\n\nBasically, don't hesitate to mute them, and report if you feel it necessary.\n\nAs for calling them out on the boards, starting a witch hunt does not solve the problem, it just creates drama. Leave it to Riot to handle these players. We can sympathize with your situation and give advice, but that's it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jurojin Wuji","date":"2016-09-15T19:13:06.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=soEhxEYc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-15T19:06:44.178+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re right, but we have the tools to deal with verbal abuse.

I have only been asking about a secondary way to report.\n\nI should state that you have no clue what my day to day may be like.
