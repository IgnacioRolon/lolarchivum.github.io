Hopefully with a little more time we can tune the game up for 4k further! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ASalami","date":"2018-01-02T17:25:28.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, you can set your monitors resolution to 1080p. :P\n\nBorderless fullscreen is actually a window, so if it's smaller than your monitor resolution it will not take up the full screen.","replies":[]}]}
