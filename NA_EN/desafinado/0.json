I'm forced to sign out of my computer in order to return to my game as signing out closes everything because the frozen scene of league overlays everything (including Task Manager). When I sign in and boot up League again and the match finishes, I cant queue up again because it says \"Patcher service unavailable.\" I'd appreciate any form of help \r\n\r\nMy Specs \r\n\r\nOperating System:  Windows 10 Home 64-bit          \r\nVideo Card (GPU): Radeon RX 570 Series           \r\nAvailable GPU Memory: 4096 MB  \r\nGPU Driver Version: 23.20.15015.1002         \r\nProcessor (CPU) Name: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8400 CPU @ 2.80GHz \r\nAvailable RAM: 8152MB RAM","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T04:52:02.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm yea that doesn't sound too fun to deal with at all. I'm curious if something in the background is causing your pc to freeze up for some reason since League shouldn't be locking up your entire computer even if it does freeze. Try doing a quick clean boot if you can, and I'd also make sure the Windows Game DVR is turned off since it can cause some fps issues in League. It might be heavily impacting it in this case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MBartex","date":"2018-02-06T17:47:59.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hunch√∞ Jack - Windows Creators Update?\n\ni ahve this problem too, Windows Game DVR\\Game Bar off not work","replies":[]}]}
