You say you have enough IP to buy a 6300 champ - I would wait until you have either gained enough experience playing the ADC role before you spend anything. It could turn out that Trist is the champ that fits your play style perfectly, or it could be that ADC isn't the role for you at all. First try out the free ADC champs of the week to see if one of them suits you, also pick up Trist (she is one of the safest ADCs around because of her range). Just keep trying out the free ADCs each week, and work on CSing well (one of the most important parts of being a good ADC). Also, don't be afraid to look up guides for specific champs.

At least wait until level 12 (and get some Flash Summoner Spell experience) before you move to PvP games, but don't wait to long after that. PvP games give you more experience and IP, and make you a better player. Don't make the mistake I did where I played bot games until level 20....it's not a good idea.

Sure, it applies a second Q for free, but in teamfights you'll be wanting to stun teams with her R when they're in bad positions, then have an AS item like Shiv or PD to take out a single target (Shiv early for waveclear, PD later for dueling), and then applying her slow to as many targets as possible with her W.  If you can't take out a single target fast enough, you may get into trouble if their bruiser dives you and your team isn't ready for it.  Also, getting the blue Trinket is kinda redundant, since it's a shorter-ranged version of the active on her E.  You always want to be getting the yellow Stealth Ward Trinket as ADC.  Also, her skill order is R > W > Q > E.  W is more useful than Q, even though it applies the current level of Q to  W.  Trust me on this, W is so useful for Ashe it's not even funny.  It's a great counter-diving and harassment tool.\n\nEDIT: If that was the first time you played Ashe, you did *great*.

Smart casting is a great way to land abilities more effectively too; it makes playing Ezreal a dream.

They don't have dashes/mobility so you tend to focus more on positioning behind your team mates to stay safe and you also focus more on the damage you dish out.\n\nMechanical tip: Use attack-move commands. This means pressing the \"A\" button (below Q), and then left clicking. What it does is it will command your champion to walk towards that location, attacking any enemy minions, champions, hostile jungle monsters or towers that move in the way that you have vision of. It will always *target the closest attackable unit.* It can be used to force an attack instead of walking to a location and ignoring hostile units.\n\nThe way you should be using attack move is for the purpose of kiting, and stutter stepping.\n\n**Kiting**: Means fighting your opponent by attacking them when they are in your range of attack, but dodging enemy attacks and otherwise staying outside of the range of your enemies attacks. Kiting is easier if you have mobility control based abilities (such as Ashe's slow, or Sivir's Move speed buff, or if you have items like{{item:3044}}  Phage or {{item:3022}} Frozen Mallet). As an ADC, kiting is important because you have a very small health pool and usually not enough burst damage to kill enemies before they kill you. So your best defence is to stay away and get \"free\" attacks against them.\n\n**Stutter stepping**: Means cancelling attack animations to reposition yourself. It's a mechanical technique that pretty much all professional ADC players have mastered. Being good at stutter stepping usually means that you can kite a lot better. A common misconception is that it will increase your attack speed, IT DOES NOT INCREASE IT. The way it works is you throw an attack animation, then immediately make a move command once the ranged projectile has left your champion, then command yourself to attack the enemy. This is because auto attacks can actually be considered spells that deal targeted physical damage equal to your total AD, with a coold own equal to your attack speed. If done right, you end up dealing just as much damage as if you were standing still, but with the added benefit of having moved a small distance. This is useful for dodging skill shots, dealing damage when running away (most likely to get out of the attack range of your enemy), and when chasing an enemy (it also helps to charge{{item:3087}}  stattik shiv a little bit more quickly).\n\nStutter stepping and kiting become much more easier the more attack speed you have. Most players find that they are able to kite once they finish building their berserker greaves and zeal. But if you are like the pro players, you can begin kiting as early as once you finish your berserker greaves by putting some attack speed runes in your rune page. Usually 10-15% attack speed is good. A Life steal quint or two is also useful.\n\nBy far the most important tip to anyone looking into becoming a good ADC is this:\n**FARM**\nEarly game, ADC's tend to have the lowest kill potential out of any champion due to their lack of cc and burst damage early on. Killing the enemy champion's in lane depends on you poking them to low amounts of hp and relying on the idea that your opponents are dumb enough to stay in lane until you they die. Most enemies you face won't be that dumb and they will actually leave and heal and buy health potions/sustain items. Don't depend on kills as farm. Last-hit minions to earn gold. As the ADC, you need gold more than anyone else on the team due to you being the best champion on your team at actually taking objectives (mainly towers) and therefore winning the game.One of the biggest differences between a pro player and a new player is that a pro player can farm minions efficiently and quickly and easily beat out the competition in CS. If you find that farming lane minions is too dangerous, then try snagging some easy jungle camps (provided you have the lifesteal and damage to take them out quickly). Try to spot free farm: large minion waves pushed to your side lane towers.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendz Razor","date":"2014-11-04T09:51:47.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh man that was alot to read, thanks for the tips.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zydron","date":"2014-11-02T06:15:38.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most important thing to remember is that you are not just an adc, (which technically could also be champions like {{champion:266}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:11}} etc....) but you are a RANGED adc. always remember you have range and to never be in melee range of ANYONE. the hardest thing about adc is that they all have different ranges, and you have to know your range to be truly effective. \n\nYou are also squishy af, so try not to put yourself in bad situations.\n\nMy fav adcs are {{champion:29}} {{champion:236}}  {{champion:18}} {{champion:96}}  cuz their ranges at times are op, but Twitch and Lucians range comes from their ults, not their autos (even tho Twitchs are autos -_-","replies":[]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-04T22:10:04.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[IMG]http://i57.tinypic.com/iz96c5.jpg[/IMG]\n\nJust showing some ashe love. Its because you don't have a safety escape skill, that you really have to learn how to position yourself (which is a skill you carry on to any other adc). You aren't trying to training wheel yourself into this, you want to learn how to adc right, and a no escape, high utility, high atk range adc will do it.

You also learn when you wish your adc would ward, push, freeze, etc, based on who you're playing and how fed you/your opponents are.\n\nWatch your adcs, and figure out what makes the good ones, good, and the bad ones, bad. NOW go pick up adc. I promise it'll help you -- my adc mechanics are crap, but I do pretty well in lane because I'm able to work with my support (especially with vision - adcs who buy wards are the best).","replies":[]},{"poster":"GildedCreed","date":"2014-11-02T11:09:27.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Start off with champs like Ezreal or Lucian who play similar to AP Burst Mages (AD equivalent would be AD Casters).

Twitch a bit more, but Kog, you better have your positioning down pat.\n\nNow my ADVICE.  First off, a good deal of learning ADC, is learning all the ADC's and all the SUPPORTS to some degree.  Knowing what skills an enemy ADC may use, and an enemy SUPPORT may use, are vital to you knowing how to stay alive, when to be aggressive, when to be sae.  Champ ranges and damages.  Part of that you can learn just by playing against them, but also as dude said, try them when they are free. Will help you even once you get a preferred adc.\n\nTIPS - Communication with your Support is vital. You guys MUST be on the same page. Let them know if your going to be aggressive, let them know if you want to hold back and farm. ect.\n\n-BE SURE YOUR WARDED. Especially if your pushing. Dont just assume Support is buying wards. If they are great, but if you need to as well, do it.  If they onlt throw one in the bush, make sure there is another in Tribush if your top, or farther up river if your bottom. The extra time knoowing when a gank is incoming is invaluable.\n\n-BE CAREFUL EXNTENDING LANE.  If your going to have a pushed lane, make sure you keep your mobility/escape skill ready. Dont OOM. Be sure your warded, this time above all. A gank when your pushed to far can really set you back hard.\n\n-KEEP MOVING. Alot if not all ADC's have some poke skill. Dont get hit by it. For that matter dont get hit by the supports either.  Keep moving, so  you cant easily be poked and dove on or forced B cause your low. Dont stand in one spot and hit creeps.\n\n-LAST HITTING. Ultra important, of course. ALSO, dont just auto hit every minion, if you werent aware of this, though I assume you are. If you dont need to push lane, dont. Freeze it and just farm gold.\n\n-DONT BE NEEDLESSLY AGGRESSIVE.  15 minions is a kill esssentially. Dont waste skills and resources poking and attacking enemies just to run out with no kills and a bunch of lost last hits.  You will end up behind.\n\nAll I can think of atm, I've had a few beers.","replies":[]}]}
