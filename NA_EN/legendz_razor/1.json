(though I don't really flame at all so that might not mean much).\n\nThat said, even though sightstone does pay for itself eventually (fairly quickly if you're using it right) there's a reason it's not bought by every player on every champion in every role, and that's because it slows down your build. Supports build it because champions are chosen for support on the grounds of not really needing stats, but for everyone else dumping 800 gold for 150 HP means you'll be a lot less powerful than someone else who just spent 225 to buy three wards and put the rest into their main build. Certain junglers don't mind that, for example Lee Sin has really powerful early game damage without stats and gets extra advantages from being able to use the wards for jumps. But on everybody else buying a sightstone means you're less powerful than you could be in a fight for at least your next three backs.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2014-11-04T17:20:28.664+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, placing the gold into non-combat stats is only really an issue early in the game.  He said that he had already finished Spirit of the Ancient Golem and Spirit Visage (and presumably boots), so at that point losing 400g in combat stats wasn't that big a setback for his build.\n\nJunglers who can get away with purchasing an early sightstone are typically utility junglers (like Nunu, Rammus) and counterjunglers (Elise, Lee Sin).  It may not always be optimal, but it can be a good decision depending on your playstyle and your team.\n\nI'm not exactly disagreeing with you, but after a couple major items are finished the 400g lost for free wards is pretty insignificant.\n\n@OP.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Purchasing a sightstone was a good decision and the Sejuani likely would have raged at you anyways, since most people like that are only looking for an excuse to argue they weren't the reason the game was lost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2014-11-04T11:00:07.600+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Level 1-20ish don't really understand the importance of wards IMO.

They have either their own formulated preconceptions, or preconceptions from hearing about the game from someone else, and thus assume if you aren't doing it, you're doing it wrong. \n\nMy opinion is that site stone is fine on champs with some utility spells and are going tanky, especially if they're going around the map a lot. Maokai jungle fits that role just fine.  Even Maokai mid with a site stone would be circumstantially fine, as long as your team isn't relying on you as their sole source of AP damage.  I 100% wouldn't pick up the sitestone if you're playing apc or adc though, just because your team is relying on you to do heavy damage, and other defensive items are much better.

I just started watching videos from the LCS season  4 and I heard them use that term as well.\n\nA \"power spike\" just refers to any point where a champ spikes significantly in power, typically because they hit a certain level, granting them access to a certain skill or their ultimate, or because they got an item that compliments them significantly.  Some examples:\n\n- When Ashe gets Infinity Edge, the automatic crit from her passive becomes really scary for enemy champs, which is why you try to rush IE on her.\n- When Akali hits level 6, her ultimate allows her to roam and gank very efficiently.\n- When Ezreal gets Trinity Force, he becomes a much stronger duelist.\n\nThese are pretty obvious/extreme examples, but almost all champs hit power spikes.  As a player, you should strive to learn when the champs you play are at their strongest relative to the champs you are facing.  If you have a champ whose power spikes most significantly after she gets her first full item, facing someone who needs two or three items to really become monstrous, you want to start bullying that champ once you get that item, because that's your best window to beat them into submission and snowball to victory!\n\nAnyway, back to my original point about Sightstone: unless you are building toward an item that clearly helps you to hit a power spike, buying a Sightstone is fine.  A lot of players, and most bad players, underestimate the value of vision on the map.  Every time a ward helps you avoid being ganked, think of that as preventing the other team from getting kill gold.  Every time a ward helps you gank someone who is out of position, think of that gold as a return on the investment you made when you bought that ward.  Sightstones are, over a long game, VERY gold efficient.  They just delay you getting to your item-based power spikes, so it's a compromise you have to consider before making it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chescatt","date":"2014-11-05T23:03:50.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a game where vision is as important as it is, I don't see how anything could be considered wrong with it...Especially if no one else is dropping wards...","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrinkMoreWhiskey","date":"2014-11-05T17:03:12.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly sightstone is a bad buy.  Not flame worthy bad, but by no means good.  It's a double problem.   \n\nIf you're at a low enough ELO that you're needing to compensate that bad ward wise, it's not just placing wards it's remembering to place them and if people are even watching the map.  Both your lack of optimal use combined with people not paying attention anyway devalue the wards. \n\n If you're aware enough to use your sightstone effectively you're prob at a high enough ELO where you're teams warding anyway and dueling \\ countergank power is going to be more valuable.\n\nBuying wards will almost always be a better solution on either side of the coin.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendz Razor","date":"2014-11-05T22:12:28.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok I understand your point.
