Just look","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":33,"down_votes":12,"body":"I got chat restricted for not doing well in a ranked game. I tried the entire time, said LITERALLY NOTHING NEGATIVE, and at the end everyone reported me and I got chat restricted. **throughout the entirety of the game**, my team was flaming me nonstop. I still did not say anything negative, nor did I flame them. I only muted 1 of them who was flaming the most of all of them. The {{champion:103}} kept saying that I was a troll account. If you're wondering what I played, I got autofilled bot so I played yasuo adc (which works). In champ select the enemy realized that and picked ashe and karma to counter it which is why I didn't do so well.\n\nCan someone tell me what I did to deserve a chat restriction??

I get that other players were giving you a hard time, but we have to hold each player accountable for their own behavior.\n\nIt's important to remember that there's a difference between arguing with your teammates, and disagreeing with them. We don't expect you to agree with other players all the time. That would be unrealistic. However, the difference between the two is that arguing does not provide anything constructive to the game. When players start arguing , tensions start running higher, and things are more likely to escalate. Arguing serves as the foundation of more continued negative behavior, which is why we don't want to see it in games. I know that this behavior may be seen as being minor, but it's still behavior that we administer penalties for.\n\nI'm sorry to have to be so final, but we won't be appending this chat restriction, for any reason.\n\n\nThanks to everyone for their suggestions and honest opinions (and some for your sympathy). I'm gonna follow the advice that was given to me so as for this to not happen again. I did not expect this to get popular at all but I'm glad it did because I got some real advice.\n\n Thanks again, and see yall{{sticker:vlad-salute}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-07-03T01:47:43.952+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":37,"body":"I've removed the link from your post as we don't allow naming and shaming for any reason.

Seeing as how you can explain exactly what _actual_ rules they broke with the negative behavior they engaged in, they do logically deserve a punishment according to those rules.

Since \"I don't like these rules\" has never been a legitimate justification to ignore rules, it's moot. OP broke Riot's behavioral guidelines by spending an entire game having a screeching match with annoying teammates. With a chat restriction, they won't be able to engage in such practices. The hope is that they learn what's expected of them and stop breaking the rules, because if they latch onto a self-centered \"only the rules I like are worth following\" perspective and continue to break Riot's rules on an ongoing basis, they'll end up permabanned.\n\nAnd that's what the PB Board is for, not telling players who broke the rules to submit support tickets in an effort to get away with it. That doesn't do anyone any good... much like getting into a prolonged argument with trolls/griefers/flamers.","replies":[{"poster":"Galievor","date":"2019-07-03T03:06:48.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel as though the only \"negative\" thing I said was \"stfu.\" I 100% agree now that I look at it, I should have just muted and went on with the game.

Look at the rest of your chat, where you're basically just arguing with a troll who flames and spams pings. Did any of the things you said _improve_ their behavior? No, and it never will. By clogging up the chat with an argument that's guaranteed to help no one and bother everyone (all who haven't muted the lot of you, anyway), you're just making things worse. That's not an appropriate use of chat. This is what justifies your punishment by Riot's standards (each player's own personal standards are not taken into account by the IFS when determining a punishment).","replies":[{"poster":"Galievor","date":"2019-07-03T03:50:58.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead of just saying that I said more negative things, could you maybe quote those other negative things I said so I can get a better understanding?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-03T04:30:56.963+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Galievor8525,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=PslQGRk6,comment-id=000c000100000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-07-03T03:50:58.359+0000)\n>\n> Instead of just saying that I said more negative things, could you maybe quote those other negative things I said so I can get a better understanding?\n\nWhat purpose did these messages serve?\n\n> Galievor8525: why would i\nGalievor8525: ??\nGalievor8525: what does playing yas have aything to do with it?\nGalievor8525: yll are tripping\nGalievor8525: why are you getting tilted already\nGalievor8525: chilll brand\nGalievor8525: im muting all just bc everyone on the team is flaming me\n\nAnd we've already covered this one:\n\n> Galievor8525: either u stfu or i mute bc im not tryna get tilte\n\nMore arguing:\n\n> Galievor8525: muting brand\nGalievor8525: you telling m that isnt helping\n\nThe following is game-related and neutral, which is good:\n\n> Galievor8525: i can play aggro till ashe comes\n\nAnd then arguing:\n\n> Galievor8525: chill\nGalievor8525: or im muting your pings too\nGalievor8525: if brand says something that isnt flaming me tell me\nGalievor8525: excuse me?\nGalievor8525: yes it does brand\nGalievor8525: every single person has bad games\nGalievor8525: where did trolll account come from?\nGalievor8525: im having a bad game and they think im trolling\nGalievor8525: idk what else to say\nGalievor8525: I AM TRYING\n\nThe following, taken on its own, looks like a perfectly ordinary message about the game, but when we look at the rest it's clearly an attempt to justify your build to someone who's flaming you (hint: nothing you say will stop them):\n\n> Galievor8525: it recently came out of meta\n\nAnd then you continue to argue with someone who claims that you're inting:\n\n> Galievor8525: im not\nGalievor8525: wtf\nGalievor8525: im legtitimately trying but because i lost in laning phase, yall keep killing me\nGalievor8525: and if u think im a troll account check my op.gg\nGalievor8525: im having a bad game\nGalievor8525: im so confused\nGalievor8525: honestly if u think im a troll, i cant stop you from reporting. im just telling you that im having a bad game and if u dont beleieve that thats fine\nGalievor8525: i cant stop you\n\nThe following on its own, once again, would have been okay, but it's just part of a larger argument. If you had literally only said this line during the whole match, there would be nothing to report. It's not a particularly useful thing to say, as people don't stop being upset within a single match, but it would've at least been an attempt at being positive:\n\n> Galievor8525: ahri i understand youre upset that im not doing well and i understand\n\nYou keep telling them that you're not trolling and they will keep not believing you, just like they've been demonstrating over the match thus far, but you keep arguing:\n\n> Galievor8525: but im not trolling\nGalievor8525: or intentionally feeding\nGalievor8525: what??\nGalievor8525: IM TRYNA E TO THE RAPTORS\nGalievor8525: cant stop yo\n\nThis next part is generally okay, but only if it's a response to e.g. \"what happened to jax?\" and not \"REEEE I HAET PIZZA DE CHAMP.\" Providing information in a useful way is fine. Responding to flame... not so fine - and that's what you did repeatedly over the entire match.\n\n> Galievor8525: jax has 10k ping\nGalievor8525: dont say that he is just afk\n\nIf, once again, you had said something like the following _once_, that would've been fine. Spending the entire match going back and forth about it is not fine.\n\n> Galievor8525: i apoligize\nGalievor8525: i had a bad game\n\nTalking about who's reporting whom is never useful. I suppose they were screaming \"RePoRt X fOr FeEdInG\" and you felt the need to have a discussion with them about it. That's not going to be a useful discussion, because they have already made up their minds.
