I have frequently used the hextech repair tool and the client to fix any corrupted files, but it doesn't seem to help with my disconnecting in champion select. I don't disconnect in-game frequently, usually just when the internet goes out for whatever reason. I was hoping that someone could help me with a way to fix the issue. I remember people used to post their logs on here to see what was wrong specifically, and if anyone tells me which ones will be useful I can post them here.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T03:20:31.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're only getting disconnected when your entire internet hiccups, it might just be ISP related where they're having some issues. I'd first try switching to ethernet if at *all* possible for the most stable connection, but also try updating some of your network settings following the steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). I'd specifically start with the DNS troubleshooting too!","replies":[{"poster":"Kenaz 21","date":"2018-01-09T03:43:04.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I normally still have access to the chat, so I don't think its an internet hiccup, but I will try the things mentioned here.\nI am already connected via ethernet.\n\nThank you for your advice.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T03:53:05.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's good to know, thanks for the followup! The chat actually works off a different server, so that might mean there's something blocking your network from that server sometimes. Have you checked to make sure firewalls/antivirus aren't blocking it? Try turning those off temporarily or adding exceptions for League to them!","replies":[{"poster":"Kenaz 21","date":"2018-01-09T14:49:51.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually play without my firewall turned on after I saw it as an option on the hextech repair tool. I believe that flushing the DNS helped, but it is hard to tell with the small sample size I have since trying it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T21:39:32.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to hear it seems to be working a bit better for now! If it starts happening again check those steps to see if they can help again first, but you can always hit us back up here to try some other fixes.","replies":[{"poster":"Kenaz 21","date":"2018-01-13T18:19:58.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly it doesn't seem to be working, its happened in about 1/6 of the games I play.

Always when i accept the match, im getting stuck for time. When champion select run, its a \"ban a champion\", so bypasses \"declare the champ\".  I reinstalled whole game, used repair hextech etc. Still the same problem. Its soo annoying. Also i dont have emotes in game, from time to time. ITS all happend after update.","replies":[]}]}
