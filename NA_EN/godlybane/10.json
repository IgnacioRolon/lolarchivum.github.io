Longer CD on ult in early/mid can also exacerbate her failure states. Especially in the current solo queue meta with damage everywhere and divers/skirmishers.

Kindred's kit basically is just about setting up a choke point and overwhelm the opponents with superior stats within it, or chasing the opponent down with hops and destroy them with their AA boosted from farming marks and whatnot.\n\nIf they have any gameplay problem, it's at the design in my eyes, rather than a balance problem.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-07-27T09:52:16.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have dashes and a giant aoe slow that exists for a decent duration. Combined with redbuff slow that is a ton of cc and mobility advantage vs almost anyone early on. This is why she's so damn scary and effective in early fights. I'm not talking anything about how she scales into the game; which isn't too shabby. I'm looking primarily at her early ability to duel, counter-jungle, and gank lanes. She's insanely strong at these.... probably a bit too good at punishing melee toplaners especially due to the tandem slow of redbuff and wolf. Combined with her low cd hop and her ability to STAY at range while doing all her damage makes it far easier to gank with her than many other junglers while removing real counterplay that others such as elise or lee offer. Sure they can match her initial dmg and/or cc and mobility, but then they either have to commit and enter melee range and be punishable or they have to back off and be happy with the dmg and cc they got off and leave. Kindred is non-commital continued harass/dps... much like a jungler version of zoe. Other champs also tend to pay for this a bit more than kindred by not scaling as well as she does.\n\nSo either she needs to be less punishing early to play against or she needs to scale less well into the game. Riot kinda took a swing at both. Not a fatal one... not by a long shot. She should now be in a spot where GOOD kindred players can still use her KIT and win both early and later in the game, but bad kindred players who use her kit poorly or not at all FAIL rather than win despite the other person(s) playing better than them. In essence, it's no different than the changes to ahri which reduced her damage if she fails to land charm, but buffed it if she does land it. They are making it so GOOD players win because they play the champ well and UNSKILLED players can't win simply by pure stat-check. You don't have to like it... but you can't honestly say it's unfair or going to make her unplayable.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2018-07-25T17:37:38.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"none of that is an excuse to completely gut her while pretty much every other champ would get a tiny slap on the wrist, completely halving a ability is 100% no the way to go","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-07-25T20:00:09.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"She isn't close to balanced.\n\nThese nerfs are deserved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-07-25T16:35:44.417+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"yeah, idk wtf riot is doing.. i LOVE seeing {{champion:203}} in my games, she has so much counter-play to work around. she isn't \"inherently broken\" but can become so if u don't play the map correctly. she is a champions that take game knowledge to beat rather than just mechanical skill. and i LOVE that. and i wish i could see her even more often.\n\ni also wish i could PLAY her, but as a markmans type jungler who needs to kite, i will never be able to so with my shitty mechanics. thats why i love simple champions like {{champion:76}}  that rely on game knowledge  and predicting the enemy rather than mechanical skill.","replies":[{"poster":"Summonah12369","date":"2018-07-25T16:45:36.612+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwiftKitten88,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G6QG1YYW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-25T16:35:44.417+0000)\n>\n> yeah, idk wtf riot is doing.. i LOVE seeing {{champion:203}} in my games, she has so much counter-play to work around. she isn&#x27;t &quot;inherently broken&quot; but can become so if u don&#x27;t play the map correctly. she is a champions that take game knowledge to beat rather than just mechanical skill. and i LOVE that. and i wish i could see her even more often.\n> \n> i also wish i could PLAY her, but as a markmans type jungler who needs to kite, i will never be able to so with my shitty mechanics. thats why i love simple champions like {{champion:76}}  that rely on game knowledge  and predicting the enemy rather than mechanical skill.\n\nWho the fuck said Nidalee is simple.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-07-25T16:49:26.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Summonah12369,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G6QG1YYW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-07-25T16:45:36.612+0000)\n>\n> Who the fuck said Nidalee is simple.\n\ni do? \ni am rank 230 worldwide in nidalee matery, and top 50 NA\nher actual _mechanics_ are brain dead simple, the hard part about her is watching your opponents, knowing when u can go in..  she has no \"get out of jail free\" card, like most assassins.. u make once bad pounce in.. your dead.. she is all decision making and prediction.. and takes a great deal of game knowledge, but her actual MECHANICS are VERY simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Summonah12369","date":"2018-07-25T16:51:15.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwiftKitten88,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G6QG1YYW,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-25T16:49:26.627+0000)\n>\n> i do? \n> i am rank 230 worldwide in nidalee matery, and top 50 NA\n> her actual _mechanics_ are brain dead simple, the hard part about her is watching your opponents, knowing when u can go in..  she has no &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card, like most assassins.. u make once bad pounce in.. your dead.. she is all decision making and prediction.. and takes a great deal of game knowledge, but her actual MECHANICS are VERY simple.\n\nYeah I main her, she's gonna feel easier once you master or learn her combos n'shit.

And yea then comes the much harder part... learning WHEN to do her combo, I learned that the hard way. Only knowing her combo and not knowing the limits. That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s important to learn about her cus she can&#x27;t just jump in 1v5 with her combo, atleast, if she&#x27;s not super fed.\n\nlol she cant even do that IF she is super fed.. but again.. that's _game knowledge_ NOT mechanics. she DOES tahe a grat deal of game knowledge... knowing when u can go in for a kill and when u cant, THAT takes practice.. but that is game knowledge.. its not.. click accuracy and perfect stutter stepping and kiting between autos like kindrid and other ADC's take","replies":[{"poster":"Summonah12369","date":"2018-07-25T18:25:39.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwiftKitten88,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G6QG1YYW,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-25T17:03:59.960+0000)\n>\n> lol she cant even do that IF she is super fed.. but again.. that&#x27;s _game knowledge_ NOT mechanics. she DOES tahe a grat deal of game knowledge... knowing when u can go in for a kill and when u cant, THAT takes practice.. but that is game knowledge.. its not.. click accuracy and perfect stutter stepping and kiting between autos like kindrid and other ADC&#x27;s take\n\nWhy did that reply have so many spelling mistakes?

A bad Kindred player will use it selfishly, and _often times_ get their entire team killed because they saved a key person on the enemy team from dying long enough for them to get their cooldowns up, while the rest of the team evened out the playing field by whittling down health bars.

Kit/play-style first and for most it doesn't fit, and thematically it doesn't. In my personal opinion it was more of a slapped on ult then a well designed one.
