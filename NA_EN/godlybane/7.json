In about 2 Weeks will be soft-reset and you will have to make placement-matches again. As your MMR will not be affected that much and you are bronze you will not be placed lower than before even if you would drop to bronze II.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-12-27T17:06:03.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I told my bronze 1 friend.

With that in mind, play ranked to practice if you want, or don't and just wait two weeks or so.\n\nAlthough, if you ask me, I'd wait until the onrush of morons and players that got reset too low passes through before touching ranked. Give it a solid month before doing it so you aren't swept up in it all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2017-12-26T23:38:39.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For practice if you want to, though if you feel the game is getting a bit too serious or not fun enough play normal matches for a while. Learn a bit, pick up new strategies and enjoy yourself until the season starts.","replies":[]}]}
