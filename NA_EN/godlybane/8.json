(tank assasin basically)\n\nEDIT: Holy shit this build is awesome, totally recommend new aatrox build for sure mhm mhm","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-06-30T02:16:16.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what's the combo?\n\nUlt + E -> Auto -> Q -> Auto -> W -> Q -> Auto -> Q - > Auto?","replies":[{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2018-06-30T14:23:10.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But so make sure u have your passive up if you want to do a propper one shot","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodlyBane","date":"2018-06-30T02:55:21.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes pricesly 5000 damage lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-06-30T02:33:12.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"interesting.... {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]}
