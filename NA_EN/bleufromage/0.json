Ive been honored in almost every one of those 20 games and I haven't received a key fragment at all. Riot says that loot system is working as intended despite error message. That doesn't seem to ring true for me. IDK ive never got very many key fragments at all, but I also dont seem to get as many S grades as I have been lately.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-13T18:00:20.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've been getting a steady flow of fragments over the last few weeks, but the drop reduces each time you get some.  You have a limit to 12, until it resets about ~28 days.  You'll keep getting more fragments at a slower rate, until that refresh occurs for you.
