Plus, when we are a challenger (the opponent of the enemy team), we are seen as red/purple name/healthbar to them. But Dauntless just sounds cooler. All challengers are not winners and Dauntless is more imposing.

I also like the hairfix.jpg =D\n\nThey drew the headpiece before they drew her eyes though, because her eyes are spaced a little too apart. You can see it in the picture I commented with to FantasyDreamer. I had to move her left eye closer. \n\nWhat I disliked most was her eyebrows. Though fierce, it didn't seem....\"Ahri\"-like to me. So although it is slightly unnoticeable, I lengthened and softened her eyebrows as well (smallheadpiece.jpg).

It shows that part of her blood, since after all she feeds on the essence of men to stabilize her human form.\n\nI'm not 100% fond of the hairfix.jpg because if you think about it, her ult lets her dash around the map and well you wouldn't want your hair possibly clouding your vision.  Again I thoroughly enjoy the peekingeyeahri.jpg because it gives a feel of power still while not messing with her eyes and covering up the area of her forehead.","replies":[{"poster":"IRawrAtYou","date":"2015-01-14T09:36:21.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I love her eyes!
