The number of stacks he has will determine the percentage of bonus AP he receives. \n\nThis will fix two things. \n\nHe will be significantly weaker early game because he will not have high AP totals (compared to other champions of the same level with the same amount of gold invested in AP), so a small percentage, or even a larger percentage will not amount to much. Later in the game his AP totals from items, runes, masteries, buffs, .. and so on, will be higher so his accumulated stacks will grant a stronger percentage, allowing him to scale up to the monster he is now. \n\nThe other thing this will fix is the issue of Veigar building very low amounts of AP, and still being an AP monster by simply being an annoying little shit. He will need to build AP items so the higher percentage of bonus AP will amount to something. \n\nIf there is any concern for this making his early game too much weaker he can start with a decently high percentage with a low number of stacks, and the percentage increases more slowly or with a larger number of stacks needed to reach the next tier. \n\nFor example, \n\n5 Stacks = +20% bonus AP\n10 Stacks = +35% bonus AP\n20 stacks = +48% bonus AP\n35 Stacks = +55% bonus AP\n45 Stacks = +60% bonus AP\nXX Stacks = +XX% bonus AP\n\nThese are not intended to be balanced numbers, but they are meant to describe what I mean. \n\nNotice how the number of stacks needed to reach the next Tier increases, but the bonus granted by reaching the next Tier decreases.","replies":[{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-13T17:05:44.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i find the current stacking very fine, i find the stun to be a problem though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-08-13T12:05:22.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That range increase got revert fyi","replies":[{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-13T12:06:16.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-08-13T12:08:01.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh in answer to your question I love Veigar right now because he is broken AF but no one plays him.","replies":[{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-13T12:12:19.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broken ? i really dont see how, i only play veigar and really cant find that broken part ?","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-08-13T12:17:39.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because his laning phase is super safe, his Q can hit 2 targets, His W is aoe, his E is an AOE stun that stops dashes and all of his scalings are off the charts.  On top of that now he can actually bully his lane opponent instead of just farming like he had to before because he now gets AP for hurting people.","replies":[{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-13T12:25:39.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think his laning phase is safe, one mistake and you are dead, what is your rank divison ? \n\nHis scalings are rather normal i would say, the stacking is what makes him strong late. the stun is unreliable. good luck hitting w without cc :)\n\nBesides, there is no keystone that fits him really well,","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-08-13T13:03:32.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His laning phase is super safe.  He can't be ganked so long as he doesn't use E aggressively, He can farm and poke from pretty good range with Q after a few levels, If you push his wave under turret he can quickly clear it with W.\n\nHe has a 100% AP scaling on an AOE basic ability?  That is pretty ridiculous.  Since the Nunu Q changes he is (as far as I am aware) the only champ in LoL who has 2 scalings at 100% or higher.  His Q can hit 2 targets with a 60% ap scaling, which is pretty decent and on par with other Mid lane mages.  you really don't need kill pressure during the laning phase pre 6.  After that it is just a matter of stunning someone and they are dead.  \n\nHe can't be shoved in after 1 ap item, as in like, part of a full item.  Give me a fiendish codex and you aren't gonna shove me under turret.  You can't gank me because I throw up a stun field and walk away, you can't outscale me, if you get even a bit low one stun means death at rank 6.  If you are getting ganked I walk up and throw a stun field around you.  i don't even have to stun you, you are stuck in one place for 2 seconds regardless.  As those 2 seconds are about to end I W the edge near your turret meaning you have to walk around it in a circle buying even more time.  There is no way you are getting out w/o blowing a summoner spell.\n\nAs for keystone you obviously want thunderlords.  You can pick up that lovely 5% bonus CDR.  I can't easily pop it during laning phase true, but I don't need to.  I want to save it for when I go for a kill to get that extra burst.  Stun>Q>W>delay>Ult the trick is waiting to ult until the travel time of the ult means it will hit after W for maximum damage.  That is the main reason Veigar's can't burst people down early these days, they ult before W hits like you used to.\n\nThere really isn't any mage or assassin who has kill pressure on Veigar simply because Veigar can easily freeze by his turret and line his E up on himself if you have a blink/dash  to kill you under turret.","replies":[{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-13T17:05:01.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, you are in silver 3, a LOT of mistakes are made there.  \n\n now just imagine that someone that knows veigar is playing against you. \n\nMaybe they know how to deal with the stun instead of walking straight into it ? \n\nimagine you get ganked and are engagede from two side and you are in middle of the lane because the other player froze it ? Veigar does absolutley not have a safe laning phase.  \n\nAnd for the mastery, i use thunderlords myself, because its the only thing i feel makes sense, and a keystone that only works with either hitting an aa or ult is not really what i would call optimal.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-08-14T01:57:38.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly don't feel like someone should be freezing a Veigar out.  Veigar Q is on a short cd and can easily be used to only last hit.  even a properly placed W can be done to only hit one minion although that is pretty mana hefty.\n\nAfter one item you can't even freeze by turret because Veigar only has to walk out long enough to throw a W over the enemy minion wave and force his wave under the enemy turret, causing it to bounce back at him.\n\nVeigar can easily freeze the wave on his side too.\n\nI definitely agree that as you rise in rankings one massive difference is that people know how to counter champions, hence why Nasus becomes worse and worse as you rise.  However I honestly think that with proper warding you really should be getting in a position you can't just E out of.  The stun area is so big he can just throw it up and walk off.  The thing about E is that you don't have to stun someone to escape.  You just need to put it in their way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-13T17:13:16.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and the aoe with 100% scaling, yes its there for a reason as he only has 3 dmg spells :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-08-13T12:44:42.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Besides, there is no keystone that fits him really well,\n\nBond of stone obviously.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-13T12:07:43.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know but thank you :)\n\nThing is i find him too easy to kill atm.","replies":[{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-08-13T12:45:47.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The range increase does let him play a bit safer so he should die a bit less.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fuh Queue","date":"2016-08-22T18:04:29.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a little short of being OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-08-13T12:10:58.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weak lane, kills you at 6 if you r not careful, amazing lategame.\n\nStrong vs divers and skirmishes in teamfights.

Yes hard to land, but once you DO land it, you get a full rotation off on your opponent.  If they aren't dead, then its pre-lvl 6, or you're significantly losing already...\n\nI just posted this elsewhere, but yesterday I played a game where I was {{champion:43}} vs {{champion:45}}.  I had my E activated, I had {{item:3001}} and I was full hp.  He was 3/1.  He threw down his E (missed), and then Q, R'd me and I died.  With my shield and Abyssal AND full hp.  And we were both lvl 8.  My point here is he doesnt even need his wall half the time, but when he does land it, it's a garanteed kill.\n\nVeigar needs... I don't wanna say a nerf, but he needs a rework.  He does so much f*cking damage right now.  Why can't they make his Q the way it was?  Last hitting.  Instead, all he has to do now is poke me with it and he gets the scaling.  Another thing, if his ult scales with missing hp, then why does he kill the remaining 65% of my hp with his ult alone?  There is something that needs a rework with Veigar.  I know I'm bronze and my opinion to you probably doesn't matter, but I take a lot of consideration with this.  \n\nPros don't use him for a reason, so there is some aspect of him that is entirely weak.  I imagine the mobility meta of the game atm is what drives pros away from him, but it can't just be that or they wouldn't play Victor either.  I know I don't understand everything, but I understand this: getting 2-shot at lvl 8 at full health with a shield and MR using Veigar Q (bringing me to 70-65%) and finishing with ult.  He wasn't that fed, should not happen at all.\n\nEDIT:\nBy the way, I mistakenly took tank runes to that fight, so I had that small bonus as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-14T14:41:48.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think about the +2 ap kill bonus? complete bs if you ask me, his weakness is really not in the stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"mak87","date":"2016-08-16T05:54:05.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would say a buff to the stun and thats it,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Penta Ace","date":"2016-08-16T02:16:14.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you saying he should be nerfed or buffed.
