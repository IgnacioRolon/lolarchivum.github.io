I logged in to my account after a very long time and I felt like I need to change the email. However after typing the new email and my password it tells me to verify the passcode but I think they are sending the passcode to my old email because I am not receiving the passcode on the new email. Is there something I can do to change my email because I lost my old email.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-05T23:34:52.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, we can help!
