As far as I can see the first group stage game is on Oct 5. Does that mean there is a less than 24 hour window to self mystery gift with the current triple bonus that is active from the pentakill and baron steal during play in stage games?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T02:41:53.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe these stages are based on the sections of Worlds. For instance, we're in the [**Play in Groups stage**](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/worlds/world_championship_2017/schedule/play_in_groups/Day%202) which should last until Sept 26.
