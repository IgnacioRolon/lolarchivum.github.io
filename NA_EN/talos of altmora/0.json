Taric","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","embed":{"description":"Targon has been through quite a bit of change recently. These changes have been controversial to say the least. It seems that there is a pretty even split of opinion between those who like the new targon, those who hate the new Targon (myself included.)","url":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/IEw4TrBF-my-problems-with-targon?comment=000400000000000100000000000000000000000000000000","image":"http://imgur.com/FHh3beZs.jpg"},"up_votes":12,"down_votes":6,"body":"This is an expansion of my arguments on that link on everyone&#039;s favorite, outrageously beautiful man named Taric. Let me be absolutely clear that I hate new Targon, so that may or may not cloud my judgements on him, but I will try to be fair here. \r\n\r\nSo, Taric was once a high-ranking Demacian who viewed himself as a protector, but he viewed the protection of all life as his duty. Now, I can admire him for that, but then the his lore says that this trait made him abandon military drills and such for things like a magical beasts and a bard&#039;s song. While in my original post I accidently read it as he literally abandoned his comrades, ( my mistake, I will be sure to correct that)  but that still shows a rather remarkable laxity for a Demaican (For those not in the know, Demacia used to require mandatory military service and used to indoctrinate it&#039;s warriors in it&#039;s moral superiority, but if Taric can goof off like that, then they&#039;re standards must of dropped.) Now, given that Taric has proven himself to have some form of ADD you&#039;d think he&#039;d never get that high a rank that he was implied to have. Turns out that Garen was one of his friends that kept him in a high position, and because of Taric&#039;s screwed priorities, even Garen couldn&#039;t save him from being demoted.\r\n\r\nSo, he was sent with a bunch of new recruits to an out-of-the-way fortress. After a few days, Taric decided that everything was fine, he went off to look at the ruins for a day. He sent all of his men to rest (they never give us a number, so we have to assume there was enough of them to properly defend the fort without being a drain on resources, so I&#039;d wager around 10-20men? I&#039;m not exactly an expert on this) When he gets back, he finds them slaughtered to the last man. What really annoys me was that they say the void creatures did his to them while they slept. (This raises many questions on it&#039;s own, but my biggest problem is that the void creatures we know of tend to be very big and very loud, so unless {{champion:121}} or another member of his species was responsible, they should have noticed something instead of continuing to sleep.)\r\n\r\nSo it&#039;s here when he was sent to Mount Targon as a punishment (apparently Targon s a dumping ground for those who fail Demacia) he climbs and is faced with Illusions of the world of Runeterra and all sorts of horrible fates that could befall the world and the things he loves. After he faces these trials, he meets the Aspect of the Protector, apparently he was responsible for bringing him to this point. (And by implication, the death of everyone at the fort Taric was garrisoned at.) He aspects and he is given the power of the Power of the protector. Now, he fights the void! (as I&#039;ve said in my original post, {{champion:38}}  who?)\r\n\r\nSo, If we cut to the meat of it, Taric&#039;s backstory is Galio&#039;s with more details. A noble stalwart protector (although in Taric&#039;s case, he abandons his duty to goof off while Galio would never do that,) who failed once and seeks atonement. (See Headbiter&#039;s post there for the finer problems) So, while I like this new Taric, I feel that the aspect he has in him is possibly the stupidest person in the entire League of legends universe. One, he picked possibly the worst person for the job, a  man who has proven himself to be very incompetent in his duty. While he certainly is strong, he&#039;s lacking in the brains department. Two, to groom him into his ~~Flesh Coat~~ avatar, he is implied to have ruined Taric&#039;s life and is implied to have killed his men. (And given that the aspects have done this before, he&#039;s probably done this hundreds of times, meaning he was a pretty high body count on him.)  Some protector!\r\n\r\nSo, there is my thoughts on New Taric&#039;s lore. Please tell me your thoughts and upvote. if you don&#039;t like either of my post, feel free to down vote and post your problems in the comments. I look forward in seeing what you have to say.","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2016-04-07T14:11:01.826+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Working back more from the end of the post first to discuss the wider lore issues:\n\n-Similarities to Galio's original lore begin and end with \"Demacian protector who has failed their mission\"\n\nI would just as soon complain that Zilean, or heck, even Urgot share similar plot points of grief/restoring honor. It's not like it's a common enough thread for me to bat an eye at personally and there's plenty of room to work around that single similarity. The events leading up to and following that point and the way each character contributed and reacts to them are completely different. Galio's story there is that of a loyal soldier who falls into despair at his own powerlessness. Taric's is that of a rebellious outcast whose friction with the system eventually causes him to make a grave error. \n\n-I agree it is awkward now that Targon is the prominent gate between this plane and the void and mention of long-standing void related folks like Kassadin and Shurima in general has fallen to the wayside.\n\nThis might be made less of a neck-wrenching change if we're simply looking at the Targon/void conflict as another frontier of a global war with the void that seems to be creeping more prominently into rewritten lore, but it seems to shave away from the importance of Shurima as THE major location of void conflict and that whole section of lore continues to be left in the lurch.\n\n-Reading and rereading what little is given to us about \"The Protector,\" I have to judge that you have a lot of misconceptions.\n\nThere's nothing that implies he actually guided Taric to the mountain itself. It could be guessed that the aspects of Targon supply whatever trials await those once they come to the mountain, though this is also speculation on my part. I think a greater theme of Targon is that it tends to confront those who have already displayed their willpower and character instead of necessarily grooming the host.\n\nAs for the worthiness of Taric to wear the mantle of the protector, I don't think the majority of his lore highlights his incompetence in that role. His dereliction of duty at his final outpost with Demacia represents Taric at the lowest point in his life, I would say. He gets by with his actions in Demacian service previously precisely because he is something of a battle prodigy who is in fact better serving his goals as a protector by playing loose with the rules of Demacia, and as long as he continues to serve them well it's a waste to throw away that talent completely. His final mistake might be seen as a result of growing resentment and arrogance in him after years that cause him to lose sight of his most important duty, swiftly tempered by the consequences. It's not as though his actions in that case were completely unreasonable, as neither his superiors or Taric could have expected the Void Inquisition, but the fact that he was basically tasked with guarding the helpless and gave anything less than complete diligence to this task would be the sticking point for Taric's own code.","replies":[{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2016-04-07T14:38:15.572+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"of the mantle that he had unknowingly been preparing for with every decision that brought him to the top of the mountain.\" The wording implies that The Protector has been leading him to this point in his life, Also, I have read the other lores and my original post that I have linked on this page, The Aspects DO change the people they inhabit. Some like the Protect groom their champions, other just shove themselves ~~up there asses~~ into their very being, changing them so the aspect feels more at home or something, and With Pantheon, He'll just eject the soul from the body and take it for itself. \n\nI actually like that he tries to make up for his mistakes, but that angle is dropped when the aspect gets into him. He is now vindicated. In the next part of the story, he tries to stop Demacia and Noxus from staring a battle not to stop the loss of human life, but because a single flower that is one of a kind is there and needs to be protected. The Implication I get is that he would gladly let these people die, as long as that flower is safe. Whuch I don't know if it's him or the aspect that I have a problem with.\n\nAs for the void, it's been heavily implied that something in the void needs Malzy to bring the worlds closer together for the kind of void invasions they are dealing with now. Malzy and Kassadin both look stupid, Malzy not noticing his apocalyptic wet-dream coming true in Targon, and Kassadin and the Preservers of Valoran seem to be wilding their thumbs and doing nothing.  \n\nI see your point about Galio and Taric, but I am comparing them because they have a similar origin point, a similar goal, and a similar concept of redemption. I admit it is a simplification, but it still works. Galio ultimately comes across as a better person because he will make sure none will die under his watch again, Taric comes across as beyond humanity, willing to protect us, but becoming similar to bard in that he will only do it if it will serve the greater good. again, at least that's as far as I can tell, and if you have any information, please put it in your reply.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-04-07T15:48:08.736+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talos of Altmora,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mT8EJYUF,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-04-07T14:38:15.572+0000)\n>\n> \"of the mantle that he had unknowingly been preparing for with every decision that brought him to the top of the mountain.\" The wording implies that The Protector has been leading him to this point in his life, Also, I have read the other lores and my original post that I have linked on this page, The Aspects DO change the people they inhabit.

The Aspect tested him once it sensed Taric's potential. Most people climbing Targon are killed outright by such mundane things as hypothermia, altitude sickness and exposure. Taric was worth testing, and, showing just how determined and honorable he is, passed that test.\n\nFor example, being told to climb Targon by Demacia's main authority is an expression, something that means \"leave Demacia and die outside its walls.\" It's a banishment. Virtually no-one actually goes there once they've been given the punishment, they go find somewhere they can live out their days under the ignominy of being an outcast. Demacia sees itself very highly, so the idea of no longer being able to live as a Demacian is a terrible punishment. However, Taric, so guilt-ridden for what happened, wants to prove his honor by keeping his word in a very literal way: he will climb Targon, though it will almost certainly kill him in doing so. He does this to prove he is worthy of his oath, and to honor those who fell because of him. In other words, his choice leads him physically and emotionally where he is when he meets the Protector, the Protector didn't make him do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2016-04-07T16:07:16.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, well said. I am sorry about the confusion, but may I suggest rewording it then?

I mean, the aspects in the lore have not exactly made themselves seem very... good. I mean, new!Pantheon took over Aterus's body, Linda (again, see the other thread) had her \"KILL THE HERETIC!\" stance changed when she got the aspect shoved into her. so please pardon my confusion regarding that.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the aspects seem to be untrustworthy, and that gives credence to my pet theory that the aspect arranged for all of this to happen.

I think that's an OK connotation to have. If you believe that Targon takes the agency away from everyone, then I understand why you would interpret it the way you did. I'd just ask you let the story play out. Some of the characters have a long way to go yet and we don't want to write the entirety of their arc in their introduction.\n\nLeona's stance changed when she realized that her teachings (some might say indoctrination) weren't as valid as she once thought. Her more violent approach earlier was a moment that shows someone who has lost her way because of how she has been taught to see the world around her.\n\nHer change allowed her to see things clearly, from a different perspective, essentially empowering her to see the truth of what mattered to her. One might say it allowed her to see the world much as she did when she spared someone she shouldn't have, which was the moment that set her toward being imbued with that power. Instead of this making all the Aspects seem untrustworthy, I personally think Leona (as well as Taric) is an example of an an Aspect being very keyed into the truth of who they are, even if Leona had lost her way, as she realizes when she needs to see Diana.\n\nAs with Diana and Pantheon, Leona is beginning her journey and we've included personality elements from the original take on her, though some of those characteristics are meant to come to the forefront overtime. They're hinted at in the piece at times rather than explicitly stated (because we want to spend time developing her character). I know you found that unsatisfying, and I'm sorry that's the case. Hopefully you will see more of what you envision Leona to be in the stories that continue after we've now set the new stage.\n\nI have read through all of the other thread and I think the discussion is very interesting, though it's a shame that things got as heated and personal as they did. I would just say that the main way we have moved from our old style of character and storytelling is that we don't want to completely sum up the totalilty of a character in one hit. In the introductory text, we want to show who they are at whatever point of the journey they are on right now, how they got to the present, show them in 'action' in the present,  and hint toward possibilities for them in the future. We then want to pay off those possibilities in stories.\n\nWe had a bad problem with setting things up and never paying them off, so I absolutely understand a mistrust that things will pay off or that you should look beyond anything but the introductory text for the Champ. It's our job, and by that I mean Narrative, the Product Teams we work on, and Riot's in general, to get more story to you to show what that looks like and earn the trust to move forward.\n\nAnd yeah, Atreus's story isn't done either.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-04-07T17:35:13.854+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"if Atreus' story isn't done either, why did you type\n>'The Pantheon Aspect had obliterated his personality, memories and emotions.

Which makes sense, because its purpose is to inform the audience what the champion Pantheon in LoL is.  \n\nThere is a time and a place to put creative uses of an unreliable narrator.  But, I would argue, the general introduction to a character in a fighting game is probably not that place.  Now, maybe if the writer of said introduction is some fantastic literary genius, they could maybe pull that off.  But, not seeing the finished product here, what we've so far got is a list of seeming facts and then an outside promise that at least one thing in the list of said facts is wrong.

I love Ionia, Demacia, Noxus, Bandle City, Zaun, Piltover and nearly everywhere else. Now, I am worried for them. Are you going to make Vi and Caityn corrupt cops?

Now that I now share a similar experience with them, I can see their point. When Targon's lore event was first announced, I was excited. I thought you were going to set up a _Burning Tides_ Type of story were you built upon the past lore, but instead, we have a setting that barely has any similarities with the old. You say Linda would become more inline with the old one over time. Well, the old Leona is, as I have said, as moral and compassionate as Braum and Soraka. This new one is nowhere near that level.  Having a magical space-parasite shoved into her does not make me think she is getting anywhere close to the same nobleness Leona once had.\n\nHeck, the first thing I did after I read the old lore is ask for a refund. I didn't have any refund credits, but I had to do something, I tried to do literally anything but delete them, but ultimately resulted in me deleting Pantheon from my account, and swearing never to play Diana and Leona (because I have skins for them, so they are not worth deleting). Seriously, during that pod-cast that you linked, the writers said that reading the lore should make we want to play these champions.

Diana was my favorite character in this game. her story really resonated with me on a personal level, since like her i grew up surrounded by people who believed very differently from me and would treat me horribly if i ever said what i believed. i grew up having to hide a part of myself and was betrayed by someone in my own family who i thought i could trust. when i read her lore it brought me to tears. her pain, her anger, i knew very well. When i got to the part in her lore where she lashed out and killed elders, it was liberating in a way. even though i would never do something like that myself, i could painfully understand the urge to fight back against the people who are hurting you. when she killed the elders it was justified, but she killed them out of pure hatred and let that hate control her even after those who had wronged her were gone becoming the very thing she hated. it's a very tragic yet beautiful story especially for those like me that share similar circumstances. her new story lacks the heart of her original lore and removed alot of what made her relatable. you took away her agency with the addition of the aspects, you took away her frustation and pain, the essence of what made her the \"scorn\" of the moon. even worse was that there was no reason to do so. her old lore and character could have easily been written into this new story. i was very upset when you took the character i loved from me, but i guess it's already been done.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2016-04-07T18:10:12.597+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But, the Aspects do take agency away from people.

That's where I first heard the evolution not revolution line.

Because I was thinking about the lores again, and it seemed odd that Atreus had to duel Leona (which sort of implied they were roughly the same age, since if she had to fight a child that she couldn't beat him is hilarious, and kind of awesome). But, then she goes off to live with the Solari and manages to become the leader of the Ra-Horak while Atreus is still in the Rakkor equivalent of the agoge.  Just guessing that the warrior rites are finished somewhere between ages 16-20, that would mean Leona either was much older than Atreus, or she skyrocketed up to become the leaders of the warrior-band when she was still in her teens to early twenties.\n\nThank you, for your help.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-04-07T17:52:53.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mT8EJYUF,comment-id=00010000000000020000,timestamp=2016-04-07T16:44:01.688+0000)\n>\n> **And yeah, Atreus's story isn't done either.**\n\nDamn well better not be.

Atreus shoves Pantheon out of his body completely, gives all the celestial Targonians the finger, for being a bunch of enslaving assholes,  tells them to take their civil war and problems with Sol off Runeterra where it has no business, and continues being a normal badass for the Rakkor like he was before the whole celestial space empire business suddenly got shoved into his lore.\n\nAlso, there is a definite kill the heretic vibe in Leona's lore.  \n\nFrom the lore:\n\n\"Presented to the elders, Diana spoke of the Lunari, an ancient and proscribed faith that venerated the moon, and how all the truths the Solari clung to were incomplete. She described a realm beyond the mountaintop, a place where the sun and moon were not enemies, where new truths could show them fresh ways to look at the world. Leona felt her anger build with every word Diana spoke, and when the elders rejected her words and named her a blasphemer, Leona knew it would be her blade that ended the heretic’s life. \"\n\nThat's before Diana kills anyone.

As you say, it seems odd for a protector to arrange for slaughter, much less by the very void creatures it is attempting to keep at bay, as a means to test their potential host. Given no direct evidence towards that I wouldn't reach to that conclusion.\n\nI recognize that the aspects do change their hosts in some manner, Pantheon's possession being the most extreme whereas Taric's enlightenment probably being much less so, but this seems to only be granted to the host after they've already directed their own wills to the aspect's goals.\n\nEdit: Took so long to formulate my answer I got sniped by a red. Oh well.\n\nI don't think Taric is vindicated of his past failures. Looking at the comic preview, it seems clear that he never believes he can fully atone.

All those sons, all those fathers, all those futures lost.

Taric probably isn't as detached from mortal morality as a character like Bard. I imagine if the same choice was between letting soldiers slaughter an uninvolved civilian over a flower that is the last of its kind he would probably still save that civilian.\n\nAs for whether Galio or Taric are better persons for what they value, that's a fierce debate on morality to be had. Galio is absolutely loyal to his people. He would kill any number of Noxians to save a Demacian soldier, or otherwise uphold the ideals of Demacia and insure the future safety of the nation. Taric's moral choices are complicated by the fact that he isn't likely to weigh the life of a Demcian over that of a Noxian in a vacuum. He won't choose to condemn one for the sake of the other unless that one shows greater worth towards the fate of the world, perhaps. Given that we're trending away from \"scary evil Noxians, raar!\" it's not that simple of a choice for him.\n\nThat's my view of it, at least.","replies":[{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2016-04-07T16:24:56.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, here's the thing about words, someone could take away one message, and someone else can take away another.
