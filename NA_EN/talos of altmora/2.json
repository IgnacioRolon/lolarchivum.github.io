Though once a notorious adventurer, he had chosen to live anonymously and raise a family among the nomad tribes of Shurima&mdash;until the day his daughter was claimed by the Void. Kassadin vowed to bring her back, combining a number of arcane artifacts and forbidden technologies for the struggle ahead. His precautions were not enough, however, and these devices now only serve to slow the insidious corruption that ravages his body... but he will gladly pay that price, if only he can save her... \r\n\r\nThis is Kassadin&#039;s current Bio according to the League of legends Wiki. The old one is found [here.](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kassadin)\r\n\r\nI have a few problems with this new one. Yes, it is a bio, but remember that so was Varus&#039;s. In fact, it bares a good resemblance to Varus&#039;s old lore. \r\n\r\nMy main problem is that Kassasin&#039;s void corruption was never portrayed to be similar to Varus&#039;s or Malzy&#039;s. In the Original lore, He found Icathia by himself, willingly seeking it out. He saw the void with all it&#039;s wonders and horrors... and came out a changed man. The Void didn&#039;t drive him insane as it did Malz, but his body was altered. It wasn&#039;t slowly killing him, the void had changed him. He used his knowledge to gather powerful allies and basically went around sealing void rifts with his Protectors of Valoran.\r\n\r\nHis daughter had her first mention in a Joj Article (I can&#039;t find the exact issue) where Malzy sacrificed her to the void. It was in Zaun, of all places and Kassadin tried to stop Malzy (Also interesting to note that Malz thought that Kass was here to join up with him and was confused that he was being so intrusive to stop a human sacrifice.) Kassadin... didn&#039;t exactly win, and caused a massive power outage in zaun (and since it was portrayed as a place where everyone was a mad scientist in those days. They really didn&#039;t care about the cult and tried to have Kass arrested.)\r\n\r\nI really like this, as Kassadin had been mostly successful up to that point. It&#039;s his biggest failure, and I really liked that about the incident. Kass has his organization and his powers, but it wasn&#039;t enough to save his daughter. it reminds me of the classic _I let Gwen Stacy Die_ comic.\r\n\r\nIf I was writing the new lore, I would keep things sort of the same, but expand on it. Kass would be introduced after his transformation, and his colour story would be arguing with his family. He would then leave and never interfere in their lives for years.\r\n\r\nThen, i would do an event in either Zaun or Shurima (Personally, given all the apparatuses on him I would put him in Zaun) where his daughter is kidnapped but the Void cult and Kass rushes to save her. It would suck in Taliyah/Ekko (as they would be friends with his daughter) and other characters. Kassadin would confront Malz... too late, as his Daughter would be sent into the void. She would come back in some form... as a void-creature in an epilodge\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at Kass&#039;s current bio.... he seems like he got a bit of a lore nerf. His story is way to similar to Varus (old varus anyways.) I don&#039;t know, it just seems weaker in comparison to his old Bio. Guess that Second Paragraph is important.\r\n\r\nAnyways, what do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2017-12-07T19:39:56.785+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Void =/= darkin.\n\nMore, I cannot say...","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2017-12-07T23:55:58.554+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do the Darkin originate in Runeterra, a dimension, or another planet?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2017-12-09T00:54:47.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now, there's a question.","replies":[{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2017-12-11T02:19:34.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And your not going to give it.

Kassadin was not this, he was an explorer whose main motive was stopping the void and closing rifts. His daughter was  collateral damage, and while he still harboured hope he will save her one day, he looked at greater things than just personal vendetta. He was motivated by saving the world, not his daughter.\n\nThat new bio cannot replace Varus, as his family cannot be saved, they're dead for good. Old Kassadin fights for the greater good, while old Varus doesn't care about the world, and the corruption he's freeing. He also willingly chose corruption, while Kass was simply altered by the void on accident.\n\nI liked both of these characters just the way they were, I don't see any logic for these kinds of changes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-12-08T11:20:15.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If this ends up to steal the old Varus struggle then I'm going to be terribly pissed because you (as Riot) arbitrary destroyed a beloved character in order to expand another while both could coexist (or you coudl drop the LGBT on Kassadin but again, it looks like Varus lost the coin flip).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-12-06T23:04:01.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Overall I understand your reasoning here.\nKassadin being an adventurer who sought out the void and was then horrified by what he found has definetly an eldritch vibe to it.\n\nHowever,it also means that essentially a random adventurer ventured into the void and somehow managed to survive because reasons.\nSo him going into the void prepared,makes more sense(and tbh,it doesn't say how his daughter got claimed by it,they might have stumbled upon a void rift on an adventure).\n\nI'm also ok with him not having his allies,because lets face it,we never met any of these guys in the old lore,so it would make sense for kassadin to start without them in the new lore,it'd be more interesting to see him recruit them over time.","replies":[{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2017-12-06T23:09:34.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
