{"poster":"Talos of Altmora","date":"2017-12-07T15:40:21.576+0000","title":"Jax's Lamppost","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":62,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Unmatched in both his skill with unique armaments and his biting sarcasm, Jax is the last known weapons master of Icathia. After his homeland was laid low by its own hubris in unleashing the Void, Jax and his kind vowed to protect what little remained. As magic now rises in the world, this slumbering threat stirs once more, and Jax roams Valoran, wielding the last light of Icathia and testing all warriors he meets to see if any are strong enough to stand beside him... \r\n\r\nSo, I really like Jax's new color story and his bio, but something different that I ave to notice is the name of Jax's lamppost. Or rather \"the Last Light of Icathia.\" In the Original Lore, Jax was, somehow, the so OP that whatever team he was on won. So the League banned hm from using weapons. Jax, being a badass, picks up a lamppost and uses that instead.\r\n\r\nNow, the whole lamppost thing isn't that important, but I really, really like it. So I really hope that Jax just picked it up back in Icathian. Something like \"Jax refuses to give his enemies the honor of dying to an actual weapon.\" Jax has been and always will be a bit of a narrsisits. Not like Draven or Sol, but more laid back and self-confident. Persoanlly, the fact that he an fight with a lamppost, something that by all rights shouldn't be used as a weapon, shows his natural skill with weapons, a sense of humor, and a little sense of honor. \r\n\r\nWhile I will admit it can be a special weapon, it's not really THAT important to Jax's character. I think it helps to inform us about his personality a little more.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I really like his lore direction. He keeps his old personality, has a goal and fits into the new lore better than other champions who have had their lores revitalized. Kudos to whoever wrote it. You've kept the sprirt of Jax while also making him to fit in better. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think, should the Last Light of Icathia be a special weapon? Or Jax giving himself a 'handicap'?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2017-12-07T19:36:01.677+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad someone noticed this... :-P\n\nIt's not an item called the Last Light of Icathia.

Varus is now two people and a darkin instead of one person and a darkin\n2. Noxus did not kill Varus's entire family anymore\n3. Varus is the name of the darkin now instead of the man using the darkin\n4. The darkin now vies for control with the two men, but instead of being a progression of the darkin getting more influence over time, it now is a coin toss on whether it is in control\n5. The entire point of old Varus was seeking vengeance on his dead family, now it's... overcome the darkin because... romance and goodness? \n6. The idea of reshaping the lore of a character that no one asked to be changed- and how hastily it appears to have been written- seemed less like a lore change and more of an attempt to appease an LGBT crowd than to increase player enjoyment of the lore.\n7. Despite most of the \"developed\" nations having no negative attitude towards gay marriage, a vast portion of the playerbase lives in countries where the practice is either heavily repulsed or just straight out illegal. This effectively alienated a large part of their playerbase\n\nNow, if you do not care about gay marriage, there are still 5 valid points why the new Varus lore is both different and a downgrade.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-12-08T03:19:42.530+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"technically originally he wasn't originally a darkin, he was just a corrupted human.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2017-12-08T20:49:39.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"PixelPicksTW","date":"2017-12-08T23:37:24.796+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RookPusher,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LjrmNVQb,comment-id=00010002000000000000000000000000000000010001,timestamp=2017-12-08T20:49:39.455+0000)\n> And, as for &quot;It was the guy, now it&#x27;s the Darkin&quot; they&#x27;re just bringing him in line with the overall Darkin priority.

So what people are attempting to convince me of is that you really wanted Varus to be a human, not a Darkin.\n\nMany of us (those who dislike the new lore) do not care about whether the Darkin is in control or not. The point is that the narrative was hastily written for a story that, while some may have wanted it redone, was not needed to be changed. A simple rewording to confirm that the temple corruption was caused by Darkin would have sufficed. Instead, Riot went through a whole ordeal of changing the fundamentals of the character (namely the fact that his entire point was slaughtering people to avenge his dead family, and now is trying to overcome a demon weapon instead).\n My point is, in response to you saying the new lore is the same, it by far is not.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-12-07T17:38:50.147+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RookPusher,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=LjrmNVQb,comment-id=000100020000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-07T17:16:54.449+0000)\n>\n> modifications. \n\nYou said it was only getting filled in, now you're admitting there were modifications.","replies":[{"poster":"RookPusher","date":"2017-12-07T20:13:08.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"And you admit to being pedantic.
