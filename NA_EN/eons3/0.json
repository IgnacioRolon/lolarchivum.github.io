Its not about \"ego\" or \"delusions\" or any of that mess. Its about \"Distrust\". Every guide you read, every place you go to tell you not to \"trust\" your teammates. This comes down to people simply not trusting people to do things properly. For example, and i am guity of this myself, mid lane not trusting the jungler to properly gank their lane without giving up a free kill because they have seen it enough times to take the risk of not having them gank. It doesn't really matter that one jg may be worlds apart from the other but the distrust is already there and guides and sites are certainly not helping in that regard as well.\n\nThis is just basic human nature though, you aren't going to trust random strangers with your own success(in this case elo).","replies":[{"poster":"tehechounpolvazo","date":"2018-12-27T15:28:56.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been playing since S4 and have never seen any reason to trust another player in league until they've proven to be worth it, which is rare in solo q.

My friend calls yasuo perfectly balanced and whenever i come with an argument as to why he objectively is not, he dismisses it. But dear god if i mention some champs with clear as a sky counterplay. Lissandra, syndra, malzahar (he doesnt even cry about his point and click cc), garen, everytankinfuckingexistance and mordekaiser to name a few, he goes APESHIT. He genuinely believes that are broken and unfun. Now he can be right about unfun. But broken? Can you really call (apart mordekaiser and his myriads of bugs) garen BROKEN?  Whenever i tell him the counterplay to the above champs he straight up ignores me and in the event that does attempt to hear me out, he just calls it unfun. In which case he can be right.  The problem with yasuo akali and their kin is that they are mostly unfun to play against.
