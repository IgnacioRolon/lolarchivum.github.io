That's pretty weird! It's possible your configuration file is screwed up. I'd like you to complete a quick reset of this file by deleting the entire folder this file resides in (Config Folder) while you're logged into the client and have it running in the background. Afterwards, you'll want to try hopping in a custom match alone so you can confirm whether the reset worked or not.\n\nPlease let me know if this fixed your problem.","replies":[{"poster":"ProeliatorNike","date":"2017-03-01T02:56:29.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":'( I can not play the league...\n\nIt is the sad time\n\nUpon load screen, frequency out of range is displayed.
