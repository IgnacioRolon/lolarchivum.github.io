I kept restarting and my pings was fine. but when i reconnected the lag was off the charts. I woke up this morning to see if the lag was gone but i started to play a game and boom 30 secs massive lag. walking animation stopped, champs were teleporting all over the map. im the only one using wifi and my pings is in the 100's. Rito wtf. Wut is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T19:12:53.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that you experienced this issue in Champ Select as well as in-game seems to point to an unstable connection.  You need a stable and consistent connection when in the client as well as in-game, and if something interrupts that connection (such as packet loss or a DC) you'll get these types of issues.  More directly, since you said you are using WiFi, keep in mind that this type of connection is inherently unstable.  If it's possible to get off WiFi and use a wired connection, make sure to do so!\n\nOtherwise, make sure to use our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743)!  It'll give you a healthcheck of your connection in your past games, as well as some steps on what you can do in order to improve it.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
