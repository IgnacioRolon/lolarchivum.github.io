It gives me a sort of white box that has the outlines of the match history box but nothing loads inside of it (Can add picture if needed). Never had this happen before and re-logging doesn't seem to fix the issue. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-05T17:56:42.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sometimes happens on the Match History section of the site.
