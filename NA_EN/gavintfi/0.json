Xerath has pretty much a 30% role rate as support, so I didn’t think much of it. The first game, someone says, “I’m not dealing with Xerath supp” and dodges. Great. Next game, nothing happens. Until I get first kill. I have a sivir adc, and they ignite a thresh walking away. This was only about 2-3 minutes into the game, so ignite only did around 70/90 true damage. I saw the thresh had 150hp, and it wouldn’t have killed him, so I q him and he dies. Here’s what follows:\nSivir: ks\nGavinTFI: he wouldn’t have died\nSivir: s7fu\nGavinTFI: lulw\nSo, I continued as normal. We played about 1 minute later when I w’d a group of minions (maybe 5 minions) and sivir says, “I’m done ur garbage xerath fuc kyou”\nHe leaves. Great.\nI ask the enemy team and my team to report him, and to which I get a response by the enemy Olaf saying, “why?” I say, “leaving and toxic” \nEnemy adc says, “report yourself for picking xerath support”\nEnemy support says, “^ lol”\nI say, “report yourself for inting then lul”\nSo, I continue in lane 1v2ing the enemies, getting fed, and carrying. They end up ffing and I got a satisfying victory and a fat report on sivir. \n\nTL;DR: my adc leaves because I play xerath support and carry. I ask if the enemy will report sivir for leaving and they tell me to report myself for playing xerath support\n\nPoint is, why do people hate off meta picks so much? I’ve played xerath support 3 times now; each time getting no less than an s-. My adc leaves and the enemies trash talk me because I choose a very good and viable character. Note: this isn’t high mmr and it’s in draft pick normal. I’m only level 36 (leveled up because of this game). This probably wouldn’t happen in like a diamond game but still, you get my point.

The AP is useful, but its more useful than something like sapp crystal because it gives better sustain overall. Also, like i said, im pretty new, and new to xerath. I only have about 2.5k ms on him, and like i said, ive only played him supp 2 other times. Overall though, taking 4 cs when theres a cannon and 2 melee minions right in front of the sivir that she missed the last hit on isnt gonna make a big difference","replies":[{"poster":"C0l0urless","date":"2019-05-07T21:29:36.038+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are support you should always start with a gold income item, no matter what champion you are playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kattzy","date":"2019-05-11T00:34:11.630+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're new, you might not understand that supports should always take a gold income item first and only take cs while laning under very specific circumstances (last hitting if the minion would otherwise die without being farmed by adc, shoving the wave under enemy tower if your adc is dead or recalled to take away farm from enemies, etc.).

Alot of people will go mage supports and do it poorly, but their argument will be \"well I did more than the adc\". Well yes, because your adc is still going to be the focus target over you, and with you not playing something that keeps him alive, helps peel, or any of that, he's gonna go down pretty free in alot of fights depending on the situation. \n\nIt is just harder to carry as the adc, if your support isn't supporting.
