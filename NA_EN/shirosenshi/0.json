I was playing unranked summoner's rift when i got killed really fast. So fast that I believe that it broke my egg animation. I then respawned as Eggnivia and spent the rest of the game as an egg cruising around. It looked comical and if it was only a visual glitch it would have been fine. I could still cast all of my spells just fine, but the only downside was that I couldn't auto attack at all. I'm not really dissapointed to be honest. I mean there are over a hundred champions so Im sure little bugs show up every once in a while. I just thought I would let you know.\r\n~Shiro","replies":[{"poster":"RussoRed","date":"2015-03-27T14:03:13.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem the other day accept that It happend when i died as the egg timer came off of cooldown it shoed the wite glow eccence but no egg and when i responed i remainded the egg form so i could move kill and attack but when i stoped moving it would start the revive animation over so RITO PLS fix {{champion:34}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"mqtak","date":"2014-12-01T17:08:23.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did it add to your death count?","replies":[]},{"poster":"XShadowAlkX","date":"2014-12-01T02:56:19.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bug with the new smite. For some reason if you smite someone it disables revive passives and ignores invulnerability. In anivias case the smite cancels her passive but she still reverts to an egg after she revives.
