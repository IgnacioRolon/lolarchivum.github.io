In which case there's no functional reason to name the passive at all because there are no other items to theoretically stack the effect off of.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-05-29T20:03:47.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Read what he said again.

That's why generic CDR is usually a unique passive on items, so you can't stack that one item for cost-efficient CDR.\n\nIf you removed the \"Wind's Fury\" name from Runaan's passive, you still wouldn't get more bolts from buying another Runaan's because it's still a unique passive. It would only be an issue if you could get bolts from another item that isn't Runaan's Hurricane, but no other item gives bolts.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-05-29T20:11:27.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're not complaining about the unique part, you're complaining that they gave it a name?

Like you said, it doesn't mess with anything. I even put this thread in Miscellaneous rather than Gameplay because it's not actually an issue.\n\nThe part about adding similar named items down the road is a good hypothesis. Though it just makes me wonder why they made Bloodrazor so weak initially and didn't just name both it and BotRK's passives with the same name. _(I've always assumed Bloodrazor was undertuned specifically so that it wouldn't be absurd when stacked with BotRK, which naming the passive would've fixed just as well.)_","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-05-29T20:11:13.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, I think you may have missed his point a bit. Why is the passive *named*? It could just say \"UNIQUE Passive:\" rather than \"UNIQUE Passive - Icy:\". Fiendish Codex has its 10% CDR on an unnamed unique passive, and stacking more than one of them doesn't get you any more until you upgrade one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Drakylon","date":"2016-05-29T20:14:11.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just flavor text -- same with the additional italicized text under Ionian Boots of Lucidity -- and it also covers the case where upgrades/sidegrades to those items get released.","replies":[]}]}
