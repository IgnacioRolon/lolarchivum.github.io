You'll need to [submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) regarding your issue. A few tips as you submit your request: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n2. Do your best to not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n3. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n4. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. \n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-04T23:22:51.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Brand50, \n\nYou could send in a ticket into Riot Support and they should be able to help figure out this email fiasco! \n\nRiot Support New: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nHope you get everything straightened out. \n\nMy work here is done: http://imgur.com/TnY9DlR \n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
