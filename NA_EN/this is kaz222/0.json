Anguis is a support that controls both allies and enemies to do what he wants.\r\n\r\nAppearances-\r\n\r\n*  Age between 17-22 but in thruth, he is thousand years old, he wears old worn-out robe fit for a priest or a monk, and is always surrounded by black mist sipping out of him. His AA is him throwing the black mist.\r\n\r\nAbilities-\r\n\r\n* Passive - \r\n-Allies that kill minion nearby Anguis get 10 shield that loses 1.5 health every second (shield cant exceed 100)\r\n-Killing enemy champion grants 30 shield that loses 1.5 health every second (shield cant exceed 100)\r\n\r\nThis passive gives more sustain for Adc and encourages killing minions.\r\n\r\n* Q - Life's Essence\r\n-Skillshot that sends a ghost/ghoul in a direction damaging the first enemy hit. Damage 50-120 +40% AP\r\n-If the enemy hit was an enemy champion ghost/ghoul will stay on them marking them for 5s\r\n-Attacking marked enemies with AA will heal the attacker for (10-20) base heal plus (10-20% AP) from Agnuis and (25-35% AD) from Attacker.\r\n+Mana cost - 50-80            \r\n+Cooldown - 12s-7s\r\n\r\nThis is Agnuis way of healing his allies while telling them which enemy to attack. I know the stats may not be perfect but here I am trying to use Adc AD to heal them.\r\n\r\n* W -Spreading Mist\r\n-Point and click, an ability that after 1s delay makes enemy champion nearsighted for 2.5s-4s (animation would be of greenish mist)\r\n-After the Duration, any other enemy champion in the area of the nearsighted enemy (Area in which Affected can see them) will be infected by Spreading Mist. Targets affected once can't be affected by the same Spreading Mist again.\r\n+Mana cost - 80-110\r\n+Cooldown - 23s-16s\r\n\r\nThis is an ability that meant to make the enemy helpless and move away from each other for easier picking. perfect for receiving ganks\r\n\r\n* E - Seed of Souls\r\n-AOE ability with long casting range\r\n-Plants a soul seed, after 2s delay it grows towards the nearest wall and equal distance opposite direction marking the ground along the way, growing takes 1.5s\r\n-enemies on the affected ground are slowed down by 25%\r\n-If an enemy stands on the affected ground for 1s they get rooted for 2.5s-3s\r\n-The ground stays affected for 4s-7s (animation of countless ghost arms sticking from the ground trying to grab you)\r\n+Mana cost - 80-110\r\n+Cooldown - 25s-19s (starts counting only after affected ground disappears)\r\n\r\nThis is his tool of making almost impassible terrain to trap an enemy although dashes and flashes could get through them. Because of all the delays, it won't be used as a chasing tool or escaping tool as it is meant to be a tool to put enemy against a wall where they can choose to fight, try to find a different way or get rooted while trying to cross the affected ground.\r\n\r\n* R - The Harrowing\r\n-When an allied champion dies Anguis can revive them for 10s with 50% max health\r\n-When clicking R small hud opens with all allies, showing which ones are dead, he can click on them and they are teleported to Agnuis\r\n-He can also click on the dead ally nearby to revive them in their current position.\r\n-Revived allies get their view changed to their new location while closing shop window and undoing their shoppings\r\n+Mana cost - 100\r\n+Cooldown - 160s-100s\r\n\r\nThis ability could bring an extra fighter on the bot, help a dead teammate get their revenge or help him escape while he throws already dead teammate to be killed again.\r\n\r\nGameplay-\r\n\r\nAs I said Agnuis is meant to be manipulative with his Q he points target for his allies and rewards them for attacking them, with his W he spreads enemies around so they would be easier to kill or he blinds them all and then they are easier to kill, with his E he is meant to give no escape to his enemies and if they try anyway they get rooted. His combo would look like this: Cast W on ADC, while confused and blind, Cast E behind an enemy to trap them when they decide to escape, Cast Q on the ADC to deal damage and heal your ADC if they fight back, could also summon ally with R if any are dead.\r\n\r\nLore-\r\n\r\nAgnuis was born on Blessed Isles where he studied ancient artefacts and magic. He was always punished and scolded as he was trying to study very dangerous and forbidden spells, Elders kept telling him that bad things happen when those spells are used but he didn't listen, for him, they were just too fascinating to not study them. He learned most of the spells when elders decided to no longer accept his behaviour. Anguis was no longer allowed to study any form of magic instead they gave him a shovel to help order of monks that meant to help the dead rest,(same order as {{champion:83}} ) it was a lot of hard labour which Agnuis didn't like. Most monks treated the dead with respect but for Agnuis they are just that 'dead' so no wonder when he used some spells to make dead bodies move on their towards their graves, the monks were not happy. That day he was severy punished and he came to a conclusion: he should control the living the same way he controls the dead. For the next few months while outside the Blessed Isles, Anguis was searching for perfect people to control and he found them. Small kingdom with a powerful army and most importantly a king and a queen that loved each other so very much. One day he cast a nasty curse on the queen that made her very sick and no medicine could make her better except for the water of life from Blessed Isles. After a few weeks, his plan progressed as a woman from that very same kingdom came to Blessed Isles looking for help. {{champion:429}} Monks and priests promised help so the woman hurried to her kingdom while Anguis completed the spell and killed the queen. He also sent a letter to the king containing an ancient and forbidden spell to be used at the right moment. After a few more days they came, the king holding his dead queen and a whole platoon of soldiers. Of course, every single priest and monk refused to raise the dead and every single one of them died at the hands of a man on a high horse with black armour{{champion:120}}. Finally, he was the last one standing, while pretending to be scared, he showed them how to revive the queen while in secret casting another spell on her dead body. At long last, the dead queen came back to life but was still under control of Anguis and her every word was actually his. \"Please, I am in so much pain. Please, I beg of you cast the spell and let us be together forever, Please hurry.\" And so the spell was cast, and the only reason why Anguis could not cast the spell himself was that the price for it was one's life. But now he is the only one prepared for what is coming and so he started to chant his own spell to take control of the dead. And that is the story of how he brought Harrowing.\r\n\r\nTell me what you think\r\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-26T03:33:45.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive - The concept is nice, but the shield gained from killing enemy champions is way too low. \n\nQ - I would say go with something other than a ghoul. The first time I read this ability it sounded like I was reading one of Yorick's old abilities. Also it'd probably be nice for it to be bonus adaptive damage instead of healing. Maybe this way Kalista might have a reason to start getting picked a bit more. Still, I like the idea of a way of placing a Leona mark on a specific champion you want.\n\nW - Probably best not to make this spread like a Malzahar E. Nearsighted is painful enough if it's Quinn hitting one person and that's a skillshot. \n\nE - So if I were to place it right in the middle of the lane then I would have a pseudo-wall stretching across the lane? Seems a bit unfair to me.\n\nR - You might need to explain this a little better because, as it stands now, there's very little difference between this and Zilean's ult. If used improperly then this could also just end up feeding the enemy team even more with nothing to come out of it. I get the idea of wanting a Mercy ult in the game, but I don't think something other than Zilean's ult would really work.\n\nLore - You might want to add a bit about Thresh considering he was the warden of the Blessed Isles archives when he was still alive. How else is Anguis going to get ahold of dangerous magic if not from a warden whose mind is slowly dipping into insanity due to the nature of his job? There are also a few inconsistencies I don't remember being in the original Shadow Isles tale.","replies":[{"poster":"This is Kaz222","date":"2019-08-26T03:55:33.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your feedback I will start making changes based on it.\nI like the idea of adding Threash in the story but would it not seem like I was trying too hard to fit too many other champions to my story?\nR - yes, I need to better explain it. \nOnce ally is **dead**, he/she can be revived for **10s** and they would be tp to Anguis, after **10s** they would go **back to being dead**\nThis Ult is meant to work like passive of {{champion:14}} or {{champion:30}} \nI think I need to change the name from reviving to... any idea?\nOnce again thank you for your feedback \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-26T04:59:21.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I like the idea of adding Threash in the story but would it not seem like I was trying too hard to fit too many other champions to my story?\n\nThere's a point where it becomes too excessive, but you haven't reached that yet. On the contrary, at the point you're at adding other champions to the backstory allows you to keep it from being generic. That said, it would be kinda weird to make this a Shadow Isles champion since \"My champion is what caused the Ruination in the first place\" shows quite a bit of hubris. Likewise the neat thing about the lore of all the Shadow Isles champions is that they all provide different perspectives about the Ruination. For instance, Yorick was a monk who wants to see it reversed while Thresh was a member of the order whose plunge into insanity saw him welcome the Ruination. For your champion to fit in with the Shadow Isles he'd have to bring a unique perspective to the story that doesn't involve him being the mastermind behind the event.\n\n>Once ally is dead, he/she can be revived for 10s and they would be tp to Anguis, after 10s they would go back to being dead\n\nIf I recall, Yorick's old ult did something like this.","replies":[{"poster":"This is Kaz222","date":"2019-08-26T10:42:18.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, thank you.
