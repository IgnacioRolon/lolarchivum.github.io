Talon as a support is a lot more risky, but IMO is still way less of a griefing pick than \"fiora support\"  b/c talon can zone the enemy botlane (especially if they're both squishy champs) and can hard punish if they over extend with just a W>Q>auto trade so the enemy botlane has to respect your kill lane potential (actually works incredibly well with an {{champion:22}}  adc b/c her slow enables you to hit both parts of W guaranteeing your passive).

There are options for ranged DPS viable in top lane matchups. So with 2 friends you could run ADC top and a Cheese off meta kill lane bot.
