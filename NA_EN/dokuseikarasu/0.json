The previous one you were probably less likely to get honor form anyone. We can't control who others honor, but we don't have to honor the carry of the game. Honor whoever you felt deserve it. Position may also play a part. I usually think the adc honors the player that supported them.\n\nAs far as toxic flamers. It may not help, but I think of it like I do mastery, or prestige in CoD. Just because they have a level doesn't mean they are good, they jist play a lot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-11T19:31:40.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One problem with the new honor is that friendly and teamwork are grouped together.
