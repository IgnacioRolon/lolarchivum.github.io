It's a dual band netgear router. Brand **flippin'** new. But everytime I play Draft Pick I dc more time than not. Maybe after two games it'll do ok with the exception of the lag spikes. But i thought after I saw that Riot had noticed that people were lagging and disconnecting and said they were working on the server that it would be fixed. But that **doesnt** seem to be the case. I just wanna know if they did fix the problem or that they see if it still is a problem and are still working to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-05T21:52:14.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clarify, what thread are you referencing where we identified a server issue and are working on a fix?  I'm not aware of any widespread issues at the moment and would like to see any communication we've had about it as I have not been able to find it.\n\nAlso, regarding your issue specifically, are you disconnecting in-game, or are you disconnecting the client/Champ Select?  \n\nReply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"ZURELL","date":"2016-05-06T14:14:51.075+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"im disconnecting in-game. I don't have problems anywhere else but in-game draft. sometimes ill have a minor lag spike but it comes as quickly as it goes. but i'll be in the middle of a game, just minding my own business, and out of nowhere with no warning of  or preceding thing that tells me its gonna dc. it just happens out of nowhere. its so random. so then when I leave the game so I can reconnect since it never reconnects on its own it takes forever and by that time I'm so behind it doesn't even matter. and then I get bashed by everyone. I've come across others that say theyre having problems but then again it my just be us. but I just bought a brand new router. like brand new. its a netgear dual band router. maybe its that or maybe its my modem. I get my internet through time warner :/. so idk. I just want it to stop. I don't play ranked becuz of this (also cuz its super stressful).{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}  but thx for replying so soon. I just wanna know whats up. also if u have any recommended things or routers or whatever I could buy if the problem is me that'd be awesome. thx bb\n\nbtw, my ping is usually 49-53 so everything is fine. then it just dc randomly","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-06T21:29:41.618+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given how random this seems, it honestly does seem like some sort of weird connection issue.  I can't say whether its because of your new router (if it started only after you got it, then it seems like the culprit), but the best thing you can do is to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  The steps there, while a lot, should get this resolved.","replies":[{"poster":"ZURELL","date":"2016-05-18T04:19:46.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k im still having trouble. and to actually answer your question from before, it wasnt on  a thread it was on the home screen for league with that little triangle at the top left saying they recognized the issue and were working on fixing it. which made sense because everyone was saying they were having problems.  \n\nnow there are less people saying it and tbh my ping ligthened up immensely but im still getting dc'd and lag spikes though theyre not as bad and dont last as long. but the dc's are driving me insane it takes me forever to get back into the game because i have to click ok through all the pop ups telling me i've dc'd (which i can clearly see for myself). and by that point im pretty flipping behind in the game. my ping was perfect right when i bought the new router but after the patch it messed up. idk i'm just having trouble with it.\n\nand I just got done with the patch .10 download and for the first few games my ping was a perfect 50 and I didn't disconnect at all for any of those games. now its back to its old ways i just dc'd while playing ziggs and when i came back blitz had been dc'd too and our team lost the game. plz plz plz plz plzplzplz plz fix this \n \n\nplz\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
