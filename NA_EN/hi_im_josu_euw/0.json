Usually when the patcher is at 33%, it's still verifying your files before it requests the proper files to update the game client files. If it's still scanning files, let it continue doing so and it'll eventually start up (although it's been 3 hours since your original post so maybe it has already gone over that hurdle)\n\nAt other times, it might just be faster to force the patcher to download all the necessary files instead of checking which parts need to be updated (especially if the scanning process is taking a long time). First of all, try running the game as Administrator in case it doesn't have enough privilege to run properly. Afterwards, follow the instructions here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq4\n\nIf you continue having issues with the patcher or aren't sure how to perform the steps outlined in the knowledge base article, please contact my colleagues through the Support Site so we can further assist you:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"DelftseKpi","date":"2016-04-07T16:13:03.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine too, it went up to 76% then it crashed and now its back at 33% \n\nHope someone knows what to do since I already disabled firewall, ran as adminstrator and deleted files from patch","replies":[]}]}
