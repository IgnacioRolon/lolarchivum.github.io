I'm a college student currently studying Computer Programming and Database Management. I've been a fan of video games since I was young, so although I enjoy programming in general as a hobby, specifically it would be amazing if I could somehow find my way into a gaming company one day. Not even necessarily Riot, though of course that would be awesome.\r\n\r\nThe real question here is, and I suppose this would go for any other programmers who might be on the community beta, but what steps should I take to increase my chances of landing a job at Riot? What programming languages would be most beneficial to master, what sort of things should I fill my portfolio with, what should I be capable of doing? That sort of thing.\r\n\r\nWhile I am rather creative, I'm not so much... innovative, I guess? I can't easily think of anything that I would need to program or have the skill to program. Certainly I cannot make a game of my own as a programmer with no artistic skills whatsoever, and any given utility I could think of, chances are already exists and wouldn't necessarily be a meaningful, difficult, or even relevant programming task!\r\n\r\nthe **tl;dr** being, what should I do now, in my college years, if I want a chance at a job or internship at Riot down the road?","replies":[{"poster":"cautomaton","date":"2014-03-05T19:49:16.126+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I *am* an engineer at Riot Games and I can give you some guidelines.\n\nFirst, you can check out our [LinkedIn Group](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Inside-Riot-Games-People-Game-3544410?trk=my_groups-b-grp-v) where we specifically answer questions like this. There's some great discussion there, so it's worth your time to review the archives.\n\nAt Riot, we do all sorts of engineering: web development in languages like PHP and Python, big data using tools like Hadoop, server-side distributed programming using Java and game server and client development in C/C++. I mention this to dismiss the idea that you need to study a specific language or discipline. Game Engineering *is* a rather unique discipline for which there are specific university degrees, but aside from that, a solid core computer science degree can open up the doors to a wide range of engineering positions.\n\nOk, now to some specific advice:\n\n- While in school, focus on getting a **solid foundation of core CS skills**. You'll have plenty of time on the job to learn specific libraries, build tools and so on. Right now you have time to invest in your core CS knowledge. All other advice assumes you're building on this foundation. If you're looking to get ahead, read books like [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and check out [these](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/143760/what-books-should-i-read-to-have-an-undergraduate-education-in-computer-science) [lists](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ch0wt/a_reading_list_for_the_selftaught_computer/) [for](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read) [more](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3253/what-books-should-everyone-read) [recommendations](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#professional-development).\n\n- **Create something.** You don't have to wait until you graduate to start hacking. Passionate programmers can't help themselves from creating things. Try your hand at a couple simple games (PC or mobile). Participate in a [game jam](http://globalgamejam.org/). If a new grad can give me a copy of a simple game he made, even if it's rough around the edges, that puts him ahead of the pack.\n\n- **Contribute to something.** Even better than handing me a game you wrote, show me the code you contributed to a public, well known open source project. I can't overstate how huge an advantage this is, not just for interviewing at places like Riot, but as an investment in your own engineering career. Contributing to established open source projects teaches you a wealth of higher-level skills: how to work on a large code base, how to cooperate with others, how the teach others to use your code, etc. Perhaps even more importantly, you develop an invaluable professional network with other experienced engineers from around the world. I wish every university encouraged this more. As an example of what I'm talking about, check out the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1) project.\n\n- **Know your field of interest.** We give special consideration to those passionate about League of Legends. So if Riot is your goal, then participate in your [collegiate program](http://competitive.na.leagueoflegends.com/collegiate-program) or help set one up. Show us something you've made using the [Riot API portal](http://developer.riotgames.com/). Likewise, if you were applying at Twitter or Facebook or Google, show them something you've made using their tools and APIs. It demonstrates that you're serious about understanding their business and ecosystem.\n\n\nI could go on, but honestly, if you can demonstrate these abilities you'll already be setting yourself up for success, either with Riot or some other awesome place to work.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Karlyr","date":"2015-02-25T20:42:33.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to bring back a desesperatly old post back.\n\nI was wondering if having multiple expertise can be of any uses for Riot Games specifically.\n\nI'm currently studying CS but I also have a diploma in 3D animation/modeling/texturing (a generalistic 3D artist diploma in short).

I'm going to copy and paste some info that we sometimes include in engineering job descriptions that captures our philosophy about this:\n\n> We are looking to hire highly accomplished engineers with a broad set of technical skills who are passionate about building technology that creates experiences that excite and engage millions of players globally. Our engineers play an integral role in the design and development of new products, features and systems and, in the process, are tackling some of technology’s most difficult challenges.\n> \n> We are an engineering organization that values “T-shaped” engineers. Riot engineers are expected to make pragmatic decisions about the best tool for the job, thus a broad exposure to many languages and tools is vital.\n> \n> Our engineers work across a variety of products and initiatives on a global scale: Game Development, Big Data, eSports, Merchandise, Live Service Development and Corporate IT Systems\n\nThe emphasis here is more on the term \"t-shaped\" as contrasted with the term \"full-stack\" sometimes used in the industry. By \"t-shaped,\" I mean an engineer who has broad understanding of engineering, but has at least one domain in which they have deep expertise. Every engineer will be a slightly different shape, but a lot of the effort we put into internally is helping engineers grow in these dimensions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arandallian","date":"2014-10-30T04:02:50.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone finding it increasingly difficult to get good job advice (currently only a child in the world of programming by comparison) I find these tips very helpful.

But I will offer some general advice that can only help:\n\n1) Build up a portfolio. Make stuff you like. In the end, your portfolio should reflect what you naturally want to be working on (and ostensibly what you're good at), and should help shepherd you to an appropriate position. School is good and all, but the proof is in the pudding. A solid portfolio of actual things is way more impressive than some piece of paper that says you take tests well. Builds lots of terrible things and hone your skills to then build better and better things.\n\n2) Learn the \"why\" of things. This can be somewhat challenging. Building a thing is hard enough, but understanding what to build and why gives you much more power and capability professionally.\n\n3) Learn about the company you want to work at (Riot or otherwise). Riot takes its culture very very seriously. The Riot manifesto is not just a bunch of lip service here, which is what makes it such an amazing place to work. Try to understand why you're a good fit for the place you want to work other than just \"I do good work\". Companies want passionate enthusiastic folk who believe in the products.\n\nThose are my off-the-cuff suggestions. The fact that you're even asking is a positive sign. Just funnel that enthusiasm into projects, and you'll be amazed at the results down the line. It's not about the things you're building necessarily, but the skills it's teaching you/honing.\n\nGLHF","replies":[]},{"poster":"IIIIIlIIIIIIl","date":"2014-10-30T01:16:21.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Degenerate Pixel!\n\nThe first question to answer is what kind of programming would you like to do? Are you a platform/business logic kind of guy? A systems oriented person? Data? The game itself perhaps?\n\nThat said, learning the fundamentals is way more important than learning any one language. We use C++ almost exclusively in the game client/server, and mostly Java for the platform services (erlang for chat, tools in C#, python, and more). This is just a slice of all the technology in use at the organization though.\n\nI encourage you to take the hard classes in college. Don't shy away from operating systems, compilers, assembly, functional programming, linear algebra, and more. They will all prove useful no matter where you end up. Also, develop your own engineering practice as well. Start a project independently or with a friend and do it from start to finish. Be ambitious! Open source things and contribute to open source. This is a great way to get good feedback on code quality. Also, read books about good software practices that you wouldn't cover in school.\n\nGLHF\nRiot3ous","replies":[{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-10-30T01:30:01.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"We use C++ almost exclusively in the game client/server, and mostly Java for the platform services (erlang for chat, tools in C#, python, and more).\"\n\nI'm wondering what's the reason for using java rather than something more flexible/efficient.","replies":[{"poster":"IIIIIlIIIIIIl","date":"2014-10-30T01:45:17.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because flexibility and efficiency aren't the only two metrics that you can evaluate programming languages by (i.e. platform independence, deployments, existing software, existing expertise).

Honestly, writing server-side Java these days often feels like plug-and-chug because almost everything hard you just import and move on (licensing dependent, but again, Apache).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nilous7","date":"2014-10-30T23:03:59.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long does the reviewing of applications normally take?
