But on my computer the normal mouse icon was persistent to the game. I couldn't click anything. I couldn't press any buttons to bring up any menus or anything. I couldn't even close down the window without having to click 'close window' from my taskbar like a billion times. I have no idea what is going on.\r\n\r\nI did notice that when loading in my mouse will flash to the glove icon that is normal in League and immediately go back to the regular arrow. I don't know if that means my mouse somehow isn't in the window when the game loads in but it should be because I'm full screened in game. Not borderless or windowed. \r\n\r\nI ran the client repair and nothing came back. This is very sudden as I was playing games just fine two days ago and nothing has changed since.\r\n\r\nAlso I can't even submit a ticket about this.\r\n[Me trying to submit a ticket while logged in.

Do me a favor and make sure Discord is closed out entirely, or make sure the overlay is turned off, and then test it in a custom game. \n\n\nAbout that ticket page, make sure you're [**cleared your browser history and cookies**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies) really quick, then try logging in on the main League landing page. *Then* try hitting submit a request to see if the tickets work now!","replies":[{"poster":"YumiSukazu","date":"2018-01-22T15:25:18.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually funny because my Discord overlay isn't on but my husband's is. And for my computer the Discord overlay is actually entirely turned off. By now I've turned off my computer a couple times and whatever it was is gone and I can play normally. But I can assure you it wasn't Discord because of my husband having it on as well as the overlay. \n\nAs for the ticket page that did the trick. I don't know if it matters but on that page originally it had my League icon displayed next to my name. And after it it was displaying my account's icon if that makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T01:08:33.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeeird, must be something else taking the focus of the window somehow. There are a lot of programs that can do this so sometimes it's hard to narrow down the culprit. If you shoot your logs over to our techs in that ticket they should be able to spot what's going on!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Outšider","date":"2018-01-22T00:58:00.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"turn off disc overlay also dont come here for answers they'll only ask you to trouble shoot. they only post real answers on twitter.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T04:29:36.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That troubleshooting helps us to narrow down the main problem, which we can then forward that info over to our techs to get a quicker solution to problems. It sucks sometimes when people don't return to followup on the steps we give, as that's an essential part to fixing things. We can't always pinpoint the main issue without troubleshooting.\n\nI'm so glad you've found a lot of help through our twitter support! We've been working on upping their tech knowledge to be more useful since so many choose that avenue of support. I'm really curious on what interaction you had, and what went so well, so we can start doing even better ^_^!","replies":[]},{"poster":"YumiSukazu","date":"2018-01-22T02:35:07.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have discord overlay on.
