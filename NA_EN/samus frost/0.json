But currently when I try to tab out and back into league my display stops working all together and I have to restart my computer. Not sure if its your end and praying that its not on my end since the GPU I have is almost 3x the cost it used to be when I first got it. If there's anything that isn't worth 3 kidneys and a soul that may be the cause of the issue I would be more than glad to take it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-31T03:51:53.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this kind of problem popup when a pc just has issues with tabbing between windows when they're in fullscreen.
