I&#039;m doing great, being very nice to everybody, when me and the enemy vayne decide to have some fun dancing (after all, it&#039;s blind pick, not ranked or something). My team comes in and kills the vayne, which upset me, but I didn&#039;t comment. Later, the Ezreal dies, and complains that the kha&#039;zix was throwing, and that everyone should report him. I told him to chill, but he wouldn&#039;t, and the enemy team agreed with him. They all reported me and the vayne in the end, making me worried that I will receive an unfair punishment due to people being toxic. Is there any way I can tell Riot that it was not me being toxic or feeding?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-20T21:08:43.515+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The number of reports does not matter.

They do not establish guilt. The game is then reviewed for harassment, feeding, etc. This is why &#x27;troll reporting&#x27; or &#x27;gang reporting&#x27; do not work. False or inaccurate reports are thrown out.\n>\n>_You can say absolutely nothing, and still be reported and punished for it._\n> \n> You cannot ever be punished for saying nothing .. unless of course it&#x27;s for something gameplay related like feeding, afking or cheating. But, you can never be punished for offensive language, hate speech or verbal abuse if you said nothing.\n\nThe italicized line is part of a comment from someone else that he was responding to.
