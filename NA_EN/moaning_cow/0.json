He went from a good tank that could apply slows and boost teams speed to throwing down barrels that can be destroyed and take 2 motions (attack + set up) to destroy them. Only idiots would let you blow one up on them and are amazingly easy to be destroyed by enemies. I would like it if at least his q got the slow proc back, or enemy champion&#039;s attacks on barrels do 1/2 of gangplank attack on a barrel so they aren&#039;t so effortless to destroy. I miss focusing tank/healing + mad slow procs left and right.","replies":[{"poster":"WombieZombie","date":"2015-07-24T20:59:32.606+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Level up the barrels more... At level 7 and 13, their decay rate increases... So they can be detonated much sooner. :) Also if you hit the barrels with Q, any enemies caught in the blast are slowed. also does more damage. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-24T20:58:07.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't just throw a barrel at the enemy and hope they don't destroy it, you throw one behind you and chain it to them so they can't diffuse it fast enough.  It's actually kinda strong IMO when someone is familiar with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CreationFlaw","date":"2015-07-24T20:56:27.259+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can talon have his silence back?\n\nThat's basically the argument I see. Talon doesn't need his silence to work, GP Doesn't really need to have super procs because if you actually utilize his kit to its potential he does solid damage.","replies":[{"poster":"moaning cow","date":"2015-07-25T18:39:37.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"but that's my point he was a great team tank. You used slows on enemies, and then speed boost your team and you lead the front with your speed as a tank so your carries can follow. He worked best against retreating enemies, just throw down his ult to a retreating team and bam you can own all of them. If you used the old gp for damage only or lane solo you used him wrong. He was one of the best tanks in the game ->heals + slow + constant speed boost/extra for u and team when active + gold + AOE ult that slowed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CreationFlaw","date":"2015-07-24T21:03:47.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ew aram main gtfo.","replies":[{"poster":"FatesDefiler","date":"2015-07-24T21:12:28.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=moberrybusiness,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jFMEQYgK,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-07-24T21:03:47.983+0000)\n>\n> Ew aram main gtfo.\n\nstop pretending to be stupider than you are, you don't need the help.  obviously I'm saying I would never select him intentionally, and will regret the times he's selected for me accidently.  you =/= logic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moaning cow","date":"2015-07-31T07:09:33.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah its sad he lost his constants for actions that require multiple motions to complete.
