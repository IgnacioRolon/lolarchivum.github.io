ARMOR USELESS!\r\n\r\nThis thinking is incorrect and inaccurate and you should feel bad.\r\nConqueror CONVERTS 20% of all damage dealt into true damage.\r\n\r\nSo, let us say you have 65 ad.\r\nYour opponent has 100 armor for 50% physical damage reduction.\r\nSo every hit will be for about 33 damage.\r\nNow let us say conqueror procs in this moment.\r\nYou gain 35 ad at level 18 so you go to 100 ad.\r\n\r\nSo your physical hit would be for 50. Now we convert the damage.\r\nYou hit for 40 physical damage and 10 true damage.\r\n\r\nNow this is at 100 armor for 50% damage reduction. \r\n\r\nLet us bump armor up to reduce physical damage by 75%.\r\n\r\nNow each physical damage hit would be 25 damage.\r\nWhen you convert 20% into true damage, the damage you deal is now.\r\n\r\n20 physical damage and 5 true damage.\r\n\r\nYour armor is still having an effect, it does reduce the true damage that is being outputted.\r\n\r\nBut wait beats dont care, isn&#039;t that the same as leaving it physical damage!?\r\n\r\nNot quite exactly. Remember it is 20% of all damage being dealt, which is why on champions such as Italia and yi it hurts so badly.  Many abilities also work off ratios or create damage enhancement effects which in turn affect.conqueror.\r\n\r\nThis is why it appears problematic. Since it is a conversion, it is affected by damage enhancement and damage mitigation unlike other forms of true damage which are independent.\r\n\r\nNow of I am incorrect on some of this do advise me, but the issue is not conqueror explicitly. It is a symptom of the already high damage.\r\n\r\nWithout conqueror you would find many champions having issues with viability.\r\nYasuo and Irelia would not be affected.","replies":[{"poster":"GFREEMEN","date":"2018-12-27T00:39:30.798+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"True damage is calculated before armor from what I understand","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2018-12-27T16:52:04.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your math is off.
