What's that, you mostly just rely on one green (yellow) at a time?  So how do you survive with one a single green/yellow normally?\n\nSimple, you place your ward in river bush or near baron/dragon where it'll cover both entrances in top/bot.  Turns out pinks can be used in the same way.\n\nMid can't cover all their bases with a single pink but mid has the least distance to cover to hit the safety of a turret so you should be fine.\n\nAs for lane ganks, yes, she can just walk into lane.  However, if she gets within 700 of you then you'll see her.  Lane is what, 1000, 1200 wide?  Stand near the middle so she can't get behind you.  Be careful of cc.

However she was already so weak from S3 nerfs that she only toped out at 52% win rate and, thanks to people learning to counter her, had fallen down to 50% by the time she was nerfed in S4.

Playing safe has it's uses but you can't sit in lane terrified of the Eve gank as soon as she kills your pink ward, and if you are congrats EVE ALREADY WON THE LANE and she didn't even have to gank it.  \n\n\n>As for lane ganks, yes, she can just walk into lane.

It's so easy it only explains why she was dominating the pro scene with Lee Sin/Kha/Elise all the way up until she was nerfed to the point of doing minimal damage.  Nice try but this is a REALLY weak and sad attempt to defend something that should not be in the game is vision mechanics are going to continue to be what they are.\n\n\n\n>I know this might be complicated and I can see why you might not know if you're not an Eve player.

Now it's been 60 seconds later, you haven't seen her sense you think you can come out from under your turret now?  Nope there she is and you are now dead.  Grats those wards meant nothing, this is the power of her stealth that you love to ignore and downplay.

The truth is the vision changes only brought her up to par.\n\n\nSo \"on par\" that she competed with Lee Sin/Kha'zix/Elise.  You know the jungle trinity for the longest of times that you either picked or banned because of how insanely strong they where?  Yeah that is so \"on par\" that she is in the leagues of the best junglers in the game, junglers that continue to dominate inspite of repeated nerfs mind you.  BTW your little win percentage is a load of crap.  Lee sits in the 40s and yet he is still one of the most oppressive and dominate junglers since S2.  It's a weak attempt to justify a busted mechanic, IE stealth, as the current game exists and you are failing miserably.\n\n\n>So, by \"get a clue\" do you mean I should base my analysis not on experience and facts but on emotional overreaction and group think?\n\n\n\nFun fact, I'm not responding on emotion, I'm responding on facts.  Stealth champs, aside for the bugged Rengar, did next to nothing prior to vision changes.  Once those changes went through they suddenly became boogie-men picks that we begin to see game after game after game all the way up to the pro scene.  You really think that is a coincidence?  That with minimal/no changes there kits suddenly became amazing out of thin air?  No stealth became broken due to lack of counters and champs that would otherwise be doing nothing suddenly became serious threats.  I'm not saying we should go back to the \"pink wards litter the ground\" S3 levels of counter but something beyond \"you get 1 pink ward to find me and I can see it\" set up right now has proven to not work when it comes to keeping stealth in check, and it's resulted in nerfs to pretty much all champions with stealth with Eve being the only one to get completely taken out of viability.","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2014-12-03T23:14:05.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So grats you saw her for 2 seconds.

Yeah they got used on the pro scene combined with significantly better communication and team strategies and Eve was still dominate.  Sorry but no you can't.  The only successful strategy pros found and used to counter Eve was to create a 2v1 lane and force Eve to stay with the 2v1 lane to protect it.\n\nYou could but that is irrelevant to the conversation about how little there is that can be done to actually stop Eve from ganking lanes.\n\nAnd I could point out that Eve will use that ability right as she comes into vision range, or shortly after considering she can easily come from behind and save it for a slow, to be seen making that fact that it \"breaks stealth\" completely irrelevant.\n\nIt's obvious you are only interested in the \"lets under sell my champs strengths to make them appear reasonable and fair instead of the broken design they currently are\" to actually listen and learn how an ability that used to be reasonable, stealth, became extremely toxic to the game due to vision changes.\n\nYou have explained nothing but shallow theories that have been proven wrong and to not work at the highest levels of competition.

Additionally if Eve does get behind but snowballs her allies then that is perfectly fine as often times she isn't going to be carrying the game.  She is much like J4/Amumu/Lee/etc style junglers who even if they get behind it doesn't really matter because they provide plenty of utility to the team fight to more than make up for not having high damage or being extremely tanky.  There is a reason you see pros waiting 30 secs to a minute for a gank as Lee Sin, we saw them do it was Eve as well.  Snowballing your lanes is well worth it for how badly it can cripple the enemy laner, they will be farther behind than Eve would be after waiting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2014-12-02T22:33:46.732+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah.. riot gutted my eve and left her to rot\nI was done with her.. the final nail in the coffin for me was the removal of 25% base damage on Q with no change to how high it scaled with AP.\nAP tank eve/full tank eve is done.\nriot has thoroughly ruined her.\nI play her on my trolly EUW/LAN/NA accounts but as of trying to actually have a bove a 55% winrate with her as a veteran eve main... yeah... its not happening in s5.\nRIP eve.\nLol.\nIdk hoesntly how hard it is to simply make her Q refund hp against non champions or something useful as a jungler,.\nBut she's always had shit tier clear and sustain and making the jungle this difficult to clear is just tightening the noose.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2014-12-02T23:05:08.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Idk hoesntly how hard it is to simply make her Q refund hp against non champions or something useful as a jungler,.\n> But she's always had shit tier clear and sustain and making the jungle this difficult to clear is just tightening the noose.\n\n\nIf you wanted that kind of effect you could give it monster only spell vamp (or a specific heal on hit)\n(same way spitit stone used to give increased damage against monsters only)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OblongOtter","date":"2014-12-03T20:37:20.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Sorry Riot but there can only be 1 Warwick per team in ranked.\n\n\n\n\nFTFY","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2014-12-03T13:52:54.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont you mean their can only be one warwick per team?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2014-12-03T03:53:04.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nautilus is okay in the new jungle, I can pretty much sustain him to clear both blue & red camps before my 1st recall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-12-03T03:33:18.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried Eve today.\nHoly hell, I've made quite a lot of junglers work in the new junlge (including Gnar and Jayce), but Eve is just completely underwhelming.
