I used to be in love with this game. I could spend hours playing and not be bored or frustrated, even after losses. Recently, though, I find myself sitting in front of the computer like a robot, locking into ranked queue day after day. Nothing really comes of it. On anybody&#039;s first death, the toxicity is already at extremely high levels. Eventually you have to mute 3 or for people, and then there&#039;s no social interaction. It&#039;s like this in normals, ARAM, ranked, hell, even in 3&#039;s. Now, I just find myself dragging through soloqueue having flame wars with every person that gets mad 2 minutes in and says &quot;gg&quot; if a teammate gives up first blood. \r\n\r\nIs there a cure for the way this game has become a time killer instead of a hobby? I really do want to enjoy it again. I&#039;ve been playing for 5+ years, and put lots of money into playing. I&#039;ve logged so many hours just because I&#039;m devoted to it. But I don&#039;t really see myself lasting much longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-02-13T08:35:33.671+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":22,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fyshie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AAQNjk2Q,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-13T04:42:32.076+0000)\n>\n>  the toxicity is already at extremely high levels\n\nI've been playing for years and I can safely/confidently state that the game currently has the lowest levels of toxicity ever.\n\nEvery year it seems they crack down harder on toxicity and it has had great effect... back in the day (S1/early S2) I could get away with massive toxicity without so much as a chat restriction (They didn't exist back then)... at worst I'd get suspended for a day every few months.
