Before keys were just given out after games kinda randomly.  It was linked to champion mastery but no one really knew how to get them.  Now its based on honor.  Its a pretty clear and concise goal.  Don't be a dick and you get free keys.  That is the message.  \n\nOf course you can still buy them, riot is a business and selling keys makes money just like selling skins to people who are toxic also makes money. Even if that argument wasn't valid they would still sell keys because for some people it feels like shit to have a bunch of boxes and no way to access the content inside.\n\n The kind of thinking you displayed is exactly the problem with our culture today and is the reason for our epidemic of victimhood.","replies":[{"poster":"Negateevo","date":"2017-08-08T21:45:04.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"every week 2 keys? compared to the amount we were getting before that, its nothing","replies":[{"poster":"SummonersDrift","date":"2017-08-08T22:19:31.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually it averaged to 1 key per week or less since the 4th key of the month required a lot of grinding or luck. think and learn the facts before you speak idiot.","replies":[{"poster":"Negateevo","date":"2017-08-09T03:40:16.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you fine with the system, idiot ?","replies":[{"poster":"SummonersDrift","date":"2017-08-10T00:43:59.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you LITERALLY UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES could get more than 4 keys a month is what im saying, so your entire \"wah i get less keys now\" is 100% utterly false and incorrect.\n\nand yes im fine with it since being toxic used to lock keys as well so its really not too different. I also purposefully avoid buying every skin i want to make sure i still have the excitement of getting one i want from a chest. chests would be boring if you owned every skin you cared about so i avoid it=P. \n\nive spent 1500+ over the years on this game, alot of which was phone credit that would have expired anyway, nevertheless chests/keys are still an incentive to me as a skin through a chest is much sweeter than a bought one, for me atleast.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yellow Herb","date":"2017-08-08T21:32:06.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could buy the keys long before they were sportsman rewards..","replies":[]}]}
