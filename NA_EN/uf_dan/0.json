{"poster":"UF Dan","date":"2018-12-31T02:42:01.556+0000","title":"@Riot, What do you want me to do?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/X5i3lGf\n\nI'm writing this post right after I finished this game because of how pissed off I am. This Pyke says nothing in champ select, nothing in game. He takes smite, takes Kayn's blue buff and afks at my turret. Obviously an instant loss. Kayn goes afk and I go move around at base to avoid getting a leaverbuster (advice given by the enemy Soraka).\n\nI don't even care that I lost 13 minutes of my time I can deal with the fact that i lost a whopping 21 lp for that game, even though I usually lose around 14 or 15 I can accept the fact that players like this that ruin games for 9 others and lead to the unfair lp loss of 4 other players is only gonna get a useless low priority queue which can never actually lead to a ban And Yeah, I can deal with the fact that I didn't even get the feedback report that this dude got punished after i reported him\n\nAnd maybe I could have dealt with the fact that I did end up getting a leaverbuster for absolutely no reason and the fact that the Kayn probably also got one. But I can't simultaneously accept me getting punished for something not even close to my fault, and the actual afker getting absolutely nothing.\n\nSo I'm asking Riot directly. What do you want me to do? What do you expect of me?\n\nDo I sit there and accept being held hostage for 13 minutes and pretend to play the game for that duration of time? Or does Riot actually expect me to just take a leaverbuster for absolutely no reason?\n\nWhat's even funnier is this recently added Remake system which was suppose to fix these problem, actually just ends up punishing people with real life situations that take priority over a videogame, instead of actual trolls, and is often abused by players to reset games because they messed up in champ select.\n\nThere have been countless suggestions by players more knowledgeable than me that can fix these problems, but Riot seems to prioritize toxicity which can be instantly negated with the mute button and doesn't have the same game-ruining impact that actual inters and afkers do.\n\nI've never seen a system that actively goes out of its way to punish innocent players for something other players do. Oh you don't want to play your clearly unwinnable 4v5? Yeah have a 20 minute queue time and take a higher than normal lp loss with it. In what world does this logic make sense?\n\nEdit: For all of you saying to try to win anyways, keep in mind that my entire team (as they logically should) gave up cause they knew we would lose the game. So if I were to actually try, I would essentially be fighting out a 1v5 in Diamond Elo. If after reading that you still think I should have tried, please do not bother commenting <Removed by Moderation>\n\nNo there is nothing \"toxic\" or hypocritical about me or any of my other teammates afking. The chances of winning a 4v6 are too low to go through the effort of playing that game out. That's a conclusion 99.999% of players in Diamond Elo are gonna come to in that situation. You know what would be way more toxic? Me delaying the inevitable by trying to delay the enemy team from ending essentially holding my teammates hostage, the same way that Pyke and Riot's system held us hostage for 13 minutes. Now that's toxic.\n\nFinal Edit: So the majority opinion seems to be against mine, which was honestly not what I expected. So I'll leave this to all who still disagree with me:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/hQ1yu1x\n \nThe Pyke ended up trolling a second time leading to another wasted 10 minute game. He then proceeded to play a few more of what I assume to be \"normal\" ranked games clearly showing this guy was never punished. \n\nStill think Riot's System isn't broken? Then I present you with Dota's System:\nIn Dota 2, if someone afks for more than 5 minutes, you are allowed to leave the game, and start a new one. You still lose LP or whatever point system they use, but you are still allowed to not only LEAVE, but also BEGIN a new game without being punished.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-31T05:24:27.743+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> ...and I go move around at base to avoid getting a leaverbuster (advice given by the enemy Soraka).\n>\n> And maybe I could have dealt with the fact that I did end up getting a leaverbuster for absolutely no reason...\n\nI'm sorry, but are you actually saying that you _AFK'ed_, _moved around in base to try and avoid leaverbuster detection_, and that you _somehow_ got LeaverBuster for \"no reason\"?\n\nYou should count yourself lucky that you _got_ LeaverBuster, because trying to avoid detection like that can net you a 14-day ban quicker than you can _blink_.\n\n> But I can't simultaneously accept me getting punished for something not even close to my fault...\n\nSo did you or did you not AFK?

They're willing to take a penalty so that the rest of the team doesn't suffer for their own mistakes, and it's rare enough that it's hard to be concerned about it.\n\nBeyond that, the /remake system has _known rules_. Every detail about /remake is out in the open, and no system is perfect - so you can't blame a system that's so readily known for having such a painful fault.

It's supposed to give teams some recourse if they have someone leave before the match kicks off.\n\nIt's not built to account for trolls who know how it works - and I can't imagine it reasonably being _able_ to do so, given, again, _the way the system works is completely out in the open._ Anyone can learn its ins and outs without hardly any effort, so can you really expect Riot to be able to perfectly tune it to counteract every possible abuse case?\n\n> There have been countless suggestions by players more knowledgeable than me that can fix these problems...\n\nGot any links?\n\n> ...but Riot seems to prioritize toxicity which can be instantly negated with the mute button and doesn't have the same game-ruining impact that actual inters and afkers do.\n\nI swear, if I had a dollar.\n\nRiot works against _both forms of toxicity at once._ It's not some situation where they have finite resources and can only afford to zero in on one and leave the other to run wild. In fact, I'd wager that Riot's putting _more_ focus into gameplay toxicity than verbal toxicity, considering just how easy it is to catch the latter.\n\n> I've never seen a system that actively goes out of its way to punish innocent players for something other players do.\n\nYou are not innocent. You said it yourself, you AFK'ed and tried to move around while not playing so as to avoid LeaverBuster detection.

That's very funny. Getting banned for in-chat toxicity is 1000x easier than getting banned by afking. And yes I got a leaverbuster for no reason, and following your logic, my 3 other teammates should also get leaverbusters because they were either actually afk or just moving around base or elsewhere.\n\n>So did you or did you not AFK? Because, if you did, then that's your fault, and nobody else's. You can't pin the blame of your actions onto someone else.\n\nAh yes it's my fault that me along with 3 others decided to not waste their time playing a game with a troll on their team.

And if you decide for whatever reason that you don't want to play that match anymore, at least own up to your decision.\n\n9 players signed up to fight a fair 5v5, they got a 4v5 with a player intentionally trying to lose the game. 4 players decided to not play that game out for that reason and the other 5 decided to end the game as quickly as possible since it obviously wasn't gonna be a fun or competitive game. I'm owning up to mine, and everyone elses decision, 3 of them who according to you, will and should get a leaverbuster. I'm owning up to their decision to not continue on with a game who no one was gonna enjoy.\n\n>Well, to start off with, someone tanking a penalty when they messed something up in Champ Select isn't an abuse case.

Anyone can learn its ins and outs without hardly any effort, so can you really expect Riot to be able to perfectly tune it to counteract every possible abuse case?\n\nI don't expect Riot's system to be perfect. I already said that I'm ok with losing that LP, I'm ok with losing that time. I'm not ok with Riot's system punishing those who had to suffer through a troll that's all. I'm not blaming the remake system, I'm blaming a LACK OF SYSTEM that is unable to punish trolls like pyke, and the CURRENT AFK SYSTEM that according to you should treat actual afkers wanting to lose, actual real life emergency afkers, and an entire team giving up because of a troll ruining the game in the same way, punishing all of them equally and not the ACTUAL troll that's afking but doesn't get punished because he's right clicking around turret. The system punishes the innocent, doesn't punish the offenders. That's a pretty counter intuitive system to me.\n\n>I swear, if I had a dollar.\nRiot works against both forms of toxicity at once. It's not some situation where they have finite resources and can only afford to zero in on one and leave the other to run wild. In fact, I'd wager that Riot's putting more focus into gameplay toxicity than verbal toxicity, considering just how easy it is to catch the latter.\n\nTell me what's gonna get me banned faster: Me consecutively afking games nonstop, or me bieng toxic in chat every game. One or the other? Maybe both methods are as efficient. Now tell me what tools do you have to combat in-chat toxicity? The Mute Button? pretty effective right? Ok Now tell me what tools I have to deal with that Pyke troll? Can I do something else since everyone in my team has given up and afked as well? Nope you get a leaverbuster. Can I mute him? Sure mute the 0 words he said in chat!\nYou'd wager Riot's putting more focus into gameplay toxicity than verbal? That's unfortunate cause that Pyke sure got to int another game and continue to play REAL games after that as if nothing happened.\nI can't prove to you that afking is easier to get away with than being toxic unless I actually go out there and test it. But I've heard of many more cases of people getting chat restrict and banned for verbal harassment than others getting banned for continually afking. And Afking to lose is objectively more impactful than being toxic.\n\n>You are not innocent. You said it yourself, you AFK'ed and tried to move around while not playing so as to avoid LeaverBuster detection. That is the opposite of innocent.\n\nSo my entire team is not innocent than right? Cause they all gave up and let the team end. Are they the trolls now?\n\n>Then your entire team gets punished. It doesn't matter what elo you're at - you queue up for a game, you click \"accept\", and you play it out.\n\nAnd there you go. That just about sums it all up. my entire team SHOULD get punished. 0 people in that situation are gonna play that game out period. It's not gonna happen. Few people have this belief you have and are willing to waste more time playing an unwinnable game. If you're the one guy trying with a troll on your team, delaying the inevitable loss, holding everyone hostage (and yes YOU ARE holding 4 people hostage. No one wants to play with a troll in a COMPETITIVE environment) you'll find out how quickly you're gonna be looked at as the one being toxic, not the actual toxic inter.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-31T06:50:14.332+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> HAHHAHAHAH getting banned for afking repeatedly?\n\nGetting banned for _actively trying to avoid detection_, is what I said. Nowhere in there did I say \"AFK'ing repeatedly\" - unless you can point it out.\n\n> And yes I got a leaverbuster for no reason, and following your logic, my 3 other teammates should also get leaverbusters because they were either actually afk or just moving around base or elsewhere.\n\nIt wasn't for no reason, you AFK'ed, and admitted it. And yes, if the three other teammates were doing exactly as you described, then yes, they should also get LeaverBuster penalties.\n\n> Ah yes it's my fault that me along with 3 others decided to not waste their time playing a game with a troll on their team. Sounds about right.\n\nSo did the three other teammates control your Champion, and force you to AFK? Did they somehow teleport to you, kick you off your computer, and hijack the game to make you AFK? Did they hack you in mid-game, while still playing, to make you AFK?\n\nIf the answer to any of these questions is \"no\", which I can make a reasonable assumption that it's the answer to _all_ of them, then your AFK'ing was all _your doing_. And that means _you_ are the only one to blame for _your_ punishment.\n\n> I said it in the post. I reported him and got no instant report feedback. Want more proof? Here ya go:  \n> Smite Pyke Support? 10 Minute game? Does it ring a bell? Yeah he trolled another game right after trolling mine.\n\nFor one, the Instant Feedback Report is unreliable as all hell. There's no guarantee that it'll be sent out if a player is punished.\n\nFor two, just because they played a match immediately afterwards doesn't mean they didn't get punished. Reviews for trolling can take anywhere around 15~ minutes, so claiming that they didn't get punished solely because they didn't get punished _right on the spot_ with _immediate and thorough feedback **telling you** he got punished immediately_, doesn't work.\n\nConsider then, that you should probably be a little more patient, 'cause not everything happens at once.\n\n> I'm owning up to mine...\n\nAnd even still, you adamantly deny that you were given a valid punishment. If you're owning up to your decision, you'd understand and accept that the LeaverBuster penalty is the repercussions _for_ said decision.\n\nAnd you'd be thankful it's only that, 'cause as I said, deliberately trying to evade penalties like you did usually nets a 14-day ban.\n\n> I'm not ok with Riot's system punishing those who had to suffer through a troll that's all. I'm not blaming the remake system, I'm blaming a LACK OF SYSTEM that is unable to punish trolls like pyke...\n\nSince by this point, any talk of you AFK'ing has already been done to death and it's clear you're not gonna own up to it, I'm going to cease commenting on that matter, starting with that first sentence.\n\nAt any rate, there _is_ a system in place to punish trolls, but the issue is that it's not as good as it should be, and as I mentioned before, _it's not instantaneous._ You can't discern intent in less than a second, so, unsurprisingly, it's not currently possible to detect the intent to troll and issue a punishment as soon as the report is sent out.\n\nBut, that doesn't mean there's no system. It just means the results aren't immediate.\n\n> Tell me what's gonna get me banned faster: Me consecutively afking games nonstop, or me bieng toxic in chat every game. One or the other?

Take a breather, come back and re-read what I said, and think about it.\n\nSince I can't fathom much more productive discussion happening, I'm gonna bow out.\n\nEnd of discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"UF Dan","date":"2018-12-31T08:06:43.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah It's pretty clear that your stance is \"Punish all AFKS, regardless of whether they deserve it or not, whether its a 4v5 or a 1v100, whether the entire team unanimously decides to give up or not\". \n\nSo I'll leave you with 2 quick things since you seem real eager to wrap up this argument.\n\nHere's The Pyke's Match History: https://imgur.com/a/hQ1yu1x\nThis 15 Minute theory of yours seems to be wrong.

Considering you can easily lose a game where all 5 players are trying, and it's significantly harder to win one with only 4 players, what makes you think this game was winnable?\n\nI agree sometimes high elo players give up early but this is a completely different case this wasn't about the \"enemy getting ahead\" this was a non-competitive game period.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-31T03:25:08.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/3qlVoYR.gif[]","replies":[]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-12-31T03:41:58.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play to win even in the hardest most impossible scenarios.

The Pyke Support went smite, stole Kayn's blue buff, and afked at turret walking around. <Removed by Moderation>\n\nGaren wasn't putting in any effort. He complained all game talking about inters and afkers in his game afk csing toplane.

This is a Diamond 3 game the chances of winning a 4v5 with a troll on your team is near impossible. And no one on my team (as they logically should) was gonna play this game out so even if I tried to win this game it would have been a 1v5. It's like if you were to drive out, buy a lottery ticket, and the cashier tells you that he's gonna throw out your numbers if you buy the lottery ticket. What are you hoping for? How are you gonna win? \n\nI'm not a masochist and I'm assuming neither are you.

It was impossible any way you look at it. It wasn't just an afk, it was someone INTENTIONALLY trying to lose the game. Who knows what he would have done if the game kept dragging on? Not only that the \"I don't want to lose LP\" attitude suddenly became a \"I want to end this game and move on to a real one\" for the other 9 players. It's not just about losing lp, it's about no one having fun and those people wanting to find an ACTUAL fun, competitive game they SIGNED UP FOR in the first place, and choosing to move on. That game was lost, everyone accepted their LP loss.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
