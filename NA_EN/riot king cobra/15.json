I have a question about her though:\r\n\r\nIs Twin Fang's CDR reset now a flat .5 seconds (reset on cast) or is it still .5 seconds + travel time of the spell (resets on hit)?\r\n\r\nThank you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Omnipherious","date":"2014-08-28T00:13:38.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Usability: Now has additional checks in place to see if target was poisoned.\n\nDepends on how you interpret this I suppose.","replies":[]}]}
