I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.14 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-714-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\r\n\r\nKayn, the Shadow Reaper arrives to the Rift in Patch 7.14 along with a number of other changes. Alistar&#039;s ultimate has received a buff to the damage reduction he gets from it, Caitlyn&#039;s attack speed growth has been lowered more, Cho&#039;Gath, Diana, and Singed have all received a small amount of gameplay changes, and a number of other champions in need of attention have as well. In addition to champion changes, a number of items have changed as well - we made modifications to Thornmail, Randuin&#039;s, and some of the Lethality items. \r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\r\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-07-12T21:45:17.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"are syndra and orianna set for nerfs?

She received a damage *increase* levels 1-4 thanks to the AP ratio buff. She then immediately suffers a damage *decrease* at level 5 until around 575 AP--or, practically equivalent at around 450 AP, then equal at 575, and a buff past that. So, her early game Q was improved (something that was pointedly stripped away from her in the past before) by around 5-15 points of damage off the AP ratio. While stripping the base damage doesn't neatly clean that up, and she'll still get *some* benefit unless it's an overkill nerf, it won't be as nearly as impactful as it is currently.","replies":[{"poster":"playtestpenguin","date":"2017-07-13T16:51:53.674+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the post (as always, love reading your Syndra analysis).

This has been like this for quite a long while, why change it now? and can we make ability specific nerfs appear in the champion section, rather than the bugfix one? obviously the swain crows from fountain are a bug fix but the changes to anivia's R are a nerf.

I believe these are framework-esque changes that will likely affect more champions in the future.

We aren't done with the vision changes yet, but this was a good first step.\nWe feel like champions with incidental vision granting abilities do not have to take sufficient risks and makes for a worse game holistically (champions being forced to facecheck or pay a set cost [eg. use a ward]) is something that we feel all champions should be held to, unless their abilities explicitly allow them to bypass this (eg. hawkshot).\nFor reference, I didn't make this change, but OK'd it.\"\n\n-- phroxz0n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kirwis","date":"2017-07-12T23:05:14.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Meddler,\nHow do you feel about the current state of Ryze?\nWill there be some balance changes in the near future?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-07-13T00:09:49.353+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not Meddler, but I personally think Ryze is on the weak side (at least in solo queue).

Both forms have their place and IMO Slayer is slightly stronger, but assassin is much higher skill cap so Slayer will probably appear significantly stronger for a while.\n5) I think this was generally a power neutral or slight buff change to Ghostblade with the Lethality scaling changes, extra MS, and extra Lethality\n6) We wanted to make it a more attractive first item so making it require you to have other sources of Lethality didn't really make sense.\n7) She's strong atm, not sure to the point she needs nerfs.\n8) I agree that the DFT nerfs to AD went too far and the issue at the time was more Lethality items.

After playing with her for a few days,  her early game took quite the hit.  particularly jungle and top lane as I feared.  In jungle, she doesn't stay as healthy.  Keep in mind I don't do the Penetration runes very much anymore, mainly attack speed.  her kit at level 2 is underwhelming as you would often throw your q and w in rapid succession, so, trying to play the mini game to keep her new passive going  is annoying.  Net loss to her jungling ability, which as you may know, she tends to power farm till 6.  Her pre 6 trading and dueling took hits as well in lane phase, most notably in the top lane.  I would go back to static 20% attack speed, leave the mana gain on third hit cleave, as you did nerf the Doran's rings she fairly famously used in multiples, as it is better for penetration builds as well as attack speed builds. The extra attack speed off her other abilities on e hasn't really come into play much yet that I have seen.  Again, on spellblade champions, Jax, Irelia, Diana, Fizz, Ezreal, etc, quite often you can't quite maximize their spellblade procs as much as one would like.  It is generally better to throw what you have when you can, her new passive feels really bad when I do a catch combo on her as I thought it would.  But, those rare times where you get to hit the rift scuttle 2 times then, dive into the enemy team and feel quite glorious at the instant triple kill, or more.\n\nAlso the odd attack damage runes which I have been experimenting more of lately, that was a rarity I did with her as well as full tank Diana on occasion, may become the norm with her the old Titanic Trinity Force builds work well on her as an ad bruiser, since her ap bruiser is basically nerfed down horribly.  She really misses the early Negatron Cloak for the Old Abyssal Scepter for early tankiness and survivability mid lane in particular.   Twisted Treeline, she is oddly ok with MoonFlair spellblade servicing both her armor and magic resist needs, but, generally you are more concerned with the Rift rather than anywhere else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geneman","date":"2017-07-15T18:31:20.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The vision score, which was implemented a couple patches ago, is very very useful.
