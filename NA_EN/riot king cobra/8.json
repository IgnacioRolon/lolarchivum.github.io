I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.16 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-716-notes).\n\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\n\nThe major goal of 7.16 was balance towards high-level competitive play. We&#039;re hitting Caitlyn (more), Ancient Coin, Cinderhulk, and a slew of mid laners. \n\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\n\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir\nChristy &quot;Ender L&quot; Frierson\nChristopher &quot;Auberaun&quot; Roberts\nNick &quot;Endstep&quot; Frijia\nNabi \"Novalas\" Barak","replies":[{"poster":"Vallalan","date":"2017-08-09T23:07:07.190+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"you guys do a mostly good job, but very serious question:\n\nhow the fuck did Duskblade get through you guys without one of you saying \"wow this shit is busted\"\n\nand side question: are you the same King Cobra who mods Dekar's stream?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-08-09T23:12:22.608+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"To answer the side question: No we're different people. :P","replies":[{"poster":"theepicdominator","date":"2017-08-10T00:30:41.475+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot King Cobra,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=b9Jf5xTa,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-08-09T23:12:22.608+0000)\n>\n> To answer the side question: No we&#x27;re different people. :P\n\nSmooth dodge of the actual question.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2017-08-11T00:15:11.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To answer the real question: It was a late change in our pipeline that we weren't able to give our due diligence to.

Do you know if anyone is looking at Tahm Kench at the moment? He's in a really bad place right now. I don't want to copy-paste all the stuff again, but the short version is:\n\n* his grey health healing is in the toilet, he lost his long range melee AA\n* all his laning abilities are minion-blockable skillshots\n* he has a large hit box which makes him get stuck in waves (compounded by aforementioned loss of range)\n* his damage vs minions and monsters was nerfed when damage was taken off his ult\n* he can hardly jungle anymore due to grey health regen + loss of damage + inability to eat buffs\n\nHis win rate, depending on which site you visit, is reported as 42-47% in any of his roles (support, top, jg). He really needs some attention. Do you know if he's on the map? I think what most Kench folks such as myself would like to see is a buff to his grey health poke healing, the return of his AA range, to make his passive do full damage on minions and monsters, and to let him 3-stack on blue/red buff so that he can eat them like enemy champions. That would help him out in so many ways without hopefully pushing him over any edges. I would wager, in fact, that he would still be below 50% win rate, but at least he would be more fun.\n\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2017-08-11T01:25:30.624+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't think I will be able to provide you with an answer you will be happy with, but I'll do my best to at least provide some insight.\n\nFirst, I don't believe there is currently any work planned for TK (subject to change, but playtest team doesn't generally decide what does/doesn't get attention).  \n\nSecond, TK is a tough one to address properly.  When a champion has so much potential in a single ability when used optimally (the devour), but isn't particularly good if you mess it up, it is difficult to balance a champion for all ranges of players.  Currently, TK is actually seeing some pro play, simply because of being able to save a teammate from an otherwise guaranteed kill.  With that said, it is unfortunately difficult for us to get him in an acceptable spot for regular play (I agree with you that he is a sad frog as it is now) without making him a top priority in pro play (similar to the azir problem)\n\nMy best guess is he will need some pretty substantial work to address this type of problem, and nothing is planned as it is now.  Sorry for not having better news to share.","replies":[{"poster":"Nebuul","date":"2017-08-11T06:29:43.415+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding, Afic. Good news or not, it's just nice to have an idea of where he stands. It sounds like Riot's between a rock and a hard place with him to prevent him from dominating the professional scene.\n\nIf you all are looking for ways to unbench the Kench while keeping his W ally devour under control, I know I'm only a gold player, but I played him a lot and have some ideas:\n\n1. Remove the speed boost when running towards enemies while an allied champion is devoured. Originally, he got a speed boost no matter what direction he ran. I believe that completely removing this mechanic would be healthy.\n2. Make the allied champion regurgitation a short channel (like 0.5s) with similar functionality to the Edge of Night active. That way, the enemy team can stick on Kench and force him to hold in his \n3. Give Kench a debuff when holding an allied champion that increases the effect of CC on him. That way, it's easier to stick to him.\n\nIf you did these things, then yes Kench could still save people, but it would remove a lot of power. It would make it easier for the enemy team to recover. It would, for example, make Ashe an excellent counter ADC to an enemy Kench because her extra-slow arrows would allow her to more easily stick to him and deal with him for 6 seconds without needing to worry about his ADC popping out and re-entering the fray.\n\nAnyhow, I get that it isn't your department to deal with these changes, but I would very much like to enjoy playing Kench again and feel like I was something other than a walking Zhonya's. Maybe you can let The Right People know that Kench players would like to eventually see some love :-)\n\n\nThanks again for answering. It's nice to at least know the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2017-08-11T20:17:30.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that it would be beneficial to nerf the ally devour scenario in some way for sure.

As a top laner, he wants to do all that and also massive amounts of damage while being basically unkillable. As a jungler, ditto, but for monsters.\n\nRiot generally seems to like him best when he's a support (and lord knows so does everybody else), so it might behoove whoever does design work on the frog in the future to start by realizing that he needs to be rather more sharply limited kit-wise.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2017-08-11T20:16:23.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep, that would definitely be a good starting point =)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2017-08-09T23:15:35.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't really understand the Cassiopeia changes.\n\nYou wanted her to stop e spamming people out of lane at level 1-2 so you increased her empowered first rank E damage but lowered rank 5 empowered E?

When talking about how to nerf Cassio I raised concern that I felt like a lot of Cassio players were attached to powerful early laning so the early base damage buff still allows her to have a pretty strong early lane - it's just that with less mana she has to be more mindful about her aggression or else she'll run out of mana faster. Is it possible we didn't go hard enough when considering the nerfs to the other mid laners? Entirely possible. But that's the idea behind that change.\n\nRegarding the mid-game damage nerfs to Twin Fang, for a champion that arguably builds the most late-game scaling build out of all the mages (triple ap/mana items into Liandry/Void/Deathcap), she still manages to spike pretty hard mid game off of Twin Fang's base damage. By lowering base damage, we're hoping that opponents have a bit more opportunity to capitalize on the fact that Cass is looking to scale into late game, and, by pushing the damage into her AP ratio, when Cass does get to late game she's actually more powerful than before.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2017-08-09T23:30:10.303+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot King Cobra,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=b9Jf5xTa,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-08-09T23:25:54.920+0000)\n>\n> There&#x27;s more context to wanting the changes than just &quot;stop E spamming people out of lane&quot;.\n\nAs a general comment, if there is more context to a balance change, it should be explained better in the patch notes.

Some ADC fixes and more support items to compete with Censer would solve the problem, but unfortunately supports are seen as the ADC's bitch even though we're really the ones that win the lane, make/enable the plays that win the game, and are far more essential that some marksman who couldn't survive or do his job without the support's utility. \nUnfortunately as long as ADC's are the powerhouses of the game supports will not be able to have decent stats or items because that would empower the ADC's way too much and cause supports to be seen as OP, even though if ADC's were weakened just a bit and more of their power was channeled into the support we would finally see a semblance of bot lane balance. Think of it like this the bot lane power level needs to always equal \"1\" to be balanced which leaves infinite combinations of ADC-Support power; ideally they should both be \".5\"'s but more often than not the ADC is a \".7\"-\"1\" and the support is a \".2\"-\".6\" and while that leads to serious balance problems it has absolutely nothing to do with the support and has more to do with the power of ADC's who would need their sustain cut in half to be truly balanced (I'm talking halving lifesteal% across the board with the exceptions being Death's Dance and Bloodthirster which are supposed to allow you to double down on sustain at a cost). I want to be clear that for the most part my mathematical analogy only applies to the power of the kit, a champ's \"power quotient\" will rise based on build over the course of the game, the problem is that support's are the only class without variable viable builds and so Censer has been built into our power allowance because we HAVE to take it or it hurts our team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-08-10T20:11:03.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because {{item:3031}} + {{item:3087}} = late game and champs like Draven, Twitch and Tristana, maybe Kog too are busted. \nAlso adcs are top tier in other roles like Lucian and Corki mid because crit items are broken.\n\nIdk but Im pretty sure at least in higher elo and pro play, its generally adc > everything except maybe tanks atm which are getting nerfed","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MugfaceTGE","date":"2017-08-10T17:14:10.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you guys have any plans soon to show Skarner a little bit of love?
