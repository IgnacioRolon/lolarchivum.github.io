I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.18 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-718-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\r\n\r\n7.18 is the last patch to go out before Worlds 2017, and as such, mainly focuses on bringing in some dominant professional picks and lightly buffing some champions in hopes they can find some play. Please, ask us questions about the patch or our jobs in general! We&#039;d love to talk to you guys as fellow LoL players. :)\r\n\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\r\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir\r\nChristy &quot;Ender L&quot; Frierson\r\nChris &quot;Auberaun&quot; Roberts\r\nNick &quot;Endstep&quot; Frijia\r\nNabi &quot;Novalas&quot; Barak\r\nSigmundur &quot;GangIeri&quot; Helgason","replies":[{"poster":"JooshBox","date":"2017-09-13T19:59:33.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha, thanks for all the confirmations I hope to see him at worlds, but I highly doubt it.

I know there are higher priorities to work on, especially when leading up to worlds, but it sucks when the champ you play is in a bad state and in the \"will never revisit\" bin just because they have a 50% winrate and aren't a problem child at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2017-09-13T23:16:20.028+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I agree with you. I was a big Fizz player (well most assassins) and I really don't play him anymore (or most of the assassins in the rework) because I flat out feel we made the class less fun. We were so caught up on making them fair to play against that we broke the thing that made them... them. My hope is that one day we will revisit it, but a lot of people are happy with the state of assassins(mainly playing against wins) so I do not see it happening on the horizon. \n\nAs for getting your voice heard, bringing up arguments on threads is usually your best bet.

The tank rework made tanks less fun and generally cancerous too. This is a large part of the reason why the class reworks, and especially the tank, assassin and mage reworks were such colossal failures. I just hope Riot can accept how badly the fucked up with class reworks and start working to unfuck it, through reverts and further reworks on the worst champions, IMO {{champion:143}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:154}} and {{champion:57}} .\n\nFor {{champion:143}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:107}} and {{champion:57}} I think they need further work.\n\n{{champion:113}} {{champion:154}} and {{champion:134}} should just be reverted, their reworks only made them worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2017-09-16T05:38:33.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strongly disagree on Akali and Sejuani.

Sej as with recent tanks is basically a braindead CC bot. She lost all the unique things she had going for her before the rework being a tank/bruiser hybrid in favour of being forced into being Gragas 2.0.\n\nThis is all before mentioning that Sej is pure cancer to play against and less fun to play as. Everything about the Sejuani rework was an utter failure. It is the clearest cut case of any rework where a reversion is obviously the best solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2017-09-16T20:35:52.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was literally nothing unique or interesting about the old Sejuani, that's why she was one of the least-played champions in the game for years.

What she is now is Gragas 2.0. Same goes for Zac, Maokai, Galio and Poppy. All of these champs are essentially the exact same since their reworks. This is why I'd say the tank rework was such an abysmal failure, it homogenised the entire class. \n\n>that's why she was one of the least-played champions in the game for years.\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/sejuani\n\nShe had a pickrate of about 3-4%, that's far from \"one of the least picked\". She wasn't as popular as Lee Sin, sure but not every champ has to be. She was still more popular than a champ like Kled, who I don't think anyone will argue is problematic because of his low pickrate. It's also worth noting that for this duration the only popular jungle tank was Gragas because the entire meta conspired against jungle tanks.\n\n>I've seen the surveys, most players really liked the Sejuani rework and virtually nobody wants it reverted.\n\nI'd like a link to that survey, because despite being one of the most well read people on the boards on this topic I've never seen it.\n\nAlso if it was taken one week after the rework it means nothing. People also thought the Kog rework was great one week after the rework. Those who aren't dedicated mains needed time to find out just how cancerous both are.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-09-13T20:29:21.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm.. unfortunate.
