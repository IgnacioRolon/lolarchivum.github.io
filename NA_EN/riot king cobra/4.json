I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.20 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-720-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a QA Analyst on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun.\r\n\r\nThe VGU to Evelynn ships with Patch 7.20 along with buffs to Brand, Graves, Karma, and Ornn. We&#039;ve also changed how Sterak&#039;s Gage works and did a tiny bit of work on a couple opening support items. Ask us questions about the patch, or anything else you&#039;re interested for that matter. We&#039;d love to talk with you guys. :) \r\n\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nAdam &quot;Afic&quot; Cohen\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\r\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir\r\nChristy &quot;Ender L&quot; Frierson\r\nChris &quot;Auberaun&quot; Roberts\r\nNick &quot;Endstep&quot; Frijia\r\nNabi &quot;Novalas&quot; Barak\r\nSigmundur &quot;GangIeri&quot; Helgason","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2017-10-10T19:14:02.450+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your thoughts on Teemo atm? He really seems to have flown under the radar for a while now. I know he's still viable with atkspd builds and can be fun to play. (at least, I enjoy him) but I really feel that he could use a little work.\n\nWhile discussing him on the forum earlier I had a thought about a small rework, and I'd appreciate some feedback:\n\nWhat if we removed teemo's current passive, and moved his current E to be his new passive, weakened the poison effect, but allowed it to stack like twitch/darius. An optional buff for his W would be to allow it to cleans slows and provide some kind of slow resistance/immunity during the cast, but that's not entirely necessary. For his new E I thought about adding a cone shaped AoE that hits 3-4 times and applies on-hit effects (a barrages of darts)\n\nI feel that this gives a little more counterplay to teemo's laning phase by making his poke a little weaker while still keeping him a duelist threat if anyone decides to engage him. his new E would provide some wave clear potential while massively improving his team fighting capabilities come late game.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Ender L","date":"2017-10-10T19:38:15.218+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't think we have plans for Teemo in the near future, but I have played some games of him on Runes Reforged. There are definitely some new runes you should try out. The Ultimate Hat can be pretty fun with full AP builds and if you're a fan of the on-hit style, Glacial Augment gives you a Frozen-mallet like slow effect at level 1. \n\nAs for your rework idea, like a lot of our older champions, Teemo needs to have a clear identity defined. Right now he's the Swift Scout, but what does that really mean? If you're theorizing changes to his abilities, you should think about that aspect too and try to find something that could define him a little bit more.  Right now, I think both Teemo's W and E are pretty lackluster. It might be interesting to move his W to his passive rather than the E and make his stealth a a more strategic basic ability.

For 1, it has some overlap with janna's passive, but more lackluster, since it only affects him instead of his team. and 2 because in doing so, that means that there is a high chance that teemo's poison darts will end up being a time based buff rather than a permanent effect (judging from recent rework trends, and the fact that the skill itself is already lack luster and teemo currently doesn't have a lot of room left with his current power budget)\n\nAs for theme, I will admit I was designing mostly from a player's perspective rather than a holistic thematic perspective. My mind went \"flurry rapid fire of darts is cool! and it fills a need for the champ!\" It didn't detract from who teemo _currently_ is, but neither did it really enhance who he should be.\n\nHonestly, I think the \"swift scout\" is a bit of a misnomer, and hard to accentuate via league's base mechanics. There isn't much to actually _explore_ in league and with teemo not having any dashes and jumps, just roaming in the fog of war is a _baaaad_ idea. The most thematic thing about teemo's kit is his mushrooms. I absolutely love them and I love hating them as well. I love the concept of teemo just claiming a side of the map as his own, and making it a death trap for all who enter and really feel that _THAT_ is what needs to be accentuated in any kind of rework for teemo.\n\nPerhaps reworking his stealth _into_ his W would be the better approach. Whenever teemo enters brush, he instantly becomes stealthed and remains stealthed until he leaves, and it has a 1 sec delay after he leaves said brush. Activating his W gives him a burst a spead, cleanses him of slows and stealths him for X seconds (between 1 and 3 most likely)\n\nAs for accentuating his map control prowess, I don't currently have any ideas, but will think about it. How about you?","replies":[{"poster":"Ender L","date":"2017-10-10T20:53:07.715+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of focusing around his mushrooms because they are both his most unique ability and his most iconic. The spell does cause \n a lot of frustration for players not on Teemo's team however, so that is definitely something to be careful about.\n\nI think it would be cool (and fit a \"scouting\" theme) if Teemo was rewarded for more offensive uses of his shrooms. Right now, a Teemo player's skill on his R is determined purely off of strategic placements of his R. And while I think that this should be mostly the case, it would be interesting to explore a version of his ultimate where the explosion requires an activation from the Teemo player (i.e. Teemo places his shroom and stays in a certain range, he can activate it to cause an explosion). I think it would be really cool for a player to drop a mine then sit in a bush invisible waiting to blow it up straight in his opponents face rather than dropping it and running away. Less spammable/higher impact shrooms (maybe they can't be seen by sweeper?) would be more enjoyable for Teemo players and feel more fair for enemies I believe.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2017-10-10T21:48:12.335+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's a cool thought, definitely, but I feel that if that replaced the spamable nature of the mushrooms, it would deprive players of one of teemo's core fantasies of map control. Currently, there is no champion that can control the map like a good teemo. and even with that, it's difficult to do since his shrooms have been nerfed so much in the past (they don't do nearly as much damage, thus making them a minor annoyance than a true terror) That being said, I do like the concept of a remote detonated shroom, but feel that it'd be hard to implement without sacrificing some of what teemo currently is. \n\nWhat about \"big shrooms\"? instead of stacking charges of individual shrooms, he cultivates and grows a single shroom that gets bigger with each stack. 1 stack = normal shroom, 2 stacks = big shroom that deals 50% increased dmg and lasts 2 min longer, and 3 stacks = mega shroom which deals 100% increased dmg and lasts for 10 min. This way, it'd retain his ability to own a side of the map while toning down on the sheer number of shrooms he places out. It also allows for more decision making, \"do I want a lot of small shrooms, or do I wand a mega shroom at crucial locations\"\n\nAnd while I do agree that some consideration for players playing against a champ should be taken, it should not be the sole focus of a champ's design. _All_ champs feel frustrating to play against, especially in the hands of a good player. What should be provided is not sterilized safe abilities, but ways for the opponent to play around. The thing about teemo is that he _thrives_ in the jungle but is rather weak in lane. If the enemy forces lane fights and avoids the jungle, they can heavily limit teemo's impact and avoid the frustration of his shrooms entirely. It's only when they go stomping thru a literal minefield that they incur his infamous rage inducing terror, but they only have themselves to blame for not sweeping (current red trinket is a nightmare to teemo players, and is an adaquate counter-measure to his shrooms imo) Personally, players _should_ have to adapt to the champs that are picked, not have champs doctored up because players don't want to adapt.\n\nThat being said, an idea I had for an ability to focus on teemo's map control is something similar to ziggs' minefield. a kind of \"mushroom caltrop\" they do low damage, and provide a low slow, but persist just as long as teemo's shrooms. (I'm undecided if they should be visible or not. but I think being visible would be the better choice) this will further enhance his ability to claim territory and act as more early warning signals for invaders that need to be exterminated.\n\nOverall, to me, teemo is Leagues \"Kevin McCallister\" He isn't much on his own, but let him set up shop, and he is your worst nightmare.","replies":[{"poster":"Ender L","date":"2017-10-10T22:23:54.582+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your points about controlling the map and that being Teemo's core fantasy are appropriate.

(teemo has a surpisingly shallow mana pool) but if teemo survives the laning phase, he will become a true terror once he sets up shop in the enemy's jungle with both minefields and shrooms providing him ample early warning signs, the best way to catch a teemo is coming at him straight on thru lane.\n\nOr for something more mechanically similar to what already exists in league:\n\nDuelist/team-fight Teemo:\n\nP: Stackable poison\nQ: Normal blind (blinding the adc is _massive_ in teamfights)\nW: move speed boost + tactical stealth (allows for better positioning and escapes in hectic teamfights\nE: dart barrage (allows teemo to better contribute to team fights as his ult usually has too long of an arming delay to actively use in a fight that travels quickly)\nR: normal shrooms OR big shrooms (whatever the power budget allows)\n\nOf these 2, I think the first really sells a core theme/identity better, but players may struggle utilizing it properly. If we are okay with teemo remaining a niche pick, this is fine. The second option, imo, feels a bit more 'modern' and allows for more active skill expression and contribution to one's team but still has the same issue with not being a particularly strong \"identity\" but, I feel it would make teemo more attractive to a wider audience and would be easier to learn and play.\n\nPersonally, I'd probably opt for the first one just because I like the concept better.

Obviously it already doesn't require any execution on the Teemo player's part, so I would rather see a window in which Teemo is enhanced with poison rather than a permanent passive.

Pigeon holing Teemo in to just playing AP would be disasterous at higher elos since he's a split pushing duelist with little impact in teamfights outside of well placed shrooms that is too easily conterable through sweepers, CW, and MR items (like adaptive helm). Which is why at higher elos, on-hit Teemo is the most viable option. If you rework him to play around only the AP style of shroom damage through AP, I fear he'll basically be unplayable above Plat. \n\nIMO, his Q, E and R are ok and nothing really needs to be changed. His W is very underwhelming and for an escape ability is not really effective. I think a buff to W, adding a passive where he gets a zz'rot-like speed boost around his shrooms would help.

If you would be able to revert back sweeper's effect of disabling shrooms, or even seeing them in the first place, it would definitely make AP Teemo more viable. I think Control Wards still having the effect they do would still give counterplay against Teemo shrooms, just doesn't make it impossible when you play against more organized teams with sweepers in their current form. But that would be a balancing thing you guys would have to test, it's hard to say what exact changes would be best, but starting with that would be good. \n\nCan't tell you how annoying it is to spend 3 min shrooming up an objective like baron or elder late game only for the team to rotate with three sweepers and a control ward on top, jg and support and clear the entire area in less than 10 seconds.

Sure luden's echo and lich bane add damage in the right places, but the item that actually gives assassins a tool they want (not just stats) is protobelt which intentionally has a significant portion of its stat budget in health explicitly to make it less snowbally on assassins. I would really appreciate a vision control tool with an assassin focused stat budget (like duskblade for AP). Something like X Mpen, Y AP, and an active which puts down an invisible \"anti ward\" which denies vision in an area without granting any vision itself (which you would then use to set up a roam for yourself or a gank for your jungler). The extant defensive options are fine (zhonyas and veil match up appropriately with GA and edge of night) but a few more ways to press a lead without just having more burst would be appreciated and would allow skilled players to succeed without making matchups as binary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-10-11T11:16:12.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not an expert but I'd say:\n- movement speed\n- AP\n- some \"moar damage\"-passive\n\nuhm...... {{item:3285}} \n\nWhy isn't that good enough?","replies":[{"poster":"Ichi Ni San","date":"2017-10-12T00:24:28.147+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"NLR items {{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} are notorious for having difficult build paths since the bulk of the items ap lies in one purchase. {{item:1058}}  this makes the scaling curve difficult in many stages of the game, since sitting on a massive stack of gold as an assassin isn't very helpful to your purpose in the game.\n\nthe ap assassins in the game tend to fall slightly short of their peers wave clear capabilities (think {{champion:7}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:55}} ). on the other hand, the viable lethality item components are great because the stats they offer are available on a very smooth build order. 350 for a longsword, 400 to complete the respective tier 2 component ({{item:3133}} and {{item:3134}} , and only 700 to finish off the item after everything else is purchased.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Qiyana is SO HOT","date":"2017-10-10T23:11:46.634+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys how have all of you been doing? A question ive been wanting to ask you guys that ive been curious about is does anyone on the playtest team play Akali and if so what are their thoughts on her overall? Obviously shes in line for VGU and all that jazz but im curious what you think of her as a champion not so much balance wise but how she fits into the grand theme of like assassin type champions. Alot of people feel like she feels more like a fighter then assassin now so im curious on you guys take on it. Also with Eve having her hybrid ad ratios removed do you think there could ever be a balanced healthy hybrid assassin?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Endstep","date":"2017-10-10T23:33:34.709+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few Akali players on the playtest team but with the VGU being worked on playing live Akali is a lower priority. She's unlikely to receive any significant changes when a VGU is on the way.\n\nAs far as how Akali fits in classes of champions, I'd put her somewhere between an assassin and a fighter - a diver, essentially, but with more assassin elements. \n\nOn hybrid assassins, my personal stance is that it's unlikely any hybrid pure assassin will ever exist in a healthy state. Being a hybrid isn't inherently bad, but there's a reason that the hybrids that can exist in a reasonable state (Jax, Kayle) deal sustained damage. Burst is inherently problematic for hybrid builds as they get access to all of the most effective and efficient damage and survivability options, whether they're AD or AP items, on top of being able to itemize AD for autoattack damage, on top of needing to be tuned around AP multipliers like Deathcap and Void Staff. Essentially, any hybrid that's designed as an assassin (old Eve, current Akali) is likely to be able to itemize to become a diver, because they have access to the itemization that allows them to do that in almost every situation. At the same time they likely can't itemize well as an assassin because they have to be tuned around the ability to purchase AD, meaning they won't multiply as well with AP itemization like Deathcap or Void Staff (e.g. old Eve's E and live Akali's E dealing physical damage to prevent Void from being as good). In cases where the true assassin path is viable (like season 3 Eve), being a \"hybrid\" essentially meant that Eve cheated out of her earlygame ramp-up time by building AD (Spirit of the Elder Lizard, in this case), then went full into AP to scale into the game. \n\nThat's just my personal perspective - I'm not saying there will never again be a hybrid assassin in the game, just saying that they are a huge concern for game health and any hybrid assassin kit in the future would need to pass a lot of checks to verify that they won't cause all the problems that have been seen in the past with champions like Eve and Akali.\n\nEDIT: For clarification, I was mistaken - there's some exploration happening right now for Akali but not a guarantee of a VGU happening.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galiö","date":"2017-10-10T19:25:16.623+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"Any chances of giving galios old w back.
