I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.10 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-710-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\r\n\r\nIn Patch 7.10 we&#039;ve introduced some changes to Heimerdinger and Rammus. Additionally, we&#039;ve pulled  back some power from a few champions that have been appearing quite a bit on the Rift including Fizz, Graves, Ivern, and Lee Sin. We also went back and further tuned our updated tanks - Sejuani, Maokai, and Zac all have some numbers changes to bring them to more appropriate power levels. \r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nNicolas &ldquo;Gleeb&rdquo; Haddad\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\r\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir","replies":[{"poster":"KeKCroW24","date":"2017-05-17T21:39:51.612+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can i ask you what is your intent with  rengar?

Well giving him an AoE 500 dmg ability that can be casted twice and can be used to delete an entire team isn't better either. Anyway I believe getting reverting Rengar isn't really the best approach. What he truly needs (even if it would be a hit to Riot's enormous pride) would be a complete makeover built around his lore that would be accorded enough time for it to be given proper animations (unlike his atrocious new Q) and unique gameplay patterns and new mechanics tl;dr no free crit, decaying ferocity or W that you either hold so you can actually use it to heal yourself but at the price of ruining your combo or just using it mid-air and getting nothing out of it except 1 ferocity (this is one of the things that makes bruiser build stand out because due to the extra tankiness he affords to stay in combat until his Q cd ends and he can use W effectively)","replies":[{"poster":"Shablagoo","date":"2017-05-18T19:49:28.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really dont see the big deal with him having an auto attack enhancer, its just like garens q, jax's w, or even teemo's long range blind.

His Q is not meant to be a poke spell (something the designer intended on purpose).\n\nGiven the patch notes explanation, does the designer/live balance team feel like players are not using Rakan 'properly' as the designer would of liked? Why is this? Does Rakan simply not have the numbers to entice players to go a more high-risk-high-reward playstyle?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ThEntropist","date":"2017-05-17T21:48:33.609+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"So this is a two parter: \n\n1) I do not feel that these changes are actually a long term nerf to the character. I (and others) expect his win-rate to initially drop however once people re-learn skill orders I actually expect his win-rate to increase long term(I think it's pretty easy to overlook the extra Q range, it's quite a bit of power in lane). \n\n2) When developing the character he was designed as a go in and put yourself at risk, but have the mobility to outplay. When he maxes shield first he tends to sit back in lane and use his very high shield values to just buff up his carry. I personally feel this is a much less interesting version of Rakan and would much prefer him move up and interact in his lanes. Goal here is to incentive the W max to give him more free mobility, increased cc, and increased damage(all in/trade potential). \n\nHe is definitely on our radar though. His win-rate with 30ish games played is in a very decent spot, so once people learn him he is still quite powerful, but if he drops too much from this and stays down I would be very surprised if he isn't given more to compensate.","replies":[{"poster":"megadethfish","date":"2017-05-17T22:15:42.149+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will say every time I played as him I would Q expecting it to hit from where a safe support distance would be for the rest of his kit and it would miss. I think the value of being able to hit more Q's is being underestimated since it can heal. It allows for a more reliable trades imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monotachi","date":"2017-05-17T22:10:46.608+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the insight. Much appreciated.\n\nI suspect the W max route is not as attractive over E max due to W not scaling hard enough, or E scaling is simply higher. E's CD per rank reduces quite significantly, and not maxing E out means Rakan would be stuck with a 20s mobility spell during laning phase, which feels awful. Perhaps there could be a power adjustment where E's CD should be flatten more, so ranking W first wouldn't look so bad. \n\nAll of his spells scale with CD, which would probably demand players to simply max the skill that scales the most. Maybe his E should have a flat cooldown to help with this (Q is already a one-point wonder, so kinda no point in making it a flat cooldown, players would still leave one point in Q).\n\nOtherwise, Q extra range is really give-or-take. It only really benefits less-abled Rakan players that just sit back and poke when he's not designed for that. Given good Rakan players will pull off W->Q->E back to ally consistently, the extra range on Q doesn't help here.","replies":[{"poster":"21782025DEL1","date":"2017-05-17T22:27:31.392+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually prefer maxing W on Rakan.

I mean, just with some math, it's pretty easy to tell that his damage has been gutted. His passive deals less damage once he gets more than 200 or so armor, his q deals less damage, his ult's damage has been almost halved. Even his w, the most iconic part of his kit, has had it's damage destroyed- it doesn't break even unless he has 700 armor! \n\nI understand he got attack speed buffs, but it's incredibly short lived without making use of his w. And it seems extremely counterintuitive- he wants w to do more damage with his autos, but you literally cannot make use of the AS buff and his w on anything that isn't a monster because of the self-slow. While his ult allows you to maintain the buff post-6, what about pre-6? Is he simply unable to fight or duel any champion? I feel like he gave up so much damage for what amounts to very situational power. Was this a conscious choice?\n\nEdit: Also, why was his w changed to only go on cooldown after the spell was over? It amounts to being exactly the same as the old W.
