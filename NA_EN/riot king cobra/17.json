I posted [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/YNYvZHAa-updated-spellblade-vfx-on-pbe) a couple of weeks ago asking for feedback about updated Spellblade VFX that the Game Systems team was working on. We read through what you had to say and made some slight iterations that I&#039;d like to share with you! The changes aren&#039;t too big - we primarily tried to address concerns over clarity by adding some white glow to the center of the VFX and brightened them a bit (The Iceborn Gauntlet screengrab doesn&#039;t convey this too great...my bad...). That said, we&#039;re particularly interested in what you guys think about the new differentiation between Sheen and Trinity Force.\n\nWe&#039;re feeling pretty good about moving forward with these, but would like to give you guys an opportunity to provide your thoughts. See them below! \n\n**Sheen/Trinity Force**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dpDg6qc.png\n\n**Trinity Force In Action**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MmAXoby.gif\n\n**Lich Bane**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/m7AcwWy.png\n\n**Iceborn Gauntlet**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Do1e6C9.png","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-07-07T01:13:15.880+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"I still don't get why;\n\nred = trinity (yellow item)\nred = sheen (blue item)\npurple = lich (red item)\n\nBlue for iceborn makes sense though.\n\nI would've just made sheen a blue, with iceborn a white/snowflake like effect, trinity force as a yellow or gold, lich as the red. Frankly, a new player won't expect the color connections because they likely won't identify the \"purple = magic, red = physical\" much like with damage type shields, especially when there's already confusion (in tooltips, green = magic, but orange stays consistent with physical, I remember when I was level 10-15, thinking blue = magic cause of morg shield and building health (green) meant damage because health bars are green)).\n\nYou're more likely to see a new player connect an effect with an item's color. \n\nColorblindness could be an issue but I don't see how this doesn't have the same issue either.\n\nGranted nobody notices these effects anyway.

Cyan would be fitting for purple and gauntlet's blue if it was darker, but would feel off for red. Yellow would be good for red. It would need something between yellow and cyan, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-07-10T12:52:48.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you get hit by magic damage, a purple number pops up.

Looking at the Trinity Force preview, it's possible that it could be clarified without reworking the colors too much by differentiating the particle effect for the \"pulsing.\" As long as they have sufficiently distinct movement shapes, it could make up for the lack of color diversity. Say, for example, something like a swirling effect for Lich Bane and a squared ice-cube-ish effect for Iceborn Gauntlet","replies":[]},{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2018-07-07T07:00:53.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think sheen/trinity force need more of a difference.
