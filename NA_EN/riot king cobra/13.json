I&#039;m Riot King Cobra and it&#039;s time for another round of Patch Chat! These threads serve as opportunity for us to talk about the patches that come out every two weeks. You can find the most recent patch by following this link: [Patch 7.13 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-713-notes).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on Riot&#039;s Playtest Team, a group of high elo players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It&#039;s our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we&#039;re introducing positive changes to League in terms of both balance and fun. Ask us questions - we&#039;ll try to answer as many as we can!\r\n\r\nPatch 7.13 brings about the new Honor system! We also toned down Galio a bit, gave Gnar, Poppy, Maokai, and Rek&#039;Sai some love, and made adjustments to a number of other champions like Kindred, Shaco, and Kha&#039;Zix. This patch also contains a newly reworked Abyssal Mask and a buffed up Adaptive Helm! \r\n\r\nAll of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!\r\n\r\nBen &ldquo;Cezium&rdquo; Burkhardt\r\nDon &ldquo;Aesah&rdquo; Ding\r\nDan &ldquo;penguin&rdquo; Hardison\r\nRobert &ldquo;ROBERTxLEE&rdquo; Lee\r\nRob &quot;King Cobra&quot; Rosa\r\nNicholas &ldquo;Nickwu&rdquo; Smith\r\nBlake &ldquo;S0be&rdquo; Soberanis\r\nTrevor &ldquo;ThEntropist&rdquo; Thernes\r\nArnor &quot;Hjarta&quot; Halldorsson\r\nBrian &quot;Madness Heroo&quot; Pressoir","replies":[{"poster":"Inundacion","date":"2017-06-27T21:44:31.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi there,\nWhat's your opinion on Malzahar? Some people found frustrating the lack of counterplay against his flash+ult combo. He has point-and-click poke with E, his voidlings are ruining all possible Malz chasing with that damage, and Q has stupidly short CD for an AOE silence.

He's a very unique champion in terms of both playstyle and strengths and weaknesses, and when you add in the 2 different forms to master I think he has an extremely high skill ceiling.\n\nI personally find the Assassin thematic cooler but honestly playing both is a blast and a lot of my highlight moments have been on slayer due to the knockup on his W.\n\nRunes are pretty flexible, I usually run AD reds and AS Quints but you can clear just fine with AD quints as well. While I haven't tried it myself I've been told Lethality feels fine as well.\n\nI think Thunderlords is the go-to Keystone. You already have great target access, you just want as much burst potential/dueling power as possible for your early game. \n\nBuilds can be tricky but I think there's a lot of room for experimentation. His damage scales well with the lethality items but if you go full glass cannon over things like Cleaver/GA I think the mechanical burden of playing the champion in teamfights rises significantly. Using your Ult well and finding the right engages with your E is absolutely crucial to avoid getting blown up with a squishier build, whereas things are a lot more forgiving with the bruiser builds. The damage payoff if you find the right engage and land all your abilities as the glass cannon build is substantial though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sqkerg","date":"2017-06-27T22:26:45.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think about Syndra atm?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sw4de","date":"2017-06-27T21:03:36.054+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"**Thoughts on catchup XP? **\n\n**Thoughts on strength of jungle? **\n\nThoughts on junglers being able to do stuff like this? \n\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/StrongNaiveGullNinjaGrumpy\n\nA 1/2 jungler is a better assassin than a 4/1 midlaner,  all the best assassins in the game are junglers, kha/elise/leesin\n\ni am still wondering when this gank/supportive role turned into the biggest carry in the game, jungle as a role spends 80-90% of the early game playing PVE in fog of war, and get to keep up in carry power with a role that from minute 1 is literally fighting for every single shred of gold and xp they can get, with another actual player whose sole goal is to deny you those resources\n\nJunglers get to practically decide matchups on all 3 lanes at any point, and for that massive early game impact and influence on the entire map that laners could never match, they naturally should get outscaled, what kind of risk reward do you want the roles to have if the safest roles are also mid to late game damage carries.\n\nin early seasons a jungler would never dream of being stupid enough to try 1v1 a fed assassin let alone actually being a better assassin who didnt even have to lane and is not even as fed.
