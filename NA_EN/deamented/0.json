Because I like the idea of playing the protector, the guardian, the every vigilant guard. But Galio does not currently feel like an ever vigilant guard. He feels like a mage who punishes you for getting close, and heals away anything but high dedicated DPS. Galio is magical, but not a mage. He is a guardian.\r\n\r\nQ: Gailo&#039;s Q feels like a stern warning, and painful reminder. His Q when disengaging or poking is a high damage, high cool down slow that keeps foes out, or can be used to trap people in, for allies.\r\n\r\nW: This is the coolest idea. A shield that makes you not only your allies harder to kill, but heals you. Except... I can cast it on myself and make myself do extra damage, heal, and become tankier. And it last for a long time! OP as hell.\r\n\r\nE: Minor damage, gives a speed boost, seems like it should be more useful. Yet it really lacks power.\r\n\r\nR: It protects allies, makes you the target, and blends really well with his kit. This makes Galio , feel like a protector. A guardian.\r\n\r\nI feel like Galio should always feel like a guardian. Braum does. Leona does. Poppy does. (or poppy feels like an assassin, depending on build)\r\n\r\nGalio&#039;s kit should punish his foes for ignoring him, but allow him to survive if he is attacked. Yet this should be done via skillful play not easy buttons.\r\n\r\nMaybe Galio should gain bonus damage the lower his allies health becomes, Then killing Galio if he overextends becomes easy, but killing the allies first only enrages the guardian and making him scarier. Then good Galio players are trying to judge when to ult based off how low his team is, and when the CC will matter most.\r\n\r\nOr give him bonus damage against targets who haven&#039;t attacked him recently. OR make Bulwark more powerful, but ally cast only.\r\n\r\nGive him some kind of love. Galio is so fun to play, but really lacking in useability.","replies":[{"poster":"soh1gh2","date":"2015-06-11T06:11:06.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"at least let him  cast E while moving and do the same to gp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ixoziel","date":"2015-06-11T07:15:22.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is decent teams won't let him get close without using flash. his E helps, but it's still easy to cc him and run. He's very reliant on getting the boots that reduce the cd on flash to help his initiates. That said, a good ult can singlehandedly win teamfights. I have my only two pentas this season on Galio.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-11T08:08:40.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't ment to initiate, so he doesn't need to get close.\n\nHis ult is peel. Amazing peel at that.\n\nIf they jump on your carry, or if most adc's even get in auto range, you merk them","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-11T08:07:54.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His mana costs are really his only problem\n\nHe is melee, and his waveclear will cause him to go oom after 2 rotations. \n\nHe's fine once you get an athenes but damn that is hard sometimes","replies":[]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-06-11T06:09:17.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"why not give him one ranged ability and make the others a spellshield/reflect where one when popped by an ability and on low cooldown, reflects magic damage to the person who broke his shield, this way galio can profit from enemies who try to poke him down with abilities\n\nthen his other ability is an aura that does damage around him to cause engage champs to disengage\n\nfinally his ult, you act as the decoy and protect your teammates while they do damage\n\ndo taunts even make sense in this game though?  why are people \"forced\" to attack\n\n\n\n\n\nGalio is in a decent spot atm, but his niche role is kidn of strange...he's a tank that's also a mage, an anti-mage, anti-assassin bruiser who is near impossible to kill when not focused\n\nthe closest champ I can think of is chogath, who is designed more as a bruiser than a tank since he's one of the squishiest tanks in the game and extremely vulnerable to poke and other effects\n\nwhereas galio can poke you down 50% with 2 abilities and take anything your team can throw at him\n\n\nhis only weaknesses are poor mana scaling and immobility, if you even call that a weakness for him","replies":[]}]}
