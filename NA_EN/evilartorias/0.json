We are playing in the same room, so we both checked our internet and saw that our internet was working fine. The \"Attempting to Reconnect\" message did not go away for more than a minute, so both me and my premade quit the game to re-connect to the game, to avoid wasting any more time. When we exited the game, we both had the message on our clients \"Disconnected from PvP.Net, Attempting to Reconnect\", meaning we had been disconnected from the server. About 30 seconds to a minute later, we reconnected to the client at the exact same time, and we immediately tried to reconnect to the game, only to get a \"This game no longer exists\" message, meaning the game had ended, and sure enough, we were both marked as leavers. Your servers crash for a couple of minutes and now we have to be in lower priority queue? Isn't this a little bit unfair? Can you remove this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-13T22:26:09.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find a record of servers issues from our end as of recent. It definitely sounds like your issue was caused by a **poor connection** to our servers. Unfortunately, regardless of your intent, we are unable to remove your penalties. A big reason for this is because your absence negatively impacts **everyone** in the match, regardless if the disconnection was intentional.\n\nI strongly recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure this wasn't caused by incompatible network settings. If you continue to experience issues after taking those steps, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
