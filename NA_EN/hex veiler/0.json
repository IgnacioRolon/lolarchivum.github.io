It's kind of a joke. Guess it went over your head a bit. \n\nThe mention of the mage thing was just referencing the idea that the last true mage was Azir over a year ago. Just speculation. Being a mid laner, most pure mages are.\n\nThe synthetic aspect was a reference to his mention of an obvious Star Wars quote that mentions droids that were being sought but the troopers got tricked into thinking it not the case. An analogous situation could be ours currently. \n\nBeing linked to Viktor, basically every robot character is in some fashion, as well as most robot skins.\n\nIf you want to provide a link for the article when that was discussed so I can refresh my memory, I'd appreciate it, but I was mostly talking from a generalistic standpoint for the sake of semantics.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2016-01-24T18:04:17.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Gary, how was bring-your-daughter-to-work day?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-01-18T09:44:40.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the record, both WaarghBobo and FauxSchizzle did really great jobs on their respective champions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2016-01-24T17:30:18.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=X85A9IRl,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2016-01-18T08:36:31.629+0000)\n> \n> But they're more repulsed by my bad jokes and affinity for stirring up trouble.\n\nGood.
