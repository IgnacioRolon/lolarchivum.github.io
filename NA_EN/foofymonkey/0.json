Excited to have you here, but not excited to hear about he current issues you're dealing with. Sounds like something is blocking the client from download, so what i'm going to have you do is work through our [Permissions Guide first](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104). I believe this will get you downloading at faster speeds and back into the game. If it doesn't however make sure to reach back out to me for help :) \n{{champion:25}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuckHerWee","date":"2017-06-21T00:28:15.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could always try looking up troubleshooting tips but honestly with the two years you've been gone + the new client update it will definitely take some time.
