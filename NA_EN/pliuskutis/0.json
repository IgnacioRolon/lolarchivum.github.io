There are a couple reasons content is removed - \n\n1)  If a player participates in Refer-A-Friend fraud to acquire IP or RP, then any champions/skins gifted with this IP or RP are removed.\n\n2)  If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf you believe that content you have purchased/received on your account has gone missing and is not due to either of these two scenarios, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  We can look into your account and investigate further!","replies":[]}]}
