I'm not seeing any packet loss from that trace, but we are also aware of the ISP issues around the Houston area that have been impacting a lot of players. Do me a favor and check out the [**Lag Report Tool**](http://report.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/) and let me know how that's categorizing your internet score. It'd also be helpful to find the network logs for a game that lagged really hard, and letting this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) analyze it too.\n\nAll of this is in an effort to pinpoint exactly where these issues are stemming from, so that we can look into any possible ways of helping on our end of things.","replies":[{"poster":"FOX Adrian","date":"2018-01-25T13:30:02.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lag report tool is categorizing my internet at 93 and saying great quality.
