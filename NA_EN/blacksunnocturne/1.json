It fits her quite well, looks awesome and the voice is amazing.\n\nI do have one question though.\n\nIs the voice actress the same as Vi's? Because there are certain quotes (Tristana and Vi saying \"nope\" when using Buster shot and surviving {{champion:51}}'s Ace In the Hole, respectively) that sound exactly the same, just with a slightly different speaking tone.\n\nEdit: \nI mean, seriously:\nTristana: http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/8/8a/Tristana.spellR1.ogg\nVi: http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/1/19/Vi.special3.ogg\n\nLiterally the same voice.","replies":[{"poster":"Destabilizator","date":"2015-01-29T09:22:26.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love her walk style, I miss \"I wanna shoot something\" and hate how slow she is :>\nCould use a tad bit of range I think.","replies":[]}]}
