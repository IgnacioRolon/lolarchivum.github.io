Yes they won and they deserve to be proud but that does not give them the right to go out on twitter and basically slap CLG in the face with this picture and post.  You make comments about how you need to be an honorable opponent as you put it but how is this being honorable.  They posted a picture which in essence says \"ha ha we won and now we get to go spend 800$ and you dont.\"  How is this acceptable?  Making comments on streams is one thing but blatantly taking a shot at a team on social media is another.\r\n\r\n(not sure if this is the proper board for it, but I went with the best one since it's Esports related)","replies":[{"poster":"Joesus Christ","date":"2015-02-16T21:50:05.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh, it is shittalking but i wouldnt consider it malicious or unsportsmanlike. if they said 'lol CLG is total trash we beat them ezpz' then itd be different. its clear the teams have a ton of respect for each other, this feels more like a friendly jab.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2015-02-16T11:21:21.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize that **TSM** and **CLG** have had this relationship for as long as the game exists right?\nRegi and Hotshot have been rivals since they were players.\nAll this trash-talk you see is not with harm intentions.
