But what I really want from you guys as a community is to spend the rest of today, March 1st, and tomorrow, (My birthday) March 2nd, completely 100% Toxic free in your matches.\r\n\r\nMy account was recently suspended and will remain suspended until March 13th, so I won't be able to join you but this was a SERIOUS wake-up call to me that I was excessively rude and toxic. I am turning over a new leaf and I want everyone who is toxic to do the same. I hope that I make an impact in someone's life that just because you are behind a computer screen does NOT mean that you are not talking to a real person. Someone who might have something bad in their life going on that you might be making worse, with even the smallest of snide remarks.\r\n\r\nLet's work together and try and cut all toxicity out of our online and offline vocabulary.\r\n\r\nI don't care if they are an AFK/Feeding Teemo, or a Lee sin who autolocks in champion select, says he will carry, and then proceeds to feed.\r\n\r\nBe supportive.\r\nBe friendly.\r\nBe humble.\r\n\r\nTry and make someone's day a little bit brighter in the next few days, and you'll make my birthday complete.\r\n\r\nThanks, for taking the time to read this and good luck on the fields of justice :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-01T21:23:46.384+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"+1! \n\nHappy Birthday!","replies":[{"poster":"Mathlete864","date":"2015-03-02T12:32:42.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":18,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-02T16:15:17.647+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I was part of the balance team, I'd be happy to comment there.

Better nerf lee !\"\n\nSeriously most of the time people complains about win rates/their personnal experiences instead of actual facts.\n\nAn OP champion is a champion that a lot of people are able to play properly and get an above 50% win rate by themselves without trying to learn the champion extensively.\n\nIf Urgot had a 60% win rate with a 1% pick rate, would it mean you would have to nerf him ? 60% win rate is HUGE, but just the URGODs are playing him. The same goes with Lee Sin's. Currently Lee Sin is played in 25% of games and yet he only has 46.50% win rate. (And there's not a single division where his win rate explodes.)\n\nSo stop with the nerf Lee Sin complaints.\n\nThe Veigar/Kassadin complaints, let them do their job. They had to experiment things. Honnestly I even expect to see his ult change. A point and click ability for 1400 damage is way too broken. \n\nI expect to get thumb downed to death.

That Feb. 24th match totally isn't still on my match history. >=D\n\nI actually had a similar situation happen last night. One of my friends, he's been having me and my other friend also play with her. She finally realized how her behavior has been when she plays with us. Whereas when she only plays with my friend, he says she's not so bad. He had a talk with her after our match because of something I said that was like a wake-up call for her. She even apologized to my other friend who was even saying \"I can see why you don't like her. Everytime we play with her...she is always so vulgar...\". I'm like \"lol yep\".\n\nSo that was an interesting chain of events that triggered from something I said at the beginning of the match. I didn't expect her to have a conscious and feel bad for it. She said something like \"So that's how they see me...I didn't mean for it to be like that... fml, f'ing kill me now\". I was like \"Wow o.o So she actually feels bad for how she acts around us\". So my friend invited her and my other friend into a group chat and they apologized to her for how she's been. Even my friend apologized to me for her bad behavior.
