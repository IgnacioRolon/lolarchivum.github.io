I think he COULD fit into all team comps if he got a little love but he needs too much help early game.

Even poke-comp teams that you would think he could slip into don't really provide enough defense for him (and that's saying something, considering he has a built in wall to chuck at people). \n\nHas there been any consideration to buff his Q slightly, since that's an ability he relies tremendously upon? To say its base damage was severely reduced with the intention to turn it into a simply repositioning tool with no actual compensation is kind of unfortunate. It doesn't really have any significant range anymore, no significant damage without a Luden's Echo, and it still has a fairly high mana cost and cooldown. Orianna's Q, another \"repositioning\" move does more damage, has a lower mana cost, and a lower cooldown -  wouldn't it be nice if Azir's repositioning tool were at least on par with Ori's? Why have a champion based on positioning if his basic positioning ability isn't that great, useful, or reliable (frankly)?","replies":[]},{"poster":"tofutime","date":"2015-04-06T17:38:11.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there are way more ways to counterplay azir than there should be. Since Azir can be compared to a sustained DPS champion let's compare him to an ADC for example. An ADC has to worry about 2 things, doing dps while having good position. This can involve kiting or dashing to a different area to get a new area of advantage while still shooting. \n\nNow Azir on the other hand has to worry about 3 things. Soldier position, Azir's position and DPS. Azir's dps relies on soldier position. if they are out of soldier range, Azir needs to relocate his soldiers with Q which is on a pretty large cooldown being such a necessary skill. Also putting down a new soldier puts Azir in a dangerous location. The soldier planting range is very low. Most of the times waiting for Q to relocate your soldier is the only and best option. During this time the enemy is DPSing and relocating simply by right clicking somewhere or using a dash ability.\n\nCurrently, Azir relies on enemies being stationary or being held down by some CC to DPS. He can maybe build burst but then his gameplay is simply a worse version of Orianna. Orianna can reposition her ball much easier have more burst with Q W and has tankiness to get in closer with her shield.\n\nIt just seems like Azir is worse at both roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RoakOriginal","date":"2015-04-06T13:07:54.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wUaM8fv8,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2015-04-05T22:25:02.457+0000)\n>\n>   If a champ's only effective under certain extremely narrow cirumstances they're probably lacking a necessary tool and/or extremely feast or famine. \n\nehm-khazix-ehm... one of the worst performing junglers for few months already (dropped even lower with the cinderhulk introduction... and only few who had worse statistics - not only winrate... everything - are getting buffed...)... only thing he can do, is one-shot squishies super lategame, and even for that he needs those extremely narrow circumstances... so after several screwed mini-reworks and buffs for everyone but him he now oficially is, the worst jungler in the game...

To deal the same amount of damage I have to use his Q twice, mind you they'll be walking away from the soldiers range or if they were smart they'd take advantage of the long cooldowns and his extreamly low damage early game.
