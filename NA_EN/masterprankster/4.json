Jhin is a perfectionist. He is obviously delusional and wants everything to be perfect, therefore he sees everything he does is beautiful, whether death or killing he sees it as a work of art. However due to his state of mind he sees himself as ugly, which is why he wears a mask, he wants to hide the fact that he's nothing like what he imagines everything to be.\nSo I have a theory according to this.\nHe's an assassain. Zed is a huge problem in Ionia due to disrupting and overthrowing the philosophy of balance. He's a threat, a huge one. Garen is a Demacian, who is in love with a Noxian. A Demacian, a public figure who leads with strength and justice in love with a person who is league with their mortal enemy. Sona a terrific musician with a magical Ethwal. Obviously someone who is jealous and wants the Ethwal for themselves. Vi, a huge threat to criminals. It wouldn't be uncommon for criminals to hire people to kill others. However Jhin won't take just any case, he takes cases where he can do some poetic justice as well as making their deaths beautiful and perfected. After all beauty comes from poetic justice.\nZed? A ninja who became evil and wants to throw balance because he saw a box? Perfect! Shoot him in the eyes and make him perfect!\nGaren? A Demacian who shouts DEMACIA? Ehh normal. But a Demacian who's heart is captured by the enemy? Shoot him in the heart and he'll be a perfect victim!\nSona? A mute who can play a magical instrument beautifully? Beautiful, shoot her in the throat and take her Ethwal. Now she seems perfect, no flaws.\nVi? A criminal turned officer because of some gauntlets? Shoot her then burn her body! That way she's perfect! No trace she was anything else!\nHis twisted mind sees this as perfection. A person who is normal no complications, take them away what made them well them and be the only perfect one in the world.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterPrankster","date":"2016-01-07T03:49:53.651+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please keep parodies outside of this discussion.\n\nTry to be a bit mature?","replies":[{"poster":"Starfish H","date":"2016-01-07T05:01:58.234+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry let me fix that.
