If you happen to retaliate (depending on what you say) it could get you reported. I know you have the option to mute players, but what if you&#039;re having a rough game and someone on the enemy team says something that just grinds your gears and you end up saying something *reportable* back. I know that the right thing to do is just ignore it and move on, but sometimes you just say something out of frustration. \r\n\r\nNow let&#039;s say the thing you said resulted in you getting a suspension or worse. Did someone from Riot check out the situation? No. A bot detects you getting reported and looks for key words you said in the chat. It doesn&#039;t consider that perhaps other players were provoking you. How is it fair that the other players don&#039;t get punished? How is it fair that you don&#039;t get a fair trial?\r\n\r\nSo now you&#039;re suspended, okay let&#039;s go to support and try to plead your case. You send in a ticket trying to explain yourself. What do you get? A freaking Blitzcrank bot that tells you what you already know and treats you like a child. Why waste the money on a bot when after you get the bot reply you&#039;re just going to reply again asking for a human?\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think /all chat should just be removed when toxicity seems to be the one of the largest problems with the game/community. This is coming from a longtime player that is almost all of the time a very sportsmanlike that received a ban recently. I know I&#039;m going to take a lot of heat for this (if anyone even responds to this post) and probably deserve some sort of punishment. It&#039;s just very frustrating that it&#039;s a rare occasion to play a game without 1 person being a dick.","replies":[{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2019-02-11T22:08:00.069+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"im sure theres an option to turn off all chat all together just use it (im sure it was off by default)\n\ni use all chat often and often enough its not toxicity that make me use it and used it multi times for friendly gaming chats (like explaining what happened in a fight or just saying that was close one)\n\nalso just because you are punished it dont mean they are off free and the system punish dont always tell you others are punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Pokelicious","date":"2019-02-11T22:37:32.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of the reason I keep it on is because yeah sometimes you can have a fun conversation with the enemy team. Normally I do just ignore the toxicity or mute them. It's just lame when the few times you get tilted enough that you end up saying something you shouldn't have and it results in not being able to play the game I enjoy playing for a couple weeks.","replies":[{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2019-02-11T22:55:15.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unless you go hate speech or other zero tolerance words as kys you would not be banned for a single thing you said in all chat at best you get chat mute for 10 games then 25 games if you repeated your offense then the ban.\n\nmeaning you do it often or used zero tolerance words\n\nbut ya if you want all chat deleted you already have the option","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2019-02-11T22:09:29.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So first and foremost, you can turn off all chat in the options. Problem solved. \n\nSecond, I enjoy all chat. I have actually recognized usernames from other games I have played that have had a very small community and was able to reconnect to them through all chat. Relying on adding them post game may have just been dismissed. If theres an issue, I mute them.\n\nThird: Is doesn't matter what they say. It doesn't. You are responsible for your own replies and what you say. You also aren't sure that they didn't get punished for what they said. You don't have that information. Just because you didn't get a notification saying they were punished doesn't mean they weren't, just that your report wasn't the one to trigger a punishment.\n\nOverall just go back to my first point: If all chat isn't for you, mute it in your settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Pokelicious","date":"2019-02-11T22:42:14.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep I know I can just turn it off.
