No matter what setting I have it set to, the vertical resolution stays the same and doesn't fit the screen. It cuts off the top part of my screen to right below the timer and score bar and the bottom part to the middle of my mana bar. I've tried reinstalling as well as adjusting the resolution in the bios file to no effect.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-19T05:21:41.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that the server-side file that saves these settings is corrupt, preventing the change to your resolution. I recommend we reset this file in order to resolve this.\n\nFirst, **log into the game** then hop in your config folder, which should be in the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n>**- input.ini**\n**- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these files, hop into a custom match to confirm your settings are all default and your resolution is normal. Let me know if this worked!","replies":[]}]}
