It's odd that we'd have to post here (or in Mechs vs Minions as it seems that would be the only other place) or send in a ticket just to be able to sync our account. I've had this account for a while and only thought about making a post on Boards only to find out I'm still level 1, so it's clear that there may not be a trigger or active synchronization happening between our ingame account and Boards profile. (Yes, this is a test post!) Will this be looked into? Sorry if I'm sounding harsh on you. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T20:29:38.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries on sounding harsh haha, I'm here to help ^_^! \n\nIt's a bit of a bug that's true, and thankfully it doesn't affect too many people. An easy way to get it fixed is by posting here just like you did, but if that doesn't help we can always push a reset through on our end for ya!","replies":[{"poster":"Lohd Smith","date":"2017-07-22T06:25:48.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good to hear that despite the bug being inconsistent and perhaps rare, you guys are still actively looking out for people with this problem and providing the solution or working out something on your end.
