Since then, I have seen a steady decline in the quality of the player base, in terms of attitude. Every season, it seems to get worse. I understand that people get frustrated in games, because I do too, and there will always be some anger in terrible losses. I don&#039;t care if someone is called a noob, or an idiot, or fu**ing trash. This doesn&#039;t bother me, because I&#039;m not a kitten.\r\n\r\nI report EVERY case of racism or homophobia, as well as EVERY single AFK/Intentional Feeder. For a while, it was nice, because I was getting notifications about a player being punished. It made me happy that Riot was attentive enough to weed out the garbage. This amounts to at least one report in every 2-3 games, sometimes multiple.\r\n\r\nThis season, it appears that either the notifications have stopped, or Riot has stopped. My season began with 6 of my 10 games having an afk on my team, and 2 of them having an intentional feeder. I thought to myself &quot;Whatever, so I went 2-8 in my qualifiers, not a big deal, I will just do the typical climb&quot;. Since then, I would say that 20-30% of my games have an afk/quitter on my side. Probably an additional 10% with valid intentional feeders (I&#039;ve died twice, so I&#039;m just going to feed). I&#039;ve had streaks as long as 8 in a row, where my team has had 4 players, from about 10 minutes in. I have seen people calling people fa**ots, ni**gers, and similar. I have reported these players, and sometimes even include the rough game time that the offense was committed.\r\n\r\nI took a few month break, earlier in the year, because the &quot;fun&quot; part of the game was just gone for me. I have recently come back, and it&#039;s just as bad, or worse. I am blown away by the sh*t community that has developed within this game, and how Riot seems to just not really care anymore.\r\n\r\nI have yet to see one single &quot;A player you have reported has been punished&quot; message, this season. I&#039;d say I have reported 100 players, and not a single message received.\r\n\r\nThis was once a really good game, definitely the best in it&#039;s genre, but man.... it&#039;s an absolute garbage fire now. It&#039;s time to start cleaning things up Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-06-17T05:53:20.049+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Short answer, yes bans and punishments do occur, but the problem is with proof of burden. Much like the justice system there are a crap load of questions you have to ask before banning players for disruptive behaviors. Things like \"is it one offence and you're gone?\" \"how horrible is too horrible\" \"how do we distinguish between trolling and experimentation?\" \"how to tell between feeding and practicing and someone just having a bad day?\". The list of questions is massive, and unless something is **clearly** across the line (racial slurs, etc.) \"punishments\" usually have to be accompanied by repeated warnings etc which all take time. Keep in mind Riot isn't in the business of running a Military State and silencing all naysayers. We want to make a game where people have fun and enjoy playing without the fear of bans looming over their head. Its definitely a tricky thing :\\","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schmegma","date":"2018-06-17T16:39:35.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bazerka, are the notifications just no longer sent? I seriously haven't seen a single one in 2018. I have played a few less than 150 ranked games, this season, and I am certain I have had around 40 afks/leavers alone. This is not including the intentional feeders and racial/discriminatory slurs. If I haven't seen a notification, I immediately assume that nothing has been done, and the player hasn't been punished. Riot is allowing this game to be ruined. Ranked games are a joke, when a third of your games are losses, due to afks. It has become a complete waste of time, and it's really not fun to not progress, due to 4vs5 games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SweetRainTv","date":"2018-06-17T01:17:34.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trust me Riot is working hard catching thos trolls {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luxana Crowngard","date":"2018-06-17T01:56:57.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Oh they punish alright.
