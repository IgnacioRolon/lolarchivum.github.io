(Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, as he&#039;s such a rare pick and I never personally played him.)\r\n{{champion:54}} has armor scaling and can forego ap now.\r\n{{champion:111}} can still do enough magic damage to qualify, but struggles due to modern(ized) champions being able to outshine him in every role.\r\n{{champion:27}} one of the few remaining qualifiers. Niche though.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s an archetype I fell in love with by playing Sejuani originally. (I&#039;m obviously not a fan of her rework.) It&#039;s also one that I always felt worked really well in the jungle, but items and champion design has moved away from this type of play slowly and started strongly favoring ad for bruiser builds. This is actually something I found kinda strange for one simple reason: If you remove strong auto attacks from the bruiser archetype (although with {{item:3115}}{{item:3124}}, this is out the window for ap too, but nonetheless, back in the day, before feral flare and such, it wasn&#039;t an issue), they&#039;re a lot easier to balance. The reason was simple. In order to have an ap bruiser, you needed 1 of 3 options: a damage over time spell like old {{champion:113}} or {{champion:32}}, a spammable low-to-medium damage spell like {{champion:154}} (back when he was healthier and also had ap scalings on w), or auto-attack scalings like {{champion:131}}. The first 2 are easier to balance for obvious reasons. A more healthy example than Diana would be {{champion:111}}, though he is outshined by modern champs. The reason why the archetype could be healthy was actually pretty simplistic, when your autos and your spells have different scalings, you have less levers you need to control, which makes it easier to keep them from going from god to trash to godly once more.","replies":[{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2018-11-02T00:36:43.018+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:8}} ?\n{{champion:50}} ?\nIt is really annoying they nerfed ap bruiser items though.","replies":[{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2018-11-02T01:07:33.754+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually you know it's sad when someone like {{champion:8}}'s builds are no longer varied","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkTree1","date":"2018-11-02T01:04:30.612+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Friendly Ram,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NwleAbtd,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-02T00:36:43.018+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:8}} ?\n> {{champion:50}} ?\n> It is really annoying they nerfed ap bruiser items though.\n\nswain and vlad sorta crowd out like 60+% of toplane picks when they're good and when they're bad they never see play, it's difficult to balance them without them just hard bullying melees into the sun","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2018-11-02T00:59:36.275+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"I miss old {{champion:113}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:57}}","replies":[{"poster":"FridgeD","date":"2018-11-02T03:54:51.352+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"same. mao is debatable, but old bruiser zac top and bruiser sej jungle were fcking amazing!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JeaneGreene","date":"2018-11-02T00:32:00.394+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"Idk why there isn't an AP version of Black Cleaver or Steraks gage.

At best an AP assassin, if you go full AP\n\n{{champion:113}} She was a full tank from release, and a weak one at that. Whenever her damage was somewhat relevant, she would be immediately nerfed. Rito never wanted sej to have bruiser potential, only some occasional burst window. \n\n{{champion:32}} AP build is mostly for fun, again not intended to be a bruiser\n\n{{champion:131}} Now we're talking bruisers. And bursty diver is a kind of bruiser, although she probably leans too much on the burst part, since she scales better with AP, and can't survive that long anyway even if building some tanky items. She's one of the victims of AP/HP itemisation being bad, in that her kit wants her to be an AP bruiser, but with the items currently present she can't really do that, she still has to build full AP/magic pen.\n\n{{champion:31}} He's a weird one. Rito sort of wants him to be half tank/half juggernaut. But since they are aware that current items don't work for that, they just made his kit work on its gimmick. He probably highlights why magic damage bruiser is different than AP bruiser: the second actually wants AP/HP damage, the first can build whatever he finds most efficient, since his kit will work anyway.\n\n{{champion:79}} I don't even know if Rito knows what direction give to Gragas. He was even a full burst mage at some point. Maybe he's like Galio, a champ that likes to build some AP but is actually a tank. Again, current items don't favor that, so you can only be successful with him if you can play his disruption game really well. If you can't, then you just stick with tank items and act as a damage sponge, not the best one, but it's something. \n\n{{champion:57}} Not intended to be a bruiser. His kit, like Zac's, is made so you either go full tank or full AP, no middle of the road, and I think that's ok. he either engages/peels for the group as full tank whose damage (generally) isn't that relevant, or sieges from a safe position as a full AP caster, though that isn't really optimal outside of ARAM, is it?\n\n{{champion:82}} On point on him, but it's Morde we're talking about, is there really anything that favours him now? Besides possibily some of his countless bugs? Although Rito said that he should be getting a rework next year, so let's wait and see...\n\n{{champion:111}} {{champion:54}}  full tanks, otherwise even Ornn should get a damage oriented build, and I don't really want that.\n\n{{champion:27}} Unique champ, and current items don't put him in a bad position. It's just that you have to know what he's supposed to do, because you don't play singed like you would play any other champion.\n\nNot sure if I should add {{champion:8}} {{champion:50}} : they are more mages than bruisers, so are meant to prioritize AP over anything else, while still wanting to build some defense.

This would have made him a tank-busting variety of ap bruiser that wasn't as good against carries. If he gets to be too strong bursting carries, you can somewhat lower his (old) q and e base damages until the time to kill is in a fair place.\n\n{{champion:131}} We're in agreement here.\n\n{{champion:31}} The funny thing about his situation is that he's actually much stronger since he can invest in pure tank items. I don't think it's a healthy gimmick, but I'm not a designer or balance staff.\n\n{{champion:79}} We're also in agreement here. I'll add that they also really wanted to nerf his % damage on his w for some odd reason. So whatever they want him to be, it isn't a bruiser, and I don't get why that is, because if you invest in offense, your defense pays for it, so they should be incentivizing it, but they're incentivizing flashy r into q plays, which is in turn favored by bursty ap items.\n\n{{champion:57}} We disagree here. Although they didn't intend him to be a bruiser, with his passive being gated by a cooldown now, and his %hp damage no longer functioning on his w (which was pretty abusive and dumb), he could function fairly as a bruiser. Especially since his e no longer deals damage on impact (although I'm not sure I agree with the bush interaction). I do miss his old ult though. I think it was a good one.\n\n{{champion:111}} was never a pure tank. Just about everyone worth their salt on him before his w changes built {{item:3091}}. {{champion:54}} Same argument as Zac. Put most of the scaling power into his w so he's incentivized to brawl instead of burst. I would keep some power in his e for jungling though and primarily make his q utility/cc.\n\n{{champion:516}} You brought him up, but I think no one would want his w to have scaling because it's like rumble q where there's not a lot of counterplay. So yeah, I wouldn't want him to be a bruiser either.\n\n{{champion:27}} I'm well aware he's strong because of the movespeed/ap items being quite good on him. I do play him occasionally.","replies":[{"poster":"Jackom1","date":"2018-11-03T09:58:42.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Premise: I too don't like that these champions are shoehorned, but in some of these cases, hybrid, bruiser-y builds will inevitably have glaring issues. \n\n{{champion:111}} has 4 ways to cc. At release his damage was pretty low. There was a time were his base damage was high enough to incentivise some offensive items, but it was correct; was it last year? Granted, with CC being given freely to pretty much anyone, he doesn't feel as much of a CC machine these days, but he still is one. A champion with high durability, a lot of CC (one of the best champs in this regard): are you sure you also want to allow him to be a threath in terms of damage? As much as Rito tries to find the perfect balance, players will always find the optimal build, in which he's a damage sponge, cc machine, AND damage threath (as much as bruiser can be), all in one package.\n\n{{champion:57}} Personally I prefer his new ult, as it has clearer effects. I agree that right it's weird to have mao's full damage potential be gated by bushes. The idea must have sounded good on paper, but in game it's meh (and way too frustrating in ARAM). If they find a way to give him relevant, non abusable, abilities that reward dipping into AP, then yes, I can agree on him being viable as a bruiser. But that we easily risk another Gragas case, which shouldn't be an example of a good kit. \n\n{{champion:154}} In his rework, rito somehow wanted to make him a tank that slightly plays like a diver. I mean, as a tank, your job is generally to either engage the frontline, and isolate as many threats as possible, or to engage the backline from a vantage position, in those RARE cases you have the chance. A tank, despite his great cc potential and damage resistance, shouldn't be able to easily reach the weakest enemy and isolate it from the rest of the group, if its team plays decently. But Zac can do that, he can jump on the backline from any position, something more typical of a diver or assassin. But when he's there, his job is to bring said target to zac's own team, and/or cc everything as much as possible. It's a weird combination, but if you want zac to be viable as a bruiser, you either take away his E, such that he can't engage the backline, or tone down his survivability, but then he's even more of a one trick: get in there and hope you can burst down the adc. A champion that can either isolate the backline or destroy the frontline? Sorry but that's too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Acanthus","date":"2018-11-03T20:42:45.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:111}} He has 2 hard ccs. One is a pull type displacement that also pulls him toward the target. I think this is strong, and I think the ability is fine. It has a clear weakness in that it puts him in the crosshairs. The second one is his ultimate, which of course has a longish cooldown, and this also has clear counterplay in that you can use mobility to delay it hitting you (assuming you're not already locked down or being hit point blank), so you can try to reposition. His other cc only limits mobility, and both are point blank, one being a slow-moving AoE that is possible to out-run, the other being an auto-attack root that has a cd per target. With these weaknesses in mind, yes, I do think that him being able to do damage would be healthy as long as it was split between his w and e because his w can be cancelled by breaking the shield, and his e isn't going to chunk you for the full damage unless you're running away. The proper lever to giving the shield dynamic counterplay would be to give him a lower cd on it along with lower shield strength. The reason you do it this way is so you don't have a god mode every 18 seconds or so. This also allows you to add damage budget to it without completely breaking him.\n\n{{champion:57}} His old ult had clarity issues because it was just %reduction in the area, and you couldn't see that he was gaining power for an explosion. They could have changed the function to giving out shielding slowly (which is very visible on the hp bar), and every time they damage shielding, they could have changed his texturing to make him gain an increasing glow, with some obvious sign when he hits max like with gp reaching 500 silver serpents. Furthermore, if they wanted him to have power that wasn't abusable,  they should have put a higher mana cost and high cd on his w, lowered the ratios on his e, and put most of the damage budget on his q so that he was strongest when in melee and able to get multiple q's off, relegating his e's and w's to being tools to pull off his q's.\n\n{{champion:154}} I like his rework, but they can never let him have any power on it because it would be too strong. I recognize this. It's the reason why I would prefer his old q and old ult. Then he would be down to 1 hard cc on his e, and one AoE positional displacement on his ult, and finally 1 soft cc (slow) on his q. Anyway, once you take away his ability to isolate, he becomes a disrupter, and if you put most of the damage budget on his spammable w, he won't burst anyone down, making him a tanky fighter rather than playing a tanky assassin. Incidentally, he's the one I can still use in league as long as I'm queued with reliable damage dealers, so if Zac is never touched again, I can still have fun with him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
