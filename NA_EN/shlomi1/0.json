Leaverbuster is good at preventing whta otherwise would have been another leave, which seems to be the case here if you're timer is messing up.  \n\nThis may indicate that your connection is losing sync and cutting you off.  I'm sure that's pretty frustrating, but the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help troubleshoot.

We can try and get a better breakdown to see if we can pinpoint where the issue starts.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a route to the game server: 104.160.131.1.  Run it for about 5 minutes, remove the IP only on the first two rows (keep the rest of the info in those rows), and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"Shlomi1","date":"2017-12-12T19:16:25.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-snipping for privacy--\nhope i did it right","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T19:24:02.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay some good news, it looks like your local network is pretty healthy for the most part!  The bad news, the ISP you're using (either Telia or someone that uses Telia), is messing up your routing.  Once you leave your home network and start traversing your way to us, your connection takes a few hits on the way which is likely the cause of this problem.  \n\nAt this point, I highly recommend grabbing those logs and reaching out to your ISP.  Usually requesting a Tier 2 specialist can help to review the logs and send someone out to take a look at those bad hops.","replies":[{"poster":"Shlomi1","date":"2017-12-12T19:28:52.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so there is no ohter way to remove this leaverbuster? \ni was waiting like 12 hours (much more than 20 min for 5 games)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T19:29:58.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not something I'm able to do, but you can request it in [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) though I can't make any guarantees.
