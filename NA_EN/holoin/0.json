Lots of post saying that they are actually not weak, but very op. \r\nActually, they are perfect. Most adc's are very balanced, id say that they are the most balanced champs in the game. So whats the real problem?\r\nThere are 2 main problems.\r\n1. Tanks are doing way too much damage. Its ok for assasins to kill the adc in one combo, they are assasins thats their job. But rigth now tanks are also killing adc's in 1 combo. They are very tanky, and also can deal enough damage to destroy adc's.\r\n2. The team does not peel. It doesnt happen only in low elo, but also on mid/high elo. \r\n\r\nNow, even if the support protect the adc from the assasin,  he cant protect the adc from the tanks. He is just only one. Thats why the rest of the team also needs to peel for the adc. I think there are 2 solutions to this problem. \r\n1.  Nerf tanks damage\r\n2. Riot needs to make an ingame tutorial about peeling. Most people dont even know that you need to peel for the dps champs. So a  ingame tutorial would teach people that peeling is extremely important for the adc. It has to be ingame, cause most people dont research videos or tutorials outside of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2017-01-29T00:29:37.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Requiemsfire,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MfG6mIJH,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2017-01-28T01:57:55.836+0000)\n>\n> Because after the ADC nerfs, botlane is even more dictated by the support and the other lanes. In other words, they don&#x27;t really have control over the momentum of the game unless they themselves are that much better than their opponents. Marksmen aren&#x27;t bad, in fact they&#x27;re still needed.\n\nJust gonna leave this quote here. No, I don't think they're weak. It's not about tanks or assassins but rather more related to ADC power spikes than anything else.
