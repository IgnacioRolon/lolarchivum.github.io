Recently my RNG gave me some games on Shaco{{champion:35}} and Teemo{{champion:17}} . Both of these champions revolve around traps and the invisibility mechanic. Oracles{{item:2047}} , a 300 gold Item lets you bypass this mechanic and it's just frustrating that your champion is just shut down with this single item. You don't even lose the effect when you die. \r\n\r\nOverall I wish they would change something about this Item. Maybe removing keeping the effect after you die, shortening the duration, or making the price bigger.\r\n\r\nThis is Aram, 300 Gold isn't much and 5 minutes is about 1/5 of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-07-19T05:42:43.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think there's a few things you're not considering about this, though.\n\nFor one thing, it is just about the only counter-play to traps on Howling Abyss modes, with the only other thing capable of doing the same job being the Duskblade of Draktharr {{item:3147}}, which works effectively only on particular champions (stat-wise), and isn't nearly as effective overall (90 second cooldown). The other thing to consider is that you're talking about a consumable that lasts only 3 minutes, and only provides that \"vision\" in the immediate area around the champion using it. It's a repeated cost of 300g throughout the game to keep it up, and generally it's only effective if more than one person is using it, which ultimately ends up putting a substantial dent in the enemy teams gold, meaning they'll take longer to get to full build.\n\nIt is certainly a good choice against champions like Teemo and Shaco, but it's not without significant cost, and it's not impossible to work around players who use it.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-07-19T07:50:34.596+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't \"work around players that use it\", unless they are idiots.\nIt lasts for 5 minutes.\n\nOnly 1 enemy needs it, the one that is going in 1st, again, unless your enemies are idiots. Oracle should expire on death and cost 200. Give counterplay to the stealth user of \"Kill them, force them to buy again or have no oracle\". Right now the cost is negligible and it's effectiveness is just too strong. I buy oracle at level 3 when I am playing a tank. And many people straight up RQ when I pop it and they NEVER get to play the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-19T05:27:01.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It used to require building specific items instead of buying a consumable, which was better.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-07-19T07:51:36.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the consumable existed too and it was cheaper, but it expired on death.
