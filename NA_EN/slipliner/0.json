Keep the whole star child aspect, and descending, but  instead of being tricked into staying (by reflexively using her powers for self defense) she selflessly stay to... idk protect some wounded people from Noxian troops or like Darius/Swain/Draven. I&#039;m spitballing, but at least temp update by changing away Warwick&#039;s name to something generic/ just make them a background character because it has been over a year and it is depressing to see nothing, not even a small fix, for my star child.

His character is interesting and has potential for his relationship for other characters, but he doesn't really seem to have any real relationships with other characters except Eve and maybe the Darkin, and he came out before a time where giving characters an actual long description was the usual, back when the new lore was still in development so he only got a paragraph really. For example, Evelynn has a relationship with Vayne because she's the catalyst behind Vayne's character for killing her parents, while Tahm hasn't really affected any in game champs. Do you know if we may get some more on him eventually?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Líthillya","date":"2018-02-05T00:49:12.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scathlocke,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=u3dvbWI6,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-02-04T18:25:03.187+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for reaching out!\n> \n> Soraka is definitely on my personal priority list for lore update.

A revered symbol of Ionia falling from grace after lashing out at the monstrous atrocities she witnessed during the Ionia/Noxus war. It made was much more appealing, not to mention tragic, when compared to 'dumb unicorn goat gets lured out of enchanted medow by random bounty hunter'. \nSeriously, bring her back to someone heavily defined by the war, and you'll be my new hero.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-02-02T23:23:17.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A wanderer from the celestial dimensions beyond Mount Targon, Soraka gave up her immortality to protect the mortal races from their own more violent instincts.

And, for all Soraka has seen of this world's struggles, she still believes the people of Runeterra have yet to reach their full potential.\n\nhttps://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champion/soraka/\n\nIt's probably placeholder lore, but I'm guessing that's how Riot will write Soraka in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warwick Main","date":"2018-02-03T17:15:19.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always saw Warwick and Soraka as a kind of rival lover relationship. In the first lore he is her antithesis who welled such hatred in her heart that she cursed him, losing her divinity in the process. In the second she grew close to him, only to be tricked and betrayed by Warwick. I love what they've done with Warwick's lore, but I'm really hoping Soraka's will somehow tie them back together even in a small way.","replies":[]}]}
