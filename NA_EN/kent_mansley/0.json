After that we noticed games appearing in the match history and realized that whoever had it blocked all friends. We suspect it was taken by some kind of key logger on a fake Riot website.\n\nIs there any way we can verify its our account to Riot? Via saved prepaid cards or something?\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-22T03:35:44.429+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely!!! I'd urge your cousin to hit us up through our [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) as soon as possible so we can get his account back in his hands. We'll need him to answer a few questions pertaining to his account creation. It's okay if he can't remember everything, and those prepaid cards can help as well if he can't provide enough information!","replies":[{"poster":"Kent Mansley","date":"2017-04-22T06:15:16.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ticket says we aren't giving enough information to submit, is there any way we can send all of the information we DO have directly to an employee?

You don't need to answer all the questions correctly, just enough that we can verify you as you owner. If you have prepaid info, that could definitely help! Keep in mind that we'll need to be talking to the original account creator as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Boggarol","date":"2017-05-02T04:03:08.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the original account owner.
