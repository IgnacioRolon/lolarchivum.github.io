Just out of curiosity. Is it really fair to be playing the game for 6 years and be perma banned because you gave into another players toxicity? If you start it, fine give them the perma ban. But you mean to tell me that with how much time, money, effort, and support that I&#039;ve given this game, that I&#039;m gonna get banned because I didn&#039;t want to win a game that someone else was ruining for me and the rest of my team? And then say that its &quot;continued&quot; behavior when it was one game. It would be really nice to have some input on what the reason is behind it. The reason I received from riot support was terrible. He said that my negative behavior continued after my 2 week ban. The 2 week ban was deserved but I said a word that wasn&#039;t very nice but it&#039;s not exactly like I&#039;m toxic a lot. I would really love to have another chance or someone else check out my ban. I don&#039;t believe it&#039;s a decision that one person should make.","replies":[{"poster":"Ilovemobas","date":"2017-10-20T13:59:27.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way i understand it a 2 week ban is your FINAL chance to reform. This means if you received a 2 week ban you have to be very careful about your behavior. This is due to the fact that things that you could normally get away with if you were never punished before could be the last straw that ultimately resulted in a permanent ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-11T11:06:49.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were warned at your two week ban that continued violations of the Summoner's Code would possibly result in a permanent suspension.

Its how i enjoy playing, its not really me being toxic its saying how I feel and playing the way i like but if i hadn't said anything in chat and just threw the game by seeing his toxicity would my ban still have occurred. So now we have a predicament. If i never said that I gave up in the first place and just threw how would it have been then. Would they still have banned me without me saying that I didn't want to win because someone on my team was being toxic. Hmm. Funny. They could have checked the game. I did fine the whole time. I never fed or actually threw I just typed it. And the person that reported me, happened to be the toxic player because i received 3 honors that game. And the whole idea of muting someone is to not read what they say. But if you don't know that they are going to be toxic and you read what they said, they react. That't what happens. For every action there is a reaction. And it was terrible in a sense that I just didn't feel like going to screenshot it to show everyone. Although I could do that. But it takes 3 reports to trigger a ban but they only found a flaw in one of the games. Where the other 2 games didn't have negative behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-11T11:24:10.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is certainly your right to not play the game to win.\n\nIt is not your right to impose your negative attitude (your attitude that winning isn't important) on other players.

And if you have really played this game then you should realize that when you're doing good and someone gives up and starts being toxic to you and your team and it doesn't get under your skin. Then either you don't care about winning, or you're a robot. And one of those is the reason I got banned from playing a game I love so much.
