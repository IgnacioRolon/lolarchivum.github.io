Far more often than not, being a champ short in your comp can equal a death sentence for the team.\n\nSome of the ways I've dealt with this is to change my win conditions. If I accept that the game will likely end in defeat, I make side-games that I can have fun with and secure a personal victory. Seeing how many times I can steal a baron/dragon is one of my go-to quests, but you can go wild with your imagination. Focusing on catching one specific enemy champ out of position, stealing buffs from the jungle, going full mobility and distracting the other team with merry chases are all fun options too. \n\n As for the toxicity, a simple muting is always a great way to combat it. Just don't forget to report them after the game so that they can get what they deserve! :)","replies":[{"poster":"ScurvyNave","date":"2015-02-24T03:38:42.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \n> Some of the ways I've dealt with this is to change my win conditions.

The fact still remains that in 4v5 you are losing LP, something you've been building up over time that you've dedicated to the game. \n\nMore importantly you lose LP from an event outside of your control that has nothing to do with you or your remaining teammates skill level. You get punished for someone else's foolish choice to leave the game or never show up for it in the first place. Fair? I think not. \n\nAs much as I want to play the game for fun and believe in comebacks, 4v5 in ranked is ff at 20 in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-02-24T04:48:49.677+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a fair point, and I agree it sucks.

The problem with leaverbuster is that it doesn't solve the problem that your ranked game was just ruined by a leaver, who may or may not be punished at some future point.\n\nIt would be really simple to fix this. If someone leaves for x amount of time (say 10 minutes), everyone on the losing team gets 0 LP loss and no MMR (Elo) loss, except for the leaver, who gets a triple lp loss. \n\nIf you are in a duo and do this, both duo players take the lp hit to prevent duo's from abusing it.\n\nNo one is going to leave/afk a game if they are going to get a triple lp loss, the other 4 players wont all feel like trash either now that they know they wont have any lp loss.\n\nI really can't imagine why a system like this wasn't put into place years ago. Oh wait, actually I can imagine that someone thought it would be abused somehow, but who is going to leave and take that huge lp loss to save 4 people they don't even know. No one is going to do that, on top of the fact that you have to leave for 10 minutes before it activates, so at the point that someone is going to \"be a hero\" and take one for the team, it must already be a point in the game that they are decisively losing. Therefor the team living for another 10 minutes down a player isn't likely to happen.\n\nNot only would this system be more fair for everyone, you don't have to wait for a future payoff of \"well eventually, statistically, the other team will have a leaver\". This breeds toxic behavior, because while you want to feel sorry for the other team having a leaver/afk,  at the same time you think \"well good, it's finally my turn for all the leavers i have gotten!\". This should not be the mentality you want to foster.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-02-24T07:08:29.467+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do present some points that I completely empathize with, but I disagree that an ultimate solution is as simple as you represent it to be. Immediately I think about the really awful experience of unintentionally getting disconnected from the game due to a technical issue that the average player can't fix right away, and then getting slammed by a negative 4x loss in LP. I wholeheartedly agree that the situation sucks, but I cant see the solution being one where a significant number of players are punished disproportionate to their crime. **If** we eliminate unintentional disconnects at some point in the future, I'd say go for it. Until then there has to be some thought toward collateral damage, right?\n\n\nI'm not a subject matter expert in the area of Player Behavior/leaver so maybe my thoughts are off base, but I've heard that the work put in by that team is creating a more positive experience than we've had before. For specific data about the gains from those changes you'll need to hear from a Rioter directly involved. They may not be ready to share it just yet, but I suspect that more could be shared in the future, and by someone more knowledgeable than myself. :)","replies":[{"poster":"deathTOeXistenZ","date":"2015-02-25T04:35:29.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. You are very diplomatic in your responses, which is nice. I am going to be blunt though. I played 3 games today. One game I got trolled, and one game a guy ragequit after dying 3 times. Two free losses out of three total games. I've dealt with this for a long time. It's getting really old, and really frustrating. I know statistically, whatever, but I must be some kind of statistical outlier, because it is insane how often this happens. In ranked.\n\nI understand that you dont want to punish someone that may have disconnected unintentionally, but right now, you are punishing the entire team for not doing anything wrong. \n\nWhat I am saying is, whatever solution is put into place, the other four players should not ever lose lp because of a leaver. Would be nice if you wouldnt lose lp due to trolls either, but I understand how that would be difficult to implement.\n\nThanks again for your time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-02-24T05:26:54.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Also, statistically, an enemy team is just as likely to have an afk/dc as yours is.

Therefore while you are statistically in a more advantageous spot, such statistics hardly expresses themselves in a case-by-case basis, you won't see noticeable results until hundreds upon hundreds of games.\n\nSecondly, unless the game is super-extreme epic fun-times, **you will not remember the good game nearly as well as every single unfair game you've lost**, and that's a lot of unfair games to remember.

It's unsatisfying. It's unfun. Imagine having a losing streak...only to have the bad streak be broken down because of such an unfairly tilted game.

Really apologize if I left that impression! \nWhat I meant to convey is that while the situation is *painful*, it is also *balanced*. There is some value to staying grounded in the math, and understand that players gain from it just as often as they lose from it. Now with that aside, being balanced doesn't mean that it's acceptable to Riot, and if I heard a Rioter say they were comfortable with the status quo in this area, I'd have some words for them behind a closed door. \n\nThe afk/dc situation is something that is being worked on by several teams that house geniuses in comparison to myself. It's an iterative process and it's slower than I would prefer, but progress *is* being made. \n\n\n> Secondly, unless the game is super-extreme epic fun-times, **you will not remember the good game nearly as well as every single unfair game you've lost**, and that's a lot of unfair games to remember.

Is that enough though? I have played since the middle of season three and have been a big fan of your game since match one. I usually do not play more than one or two games at a time and relish the chance to devote my free time to getting better at a game with some deeper value and strategy. I have tried hard to get better from watching videos of streamers and practicing to learn my role as best as I can. I will most likely win out in the end as I have an above 50% win rate so as long as I play hundreds of ranked games I can climb to where the better players are and theoretically will be with more people who take the game seriously like me. Sadly I do not think I want to put myself through that, nor should I have to. It is not worth it if you think about it since the whole point of any game is to have fun. To put it in perspective I do have fun when I lose to a better team. When I get outplayed I respect my opponent and try not to make the same mistake. There has to be a better way, the only requirement for ranked cannot just be to reach level thirty and being locked out of ranked should be a very easy penalty to get. I have sunk a lot of time and money into your game and am currently going to school for animation and had considered applying when I graduate; but, I am very, very close to leaving this whole game in the past as the concept of trying your best only to lose because some child of a person that will likely grow up to be a skid mark on the underwear of society doesn't care at all is unacceptable to me.

Sometimes I feel bad about it especially if the enemy isn't doing too well anyways.\n\nOne thing I hate though is the whole debate of \"Oh, we'd win if we'd have 5 people cause we were beating you early\". Like even if that's true, the enemy doesn't have to get so freaking obnoxious about it. When they get like that and keep harping about it, then I don't feel bad for the 5v4 and enjoy beating them.\n\n2 things people shouldn't do when there's an afk. Though I've seen some 4-man teams pull it together and still beat the 5-man team, but anyways.\n\n1. The 5-man winning team shouldn't gloat about winning and just play.\n\n2. The 4-man losing team shouldn't constantly be whining about \"Oh, we'd be winning if we had 5 people, so why don't your most fed player afk to make it even\". Like no.
