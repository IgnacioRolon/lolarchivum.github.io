Why did you change the heal on blood thirst? Looking at the changes almost everything is fine, the blood changes are a good idea and gives him some power spikes and power weaknesses. But the change to his w seems absolutely horrid. Looking at the notes you didn't change the stats which would be fine, if he still had the sustain to not get bullied out of lane. Blood thirst is a very iconic part of the character and the immense sustain defined aatrox even though he was weak people still played him because of that one ability. It was the best feeling to be able to outduel someone by out healing them and it made him unique. The best it is, it was balanced and counterable, grievous wounds are a thing, the opponent had to make the decision if he had enough burst to take aatrox out so he was interactive. Why would you change that? all it does is make aatrox weaker and frankly your changes are more of a re-balance than anything else. You removed his health costs but also removed his sustain and attack speed which AATROX NEEDED to survive in lane with his absolute garbage stats. Is there any hope that the blood thirst changes will be reverted because aatrox at his core is a bruiser the reason why he couldn't build pure hp is because he hits like a wet noodle when he does. Changing the W to make him more of a tank is going to fix none of his problems and will make him frankly worse and less fun to play.\n\nTDLR - like all the changes, bar his W blood thirst (the heal) Which will make him significantly weaker by allowing him to be bullied out of lane and removes the unique sustain of aatrox which makes him another generic fighter in this game.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"4GLTE","date":"2017-02-24T11:45:59.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler. \nI am afraid Rek'sai will become even more fast or gaming than she already is due to how easy she is kitable. She is already very oppressive with her mal presste when ahead and even more useless when losing.\nMaking  her lese Team reliant  means  that she either  can kill her target in one combo or be kited  to death if she can even close  up once. She has no way  to Stick  to her target if the target is just a little mobile like Lucian graves ezreal leblanc zed kalista and stuff. She is also easily kited by  melees champions  like riven and Lee sin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maxxston","date":"2017-02-23T19:43:40.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gHuszPYh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-23T19:40:37.628+0000)\n>\n> Sort of.
