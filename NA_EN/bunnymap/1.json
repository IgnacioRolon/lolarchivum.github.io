We don't even have to deal in idealism vs realistic for them to be enemies.\n\nLet's make a scenario. In their early days they set on different paths. Demacia wants to be left alone to nurture its art, military, and general culture all on its own.\n\nNoxus would rather expand, conquering other nations and adding to its culture via assimilation.\n\nThey clash and war because Demacia doesn't bend easily to Noxus.

What we saw in her League Judgment might still be the case, even if the League itself has been removed. Her biography sounds about the same as it did before, after all. All the dark, hidden depths were in her Judgment. The military still recruits her, so while she might've seen her powers as a gift while she was still in the College of Magic, she could've still been torn from her family as soon as her potential was realized by the military. \nI mean, I could be wrong, and they could have entirely removed the darker aspects of her and Demacia's lore, but unless I've missed something, that hasn't been definitively stated, has it? This was her previous lore: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Lux/History and as we can see, it's practically the same as we can find in her current biography, aside from the missing Judgment which was -always- a pain to find, for all the champions who had them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2017-03-07T20:11:37.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We see a bit off dark side with Taric, It cares about DUTY and HONOUR","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-03-07T20:13:26.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True.
