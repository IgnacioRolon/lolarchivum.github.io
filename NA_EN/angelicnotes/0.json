I've had Windows 10 for a long time and it has not given me issues till now. I will load up league then log in screen will appear and everything seems normal. So I will log in then all of a sudden everything is Extremely slow, my whole computer screen will start to spaz if that makes any sense, and it does not let me click anything because it is extremely slow. Once I get out of league this spazzing of sorts will stop. I went into troubleshoot compatibility and it said it was not compatible. I've tried running as Admin as well but nothing seems to be working.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-10-17T14:13:22.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Angelic Notes!\n\nIf you right click the League application it will have an option of \"Test Compatibility\" run that diagnostic. It should save league under some windows 7 settings and run normal, make sure to save settings on exiting.\n\nI had many of the same problems, this fixed mine","replies":[{"poster":"AngelicNotes","date":"2016-10-17T17:21:40.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that helped!
