We build lasting friendships and relations and aim to take you back to the social atmosphere of local co-op and lan parties. We seek to do this by hosting community events (some listed below)  and games outside of just league. We plan on running tournaments, hosting/recording coaching lessons and creating team based contests that will lead to rewards.  If you would like to learn more about us, come join the discord and check out our &ldquo;about&rdquo; page listed in the &ldquo;Learn more&rdquo; folder. \r\n\r\nJust to quickly share, here are some activities we do : \r\nKaraoke nights\r\nAnime/Movie viewing parties\r\nLive streams and giveaways\r\nTournaments\r\nCoaching\r\nParty games (Jack Box, Cards against humanities) \r\nDiscord bot games (Currently only pokemon)\r\n\r\nAnother part of what Internal Gaming is about, is investing in each other. By this I mean we support our fellow streamers. In our community we have a level system from a commonly used to to help measure activity in the discord. Upon reaching level ten (can be reached in 3-7 days if you are active) you will receive the &ldquo;Content Creator&rdquo;  which will give you access to a channel to promote your own channel when you go live. However, we understand that often, that is not enough. So what we do to help, is that every week we use a randomizer to randomly select two members with the  &ldquo;Content Creator&rdquo; to be specially listed in our featured streamers section. They will also be allowed to @everyone once a day for the week to help get attention for their stream.  We also occasionally have paid commission based position open for different projects.  In time to come, we may even offer regular partner positions to pay content creators to help create content for Internal Gaming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAs we all know, anything worth wild takes times and effort. As of right now, we are still in are beginning stages and will need help to make it all come together. As of right now, the best way to help is to join the community and play with us. If you are like me, and believe I.G can be something huge and are looking to be more involved, go visit our &ldquo;learn more&rdquo; channel to see how else you can support or join the team.  We are currently looking to recruit moderators and admins\r\n\r\nThis has been Internal Malice from Internal Gaming, and I thank you for your time. See you on the rift summoner!","replies":[]}
