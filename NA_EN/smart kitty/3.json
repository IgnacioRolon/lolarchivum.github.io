Unfortunately for me, by the strangest twist of fate all the teams I wanted to make it except for one ended up 2nd in their region (GJ AHQ), so I&#039;m not sure who I&#039;m going to root for. I want to root for AHQ, since they&#039;re the only team I supported that made it, but I somewhat want to root for TSM because I want NA to have another strong international showing. I want to support FNC cuz yellowstar is one of my favorite players ever, so it&#039;s really hard to make a choice on a single team. The rest I don&#039;t really care about, but based on regional strength, everyone expects EDG or SKT to win.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I&#039;m really excited for this competition regardless, so I want to know who you guys are rooting for and why if you don&#039;t mind sharing :)","replies":[{"poster":"4nth0l0gy","date":"2015-05-02T16:22:31.342+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know people like to trash on 'em, but TSM man.

I want to see how much SEA has progressed when they face NA/EU.\nSame with Turkey's BJK or whichever it is.\n\nI think the most exciting thing will be the CN/KR match up. Though I really hate the \"Only 1 Sub\" rule. SKT has 2 subs for more total strategy. I mean Easyhoon and Tom were on the team when they qualified for MSI, but Bengi/Faker are noticeably better in terms of mechanics and pressure. EDG also have a ton of subs (2 main ones), but they are less focused driven on strategy differences they can make with subs.\n\nLe sigh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ganiklis","date":"2015-05-04T03:48:46.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fanatic and Im NA....that team is so fun to watch.
