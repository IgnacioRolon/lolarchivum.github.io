Any codes someone claims to be selling will not work. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to obtain PAX Sivir. Sorry!","replies":[{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2014-11-18T00:13:45.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*gross sobbing*","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2014-11-14T02:53:30.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you guys ever consider bringing them back around maybe one more time for future PAX events?

(I've heard there was some contract between Riot and the PAX people that prevents it).\n\nAs a Sivir main, it makes me sad that I learned about League after the event she came out in. PAX Sivir (a.k.a. Tron sivir, as I like to call her) is honestly the greatest skin I have ever seen but never played. T_T\n\nEdit: Just read the above comments.
