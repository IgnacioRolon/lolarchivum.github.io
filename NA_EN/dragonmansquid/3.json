An A tier jungler should beat an equally skilled B tier almost all the time assuming equal teams. They're not just marginally better, they're gods compared to lower tiers.\n\nThe tiers also aren't in any particular order, the first champ in the A tier is about as strong as the last.\n\nOut of the champs you listed the best are Hecarim, Graves and Nid. Graves is pretty much a brain dead easy champ, so if you're not familiar with the role he's going to be the easiest of them.","replies":[{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-02-04T11:38:36.814+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nid is nowehre near A tier.

I think they're both very good right now, they're two of the more underrated champs right now and as other champs above them get nerfed you'll start to see them a lot more. Still a good Nid or a good Kindred is nothing to laugh at and this is a list assuming good players.\n\nRumble is an odd champ, he's more of a gimmick than an actual jungler IMO, same goes for Twitch although Twitch's early aggro is generally a more effective gimmick. Once you've played against a Rumble jungle a couple of times you learn how to basically play him out of the game.\n\nGrag's at the bottom of C tier. There's nothing he does that another jungler can't do better. The only thing he has that can set him apart from other more efficient tanks in both the C tier and above is his ult but as it stands the ult is so slow that it's just not enough. Someone like Sejuani who has a similar kit ends up utterly outclassing him, she's marginally more tanky, does more damage and is harder to kite with better, more reliable CC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2017-02-04T14:06:44.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adding champs that I feel you missed\nA Tier: {{champion:54}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:5}} \nB Tier: {{champion:131}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:48}} \nC Tier: {{champion:31}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:29}} \nF TIer: {{champion:75}} {{champion:223}} \n\nAlso I would drop graves to B tier, because while he clears well, he only offers damage. and a lot of your lanes are not going to bring gank assist making him a lot worse for solo queue than in a team environment, where they will actually play champs like maokai or naut top.\nKindred I don't feel is B tier worthy, but I know some people do find success on her still (feel she is weaker than udyr though who you have in C tier)\nAnd you can't have lee in S tier without having Ivern up there, seriously Ivern is so incredibly strong right now it is insane\n\nI feel Xin is A tier worthy, even though a lot of people would disagree, simply because his early pressure allows him to compete with the S-tiers in a game and not be worthless, not because he outclasses the others in A-B Tier\nAnd malphite is only A tier because of the best jg's being AD, and he does well vs the meta champs/comps","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-02-04T14:22:51.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of the junglers you listed except Twitch who I did include and Xin, who I forgot are C or bellow. Xin is probably B. You're overvaluing skill floor and undervaluing skill cap, only listing the easy champs high.\n\n>Also I would drop graves to B tier, because while he clears well, he only offers damage.\n\nHe has good early ganks, in the current meta if you clear well and have good early ganks you're at least a B tier. Graves also has very high burst and ranged carry potential as well as powerful vision denial, he's an easy A rank.\n\n>Kindred I don't feel is B tier worthy, but I know some people do find success on her still (feel she is weaker than udyr though who you have in C tier)\n\nSkillcap VS Skillfloor. A good Kindred is far more valuable than a good Udyr. Udyr can only do one thing, he's basically a bad Vi who just runs at a carry rather than point and clicking them and has less impact if he reaches them. Kindred does something utterly unique, which alone is almost enough for B tier, on top of that she's actually doing pretty well since her last buffs.\n\n>And you can't have lee in S tier without having Ivern up there, seriously Ivern is so incredibly strong right now it is insane\n\nIvern's easier, Lee Sin's stronger. A good Ivern and a bad Ivern are basically the same. They do the same shit, send their rock at you and throw in Qs. While Lee isn't super hard you can see the good Lee's from the bad. I can't even tell if I have a first time Ivern or not. Even at that I feel he's the number 1 champ in A tier, his problem is that he utterly lacks true carry potential. If he has a bad early game and his team falls behind then he's fucked even if he's snowballing personally, Lee can hardcarry if he's good,","replies":[{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2017-02-04T22:06:28.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LankPants,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yY2ffp3d,comment-id=000600020000,timestamp=2017-02-04T14:22:51.593+0000)\n>\n> -snip-\n\nI guess I didn't see the twitch, however I think you are overvaluing skill cap.\nRemember the large majority of players are high bronze - low gold\nI placed champs where I feel they fit in Plat elo, and if I put just east the easy champs at the top, Maokai and Cho would be higher while Malphite would be lower.  YES malphite is not hard to play as a champ, however he is hard to succeed with in the jungle specifically. But a good malphite jg right now is incredible because of how strongly he fits (or rather counters) the meta. He can't power farm, he has to gank and get good ganks off.\n\nAlso it is less Ivern should be S tier, and more Lee doesn't deserve it, because a behind lee = 100% worthless, where a behind kha/rengar can still assassinate someone.

If we're talking about Plat there are good Lee Sins, there are good Nidalees, there are good Elises. Even playing in mid gold I almost exclusively see champs from A and S tier. The only two champs from bellow that I've seen more than once are Sejuani and that's because she's my main and Warwick, who was just reworked.\n\n>He can't power farm, he has to gank and get good ganks off.\n\nHis early ganks are very weak though, pre 6 he has a 0% chance to get a kill on almost anything. He has no hard CC and no dashes and low damage, his pre 6 ganks are absolute bottom of the barrel. \n\nOne of the things about high tier junglers right now is that they all have dominant early games. Theres a good reason for this, a jungler like Lee Sin or Elise can snowball the game out of control at level 3. If you're a jungler who has less pressure than them, like any champion in C tier and most of the champs you listed you lack options to deal with this. \n\n>But a good malphite jg right now is incredible because of how strongly he fits (or rather counters) the meta\n\nThere is no counter to the meta currently. You have to play to it or your champ's bad. Malph jg is bad because he can't play around the early pressure the meta puts down. What he does later isn't really important because a good Lee shuts out the game before he becomes even remotely relevant.\n\n>because a behind lee = 100% worthless, where a behind kha/rengar can still assassinate someone.\n\nBullshit. Even when behind Lee still has good damage and insane utility on his R. A lee who's behind can still effectively remove a carry from a fight.\n\nLee is absolutely one of the top junglers in the game right now, he's about as good as both Rengar and Kha'zix.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2017-02-04T09:45:38.950+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nid is at the bottom of B tier.
