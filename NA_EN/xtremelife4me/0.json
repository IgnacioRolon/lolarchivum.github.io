Each time people promise that they won't be toxic if they were unbanned and fail to uphold their promise.  Blame the people who were irresponsible for why you most likely won't get the permabanned account back, because its players like these that make these promises seem hollow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xtremelife4me","date":"2018-11-08T06:31:04.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xtremelife4me,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=JQfXPE6G,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-08T06:30:08.624+0000)\n>\n> I got banned  by  talking trash and salty ,toxic riot wish u can get my account back i won&amp;#039;t do it again :(\n\n{{champion:86}}","replies":[]}]}
