The bans from today were based off the audits by Player Behavior and Justice team looking for toxic behavior.  If you didn't get an e-mail I would double check your account settings to ensure that your account e-mail address is up to date.  It's also possible the e-mail may have been sent to your spam or junk folder.  The e-mail itself should be easy to spot, it explains the ban and contains a picture of Kayle on it.  It however, does not contain chat logs of the games which may have gotten a player in trouble.  The chat logs are part of the \"reform card\" feature which won't return until the Tribunal is back online.\n\nEveryone that was banned is welcome to submit a ticket to support, and the kind of response below is what you'll end up with if you do.  With that said.   These audits can cause some delay in us getting back in a timely manner, so bear with us as we work on getting to you.\n\nIn the meantime I went ahead and looked up some of the cases you guys mentioned might be false positives.  False positives are the last thing we want to do here, it's very important that our systems are accurate and target toxic behavior appropriately.\n\n\nDetained,  A string of games a little over a week ago brought you to the attention of our auditing system.  Some of the offenses noted were telling other players they have \"downs\", implying terrible things about a team mates' mother, demanding that your lane opponent talk to you in a very harsh and demeaning manner,  and repeated claims that you were going to AFK at any second because team mates didn't play up to your expected level of ability.\n\nMeta Melt Razec,  Unlike a lot of other players you were not flagged for name calling, or threatening other players, but multiple behaviors were still detected which were not acceptable.  There are more than a few occasions noted of not being able to work with your team mates in character selection and either threatening others to get what you want, or ignoring pick order and just auto locking in.  In addition you argue, a lot.  Not the juvenile \"i'm going to %^(& your mom\" kind of arguing.  But the kind that is extremely aggressive, blames teammates and constantly deflects blame.  Keep in mind people play League to have fun, not to be berated by others.  I'd say the plus side in all of this is that avoiding bans in the future will be super easy.  First, be nice in Champion select.  Keep in mind, sometimes you won't get the role you're best at.  It's the way the cookie crumbles and we all deal with it.  Next, just avoid chatting; especially if you really start to feel you're typing furiously.   It's not helping you win, it's not helping your team mates play better.  All it's doing is pissing them off and distracting you from the game.\n\nDwizzle69,  Your case is similar to Meta Melt Razec.  It's not that you're calling people names, it's that your constantly arguing and fighting with other players.  On one side of the spectrum you're pointing out every mistake they make and nitpicking their choices after the fact; on the other side you're calling team mates stupid and bad when they don't perform well.  While you don't do this ALL the time, the system is seeing this in more than just a couple of games.  Again, like Meta you're going to be in a good spot if you can just hold back from the needless arguments and bickering in the game.\n\nJackTheBlak,  I'm sorry but you were permanently banned from League of Legends; something that is reserved for very high offenders.  Compared to the previous two players the frequency of your toxic behavior is simply off the charts.  The system repeatedly saw you berating and griefing others.  This included questioning players' sexual partner preferences, diagnosing other players with \"downie syndrome\" as well as trolling in champion select.","replies":[{"poster":"Cpt CrabCakes","date":"2014-12-02T13:47:06.297+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll go ahead and submit myself to the potential public shaming.

What I found interesting is that since your initial chat restrictions back in August you have improved some.  Most notably the much more harsher and offensive lines of chat are no longer used in your games.  That was until one particular game last week.\n\nBut after reviewing your other matches you still frequently lash out at others.  I think part of the problem may be that you play with a friend in a lot of games, so you feel a bit safer trash talking, or using offensive language.  But it's important to note that there are still three other players in your game, and you should be respectful to everyone, even if you have friends playing.\n\nBesides trying to inform players how poorly they play, there are also instances of you mocking and attacking your opponents.  Since [ALL] chat is completely optional this isn't really necessary.  If you feel tempted to rub salt in the wounds of your opponents I would encourage you to turn off [All] chat; something that can be down from the options menu in game.\n\nLastly, when I read your matches I get the feeling that you think you're cracking jokes and being funny.  But from the outside it's easy to see that you're going overboard.  For example, that match I mentioned earlier in the post, you mentioned how suicide is okay if it's someone you don't like; how Kalista is a whore and providing sexual favors to all players in the game, but then a few moments later how she is actually a he who likes other men and should be beat up for it; and then lastly that Volibear is poor and lives in a dumpster where he provides sexual favors to men in exchange for food stamps.\n\nA lot of it reads a bit too much like 2edgy4me chat; and I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say that's what you were going for.  I really doubt that you encourage suicide or violence against people based off their sexual preferences; or that you genuinely believe Volibear lives in a dumpster.

I have a lot of games played, especially last season when I struggled to climb to gold from Bronze 5.  (and failed, lolollolol silver scrub 4 life)\n\nI do play with the name WookieeCookie though, so I have to take into account that players may treat me differently in game.  I don't have Riot in my name, and I do that on purpose.  I don't think it's really fair for me to be treated any differently than anyone else.  You'd probably be surprised how many people don't notice or recognize my name.  If they do, it doesn't really stop them from... letting me know how well I play in games.  :D\n\nRegardless, I do like to play on an alternate account just in case I'm not getting an authentic experience,, but my experience is largely the same as on my main account.\n\nWe don't think there is any reason to verbally attack other players in game.  If they're trolling then you should report them.  If needed mute them.  But arguing and degrading the quality of chat in the game isn't doing anyone any favors.\n\nSomething that is missed a lot in this kind of conversation is that the game is much bigger than just you and one other player.  There are 3 other players on your team, most likely doing their best to win and play.  When you attempt to \"put a troll in their place\" really all you're doing is making it harder for those other 3 players to enjoy the game.  Instead of one player being a jerk, now there's two.  That makes it that much harder for people to focus and carry the game.\n\n>just had a blitz i told to leave the lane cause he was making things worse and my enemies weren't good enough that i needed him and a smurf lee that's unrestricted jumped right on in with none stop bashing onto me.\nwhy didint lee ask blitz to join him long story short i was the victim put in the spot light of being toxic all becuase i asked the one guy that could leave lane to do so before we lost it. we lost the lane my game was ruined some how won and this lee will forever be unpunished which is why i have zero faith in you guys\ndont bother looking into the above game o dont need the extra marks because you sure as hell wont be doing anything about lee\n\nOkay, I did what you told me not to and looked up the game.  Not because I want to get you in trouble, but because I'm genuinely curious.  I think this situation is a pretty good example of what I explained above.\n\nIt's pretty clear from reading the chat log that Lee Sin was super toxic.  It didn't really help that you started the conversation by letting everyone on your team know that Blitz was \"shit\".  But generally that alone wouldn't get you in trouble.  The problem is you continued to argue with Lee Sin.   He said a lot of mean things for sure and that's where it could have ended.  Because in the end he's going to get punished regardless.  But by dragging yourself down in the mud (and saying some really really mean things) you're opening yourself up for punishment as well.  Avoid that.  Let the toxic players rage and get themselves in trouble.  Ignore them and report them afterwards, and you won't have to worry about bans; just them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EtttJEEtWU","date":"2014-12-02T19:32:08.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, Wookie!

But should you find yourself in a similiar position, be persistent and polite and ask for some additional information.  In such a case support will escalate your ticket so that you can see logs relating to your suspension.\n\nYour case was similar to Dig Nightsend from earlier where it falls under a borderline situation but a little more unique.  \n\nWhen I took a look at your chat logs I saw a passionate and excited player who relies way too much on using foul language when talking to other players.\n\nProfanity in general is okay, assuming it's nothing too offensive, or directed at other players.  But the level found on your account is excessive and far higher than that of your average player.   The issue, from what I could see is that it's rare for you to make a statement or request, without lacing it with profanity.\n\nThis isn't really a case we come across too often, although Lyte did note a case the other month where a player was audited for saying terrible terrible things to themselves, and your situation is somewhat similar.  The thing is, that kind of language, while tolerated in small doses still isn't acceptable in game.  Since you were not targeting and harassing other players in this instance though I don't believe the 2 week suspension is appropriate, so similar to Dig Nightsend I've reduced it to 3 Days and added 25 chat restrictions.\n\nI would encourage you to be a bit more aware of what you say.  Also, try to keep your chat a bit shorter, and to the point.  The time you spend typing curse words can be used to focus and play on the game.

I'm also pre typing my reply in a notepad document to help me keep track of my thought process. I apologize if my use of word wrap creates any unsightly results.\n\n~~~\n\nI'm going to start all of this by doing what I think is the most important thing, and that is take my licks. I absolutely have got to stop my jungling behavior in reference to my laners. I honestly can't explain why, don't eve understand why, but I tell you I DO get so furious when I come for a gank and it fails. More so then any other champion I get mad when I play Vi. I will start Red Buff, may or may not take Raptors, but at lvl2 I'm Red Buffed and creeping into mid lane's bush for that juicy early kill. \n\nI find in these situations my laner has often been too focused on the \"farm to lvl2 or 3 before you engage\" and when I come flying out the bushes with a Q exhaust E burst combo they almost seem suprised as if I were the enemy jungler. I've even taken measures to communicate with my team in champ select \"I like to gank early so please don't leave me hanging\"\n\nRegardless, my responses and reactions to failed gank attempts, no matter whose fault the gank failed was (or just good enemies) I need to adjust how I handle it. If someone knocks my drink out of my hand, that upsets me. I have a right to be, but I don't have a right to punch that person out. When my ganks don't work, I need to be a big boy. This is something I will work on \n\n~~~\n\"The behavior is similar to matches where you play support. I can see you like an aggressive playstyle, with champs like Braum you're no doubt eager to secure the kill for your ADC.

In the end, out right leaving the lane to roam, or just ending up at top lane despite the protests of other players on your team.\" (From WookieeCookie\n~~~\n\nBefore I elaborate on this point, I'd like to copy and paste a post I made a day ago in a different thread:\n\n\"Faith Breaker (NA)  - a day ago\nThe strategy is solid, but I don't see how it zero counter play. The enemy team can do MANY THINGS. They can have their mid leave lane to come into jungle to help vs Fid and Morg, or better yet, have top or mid, and support (only 2) recall, and instead of going to lane they can follow their jungler. What is to stop their bot lane support from leaving lane to follow their jungler to assist? Also, the enemy jungler may notice he is being counter jungled. Does he see you and Morg taking red or Krugs? He knows he can go bot and even if they have wards or not (enemy can buy pinks too) your cait is going up against a potential 3 v 1 situation. If the jungler stays in bot lane they can push 2 waves of minions into the turret before you go bot to change the situation.\n\nValid strat, I myself have personally been a support that has left my adc to support top lane or perma leash the jungler. I have done this in games where me and my adc are not working well together, maybe one of us is harassing the other. My solution isn't to troll or rage or quit or feed, I take my role (support) and I find another ally to support. You aren't breaking the games rules by roaming (LCS) and there is no rule that says the support has to be glued to the adc's butt.\n\nJust keep in mind while this strat WILL plow many peope's teams, you will find an enemy team that will adequately respond to this threat, and assign extra assistance either to their own jungler, or give up their jungle in exchange for added pressure top and bot. Think I'll go pick up Annie and hop and skip around with my jungler now.\" (Faith Breaker)\n\nI want to digress, when I roam from bot lane it is NOT to pout, or show my anger. I watched some LCS matches for last year, and something I saw confused me: Lane rotations. People would recall and go to different lanes, \"rotating\", and often times out right roam to another lane. This was strange to me, but I learned the tactical reason behind it. I began to use it myself, but for different reasons. In the past, I'd get mad ( at my ADC) and the pattern of toxic behavior that would emerge would only perpatuate.\n\nWhen I roam, it do it as a method to PREVENT my toxicity. It is my personal strategy I use to prevent myself from raging and growing negative. I don't do this out of toxicity, I do it to stop it from happening. If I stay in the lane with the person I'm angry at, our gameplay won't have synergy, and we will be busy pausing our play to type bad things to each other. It's hard to stay in this lane, and continue to interact, and literally support someone you don't like.\n\nSo I roam to other lanes, to \"reset\" my anger and start fresh. Yes I've had some top lanes protest and spam ping for me to back away. But you know what WookieeCookie? I've had top laners GRATEFUL I came top. I've had Jax and Garen players adore the fact I've come to the rescue. We've won games where I've done this. Supporting bot didn't work, so I went to support top. Me and Top found great team work. We did so well our jungler didn't have to worry about ganking for top because I was there. \n\nTo quote you again regarding my issue of roaming\n\n\"WookieeCookie (NA)  - 8 days ago  NEW\nTo be honest, I would actually consider his infractions to be worse than someone who merely tells another to \"go fuck themselves\".

It's a team game after all, and will require a team working together to win.\n\nIntentionally throwing a game or refusing to cooperate because a person didn't do what you expected them to do or because they made one mistake, or misunderstood a message is unacceptable.\"\n\n\nPlease explain to me how going to a different lane, supporting a different champ, and continuing to serve my role is throwing the game? Please explain to me how I ruin the game for EVERYONE by stopping Fiora from manhandling Nasus? My own self imposed restrictions that I use to keep myself from getting toxic are seen as direct and outright blatant actions of toxicity? Are you telling me every LCS match is full of roaming trolls throwing the game? No you won't , because it's not true. Why do you declare my choice to go to another lane and continue to perform my role elsewhere as a sign of me just basically saying screw this game? Forgive me, but you sound like you are singling me out because you say many different things, that lack consistency.\n\n\n\"Eotw (NA)  - 8 days ago\nAbandoning the ADC to go troll the top laner is pretty much throwing the game.\"\n\n\nI'd rather you kept your opinions to yourself, you don't have access to my previous games or logs.
