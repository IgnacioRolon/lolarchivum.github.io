Generally it is at any random point after a game has loaded, and has happened up to 3 or 4 times in a single match. What happens is my game will randomly freeze up for a few seconds and then minimize to the desktop, my cursor will be stuck as the league Glove and the music will continue to play. I cant Alt+Tab out of this, it is completely locked that way. I get no bug splat or crash message it just freezes like that. My only solution has been to ctrl+alt+delete, and kill the not-responding league process, at which point im given the option to reconnect. \r\nI doubt this is a graphical problem as i play far more intensive games than league without any issues. Ive tried updating DirectX, reinstalling League in general, updating my framework, playing with graphics on minimal settings, setting League to high-priority through task manager, closing all background applications. Nothing seems to affect it at all. \r\nIm thinking im a victim of the Swain-Patch bugs but im not sure as i get no crash/splat report to check out.\r\nRunning from Windows 7 64bit. \r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, as im currently stuck with 10 minute punishment for 5 games because i occasionally DC right at the end of a game and its counted as a leave.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-31T22:29:28.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware what the *Swain-patch bugs* are, but I've seen this issue before. It usually occurs as a result of League having an issue communicating with your display device. I suggest working through our [*Crashing Guide*](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) since it covers the most common solutions for this issue.\n\nLet me know if you continue to see this issue.","replies":[]}]}
