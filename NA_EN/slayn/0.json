When you say league crashes, can you provide some more details?  For example, does the loading screen appear at all?  What do you see?  Are there any error messages and what does it say?  Until this is resolved, you may want to stick to custom games to troubleshoot.

So as soon as the game goes into the loading screen my whole screen goes black and my mouse turns into a little blue circle. A few seconds after the screen is black, a message pops up saying I need to try to reload the client, and two options are shown \"reload\" or \"cancel\" either one I click nothing happens. I then ult tab out, and either close league of legends from the taskbar. When I close League from the taskbar, it brings me back to league, but it says \"Your game has crashed, please reload the client\" or something along those lines and in the little orange box it says reload. If I click reload, the whole cycle just happens over again. If I click the X button to quit out of league at the top right of the screen, League closes, and then when I turn it back on and log in, the whole cycle happens over again. If I go into task manager, and end all the league tabs, and log back in the cycle just happens over and over again. I have even tried right clicking on the league aplication and \"running as administrator\" but still I get a black screen... I really want bronze 4 back :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IIIAlphaDrakeIII","date":"2017-03-13T19:13:56.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/XYP8e32d-i-know-how-to-fix-the-latest-bug-march-2017","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xs and Os","date":"2016-08-16T18:44:47.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issues with the client, when I'm waiting in champion select it crashes, when i go and click the hextech crafting it crashes.
