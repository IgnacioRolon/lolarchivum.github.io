It's important to find out what's causing this and stop that from happening!  I'd like to help but I could use some more information to what's happening.  Are you receiving any errors?  Are you doing anything just before the crash like trying to change masteries?  Did you open up hextech crafting while waiting in queue?  Any detail can help a lot!","replies":[{"poster":"Slayn","date":"2016-08-08T20:02:43.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had opened up the shop, and was looking at different champions","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naenia","date":"2016-08-05T22:01:05.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had some crashes while a game was loading (luckily, it wasn't ranked, so no LP loss) and I did get a low priority queue for it. But I'm sure this happens to a lot of people who were playing ranked. So my question to Riot is: Is there a way you guys can determine if a person intentionally left a game rather than their computers having technical issues (which can be out of the summoner's control) because if so, there shouldn't be a penalty for people who did not leave intentionally. I would be quite upset if I kept getting penalized (LP loss, low priotity queue, bans, etc) for my computer crashing. I hope that makes sense LOL. It sounded good in my head ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Naenia","date":"2016-08-05T22:02:50.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additionally, even if there still has to be some kind of penalty, can it be a lighter penalty than someone who actually did leave intentionally?","replies":[{"poster":"Adinymis","date":"2016-08-05T23:35:46.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think it would be hard to tell from a technical perspective if someone left intentionally or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Naenia","date":"2016-08-06T04:41:52.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I was asking if it would be possible or not because IDK","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Minuteman Yancy","date":"2016-08-06T07:46:10.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its happened to me twice got banned for dodging for half an hour. if i recall i had clicked the shop before the queue popped or something like that and then champ select started fine and then all of a sudden it said lolclient has crashed and had to close","replies":[]}]}
