And you wanted the role be more appealing... Yes... in 10 years because nobody will play enchanters again, it will be again tank meta or full of mid laners as supports (welcome veigar).\n\nSo why did they do this? And don&#039;t tell me they wanted to cut their power because after the insane nerfs to ardent they are not even good, also they are the most team realiant champions.\n\nSo? :/ Opinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Ventira","date":"2017-11-06T21:44:06.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Akali is melee and has no access to disruption and damage mitigation besides stealth.

They did not get basic attack damage upgrade because they do not last hit. They did not gain MR because no one did, which is a blanket buff to magic damage.\n\nAnd if you want your enchanter tankier go resolve/sorc instead of Insp/dom.","replies":[{"poster":"x Wyvern x","date":"2017-11-07T01:42:08.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone got armor, even adcs, but they also got health and health per level, and some even AD, so thats not excuse, they had armor, magic resist, health and sometimes even ad in runes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shad√≤w","date":"2017-11-06T21:28:21.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because this shit has been dominating the META too long now.\n\nNo need for this to drag beyond preseason.","replies":[]}]}
