But i usually dont step in , i mute people that are flaming and report them after the game. I even have a story that a guy that i reported got banned and posted on the forums but anyway.\nSo me the adc and mid went for herald and i took it . The adc got mad at me cuz he wanted it for fast recalls. Start flaming me etc. So i decided instead of muting him and report him after the game ... to make him even more mad and get him 14days banned or perma banned. \nSo i start talking with him, but i talked with him calmly , i was laughing , asking hows the weather in his country ( not flaming at all as most of the stories in this forum ) i was super chill. \nHe got even more mad because he saw he cant make me mad. So he start using really bad words , racists words , instant 14 days ban words. So instead of stopping i decided to make him even more mad. He was so mad at one point that he stood on the spawn and kept spaming the 3 letter word that starts with K .... xD I reported him after the game and i got and feedback that he got punished . He havent played a game from few days , maybe he got banned 14 days or perma. \nI thought its right thing to do but right now im feeling kinda bad, i mean he might had a bad that thats why he was mad , but that doesnt give him a reason to be rude to his team. am i really a bad person for doing this?","replies":[{"poster":"WoollyWitch","date":"2019-12-09T19:07:17.111+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-09T21:55:15.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other words, he was deliberately manipulating him into punishment. It's not against the rules, but it is certainly morally corrupt.\n\nPsychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or perception of others through indirect, deceptive, or underhanded tactics. By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative and devious.","replies":[{"poster":"Proud2bYelow","date":"2019-12-10T00:37:41.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but this is not punished by riot so go for it, because its fun and the game should be fun no?\nriot punishment system is perfect!!!\nirony off\nalso we never know if the support wasnt permanently pushing and taking cs or the other extreme staying afk at tower all the time and in that way starve the adc.\nthere are tons of ways to troll the adc without getting banned by the system","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2019-12-10T09:57:55.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole thing escalated at 4th minute when the adc lost a trade to enemy team and blamed the support for it.

If your mid was a duo then Id understand but this does generally fall into bad for most people, however I will not blame you for his ban, he had a choice to say those things, whether or not you fired him up.

Still, you definitely should've refrained from provoking the other person as you clearly influenced his punishment in a bias way. Although you may feel that you must DIRECTLY hold someone accountable for their actions through using your words, a report is enough. If they're getting mad, it clearly means the game means something to them, and a simple uninfluenced report should suffice.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"RJay123","date":"2019-12-09T22:36:43.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Eh, if he doesn't have an ounce of self-control, it's not your problem. You probably taught him a thing or two about it. I don't have access to chat logs but if you responded to his flame by asking how the weather was at his place, then I got news for you folks, it's the oher guy's fault. Sure, the intent was wrong but that's equivalent of a person putting laxatives in a sandwich that always gets stolen by a coworker except this is even more minor. Sure, \"purposefully allowing someone to fall for a trap you've laid for them\" seems off but let's be honest folks, you're no different. Doesn't make it right, it just makes you hypocritical. I don't feel bad for that guy. Don't be like him.
