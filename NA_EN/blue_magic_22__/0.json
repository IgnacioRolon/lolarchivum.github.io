And/or giving an option for a faster queue, but the pool will be any level.\r\nThe same should apply with levels. A level 150 player should be given the option to play with a level 35 players.\r\n\r\nIf an algorithm taylored to these examples are set in place for a beta test; im sure negative players will tighten up. The better you actual play and longer you play; the better the player and the better the game.\r\n\r\nLook at some games like Xbox Halo. You have toxic people everywhere, but its somewhat controllable and manageable..\r\n\r\n*A player who played 50 games and 25 games are Graded as D, should not be matched with B or better.*\r\n\r\nIts simply not being mean; if that's too harsh, well charge that too every school and tell them the system is flawed. Im just saying.. try it..","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-08-16T08:28:53.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you sort Stat padding with out looking at consistency of WR?   \n\n I pick {{champion:30}}. I decided to hit R every time its off CD and I have 5 targets. Player Y Picks Karthus and only casts it to help teammates win a fight or to secure a kill that would otherwise get away.  I make every effort to get kills or assists and evade death regardless of if my team would be better off with me dying mid fight then using my Passive to put up a zone of damage to win a fight, each death multiplicatively lowers my KDA after all. Player Y Flashes into the Blitz Q that's gonna hit the late game hyper carry ADC then doubles off aoe and shredded MR with his wall.   I spam all MP as fast as possible on waves and I also take CS from jungle and teammates to put up good gold and CS. Player Y knows he has his power spike and when team comes to help him defend the 3 man mid push lets the adc CS and scale into their 4th item power spike. I buy constant {{item:2055}}  and spam them anywhere just to get more wards placed for my vision score.\n\nMy stats are by far superior to player Y at the end of the game. I played only selfishly and we lost because all I did was stat pad, something excessively easy because you don't think Is using this ability the right move, all you have to ask, Can I hit something with it? \n\nHow does an automated system identify me as a worse player then MR Y when all it does is check stats and not WR.\n\n\nYou bring up Microsoft? Here is a quote from their publication on true skill 2.\n\n> Aligned incentives. The skill rating system should create incentives that align with the spirit of the game. For example, consider a team game where players cooperate to achieve a goal. An improperly-designed skill rating system could encourage players to impede their teammates. As another example, consider a system that increased skill rating according to the number of times a player healed themselves. This creates an incentive for a player to repeatedly injure themselves so that they could be healed. In general, the more control that a player has over a quantity, the less useful it is for skill rating.\n> \n\n\"In general, the more control that a player has over a quantity, the less useful it is for skill rating.\"   So. Apply the context of a moba. What statistic is exclusively determined via skill that can not be faked?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-16T04:15:53.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno.
