So i put in a ticket because i knew i did not break any of the rules. I got a copy pasted response which did not help my situation at all and I am still banned even though other people who were affected by the account are already unbanned. This bothers me as i have put in time and effort to try and help the team figure something out but i just get ignored. IDK if anyone else has had a situation like this happen and if you have what did you do to fix it. I would just like to voice my displeasure with the way that support has been functioning as of late.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-18T22:19:22.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and see that a specialist is investigating your case after your follow-up.  Due to the nature of the issue and sensitivity of account information, it's not something we can assist with on the boards.  Your specialist will be reaching out to you- in your original ticket- as soon as he can.  Hang tight until then.","replies":[]}]}
