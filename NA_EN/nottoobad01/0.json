AI game and had connection issues so I had to reconnect, while reconnecting my computer decided to update and restart. The game is over, but every time I log into my account it takes me to a black screen (as if I were to join a game) and when I click escape or something it tells me it was unable to connect to the server and attempt to recconect to the game that doesn't exist, it has two options \"retry\" and \"cancel\". When I click retry it prolongs the black screen and does nothing, when I click cancel, it takes me back to the home screen, I can talk to people but it has the \"reconnect\" screen instead of the home screen. I've done a full repair multiple times and I've logged onto my cousins account on the same computer and their account works fine, can someone help me ?","replies":[{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2017-06-29T02:02:10.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[I'm having a pretty similar problem](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/tXkd10V1-help).

The black screen happens when your connection is failing to download assets, and likely to kick you out eventually.  Your best bet would be to run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and fix this up.
