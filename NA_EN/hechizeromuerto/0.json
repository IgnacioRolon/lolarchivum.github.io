I know that having a connection issue can feel out of your control, but [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will treat all leaves equally because it still causes others a bad experience.  \n\nYour best bet is to play through your games without further issues, and I recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is holding tightly.
