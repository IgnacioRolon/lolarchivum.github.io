Do I have to own fiddlesticks to get a box? (because I am not getting boxes.  I have boxes available to \"earn\".  My assumption I saw play out previously is that you can earn a box from a premade teammate getting an S every time they do so as long as you have boxes available to \"earn\".)","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2016-09-12T04:44:33.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing you probably got a box from Lux yes?\n\nFor some reason the system is set up in a way that if a premade gets an S, it checks off whatever champ YOU played, not the one they were playing. IE: if you played as {{champion:58}}  and your premade pal {{champion:34}} got an S, you would get a box for Renekton, not Anivia. What this unfortunately means is that if you already got a box with Lux, you won't get any chests from premades if you play as her.","replies":[{"poster":"FirnLazor","date":"2016-09-12T17:28:05.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"huh, alright, ty :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T20:36:23.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can obtain mastery chests through your premade as long as you own the champion and haven't already gotten one for that champ.
