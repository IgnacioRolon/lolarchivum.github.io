But today I'd like to ask about Sona:\n\nI&#039;ve been playing a lot of mid Sona, and while I love the champ and her ability to nuke people with her beautiful beats, I feel like her W and E don&#039;t provide enough even if they&#039;re spammed. (Especially her e, it doesn&#039;t really provide what Lulu&#039;s w does in terms of utility given the cd difference.) I mean:\n\n**Lulu&#039;s W:**\nWhimsy\nRANGE: 650 COST: 65 MANA COOLDOWN: 18 / 16.5 / 15 / 13.5 / 12\n\n**Sona&#039;s E:**\nSong of Celerity \nRANGE: 350 COST: 65 MANA COOLDOWN: 12 \n\nFactoring in 800 ap and max rank W/E:\nLulu&#039;s movement speed with W: 110% Bonus\nSona&#039;s movement speed with E: \nFor herself: 77% Bonus\nFor others: 48% Bonus\n\nUnless I&#039;m an idiot at Math, this really doesn&#039;t seem that good compared to Lulu. While the cooldowns are the same and Sona does give access to her Q+W bonuses while people are in her E, Lulu does the same thing with her E+Ult, not to mention she has a much easier time escaping than Sona. Also, this isn&#039;t mentioning just how bad Sona&#039;s base heal/shield are compared to Lulu. \n\n**Lulu E Scaling: **\nHelp, Pix!\t\n RANGE: 650 COST: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 MANA COOLDOWN: 10\nSHIELD STRENGTH: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 60% AP)\n\n**Sona W Scaling: **\nAria of Perseverance RANGE: 1000 COST: 80 / 85 / 90 / 95 / 100 MANA COOLDOWN: 10\n**Heal:**\nMINIMUM HEAL: 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 (+ 20% AP)  MAXIMUM HEAL: 45 / 75 / 105 / 135 / 165 (+ 30% AP)\n**Shield: **\nSHIELD STRENGTH: 35 / 55 / 75 / 95 / 115 (+ 20% AP) (+ 10 / 20 / 40)\n\nI understand at early ranks it shouldn&#039;t be high, otherwise Sona would dominate as a lane bully again, which she&#039;s fine at already. But when she gets out of lane...She&#039;s just really underpowered compared to Lulu. Sona should be a weaker form of Lulu because of her AoE spells, sure, but doesn&#039;t this seem like overkill? I&#039;m just asking for better base scaling on her w/e (Maybe even on her ult bonus to prevent people from maxing w/e early), because when I have to decide between Sona and Lulu, Lulu always seems like the better option. Always.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-11T02:16:19.378+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm not really sure what, if anything, we should do about Sona at this point.\n\nHer Champion.gg win rate is currently almost 53%, which is at least a beginning indication that she's not too weak at the moment.

Esp in a fight where I need to be switching auras and trying to get the buffs on as many people as possible. Most the time, I'll need to move around ALOT in order to buff the right people, and by the time I get there, somewhere else requires me to use another aura and I just can't serve enough people at the same time.

On sona's side, that puny little shield on my adc only that an enemy bruiser can just rip through in 1 AA feels a little less clutch, which is basically what is satisfying to a support. Clutch saves that we can feel the difference.\n\nGranted it is a 1 ally buff VS an AoE buff, but the range of the auras is the main thing I feel needs improvement.\n\nEDIT: Random thought, if the shape of sona's aura changed to a little less around her sides & back direction, but more in her front, I wonder how would that feel .... thematically .. its like having .. speakers .. the forward direction has a higher amplitude than the backside.  \n\nThat would in theory make it a little easier to hit the prime targets of the aura and requires sona to have better positioning and weaving back and forth of the front and back line.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-08-11T19:57:10.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like sona, but I'm not sure if she's quite right atm.

Damage buffs? Wombo? There's really a lot she does.\n\nI'd say one of the least satisfying parts of her kit right now is the scaling on her E. The AP% and ult bonuses are far more noticeable than actually ranking the ability. While having a one-point wonder is fine, the AP% scaling is so much higher for herself than her allies that it starts to feel really out of place. If you build a decent amount of AP, Sona herself will be zooming around the map and leaving her allies in the dust - even when tagging them with the aura. This is because not only does the self-buff last longer, but it also has a higher starting value before decaying down to the aura value. Currently, her E has a 7.5% AP ratio for her self-buff and a 3.5% AP ratio for the aura buff. **Equalizing the AP ratio to 5% per 100 AP for both herself and her allies would make it a more unified support ability rather than a selfish ability, which fits her identity better and would make the ability feel better to use.**\n\nAlternatively, it might be better to increase the duration of the aura buff as E rank increases. In the early game, having a selfish MS buff is fine and useful for roaming, placing wards, etc. But when lategame comes around, she wants to be staying with her allies; taking off like a racecar while the others follow behind isn't exactly conducive to that. **Maybe reduce her self-MS buff duration to 2.5s (from 3s), while making the aura buff scale from 1.5s-2.5s as the ability is ranked.** This would be a slight nerf to her early roaming, but a large buff to her team's roaming/engage/disengage in the lategame. With this, she probably wouldn't need an increased AP ratio on her aura buff, though a reduction on the AP ratio for her self-MS buff might still be in order.\n\nThe goal of these changes would be to shift power in her E toward supporting her allies and away from selfishly increasing her MS, without having to take away power from elsewhere in her kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-08-11T19:42:07.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play sona a lot and at times I just would like to feel that I'm even squishier than a minion.

To me the best part of Sona has always been her passive, a single glorifying moment where you choose to do something extraordinary based on your current needs, and once you choose you can't do it again for awhile. For me the current Sona has always felt less satisfying than old Sona, even if she is technically stronger (and she is), because so much of her passives power was removed. \n\nI remember in the earlier seasons Sona used to get nerfed all the time because she was the only Support with on demand ranged AoE hard CC. Now we have Annie, Leona, Lulu, Bard, Thresh, and Morgana all living in the bot lane. Sona also used to be an insane lane bully, but now most bot lanes are tanky enough to endure it and Sona is so squishy that getting caught once is often a death sentence. Sona also has issues against ganks when the enemy jungler has mobility abilities (read approximately every viable jungler). \n\nDespite this Sona has a high win rate, and I think this is because if Sona can not get dunked before team fighting starts she offers a ton because she gives everyone on her team a little which turns into a lot when added together. Which is great for her \"power\", but not for it being satisfying to play as her. Moving some of her power budget to her passive would fix this I think, specifically her AP ratios.\n\nAs far as people complaining about her laning, I think her laning is fine. Yes if she gets caught she dies, but for how much she does late this should be her weak time. You can do things if you massively out play your opponent. I feel like Sona should be the \"scaling support\" who has a weak early game but a massive late game, which is kinda how she plays at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-08-11T05:14:07.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A part of me wonders why the idea of having Sona's R becoming bigger as she levels it isn't a thing (but I also know why it isn't).

I don't feel the zones added or improved her Gameplay or play satisfaction, and much of the feedback on the rework resonated the same, though other players may like it, I don't think it does anyone a service to say this so matter of factly.\n\nMy main issue with the rework is that it made Sona impossible to balance to the point where when she's a strong support, she's an oppressive one. Her utility and damage both scale off AP now, whereas before she had spell damage off AP (at a higher ratio) and non scaling utility. This was similar to Thresh where the utility could be manage a great deal easier. Now both aspects scale off AP so mage Sona and support Sona both need the same stat to succeed, so itemizing for one means you itemize for both (the hard part to balance) but if you don't itemize for AP, and seek utility items instead, you have no floor in the non scaling effects making both your damage and utility anemic.\n\nThe rework didn't hit the points that it was intending to do. She actually lost her depth as before there was a cost to using one stance over another as they were stances. Now as they are effectively PBAoE actives they cost nothing but mana to use, so there is no decision to which one to use as the effects are no longer mutually exclusive. An issue exacerbated by the armor changing to a low duration shield that doesn't persist.\n\nShe isn't more rewarding because she cant be. If she's more rewarding, she's getting more effect for action, but because all action scales now, she will pull head and shoulders above where she was, and become super oppressive (this actually happened before she was nerfed the first and second time). So all of her effects have to be scaled back for the eventuality of AP being built, because AP must be built as there is no longer a non scaling floor she could rely on. \n\nAdditionally despite claiming she would be able to make plays and save allies, she was given the weaknesses of not being as capable of responding and making plays, when she was nerfed, saying she was supposed to be vulnerable and unable to do so. So the rework failed in that sense as well as she was supposed to be less static and more active, while her play pattern degraded into a similar Q poke pattern with much harder to balance numbers and no other options for play.   \n\nSo the rework only ended up making a more frustrating and less rewarding (outside of items) version of her old play pattern all in the name of making Sona less passive and able to actively affect a game. All while having the enforced weakness of not being able to respond to the types of all in plays that they were claiming the rework would allow her to affect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2015-08-11T02:56:42.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fGrvfPlA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-11T02:16:19.378+0000)\n>\n> I'm not really sure what, if anything, we should do about Sona at this point.\n> \n> Her Champion.gg win rate is currently almost 53%, which is at least a beginning indication that she's not too weak at the moment.

It wouldn't be enough to make Sona stronger at poking as such while giving Sona mid a boost in wave clearing, and making Sona supports more wary of using Q near low health minions.\n\nAs far as the rest of her kit goes, since her kit mostly promotes using Power Chord smartly, i would recommend buffing the W and E Powerchords if nothing else. Reduce the ratios to lower full AP Sonas from being too strong, but raise their base values somewhat (or their duration, why not?). A lot of people i see tend to forget that Sona has a Slow and a damage reduction.\n\nAnother path (though it would feel more like a rework, somewhat) would be to add weak (very weak, otherwise she'd become broken very fast, i believe.) on-hit versions of Q's AA damage buff to her W and E Auras, implying anyone within her Auras would get the effects just like her Q AA buff. Lets say 10 to 30% MS slow for .75 seconds on hit after casting E, and say 2-5% damage reduction on hit after casting W. If so, i'd recommend not letting Sona or anyone affected by her Auras be able to use more than one on-hit effect at any one time.\n\nJust my 2 cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2015-10-30T08:12:53.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Her Champion.gg win rate is currently almost 53%,\n\nThe fact that the first thing you jump to as an excuse is \"winrates\" proves that you're unqualified for your job and makes everything you say highly suspect.

When her numbers are high she pushes people out of lane with ease; you don't even have to mouse over your target, it picks it for you. Yet when her numbers are low she doesn't do much in lane, as she has no pre-6 cc like most supports do. I regard her as the Vladimir of supports. It's been more apparent in this meta where tanky supports are popular. Q all you want, that Nautilus/Blitz/Leona aren't going anywhere; but one of their hooks hit you and you're going to die. It's pretty hard to balance.\n\n**I feel that this is also why she still has a high winrate**. She's so easy to use and actually making a mistake in gameplay other than missing your ult or positioning wrong is very rare. Same reason why Warwick still has a high winrate after all his nerfs. \n\nI suggest following the trend of the past reworks and **make her Q a skillshot**. A lot of people are against doing this to chamions ({{champion:13}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:114}} ), but I feel that it offers them more room for strengths without being overbearing. Maybe something like a mix of Lulu's Q and Heimer's rockets? \n\nAnother idea I have is **making her auras a second active **(like Lee's Q,W,E) and giving them a little versatility. An example would be with her E; first she would activate the first cast and speed herself up. She then activates E a second time and places her aura on a target location; it **slows enemies and speeds up allies**. This would also solve the issue where most Sona players don't even level E until way later in the game, as it's not very useful on it's early ranks nor without significant AP. \n\n**Tl;dr** raise Sona's skill floor/ceiling by taking away reliability, and add more player-control of her abilities in order to make her a 'control' support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Captain Lito","date":"2015-08-11T00:49:25.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't understand why I'm being downvoted, I'm just asking Repetoir for his opinion, I'm not asking for Sona to be super buffed here.

You claimed that Nami or Soraka can outburst Sona, and i gave numbers to show you wrong. Even through diminishing the scaling, i'd still be right, considering we haven't factored in Sona's passive in the damage, or it's potential W effect. Sona is considered an early game Lane Bully for a good reason.\n\nSecond, while building Locket, for instance, has merit with it's active shield and aura, it's still much more, by far, profitable to build either a RoA or a Rylai's on her due to the fact that everything she does with her kit scales up very well. In exchange for a 30 CD weak shield, i get a buff on my 6 CD better shield and heal, not to mention everything else at the same time. Sure you can argue that the Locket's aura is invaluable, but consider that the aura is getting nerfed again this patch. I usually just reverse it and get Abyssal Scepter instead. Worst case, I'd get Banner of Command.\n\nI can make a similar argument about every other support item and be right except Sightstone and the GP5 items, when, and (almost) only when, talking about Sona. This doesn't include Janna, or Soraka, or Nami, or anyone else. I very strongly believe that Full Mage Sona is better than Support Sona at supporting overall.\n\nIf my hunch is right, next preseason might see Sightstone and bought wards removed in favor of Trinket amelioration and diversification. If that happens, i'll be playing Full Mage Sona support again instead of going Sona mid (and winning).","replies":[{"poster":"A Wild AP Sona","date":"2015-08-11T02:52:37.136+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GinoSoldier,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fGrvfPlA,comment-id=0000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2015-08-11T02:42:06.431+0000)\n>\n> First off, Sona isn't immobile and has plenty of time and mobility to spread those aura's bonuses around far and wide, and it's 150 range on one side, implying the aura is actually 300 range diameter, so get your facts straight.\n> \n> As far as Elo goes, yeah, i'm bronze right now and it doesn't matter at all for the purpose of this argument.
