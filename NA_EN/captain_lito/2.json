If you disapprove of someone's behavior, mute them, ignore them, then report them after the fact. But don't sit there an engage with them in the same disrespectful fashion, because your behavior is not canceled out by their behavior. Keeping calm and collected when forced into situations like that is called civility, and without it everything falls apart and then we're no better than gorillas or chimps. We as people learn how to act in social situations, and we should have been taught what to do at a very young age - and I can think of no societal norm that says \"If someone is mean to you, be mean right back at them, and start a fight, and cause a scene, because that's how you deal with people who upset you.\" It doesn't exist, because that is juvenile and the most childish way to cope with being disrespected.\nSo if trolls are upsetting you, ignore them, mute them and report them. Don't feed into their behavior, because then you're dragging yourself down to their level and putting yourself at risk of being lumped in with them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-08-03T03:29:27.847+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"What rights are being infringed by me calling someone a bitchass?","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-08-03T14:10:48.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SugeMinPikk,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7A36lpIH,comment-id=0000000500000000,timestamp=2018-08-03T03:29:27.847+0000)\n>\n> What rights are being infringed by me calling someone a bitchass?\n\nTheir right to have a game without harassment.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Proxhawk","date":"2018-08-03T03:27:33.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With that I can agree but what about the toxic players that intentionally throw games how do you feel about that?","replies":[{"poster":"minus 25k","date":"2018-08-03T04:27:40.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Proxhawk,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7A36lpIH,comment-id=000000050001,timestamp=2018-08-03T03:27:33.076+0000)\n>\n> With that I can agree but what about the toxic players that intentionally throw games how do you feel about that?\n\nIf it's true intentional feed I save replay and screenshot and submit ticket and hope for punishment.

Perma'd players had the opportunity to level a fresh account to 20 in order to prove their reformation and earn their main back. It failed SO MISERABLY that they scrapped the project until today. Frankly, I expect the same thing to happen now in 2018.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingboy12669","date":"2018-08-03T17:39:01.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think otherwise Its been 6 years and those who were excessively toxic are probably gone. I think its better they unbar the account and see instead of starting from lvl 1 only time will tell alot of pressure on these NA players because this is their last chance for the ENTIRE LOL community after that other regions can choose for themselves. This is bigger than it seems and can hopefully bring back lost accounts especially those who put money.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-08-03T17:52:40.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If this succeeds, I’ll be happy for the players who demonstrate reformation and get unbanned.
