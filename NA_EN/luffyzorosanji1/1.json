I don't see why I lost anything the day in question. I could understand if it is in fact that slow, but I've never had issue with this in the 3 years I've been playing the game. So if it's just a false sense of what the client claims then like I said, I'll just make it back.

Perhaps read comments in depth before you go on some sarcastic side note.","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-08-12T15:19:50.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't even meant for you - it was a poke in the side of the Rioter to which I directed it at. :|\n\nIt was obvious that you didn't unlock Kled, because you were missing 6300 IP, whereas Kled is still 7800 IP.

In reality the last purchase I made was a champ that cost 6300, however I find it strange that it would take nearly 6 days later to come out.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LuffyZoroSanji1","date":"2016-08-11T09:21:53.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone?
