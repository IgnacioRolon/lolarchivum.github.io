Usually the issues seems to level off, but since it's reoccurring I thought I'd ask rather than just keep hope that old posts with the same issue get answered. So in game I would have the issue of a frozen character, if I gave inputs before the champ froze or game, they'd be completed but I would have no way of stopping them. Thus at times I would get killed due to game freeze that is out of my hands. The actions of other players and minions still happen around me, and I can see my team or the enemy moving around on the map. It's as if I'm just standing idle on purpose, which isn't the case. The link to the image I posted above is another side effect I keep having as well post game. \r\n\r\nAlso a more recent issue I've also had is that the game will at the start after champ select kick me out and make me reconnect, doesn't always happen and in the past never happened, but not it's been more frequent. I would like and basically beg someone from Riot to at least give me some guidance so I can play the game again like I was able to a few days ago with out issue. This isn't a packet loss or ping spike or drop of frames issue. I've ran tests and they come back fine. Thanks for you time I hope you can help me get back to a norm.","replies":[{"poster":"LuffyZoroSanji1","date":"2016-08-10T20:54:18.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Taragons, this helped me more than it has in the past.

This can be influenced by poor ISP routing to the server or local network settings.
