I'll just randomly get booted from the lobby and then a queue dodge penalty placed on me because for some reason it's my fault that the server booted me off. It seems to happen when I am locking in my champ during draft pick.","replies":[{"poster":"Mango Beast","date":"2017-06-14T02:35:47.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happens to me  a couple times a week and has been ongoing for the entire season .  its VERY frustrating and UNFAIR that i am penalized for this garbage client bugging out and disconnecting me. my internet connection is 100% fine , i do not lose connection to my browser, anything i may be streaming at the time, ONLY LEAGUE. Then i have to wait 5 + minutes before i can even play again and i lose lp all because of a client bug on riots side NOT MINE. Again,  you client is buggy, my internet is fine, and i end up being penalized, it really is strongly dissatisfying experience to log  on looking for a game only to be smaked with penalties.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-06T22:49:10.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you click to lock in your champion, the client has to send that information to the servers and then all the other players. If it's kicking you out of the lobby when you click on your champion, it could mean that your network's connection to that game server was dropped for some strange reason. \n\nLet's first double check that your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) are all configured correctly, but definitely hit me back if that doesn't help!","replies":[]}]}
