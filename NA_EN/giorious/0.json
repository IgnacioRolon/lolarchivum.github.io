I'm assuming you can run the client so that's not a problem. If your game is crashing in game it might be because you're using a Logitech device like a mouse or keyboard. If you are try doing this. Go to League of Legends > RADS > solutions > lol game client > releases > the next folder (0.0.1 something) > deploy. In this folder you can find some Logitech files, the video recommended deleting them, but I just renamed them by adding an f at the end of the file before the .dll (it still worked). This worked for me and I hope it works for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-08-24T11:19:43.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No clue, but on another post somebody suggested reverting the update.\n\nIt worked for them, maybe you should try it.","replies":[]}]}
