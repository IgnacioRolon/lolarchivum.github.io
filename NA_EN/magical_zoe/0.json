Its almost 1000 days since he got his last skin and many other champion but after reading his comic him climbing Mount Targon he really inspired me and i wish that he will receive a skin that shows how powerful he is . Sorry to bother you ! I was really curious for a long time about this question ! Have a nice day !","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2019-02-09T02:54:23.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xzq,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nJqft3IF,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-02-08T17:57:19.353+0000)\n>\n> Hey !

However Idk about skins production. I'm not entirely sure what strategy goes into choosing what skins to make where, but I can imagine it has something to do with how much we can make period. We are only human on this side of the computer, and that means theres a limit to how much we can work and make. But again, I'm not on those teams or in the know of exactly whats going down, so I can only speculate :3\n\nSorry you're frustrated that Taric hasn't gotten a new skin recently :(, I feel you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cavemantero","date":"2019-02-08T04:57:07.562+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"You missed all the disasterous decisions that Riot made in turning this game into counterstrike go.
