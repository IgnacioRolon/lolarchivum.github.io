It does damage and procs on-hit effects, like what Guinsoo's does. Before this, Lucian could get three procs of stuff; one from his attack, one from his Lightslinger, and one from Guinsoo's since Lightslinger proc'd it. Lightslinger is an extra on-hit, not an extra attack.","replies":[{"poster":"TigerMama Gemgem","date":"2016-06-04T05:23:37.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why does Lightslinger proc stuff like Braum shield?
