I decided to play Lulu with the Bittersweet skin. Later in the game, whenever I put Help, Pix! on my allied Miss Fortune, I found myself unable to auto attack while Miss Fortune was auto attacking. My autos would stagger as Pix would shoot bolts quickly due to MF&#039;s fast attack speed. \r\n\r\nIt happened when MF activated her Impure Shots and had around 1.87 attack speed, but it also happened when I cast Pix on Shen as he attacked Baron.  As long as Pix was shooting his bolts at/above a certain speed, I was unable to actually connect my auto attacks to a target.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-02T21:14:49.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sasunto,\n\nThanks for the report!

Lulu just twitches and her autos are canceled. Especially evident when both of us had 2.0+ attack speed. Lulu couldn't get a single auto off on enemy champions/baron/dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bondage Bunnyboy","date":"2015-11-08T17:50:01.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I've had that issue for months and thought it was lag. :l","replies":[]}]}
