This is a big reason as to why all disconnections are treated equally and why we cannot remove or modify these penalties. Additionally, you'll **never** receive a penalty because of a single disconnection and a 5--game penalty is only added to your account *after* a *trend of disconnections* has occurred on your account.\n\nWhat most likely occurred was your connection to the gameservers was unstable, causing your client to not make the right connection to the game instance. This is most often influenced by conflicting network settings, so I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure these settings are in good standing. Please let me know the results of those steps.","replies":[]}]}
