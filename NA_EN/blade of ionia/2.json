When you first become dishonorable, hextech rewards will be locked. After showing some improvement they'll open back up again so you can start getting chests and keys. Currently, you're still at Honor rank 0, but you are now progressing at a normal rate again. Keep up the good behavior and you'll start ranking up again soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Blade of Ionia","date":"2017-10-06T13:37:49.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
