I don't know if it's because there's too much going on or if the wrong colors are being used but I find the whole League of Legends website to be very cluttered and confusing. I love the game I'm just commenting on how everything looks the same and there's no sense of priority sections or options.\n\nNOW with my actual post:\n\nWhere can I find official documentation of say S grade requirements?\n\nI played as Teemo and ended 22/9/36. Got 750XP but not even an S-.\nI'd really like to know what it OFFICIALLY takes to get an S-.\n\nI know we have participation points but I don't see a place to view that. I'm going off of a game where they did not award me a grade at all. Support told me there was no errors.\n\nhttp://i63.tinypic.com/wl2nhd.png\n\nMight I add that this happens to my score every other game or so. Either no grade or no xp shown.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-27T01:55:19.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't a list of S grade requirements. \n\nThe main reason is that the system doesn't work off a checklist. It looks at what champ and what lane you're playing and compares your gameplay against others of the same champion and lane. To get an S you need to have performed in the top percentage of those players. If you didn't get an S, that means someone out there had a better overall game. Be sure to read up on how mastery works in the [**champion mastery guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-11-27T01:54:55.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"750 experience gain is most likely due to your first win of the day mission added to the experience gained for the game. S rank is determined based on how good you do with a particular champion in a particular role in comparison to other people who have played that same champion in that same role in the past. If you're trying to get S rank for mastery 6 or 7 tokens, you can't earn those from ARAM unfortunately.\n\nI had also made a post yesterday questioning why some matches don't show grades or experience in match history.","replies":[]}]}
