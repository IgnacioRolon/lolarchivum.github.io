He is actually supposed to be The Rogue General**\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive - Soul Forge:  Gaius's abilities do not use mana. Instead, he has an ammo supply of Spirit Blades.  Every time he kills an enemy minion or neutral monster, his resource bar will fill up by a set percentage.  Once the bar is completely filled it will reset, giving him another blade stack.  Gaius always begins the game with five blade stacks, and maxes out at 25.  The resource bar will fill automatically, no matter how much has been filled previously, upon killing or assisting in the kill of an enemy champion.  Whenever Gaius walks over one of the blades he has in the ground, he will pick it up and place it back in his ammo supply.\n    --Blades left on the field via his Q and W will only remain for about 5 seconds.  If he does not pick them before time runs out, they will vanish, and will NOT be placed back in his ammo supply.  The blades will, however, go back into Gaius's ammo supply should he have any less than 5 blades remaining in the stock.--\n\nQ:  1st cast - Gaius will begin to channel, increasing the number of blades that will be used up to a cap of 5.  This also increases the radius of the ability, growing from a single skill-shot line nuke to a cone (see image attached below).\n     2nd cast - Gaius sends out all the blades that he stored up during the channel.  The blades do physical damage to all enemies struck, and stick into the ground upon reaching their maximum range.\n     This ability passively increases Gaius's maximum blade-count by 5 upon reaching ranks 2, 4, and 5.\n\nW:  Gaius throws one of his blades at target enemy champion, dealing a small amount of damage and slowing the target.  The blade will stick in the ground where it hits the enemy champion.\n    This ability passively increases Gaius's maximum blade-count by 3 every time that it is ranked up.\n\nE:  Passive - After picking up one his blades, he will gain a movement and attack speed buff for a few seconds.\n     Active - Gaius begins drawing on some of the life-energy found in the air around him, granting him a slightly larger boost to his movement and attack speed for a few seconds.  During this time, his resource bar will slowly fill even without him killing minions or neutral monsters.  Gaius's passive still holds it's effect, however.\n    --Gaius gains no bonuses from picking up one of his Spirit Blades while this ability is active.--\n\nR:  Gaius unleashes three swift, consecutive strikes on target enemy champ, doing a flat amount of damage.  This ability will do bonus damage based on how many blades he has in his ammo supply at that time.  (Remember that his Q can use up to five at a time.  Careless use of the Q and W will result in few blades left in the stock, which in turn will result in less bonus damage)\n\n\nLore:\n\nWithin the middle class of Noxian citizens, there were two boys who many deemed to be inseparable, despite their great differences.  These boys were Gaius and his best friend Leo.  Many people were confused on just how these two could be such close friends.  Gaius was always calm and composed, never letting anything phase him; especially when it came to helping a friend in need.  Leo on the other hand was very light-hearted and care-free.  He always tried to come up with some witty comment for every situation, and his broad smile only faded when push came to shove.  In spite of these differences in character, there were two similarities between the boys.  First was a shared discontentment in regards to how the Noxian government was currently being run.  The second was a crush equally developed towards the soldier named Riven.\n  \nOne day, they came up with a plan to be able to change things.  By entering the military not only would they get the chance to make an impression on the woman they love, but they would also be able to work through the ranks into a position with enough power and respect to be able to change how the country was being run.  However, during training, it became quite clear that Gaius was simply more talented than his friend.  He was held back for more elite training while Leo was placed in Riven's unit and sent off to fight in Ionia.\n\n  For a time, Gaius was envious at Leo for being able to fight by Riven's side.  However, envy was quickly replaced by sorrow and rage when he received word that the unit had been wiped out.  Gaius blamed the Noxian High Command for the the deaths of his love and his friend.  They were the ones who sent them to the front lines and to their deaths.  Hiding his rage, Gaius used the influence he'd already gained to request an audience with the High Command.\n\n  They agreed to see him, not knowing that they were agreeing to their own execution.  To ensure that they would not interfere with his revenge, Gaius quickly dispatched the guards as soon as he entered the room.  This act was what unleashed the dark ability that he never knew he had.  As the guards' bodies hit the floor, their souls seemed to be drawn towards Gaius.  Without thinking, he reached out, and took one of these souls in hand.  Using only his will, Gaius then molded that soul into the shape of a sword; a sword that he then turned against the Noxian High Command.\n\n  One by one they fell, their souls being added to Gaius's dark armory.  Swain was soon the only one who managed to escape the onslaught.  Blinded by anger and grief, Gaius gave chase.  But the Master Tactician would not be taken by surprise again.  In a matter of moments, he and the soldiers under his command cornered Gaius and captured him.  Noxus chose not to execute him, however.  They chose simply to lock him away and experiment on him, in high hopes that they may be able to replicate his dark power and use it against Demacia.  In his cell, Gaius finally managed to calm himself and realize the gravity of his situation.  Once his power could be replicated, he would be executed, and his own dark gift would be turned on countless innocents.  With no other option, Gaius escaped from his prison and fled to Demacia.\n\n  There he adopted Leo's light-hearted nature to hide the pain which he felt.  Eventually, Gaius actually began to speak with the souls which he'd captured.  In time, they managed to come to an understanding, and he was able to earn permission to wield these souls.  With that effort now in the past, he turned his attention to bringing about a better future; one including a new, stronger yet honorable, Noxian government.  After several months of trial and error, Gaius was finally able to forge and uneasy alliance with the Demacians.  He would help them bring Noxus to it's knees, in exchange for being the one placed in charge of the reformation process.\n\n  -\"My friend Leo used to say: 'For now, just keep moving forward.

Currently, my biggest issue other than that typo in his title from when I first posted him (which sadly cannot be fixed unless I re-post Gaius entirely) is his ultimate.  I've been struggling to think of something that makes better use of his stacking Spirit Blades.  Right now, I'm thinking on giving him something like Zhou Tai's musou attack \"Void\" from Dynasty Warriors (I'll leave a reference video below, or at least a link) with either the affected area or the frequency of the attacks increasing with how many Spirit Blades Gaius has.  Let me know if you think I should do that for his ult, or if you can think of something even better.

If people want to see concepts, they'll look there.\n\nB: I only stuck that in as a minor jab, no need to be so defensive. As for the 'aspiring fiction' I wouldn't mind giving you some critique to help you grow, if you've got a pastebin or something of whatever you've written in the past. I'm just being brutally honest because all too often I see a lot of 'aspiring authors' who brag about how many upvotes or good comments they get on their stories, only for them to post to links to a circlejerk anime forum or fanfiction website with grammar that could make a 3rd grader cringe. Likewise for plotholes the size of Manhattan. For the 'my cool idea added' it's pretty clear Riot takes bits and pieces from everywhere on the concept forums and gives no credit to the original poster, due to board ToS and game ToS more or less saying \"Anything you post on these boards is our IP and even if we take 100% of your post and make it real, you are not entitled to a lick of creative credit.\" \n\nC: I should have mentioned it in the previous reply: Avoid numbers when posting CONCEPTS. Use arbitrary terms to define what you want him to do/what he should be rather than posting numbers because you deviate from what the major idea is; A concept you came up with. Posting numbers invites a huge amount of problems and your overall quality of post goes down trying to justify numbers or otherwise tweak them endlessly up and down until you're left pandering to whomever will throw you an upvote.\n\nD: I didn't mention anything about him having sustain with his E. I'm saying that it functions to Zac's passive sustain (healing blobs that he can walk over). But you added an armor penetration bonus on to Lucian's Lightslinger rather than a healing. Look, basically I said \"Your X is the same as half of Y plus half of Z.\"\n\nE: Pretty much, yes, it sounds immature, or, like I had said earlier, anime/cliche.  Don't take it as a personal thing, it's just highly overused in those mediums. I'm pretty sure when you take another crack at the lore section (and I guarantee you will) you'll get something a lot better that doesn't feel so forced.

As for the 'aspiring fiction' I wouldn't mind giving you some critique to help you grow, if you've got a pastebin or something of whatever you've written in the past. I'm just being brutally honest because all too often I see a lot of 'aspiring authors' who brag about how many upvotes or good comments they get on their stories, only for them to post to links to a circlejerk anime forum or fanfiction website with grammar that could make a 3rd grader cringe. Likewise for plotholes the size of Manhattan. For the 'my cool idea added' it's pretty clear Riot takes bits and pieces from everywhere on the concept forums and gives no credit to the original poster, due to board ToS and game ToS more or less saying \"Anything you post on these boards is our IP and even if we take 100% of your post and make it real, you are not entitled to a lick of creative credit.\" \n> \n> C: I should have mentioned it in the previous reply: Avoid numbers when posting CONCEPTS. Use arbitrary terms to define what you want him to do/what he should be rather than posting numbers because you deviate from what the major idea is; A concept you came up with. Posting numbers invites a huge amount of problems and your overall quality of post goes down trying to justify numbers or otherwise tweak them endlessly up and down until you're left pandering to whomever will throw you an upvote.\n> \n> D: I didn't mention anything about him having sustain with his E. I'm saying that it functions to Zac's passive sustain (healing blobs that he can walk over). But you added an armor penetration bonus on to Lucian's Lightslinger rather than a healing. Look, basically I said \"Your X is the same as half of Y plus half of Z.\"\n> \n> E: Pretty much, yes, it sounds immature, or, like I had said earlier, anime/cliche.  Don't take it as a personal thing, it's just highly overused in those mediums. I'm pretty sure when you take another crack at the lore section (and I guarantee you will) you'll get something a lot better that doesn't feel so forced.

I'm afraid I'm at a loss.  I only ever posted Gaius on the \"Skins and Champion Concepts\" board.  Is he on some other board that I'm not aware of?\n\nPlease allow me to apologize for getting so defensive.  I saw your comment about my summoner name fitting my champ, and I'm afraid that was somehow the only thing that registered.  A big reason for my little \"cliche\" about him having a crush on Riven is: in League, I see a lot of characters created as enemies and I thought it would be interesting to give an older champ (like Riven) a \"foe\" with a more positive interaction.  And I don't really care if Riot gives me any credit or not.  Just something even LOOKING like they used an idea that I had come up with is more than enough for me.  And about the books that I'm writing... I'm only still WRITING them.  I have yet to post what I've got on any sights, so the only ones who've read my work thus-far are friends and family.  And like I said, before, I'm still somewhat of a novice at writing fiction novels.\n\nAvoid posting numbers?  In all honesty, I've always heard that it was best to post the numbers in a champ concept and give Riot less work to do.  Is that really not the case?\n\nOkay, so my \"sustain response\" was a little off.  Now that you explain it that that little \"math equation\" I think I see that problem that you were pointing out.  Gaius's E has given me trouble ever since I first created him in my head, and now it's still giving me problems... Seems I'll have to go back to the drawing board and see what else I can come up with for him.\n\nIn all honesty, I have two big problems for the whole \"Shadow Isle deal\" for Gaius.  First, as stupid as this may seem, I really want him to have some sort of positive interaction with Riven.  Secondly, every champ we see that deals with souls comes from the Shadow Isle.  Sure, it just fits, but I was going for something different.  Something like a rare anomaly; a being appearing with a soul-based ability, but isn't from the Shadow Isle.  The best idea?  Maybe not, but I believe that it was at LEAST worth a try.\n\nAnd finally, the ult again.  As I've said in my previous post, I HAVE been trying to come up with a more fitting ult, but to no avail.  Does that mean I'm going to give up on Gaius? HECK NO!  Of all the champion ideas I've ever come up with, Gaius is my favorit (and my best by far).  I merely hit a road-block, and I'm not afraid to admit that I could use some help to get around it.  Which... is more or less what I'm admitting right now.\n\nAnyway, as upset as I may have gotten when you first posted, I do appreciate that you replied and helped me understand where you were coming from.  I, unfortunately, can sometimes be quite slow to understanding things.  Never the less, now that I understand a little better, I'm going to keep looking around and see what exactly I can do to fix Gaius up some more.  Any further feedback would be appreciated.  Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rito Jericho","date":"2015-03-12T14:00:16.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.  I was able to make one of the promised changes.

I understand the problem with providing feedback to a concept that has no numbers posted. Really, I do. The only reason why I HAVEN'T posted the numbers is because I'm just not good at that. If I TRIED to post the numbers, I'd probably screw up big time. I'm just not very good at math. Then there's my constant bumps. I keep bumping him, because nobody has been giving me feedback. No feedback, no idea on what TRULY needs to be adjusted.\n\nI'll admit, that first point that you mentioned for Gaius's passive has bothered me some. I see what you're saying about him easily being starved. But at the same time, I feel that it sort of promotes paying attention to the creeps, playing smart, and getting the last-hits. Sort of like Nasus or Veigar. I think it's been suggested before that Gaius be able to just generate his blades over-time, but I fear that such a thing might make his passive just seem like another mana system, or that it might take away from HIS version of the \"soul\" theme.\n\nDid I really do that poor of a job explaining the Q? I'll take another look and see what I can do to fix that as soon as I'm actually able.\n\nI do not need to reply for the W. I've already given my explanation, or excuse if THAT'S how you want to look at it, earlier in my reply. But, I'll still see if there's anything I can do, or if I can get some professional help with dealing with the number issue.\n\nPersonally, I must disagree that Gaius's E is like Yi's passive. Yi's triggers every 4 attacks, and only delivers the double-strike. Gaius, on the other hand, must walk over one of his blades, picking it up, to trigger his E. On top of that, doing so also increases his MOVEMENT speed so that he can get in close to USE his double-strike. Again it's just MY opinion, but I feel that this is a solid enough difference between the two abilities. \n\nI really liked my idea for the R. Oh well. If I want Gaius to be even CONSIDERED, changes must be made. It's been suggested to me that I find a better way to actually incorporate Gaius's stacks INTO the ult, but I honestly can't think of anything. Would you happen to have any ideas?\n\nBroad lore... I don't know. I felt that it was decent at least. Or is that my background as an aspiring fiction-author coming back and biting me in the but? Well, nobody's perfect. I'll take a look around and see if I can find anything that I can clean up.\n\nWell, your criticism was constructive, and you seemed to like my overall concept, so thank you. Actually, I can't tell you HOW happy I am that I actually got some feedback after... you said 3 whole MONTHS? Thank you again, and I'm definitely taking this to heart so I can make Gaius the best champ concept that I can possibly make him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rito Jericho","date":"2015-02-16T23:06:50.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made a couple quick adjustments to Gaius.\n\n1st: I simply moved one of the points in which his Q increases his maximum blade-count.\n\n2nd: The duration for which his blades can stay of the field has been reduced from 30 seconds to 6.
