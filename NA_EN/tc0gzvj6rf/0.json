Go ahead and downvote or whatever. I played the game normally up until season 6 and I just straight up hated the game at that point and what Riot had done to it so I started scripting. It was extremely fun and pretty addicting and I got away with it for two years until recently when my account got banned ( which was completely deserved obviously). I am just here to share a couple things about it.\n\nIt is incredibly easy to script. Like it honestly takes 0 knowledge of computers and I could show you in about 10 seconds. With that said, The scripting community i was in had hundreds of thousands of members. So if you think someone is scripting in your game, they most likely are. It is a lot more common then you think it is.\n\nScripts do more then just aim skill shots and dodge them for you. There are scripts that will use mini map hacks, use items and summoners for you, potions, skin changers, and I even made one where it would spam your mastery 6 or 7 emote every single time you auto attacked or casted a spell and I called it Tiltmote. I promise you at least 20 percent of players use one of these.\n\nScripting makes you good but not great. I was Gold 3 without scripting and Got all the way to D2 with scripting. It makes you really good mechanically but absolutely terrible game knowledge wise and with your decision making. You think you are a god and make retarded decisions that lose you games.\n\nI will not reveal who these players are but there are popular streamers who use scripts that you would not expect as i have collaborated with them once i got high Diamond for duoing. Scripting databases have a \"streaming mode\" so you can stream normally and it won't show any of it on screen. Most people won't believe me but it is true unfortunately.\n\nI have developed about 25 scripts, and about 8 of them have over 50000 downloads\n\nMy days of scripting are over and I deserved the ban 100 percent. I will play the game normally from now on starting in bronze 5 on this account.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask them and I dont mind if I get downvote whore'd. Most people hate scripting i get that\n\nEDIT : For the Mods reading this who deleted it last time. I have not given a single detail on how to script only information pertaining to it and why you shouldn't do it and why i was banned. If anything it will deter people from doing it so please dont remove my post. I won't be telling people how do do anything or giving out any info. It is purely game knowledge based.\n\nEDIT2 : My Clear intention of this is to do everything in my power to get scripting out of the game and make this game as enjoyable as possible. If Riot would like to collaborate that would be the best case scenario but for the time being I am just trying to improve the game I love so much\n\nEDIT3 : This post has obviously blown up pretty big so I will do my best to answer every single comment in the comment section. It may take time though as I do have a life outside of being a cheating Pleb (Kappa)\n\nEDIT4: Please don't comment if you just have negative things to say. I understand its frustrating that I did this and that people like this exist and do this currently, but there isn't a reason to be toxic or rude. Most people can and would of done the same thing in my position unfortunately had they had the resources and thats what I don't want to happen","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-06-10T02:20:06.669+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":6,"body":"Discussions pertaining to the identification of scripting applications and/or applications that otherwise violate the Terms of Use will be removed.

In high elo every so often ( maybe 1/30 games) someone would say something.\n\nSo I'm a bit confused by this, you place an emphasis about how damaging to the game and people you were playing with that you were scripting, but if they can't even notice it, how much damage does it really do? As far as they are concerned how you playing the game any worse than someone who is naturally d2 playing the game? As long as they don't feel cheated what's the difference?\n\n> 4. Yes, The top 4 are Xerath, Cassio, Lee Sin and Vayne. Right below them are Caitlyn and Zed\n\nCaitlin scripts? Are you allowed you tell what exactly those would do? I can sort of imagine what the scripts for the other champions here can do but not so much for caitlyn.\n\n> 5.

I actually don&#x27;t play them anymore now that I am playing normally and my main champion right now is Darius\n\nSo due to the capabilities of your scripts, were there champions who were particularly easy to deal with?

Ok i should of cleared this up. Most people arent as good at hiding it as I am or coding it. Also, all it looked like in game was that I had the mechanics of a challenger player. That is the unfair part. But at that high of elo, Challenger players tend to have a lot of smurfs so it didn't catch on much. I would code my Evade script to only dodge dangerous skill shots. So like I would let a jinx W hit me but I would always dodge a Blitz hook for example or an Ashe arrow. This takes a long long time to perfect in design but it makes it very hard to detect in game. Most scripters cant do this and its much more obvious.\n\n2. It orbwalks perfectly with her, Auto hits her Q, Auto E's when people gap close to you, and animation cancels your traps so you can put them down as you are autoing right where people can step on them. Some scripts even can make invisible traps. It also auto ults if it knows it will kill. It's more popular because she is really strong all the time naturally. \n\n3.
