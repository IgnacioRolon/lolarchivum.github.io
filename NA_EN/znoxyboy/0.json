Lastly there&#039;s &quot;The Southern Continent&quot; or &quot;The Shuriman Continent&quot;, consisting mainly of The Shuriman Empire, Icathia and Mount Targon.

Otherwise I have no quibbles with your statements.\n\nI know you know that, and have probably done the thing that I do where I get my east and west mixed up for a brief moment.  I actually still have to use a mnemonic to remind myself; (going clockwise, from top) **N**o-one **E**ats **S**hredded **W**heat.

Where most outsiders see Shurima as a beige and barren waste, her family raised her to be a true daughter of the desert and to see beauty in the rich hues of the land. Taliyah was always fascinated by the stone beneath the dunes. When she was a toddler, she collected colorful rocks as her people followed the seasonal waters. As she grew older, the earth itself seemed drawn to her, arcing and twisting to follow her tracks through the sand.\n\nAnd then...\n\n> **She journeyed west toward the distant peak of Targon**, her natural connection to rock drawing her toward the mountain that brushed the stars. However, **at the northern edge of Shurima, it was those who marched beneath the banner of Noxus** who discovered her power first.

Thus Mt Targon is on the same continent as the Shurima empire.\n\nTaliyah did not pass through Noxus, she passed through a Shuriman city that was taken over by Noxus.

IMHO the name of the southern continent is League's most perplexing and largely ignored mystery outside of _what is a Darkin?_ etc. This mystery isn't helped by the fact that every time current lore mentions the south, it's only ever referred to as \"Shurima\" Making it almost impossible to tell if there is a difference between what is the entire land and what is the large area that was **once** the Empire of Shurima. \n\nIf the continent and empire are two different things and the empire has been buried for centuries. Why does lore still refer to the territory of the lost kingdom as such? Let me put it this way, would it not be confusing if Noxus was the name of  Mordekaiser's old kingdom as well?\n\nOh well time will tell if something will be revealed or not.
