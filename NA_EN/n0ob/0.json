I've got about 150 games in since the rework, and feel like I have enough of a feel for it to comment on some things I've noticed. \r\n\r\nQoL Issues:\r\nCan't left click while channeling Q without activating it:\r\n- seems minor but several times I've been camping a bush, charge q as soon as I see a champ, ping for teammates to notice, only to have the q go off early.  There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to ping, or place wards, or click on the minimap while casting q. \r\n\r\nAncient golem HP/MP5 regen upon taking damage from monsters doesn't work through shield:\r\n-my preferred skill order when doing a jungle camp is full charge q while they aren't attacking, w once they are about to start attacking me, then Q asap. This doesn't leave much of a window for the camp to attack me, and I hardly lose any HP, but I find myself going oom very quickly. I find it annoying that I'm forced to auto attack before casting my first q, just so I can still clear fast w/o mana issues. Would be nice if the regen worked when a monster was attacking you with shield since technically you are still taking damage from them.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed a couple bugs with Q and R not being able to be cast, and the passive not proccing, but I've seen threads about that in the bug report section, so I won't go there.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I wanted to talk about was his passive. Simply stated, its just not fun. It feels like you die twice each time and it feels twice as frustrating. As it is now it feels completely useless, a gimmick which lets you catch someone off-guard every once in a while, but completely worthless when people remember about it. The movement speed boost might as well not exist for all the help it gives. I saw the changes where it will tick down in a flat amount instead of %, but I don't think it lasting a little longer will fix the fundamental fact that its not fun, and not useful. I would suggest replacing the movespeed boost which is worthless anyways with Q or even e. At least that would give a little bit of utility still.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2014-11-02T17:35:53.167+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"In regards to his passive, it does have its perks, like still being able to contribute to the teamfight after you die, I agree that it feels terrible most of the time. It does have the perk of giving Sion less time dead than any other champion assuming they all die the same number of times because the death timer starts when Sion first dies, not when his passive runs out like every other champ with an on-death passive like Karthus and Kog'Maw. You can literally die in lane at level 1, farm some cs for a bit, and then teleport back to lane like you didn't die at all.\n\nSome more QoL buffs:\n\nHave Sion not collide with a wall during his ult if he is at an angle less than 30 degrees with the wall, and instead have Sion ride along that wall. This is one of those edge cases that feels frustrating when you barely clip the wall, and have your ult stop because you barely clipped the wall. Sion's ultimate is extremely unreliable, and this would help give it more usability, especially when trying to engage in the jungle.\n\nEither let Sion not have the camera locked during his ult or lock it further ahead of him during his ultimate. This is another usage issue of Sion's ultimate because it prevents you from using it effectively if your opponents move out of the way. Letting him see more of what's coming or seeing what we want to see would put a lot more reliability into using his ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Star Warden","date":"2014-11-02T22:00:34.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> QoL Issues:\n> Can't left click while channeling Q without activating it:\n> - seems minor but several times I've been camping a bush, charge q as soon as I see a champ, ping for teammates to notice, only to have the q go off early.

I did not know this. Been played singed till summoner level 20, then played Sion from then on. It seems foolish though. I can't even click on a surrender vote while casting q without it going off. I can still cast my shield though.\n\nAnother fun fact about passive, if you die with kats healing debuff on you, your passive spawns at 50% health. I imagine its the same for most healing debuffs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-11-02T17:36:42.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with all of this, but I can help you with your passive.\n\nIf you ever want to actually kill someone with it, you need frozen mallet. \n\nThe slow, health, and damage will help you out while you are alive and even more so once dead, especially with the flat vs % change.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-11-02T20:21:33.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I agree with all of this, but I can help you with your passive.\n> \n> If you ever want to actually kill someone with it, you need frozen mallet. \n> \n> The slow, health, and damage will help you out while you are alive and even more so once dead, especially with the flat vs % change.\n\nThe item is mostly inefficient and the odds of you actually being able to run up to the target and hit them more than once is really low.\n\nThe ultimate is best used in a teamfight. You throw yourself in the middle of the enemy team immediately and force them to basically kill you, and then you go to town on them while your team sets it up. Its also very useful if they had to use a possible escape to chase you down for the final kill. Hell if you don't kill them but they wasted an ultimate or a summoner, thats all good. It was worth at that point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chumbler","date":"2014-11-02T22:15:33.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An actually useful passive and damage scaling worth a damn outside of one skill you'll basically never hit with if you charge it enough to do damage would be starts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-11-02T20:01:55.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've not had the issue with Q, but I haven't played him in a couple weeks so could be I never noticed.\n\nHonestly, once you have Ancient Golem, you can pop W early for faster clear, also allow the camp to pop the passive on Ancient Golem, which means you should still take almost no damage.\n\nBork and Frozen Mallet for offensive items, the rest of your buys need to be tanky.  You can initiate for your team, force the enemy team to focus you, once you're dead, the enemy team relaxes, but they forget that the moment you come back, you will be on top of them and should easily finish the fight with a kill, if not a triple.\nThough I do agree, I'd love it if they took off the move speed and attack speed cap on his passive, it just feels so restraining.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finnical","date":"2014-11-02T19:47:06.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Can't left click while channeling Q without activating it:\n> - seems minor but several times I've been camping a bush, charge q as soon as I see a champ, ping for teammates to notice, only to have the q go off early.

I don't think I specced my runes/masteries into mana, I wonder where the discrepancy lies. That said, I often find myself suffering on mana in general with Sion all-game unless I build specifically for it. He doesn't seem like the kind of champ that should be gated on mana costs. Actually, come to think of it, he might work great as a mana-less champ. \n\n> The last thing I wanted to talk about was his passive. Simply stated, its just not fun.

The best possible case for your passive is to have it activate while you are in the middle of the enemy team and YOUR team is dropping CC and AoE over you. That way you are disrupting and damaging them while both protecting your team and getting kills. The current problem is nobody really understands that you are still useful when you die, so they just bug out and leave you useless. Another problem is the people on the enemy team DO seem to get this in general, so they distance themselves from you and your team doesn't stop them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KowaiKami","date":"2014-11-02T23:42:57.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot in its infinite wisdom has 3 latin servers, and one NA server. super duper smart.
