Congratulations, sir.\n\n1) For your information, Riot Games is a company that claims to be about _all their players_.  All of them, even the ones who like and enjoy the \"less popular champs.\"  If they ever claimed otherwise, we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\n2) You seem to believe that Riot exists in some sort of bubble or ivory tower, handing out little trinkets to the masses at their whim and leaving the rest to suffer.  Supposedly, Riot's philosophy is the exact opposite of that line of thinking, and that they would happily \"waste their time\" on something like that as opposed to, I dunno, giving Blitzcrank a visual upgrade because a \"handful of people\" hate his design.\n\n3) Your \"handful of people\" still equates to _millions of players and hundreds of thousands of potential sales_ now and in the future. (if Riot's telling the truth about how many people play the game worldwide).  If the product is cool/awesome enough or hyped like Riot's other skins, a new Yorick skin will also inspire millions of other players to pick up the champ and possibly buy the skin.\n\nSo, yeah, your comment was pretty stupid.

In the same way this new Zyra skin took a huge amount of work and was in the pipeline for a long time and I really wanted to be able to say 'We are working on something awesome hold on just a little longer!', but I also understand why we can't.

I hesitate to even type the words **Magma Chamber**...\n\nThe thing I'd really like to be able to share with players though is what it's like to be on a team at Riot. We play LoL, we take it seriously, we compare ELO, we watch the LCS, we lurk Reddit (and Inven etc) and we argue a LOT. All of us are driven to create the best experiences for players and we agonise over every decision. Every day I'm surprised by how carefully everything is planned and how thoughtful Rioters are. Rioters care so much about players that if we agree something is the right thing to do for players there's really no excuse that can stop that momentum. After the [Cosplay Creator Lab](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/community-spotlight/cosplay-challenge-conquered) I'm even thinking about how my designs might be cosplayed and how much misery my decisions could be causing in terms of complexity! I think comments that make fun of Riot are great because they keep us honest; I always get a chuckle out of 'More Teemo Skins', although the reality is there was a lot of serious talk about if we should do Devil Teemo because of how the meme has affected Rioters impression of community reception. Btw players LOVED it and we were so relieved!\n\nWe've been pouring over the feedback and reaction to Zyra, the whole team are behind this one.

Sorry for necroing your post, but I had a really awesome idea for a Yorick skin and would like to share it with you if you're still looking for concepts ^-^. \n\nWell, I think the Hextech thematic would be an awesome fit for Yorick. All his pets and minions could be super high-tech creations of his own making, while Yorick himself could be decked out in steampunk clothing, wielding a shovel-like gadget imbued with a hextech crystal (this crystal could light up upon activation of his Q, kind of like Camille's Q activates the one on her chestpiece). \n\nYorick's Maiden (R) would be the most challenging part of this skin I feel, in terms of modeling it's not super clear what could be done with her, but honestly any kind of high-tech metal robot would do, in the vein of Hextech Annie's Tibbers or new Hextech Galio -- it could even be a creepy robot meant to detect ghosts, or perhaps siphon/collect them (ghost in the shell? ;)\n\nAnyway, I think the new visual style of the Hextech line is really cool and high quality, and I'm sure Yorick players both new and old would appreciate a skin of that caliber. \"Steampunk tinkerer who creates high-tech robots to fight with\" would be a super cool fantasy/direction for him, IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-03-20T06:19:12.394+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!

Mentioning Dragon Master Swain, cancelling it, trying to make it again and having to cancel it a second time is the perfect example of why it is much worse to announce work in progress when we can&#x27;t guarantee it will actually work out and ship. I hesitate to even type the words **Magma Chamber**...\n> \n> The thing I&#x27;d really like to be able to share with players though is what it&#x27;s like to be on a team at Riot. We play LoL, we take it seriously, we compare ELO, we watch the LCS, we lurk Reddit (and Inven etc) and we argue a LOT. All of us are driven to create the best experiences for players and we agonise over every decision. Every day I&#x27;m surprised by how carefully everything is planned and how thoughtful Rioters are. Rioters care so much about players that if we agree something is the right thing to do for players there&#x27;s really no excuse that can stop that momentum. After the [Cosplay Creator Lab](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/community-spotlight/cosplay-challenge-conquered) I&#x27;m even thinking about how my designs might be cosplayed and how much misery my decisions could be causing in terms of complexity! I think comments that make fun of Riot are great because they keep us honest; I always get a chuckle out of &#x27;More Teemo Skins&#x27;, although the reality is there was a lot of serious talk about if we should do Devil Teemo because of how the meme has affected Rioters impression of community reception. Btw players LOVED it and we were so relieved!\n> \n> We&#x27;ve been pouring over the feedback and reaction to Zyra, the whole team are behind this one. Right now I think as a team we are focused on making sure that when those skins do happen, they are worth the wait.\n\nAn honest response. http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/I-Like-It-Another-Thor-Reaction-Gif.gif\n\nYou talked about champion choices and your favorite champions, So who gets last say in what skin comes out? I am a fan of Yasuo, Malzahar, Vlad, and a few others. Yes, I am a big old tumor. But many of these champion don't have many skins or haven't received one for years. What are your(personal) thoughts on getting a VU for Malzahar and getting him a new skin? Or getting Yasuo the evil overload skin, since like Teemo, people see him as pure evil.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-02-27T03:43:52.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Skins has a primary Product Owner, [Supercakes] and several squad level POs that plan out skins for the year.

But he's one of the few champs that are on the short list that haven't gotten a skin since I started at Riot in 2015 so I'm fighting for him. Yasuo is actually the most popular champion in LoL, by a wide margin, so it's safe to say he'll be getting skins until he reaches teemo-meme status. Although given that he's only had two skins since launch he is also a good indicator that we aren't just following the popularity, and that sometimes things don't go as planned, or he'd surely have like 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2017-02-27T21:03:39.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=vQy5EUkW,comment-id=0000000000070000,timestamp=2017-02-27T03:43:52.001+0000)\n>\n> Skins has a primary Product Owner, [Supercakes] and several squad level POs that plan out skins for the year.

What is your favorite skin/ skin line you have done and anything you can share of upcoming works?\n\n\n True Malzahar was updated, his pants just bother me :))) lol. Please do fight for a Malz skin and make it epic. I knew Yasuo was the most popular! Yet everyone complains about him....I sense a lack of logic. But yes 10 Yasuo skins sounds good, I believe in you!\n\nThank you for the reply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-02-27T12:37:41.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=vQy5EUkW,comment-id=0000000000070000,timestamp=2017-02-27T03:43:52.001+0000)\n>\n> Skins has a primary Product Owner, [Supercakes] and several squad level POs that plan out skins for the year.

If that's the case, then I guess everyone else at Riot, specifically the QA people on skins team, have been lying to me (and the rest of us) over the past five or so years.\n\nThanks for being the first skins team member to be honest with us.  I really wish I could get a refund, since Riot's whole \"player focused\" premise has been pure BS. :(","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-02-25T23:36:45.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are any changes even being done to Dragon Sorc.
