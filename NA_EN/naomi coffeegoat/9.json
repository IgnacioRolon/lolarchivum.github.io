If not that&#039;s fine too. I&#039;m considering just taking my leave from my home tonight.\n\nEdit: Thanks for response anyways. I was feeling like a lot of shit earlier. And it's not stuff like \"I don't wanna live by these rules or anything.\" It's moreso just these confused feelings and wondering if my mother just hates me through some recent actions and if I should even keep living under her roof if she really does dislike me. Maybe one day I can work up the nerve to get a serious talk with her on this. What does make me stay though is talking with my online friends and all that and seeing they care. Not too much the whole, \"I won't make it out there.\" I've had bad depression for years now and I was just ready for anything to happen. Though knowing if it would be possible to make it out there would help regardless. I don't really know why I'm venting out like this on the League boards. Sorry if this all just sounds dumb and all that, but again thanks for responses. ","replies":[]}
