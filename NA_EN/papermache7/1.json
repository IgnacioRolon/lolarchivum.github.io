I can speak a little towards the first case (ex: wight over the wall) and this is actually intended.  The reasoning behind it can best be explained if you think about 2 ADs fighting each other in the bot lane brush.  Lets say they are both standing in the brush and attacking each other (in this case, 2 conditions are met, just like with the wight.  You physically see each other, and you are also revealed because you are attacking each other).  Lets say the enemy attacks me and then I step out of the brush.  If the revealing overlapped and auto attacking gave vision for a little longer, I would be able to step out of the brush and still have vision! (which would not be intended).  \n\nIt's definitely frustrating when that is applied to a neutral monster, but without doing some serious overhauls to the vision system or adding in some special case exceptions, this is actually how it should work.  I hope this clears things up a bit.\n\nIn terms of your second point, that can also be pretty frustrating.  I actually don't know why the sweeper reveal is a little delayed, but I will certainly look into it and see if I can figure out what the reasoning is behind it.","replies":[{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-09-23T05:51:43.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a good case, the bug is minor enough that it wouldn't be worth the effort. Just hope that if you ever get around to reworking the vision system a little it'll be on your list.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2014-09-23T07:16:52.430+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely!  Keep posts like this coming though, I like seeing any and all potential in-game bugs.  Something we would like to do in the future is get together a list of known bugs that people can look through before submitting their own","replies":[{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-09-23T16:07:16.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny thing is I was about to ask you guys to make such an FAQ, anyhow I've got quite a few that I need to verify once more, but I'll likely posting quite a few more soon.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
