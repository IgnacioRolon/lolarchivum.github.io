The way I see it in this case, the server receive a request for your champ to recall from your client and would start doing so. Then there would be the actual recall with each of its ticks, then there would be the second last tick and right after it the check for if damage has been taken, then the time between 2 ticks and finally the last tick that makes you recall. \n\nThis would explain why the recall isn't stopped since the condition check occurs after the last tick that was executed instead of before the tick that's about to happen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-09-24T14:59:27.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One could argue the big is that the damage hit the player when they should have based without taking damage :p.

I have seen Rioters reference it in their explanation of gameplay and they don't seem to intend to change it.\n\nI think your assessment is right. I remember reading that damage is applied at the end of a tick. So if damage and return occur on the same tick, then they will return and then take damage. Something like that - point being that they cannot be interrupted during the last .25 second of the return channel.","replies":[]}]}
