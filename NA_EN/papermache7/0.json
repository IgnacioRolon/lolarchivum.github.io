Here's a video example.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gC1LY4cCyg&amp;feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nWould it work as you'd expect the game would check if Leblanc was within Fiddle drain range right before dealing damage and would realize it's way too far so that last tick of deadly damage would not have been dealt.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2014-09-23T23:29:22.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is certainly not ideal and goes against my expectations as a player.  This is most likely caused due to the refresh rate of the game/ability being used.  If the refresh rate is .25 seconds, and you flash away within that window, the server will still think you are in range and even though you see yourself far away, the game still thinks you are in range and the stun/damage/etc. will be applied.\n\nUnfortunately this is a limitation with what we can do, and without making things more taxing to run, this is going to be working as intended.  If we ever do revamp tick rates or something along those lines, we can address problems like this.\n\nI'm not entirely sure this is the cause, so I will still look into it and make sure, but it is unlikely we will be able to make this match player expectations in the near future","replies":[{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-09-24T00:48:47.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't see how that would work if the server thought you were still in range of the lack tick of morg ult you'd either not be able to flash because you were actually stunned or you'd be able to escape without getting stunned. What happens is that you flash out of it between the two last tick and you're still linked because the second last tick made the check of you still being in range and the last tick occur. The end result is that you end up both stunned and outside of the max range of morg ult.\n\nAnyway that's how I would see it making sense for the game server.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jhaie","date":"2014-10-08T16:57:17.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the range is the casting / attacking range, so if you are in the range when the cast or autoattack is made, and then flash after it has been casted, the ability will still reach you. (Though I may be wrong)\n\nI think it's the same with all targeted abilities and auto attacks. If you are in the casting range when the ability is casted, and then flash, the spell will follow its target, for instance, rengar leaps to you - you flash outside of his leap range before he reaches you, but instead he leaps a greater distance than his leap range and reaches you; or caitlyn auto attacks you, you flash out of her auto attack range before the autoattack hits you, the attack travels further than her range and still reaches you.\n\nSo in this case with fiddlesticks and leblanc, leblanc distorted after the drain tick had been casted/ticked/refreshed (but before it had reached her), so the tick that had already left fiddlesticks reached  leblanc, outside of fiddlesticks' range. (Though again, my theory could be wrong too.)","replies":[{"poster":"PaperMache7","date":"2014-10-08T17:44:55.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only works that way for projectiles and projectiles like attacks.","replies":[]}]}]}
