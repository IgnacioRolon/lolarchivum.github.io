I actually like potato settings and want to cap my frame rate. However, when I change it in the client, it does not obey the rate that I am choosing. My laptop can switch from integrated to nvidia, and I already made sure it was opening and using the nvida processor. Any insight?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T18:47:33.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which settings are you specifically changing? On top of capping your frames, you may want to enable vertical sync, that way your frames are stable and synced with your display's refresh rate.
