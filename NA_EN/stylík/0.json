Tried to get help at support but that was unsuccessfull. This happens only in League. I dont see any fps drops or bad performance in any other game. CPU is like at 20% and RAM at 60 yet it still lags. Sometimes in games it happens more frequently like every TF or when i destroy a tower and sometimes it doesnt lag almost at all.\r\nCPU AMD 8-core 4GHz\r\nGPU GTX 660\r\nRAM 8GB\r\nUsing win 7 64bit\r\nanyone else has issues like this or managed to fix them?\r\nit is starting to get really frustating when you are playing game about where every ms matter and you get this stupid thing when you cant play your best","replies":[{"poster":"Melø","date":"2016-10-09T09:48:01.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me. Used to play with 100/120 fps but after a few patches ago now I can't go past 50/60 and in teamfights I don't understand anything cause it's stuck below 10 fps. Tried to repair lol client, didn't work. Uninstall and reinstall it, didn't work. Lowered every possible setting, didn't work. Checked all my drivers and stuff, nothing. I don't know what causes this, but I strongly feel it's related to something on the patches cause I looked on the internet and a lot of people are having the same issues. I don't know what else to do, it's very frustrating playing like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T20:58:52.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was unable to see any support tickets on this, but I'm happy to help!  FPS issues can be caused for a variety of reasons like drivers, but also bad files and even hardware.  Specifically, you could be overheating so make sure your PC has solid ventilation.
