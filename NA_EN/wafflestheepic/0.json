When we have sales that go \"through\" a particular date, the sale typically ends at 11:59 PM for that day.  In this case, 11:59 PM PST (For NA).\n\nI hope this resolves some confusion! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"WafflesTheEpic","date":"2015-01-05T20:56:12.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I need an answer in the next 2 and half hours before I go to work, which I'll off at 2 am or so on the 6th (That's 3 am Riot server time).","replies":[]}]}
