For those bugsplats, let's grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with a **force repatch** first to make sure the patch installed correctly. \n\nAs for why you couldn't get loaded into those matches, I want to go ahead and check up on some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to be sure everything is configured in the best way for League.
