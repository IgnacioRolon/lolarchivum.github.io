I am currently level 22 and my favorite champion is Orianna. I main mid and i currently own Kat,Yasuo,Orianna,Annie and Ryze. I was thinking about cassiopeia but she seems like a really high skill cap so im currently saving for xerath.

She is one of the hardest champions to really master, besides maybe Yasuo (No, I'm not a Yas player, I actually hate the champions' kit all together). \n\nRegarding your next point, Xerath is a champion where either you're good with skill shots, or you're not. His kit is run souly around the fact of skill, map awareness, and timing. If you can get those three down, then sure pick him up. He's not really known to be a hypercarry, but you CAN if you get far ahead during laning phase. He's designed to poke with his Q,W, or catch someone with your e and collapse.","replies":[{"poster":"Guanxi","date":"2017-01-28T17:10:18.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making another point* \n\nAsking people on the forums about what champions are good and what aren't isn't the best thing to do. No champion is \"bad\", they're just not good against certain matchups. I play A LOT of Aatrox and win my lane 95% of the time, with a few exceptions like Jayce or some other instant-burst top lane. \n\nPlay a champion that YOU are interested in, not something that is good because an LCS player said so. You won't get where you could playing something you are told is good, but you don't actually enjoy playing x champion. It's like you doing something you don't like, but your friends are telling and peer pressuring you to do it, not cool right?","replies":[{"poster":"Bad Sardine","date":"2017-01-28T19:41:46.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I understand, ill try to play most free week champions and see which ones fit me the best.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Doorknob","date":"2017-01-28T22:10:29.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would suggest you get Champs for other lanes and start building skills made for your secondary roles aswell as you will not have the opportunity to always MID lane.

Taric can be phenomenal if you get good with his ultimate. \n\nI never liked Janna, but she's very strong if you're good with her. Very hard to kill her. \n\nMy #1 support right now is Nami, but she's an expensive pickup if you don't have runes yet.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bad Sardine","date":"2017-01-29T16:36:25.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already own champs for most lanes but not for support/adc so i will make sure to get some of those.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2017-01-28T19:43:32.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get one you like for each role just incase \ngood starters are\nGaren top\nAshe adc\nAnnie \"can\" support, but I suggest getting Soraka\nand for jg try Warwick or Udyr\n\nas for mid, try Brand :3","replies":[{"poster":"Bad Sardine","date":"2017-01-29T16:33:45.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already own most of the 450 champions but i will think about udyr and brand","replies":[{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2017-01-29T18:59:26.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand's combo is, 3rd, 1st, 2nd aka E, Q, W\nbest to max W first then Q next\nLiandrys{{item:3151}}  and Morellonomicon{{item:3165}} are key items you'll need\n\nUdyr  is mostly a jungler but can go top, thought it may be difficult\nfor jungle get them in the order, Q, W or E, then R \nmax Q first\nTrinity force{{item:3078}}  is a key item you'll need\n\nbest wishes","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Doorknob","date":"2017-01-29T16:48:47.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't really need any adcs' if you have no plans on going there.
