I had no clue how to really play against him. My damage barely did anything to him and whenever I got a decent chunk off, he just derp healed it back. Of course I built an early {{item:3123}}, but it didn&#039;t seem to help at all. He didn&#039;t really do anything special, just harassed me anytime I went in for minions and healed himself back anytime I damaged him. I think it was more me being confused on how to play against him. What&#039;s worse is he is a S3 and I&#039;m G5 :/ Hurt the pride a bit, but I know I&#039;m better than that. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nBTW: I was a bit cautious on engaging since I wasn&#039;t really sure of his early damage potential. Should I have been more aggro early on? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SirΤeemο","date":"2017-04-21T20:50:37.067+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"a vlad main just downvoted all of the comments DAMN O.O","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-21T20:57:59.225+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's pretty sad when people downvote posts without even arguing.

Hopefully I run into another Vlad main that I can give another go at. I honestly felt like I could've definitely played better. Sometimes I get caught up in the whole \"I'm an assassin I must kill\" thing. Leads to tunnel vision and I end up not out smarting them. Lesson learned.

EC is only 15 damage for 800 gold, and when you roam you just need a lot of damage because the main goal in ganking is to overwhelm your opponent in damage or CC. \n\nMaybe grab a bit of MR if you're getting poked down before you're even finished pushing but aside from a Hexdrinker just full damage and run off to other lanes because he shouldn't he able to follow a Zed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alex h8721","date":"2017-04-21T19:45:40.047+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"What kato said, vlad is a strong counterpick to assassins because his sustain helps him win trades, builds hp which makes him harder to burst, and has his W to deny all in-s.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirΤeemο","date":"2017-04-21T20:05:15.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"playing against a good vlad is hard , because he won't  rush and Q you ,  he will Q minions to get hp back , and auto attack you. \nI think the only meele champion that \"counters\" vlad is probably talon because of his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-04-21T20:04:33.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you need to play around his resource bar.\n\nwhen it's full and red his next Q will do hard damage and heal him big.\nthat's the point where you want to stay out of his range.\n\nyou want to force him into his W without using your Ult.\n\nbest is to combo him with W+E+Q and trying to hit all.\nmaybe you can already go in and force him into his W by swapping and aa'ing him.\n\nafter he comes out of the W you can Ult and kill him.\n\nin general you should take care of his resource bar and play around his CDs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2017-04-22T02:19:48.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you get a kill on him early. you win. if you dont you lose. rush mortal reminder. the entire item. if you get that and your a little ahead. you can kill him over and over. and get botrk after. and then maw. he becomes no problem, after even late game.\n\nif you don't kill him early you're fucked.
