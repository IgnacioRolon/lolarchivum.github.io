Yeah, sure, there are ways around Darius, Morde, etc., but they lock entire portions of the roster out of the game, because the amount of skill it takes to fight them with certain champions is absurd for the overall low reward. Darius can drive off certain champions merely be existing near the minion wave.\n\nAnd Riot's policy is supposed to be that the answer to certain champions should never be \"play x champion\" but that is generally what must be done when it comes to juggernauts.\n\nI don't mind them being powerful. What I mind is that champions who simply have no answer to their kits don't have enough power to fight back directly.

Its entirely fake and performative on their part, and it started with excusing controversial releases like Zed/Riven, who were a certain class but had/have little/none the weaknesses to it, or possibly no exploitable weaknesses at all over a certain margin of skill.\n\nCounterpicking is still a pivotal part for 99% of the playerbase, on every role and every lane, even if Riot has done a lot of work to blurry class advantages and weaknesses (but only for some classes and some champions, specially hypermobile popular ones). But its not a rentable or convenient truth for Riot, since a ton of people dont want to face their counterpicks and the implications of picking their fave into a hero that counters them.\n\nIts simple a core aspect of the MOBA genre that cant be removed, at least not completly.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2019-06-23T04:03:16.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a shit aspect.

According to op.gg Mordekaisers three biggest counters are, Vayne, Jax and Fiora, these three champs likely counter him do to how as long as they know what they are doing Mordekaiser should never be able to land his E onto them, all Three have a dash/leap (while admittedly Jax's is more situational) and when the fight starts Fiora and Jax will out duel him and Vayne can just kite him into oblivion as Mordekaiser has no reliable way to get onto her. \n\nOther than that from my experience he is highly susceptible to poke and his E is a very slow ability. The way I see to counter him is to just repect the grab and then punish him for using it, especially they wave clear with it, thats a 20 second window where he cannot engage onto you and cant deal any damage unless you walk into his Q range.

I think he's strong.\n\nHe has a lot of reach for a melee champion, and he thrives on AoE situations while also being able to force a 1v1 when necessary. This makes him really hard to stop even as a team if he gets a lead. He seems to scale well, too.\n\nThat said, he has trouble with champs that also revolve around reach and sustain, like Karma. Her E helps her avoid his skillshots, she can poke with Q, and RW is a good tool for surviving his ult. I tried it yesterday on another smurf and, while I gained absolutely no lead on him, he couldn't do anything, either. He must've been really bored by the time he abandoned the lane and started roaming. However, he then proceeded to get pretty fed off of the rest of my team. He ended 14/7 but didn't get enough of an early lead to pull off a win.
