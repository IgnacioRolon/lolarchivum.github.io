Fucking around is just that. Fucking around. You just thought up this little chain reaction of fucking around = making fun of a situation = making fun of them = being racist. That's stupid as hell. Again, stop with the assumptions about me and trying to slander my shit. You don't know a thing about me.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-06-05T02:38:03.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There comes a point where fucking around is not an excuse.\n\n\"But officer, I was just fucking around with the other cars on the highway going 100mph in a 50 zone\"... \"But officer, I was just fucking around when I waved the knife haphazardly and got closer and closer to them\".\n\nYou were \"fucking around\" - which means making jokes or \"lightening the mood\" - both of which are akin to making fun of them. \"Fucking around\" is not an excuse for bullying.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben SwoIo","date":"2018-06-05T02:42:03.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chermorg,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=y7Yfvxn9,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-05T02:38:03.254+0000)\n>\n> There comes a point where fucking around is not an excuse.\n> \n> &quot;But officer, I was just fucking around with the other cars on the highway going 100mph in a 50 zone&quot;... &quot;But officer, I was just fucking around when I waved the knife haphazardly and got closer and closer to them&quot;.\n> \n> You were &quot;fucking around&quot; - which means making jokes or &quot;lightening the mood&quot; - both of which are akin to making fun of them. &quot;Fucking around&quot; is not an excuse for bullying.\n\nYou really just compared typing a little phrase online to driving 100 MPH in a 50? Come on, that analogy is ridiculous. That's way far off. This phrase doesn't put my life or anyone else's in danger, so that's just reaching. \n\nYes, I was fucking around. Kidding. Joking. That's it. What's so hard about that? Do you people HAVE to find wrong in everything? It's NOT bullying. I said ONE thing ONE time. THAT's not bullying. If anything, the shit YOU and a few others have done on this thread is bullying. Go look in the damn mirror.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ben SwoIo","date":"2018-06-05T02:14:59.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Is there anyway to voluntarily delete my League account?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-06-05T02:15:56.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akrid415,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=y7Yfvxn9,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-06-05T02:14:59.108+0000)\n>\n> Is there anyway to voluntarily delete my League account?\n\nThere is, yes.
