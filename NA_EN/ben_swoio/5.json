Lmfao, the second you get to 70% hp they have kill pressure on you REGARDLESS if they have ult or not.\n\nUnless you position extremely badly, Fizz and Zed and debatably LeBlanc shouldn't have any way to kill you. Assassin Kayn heavily relies on your team's lack of vision.\n\n> And those champs can easily make use of that kill pressure since their mobility spells IS NOT AN ULTIMATE, and since said mobility are basic spells they can force a trade to get you into kill range for their next rotation :).\n\nAs I said, their engage is very limited in terms of Range and Damage without their Ults. If you use your E as Fizz to be able to Q a target, you lost most of your damage. Same for LeBlanc with her W. Zed's W range is very small and Kayn should rely on Walls to get to you in the first place (not as if he can't be easily peeled.\n\n> Also Eve doesn't even need her ult after she has her 3 core items, and anymore after that means she deletes you within the blink of an eye. Not the hardest thing to do in the world thanks to her camouflage.\n\nAfter 3 items people should already group and protect their carries. If you go without ult, people would easily collapse on you, besides having a hard time approaching them without being peeled by their tanks or supports. Besides, you talk about a 3 item Evelynn, which is very late into the game. She needs her Ult for most of the game to gain an advantage and snowball with the 3 item spike. Until then, she is pretty much depending on it.\n\n> Now lets talk about the other assassins you mentioned.\n> \n> Diana- Her ult is 20 seconds and resets, she will have multiple chances to one shot or force you out of fights while burning cooldowns. And just killing her isn't that simple when her W is pretty good at mitigating damage.\n\nFights don't last longer than 20 seconds. If she used it without resetting the CD, the enemy can turn on her and pretty much kill her. And her reset requires you to land a Q before, which isn't as easy as you make it. Many Diana players started using R and then land her Q to guarantee it hits, even though they lose their reset. Her W is good in 1v1s, but outside of that she dies easily.\n\n> Noc- Are we forgetting the part where his ult blindsides everyone making it harder to protect his targets in jungle fights? The perfect solo Q champion.\n\nAre we ignoring the fact that he is immobile without it and it has a really long CD? He has a hard time engaging without it, which is my whole point.\n\n> Pyke- AOE true damage execute that goes through shields and resets. Literally just let your team do the damage AND THEN go in with the ult, it's that simple as pyke.  Why do you think he is the only assassin to go Aftershock instead of more damage?\n\nHow many Assassins have more than one spammable hard CC in their kit? He pretty much abuses the Keystone and it doesn't have any connection with his Ultimate at all. Heck, some Pykes run Dark Harvest as their main Keystone, and those are arguably the ones that abuse how his ult works the most. And sure, let's ignore things like Kassadin and Akali going for Fleet Footwork, Glacial Augment Ahri and the new Smite/Spellbook meta that people started abusing on Mages and AP Assassins. \n\n\nAnd I don't even get what you try to prove. That their ults are powerful? That is the whole point. Without their ults, they barely work.\n\n> Do you guys even play as or vs these champs?\n\nI do and I don't consider them as impossible to fight against as you make it seem. It is all a matter of positioning and reacting correctly to the situation. Heck, even now I dislike to face some of them, but I generally don't have a hard time facing them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Psi21","date":"2019-06-03T19:23:06.177+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Arhi's ratios get worse as the game goes on.
