This results not only in the first part of his ult hitting you, but also it&#039;s second part immediately converging to you. Furthermore, since his Q resets his auto, this all result in a pretty reliable combo to proc his passive. \n\nNow, I&#039;ve been a Talon onetrick since S3, so I&#039;m not saying this to complain about this champion being OP. Because he&#039;s utter shit IMO. But the point is, I don&#039;t know if this is intended, so it would be really sweet if a Rioter could clarify whether or not this will be fixed in the future. I&#039;d rather just have this taken out of the game than to lose it AFTER getting used to the combo. Thanks in advance.\n\nEdit: Be cool if there were a way to wave this in Rito's face once or a twice. Simple question with a yes or no question should be pretty easily answered.\n\nEdit 2: 9 hours in, no official reply on what's potentially a bug report.
