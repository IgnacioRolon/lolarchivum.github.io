What if I re-install league of legends? Will it take so long again like getting league for first time? Will it delete my account? Will it be like a fresh new league of legends player? I'm kinda getting too much on this which is making me feel if I should or not. Anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"kill violet","date":"2016-07-29T02:45:31.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It says it will be a clean re-install.

A client repair won't always be able to fix all data errors every time, but a reinstall will. You won't lose any stats on your account or anything.\n\nWhen you do a reinstall that is not 'clean' that typically means it will retain your personal settings folder and move it to the new install.","replies":[{"poster":"kill violet","date":"2016-07-29T13:46:05.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it worth it if I'm having 100-500 MS?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-29T13:53:54.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repairing the client won't fix high latency issues. For that, please visit the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). \n\nIf you're not in NA it's expected to have high latency due to the distance to the servers, but otherwise if you can get a better connection you may be able to do so by switching to a wired connection and disabling background downloads while you play.\n\nIf you're having lag you can see where it starts by running a tracert to the NA servers. I suggest doing this by downloading the [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/) Network Diagnostic Tool and doing a traceroute to the below server IP for 5-15 minutes. It will show where your latency starts getting high to facilitate troubleshooting it;\n\n> 104.160.131.1\n\nFor reference, you can run a tracert to the Google public DNS **8.8.8.8**. It should have about the best connection you can expect, so if the ping to Riot is significantly worse there may be an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"kill violet","date":"2016-07-29T15:28:27.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I downloaded the WinMTR, it's currently doing its work but I don't know what it's supposed to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-29T15:37:09.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'll pump out numbers that look like this;\n\n> |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                             10.21.111.1 -    2 |   70 |   69 |   51 |   74 |  129 |   69 |\n|                      temp1.unlinx.net -    2 |   70 |   69 |   31 |   77 |  129 |   65 |\n|                           61.21.151.178 -    4 |   66 |   64 |   62 |   84 |  126 |   84 |\n|                  v204.core2.mc2.he.net -    4 |   66 |   64 |   74 |  106 |  329 |   81 |\n|              100ge8-1.core4.chf3.he.net -    2 |   70 |   69 |   80 |  108 |  330 |   98 |\n|              100ge5-2.core2.chf3.he.net -    2 |   70 |   69 |   71 |   99 |  212 |  112 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    2 |   70 |   69 |   68 |  107 |  214 |   89 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\n\n(Stop, Copy text to clipboard, and paste)\nThe first column is the 'hops', the servers the data goes through to its destination. The first row of numbers would be at my house modem, and the last is the Riot server.\n\nThe second and third columns are how many packets of data are sent and received. Receiving less packets than it sent means there is some packet loss.\n\nThe columns after that are the ping in milliseconds (latency, ms). You can see the best (lowest) ping, average, worst (highest) and the last (current ping when you stopped it).\n\nIf you are getting packet loss or lag spikes you can see where along the route to the Riot servers it started; most of the time it starts at you and you have to fix something on your end, but it can also be at your ISP or at Riot or anywhere inbetween. Finding where it starts will allow you to start fixing it.","replies":[{"poster":"kill violet","date":"2016-07-29T15:39:34.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                             192.168.1.1 -    0 | 1119 | 1119 |    0 |   74 | 1093 |    2 |\n|                               10.37.0.1 -    0 | 1119 | 1119 |    6 |   88 | 1166 |    9 |\n|                            24.246.128.9 -    1 | 1115 | 1114 |    7 |   91 | 1154 |   11 |\n|                            64.53.15.117 -    1 | 1080 | 1077 |   12 |  167 | 2897 |  592 |\n|                             4.34.16.125 -    1 | 1108 | 1105 |   16 |  108 | 1162 |   19 |\n|        ae-2-52.edge3.Newark1.Level3.net -    1 | 1112 | 1110 |   25 |  105 | 1135 |   40 |\n|        ae-2-52.edge3.Newark1.Level3.net -    1 | 1115 | 1114 |   25 |  106 | 1127 |   30 |\n|                              4.15.31.82 -    1 | 1108 | 1105 |   27 |  107 | 1151 |   32 |\n|                          104.160.132.35 -    1 | 1112 | 1110 |   25 |  113 | 1139 |   28 |\n|          ae31-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 | 1119 | 1119 |   34 |  114 | 1153 |   43 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    1 | 1097 | 1091 |   34 |  121 | 1156 |   45 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-29T15:48:54.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can see extremely high ping spikes starting right from you.
