People grow bored of them, just don't have time or something else got their attention among many, many other things. If you are implying that the only reason people stop playing games is because \"they don't like it anymore\" or because \"the game is now bad\" then I feel sorry for you. I used to play Ragnarok Online all the time and one day I just stopped since I didn't have time to keep playing it and my friends moved on to other games.

I said that if the ONLY reason you think people stop playing games is that then that is simply not true. There are so many reasons why people stop playing games that focusing on one aspect of them dumb. Are there people who just hate the game and quit? yeah! there are people who love the game but can't play anymore due to life reasons.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Revech","date":"2020-02-08T06:46:15.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Endorphin addiction aka mental high from wins.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2020-02-08T16:59:33.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Revech,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WP9z6Wew,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2020-02-08T06:46:15.512+0000)\n>\n> Endorphin addiction aka mental high from wins.\n\nyeah MILLIONS of people are addicted by winning... do you have actual argument here?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-08T06:06:16.904+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"photo of game\n\nhttps://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/217/040/48ACD.png?1323900430","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2020-02-08T11:08:10.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When League is feelin bad, just play WC3 Refunded for a few minutes and your passion for LoL will instantly be rejuvinated.","replies":[]}]}
