How do you fight darius?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;m not trying to whine &#039;wah wah, op plz nerf&quot; but i don&#039;t understand. How do you fight darius as melee?\n\nsince he came out. darius has always been a lane bully. he is extremely tanky and has some of the highest potential damage in the game, true damage no less. as well as an absurdly strong bleed + an ad steroid ontop of it.  \n\nNo matter who I play, it always feels like he has all the options. \nPlay ranged carry? you might shove him in early, but then you just get camped or he goes b, gets tanky enough to ignore you and you die\nplay mage? same issue, but might take him a little longer\nplay gnar? you can kite/harass him in mini form, but the moment you transform. you have to hide until you transform back\nplay melee? the only way i&#039;ve ever seen him even lose lane vs melee is when his opponent went flat damage + ignite and managed to outburst him pre 6. and even then he barely lost.\n\nAs someone who tries to play to what the team needs, (usually tanks) any time i see darius top lane, i already know i've lost the lane, and just hope i don't feed to the point my team can't kill him. It&#039;s not that I&#039;ve given up, but no matter what I try. i get absolutely destroyed. Even fighting with minion advantage or with a surprise initiation of some sort usually means nothing since he's tanky enough to survive the cc, then q's you and gets 1/4 of his hp back, then his passive will win in a straight fight pre 6, or he'll just ult you and laugh unless you have some magic way to block his ult... which pratically doesn't exist unless you're sivir or nocturn\n\nsimply getting into melee range of darius is either automatic death or you have to recall to base. if you get some damage on, he just pulls you back and heals, if you&#039;re trying to kite, he just pulls you back, slows and takes away 3/4 of your hp already.\n\nIn all honest... besides sit under tower and cry for your jungler (darius can often win a 2v1 anyway just with his heal and raw base stats) how is this matchup even playable?","replies":[{"poster":"l DÃ¡rius l","date":"2016-11-15T04:14:27.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"be ranged or be riven and fiora\ntrundle and nasus beat him post 6\njax beats him post 6\nanything ranged can beat him\nsome matchups can beat him if he just misses his q heal\nswain beats him at all stages of the game\nekko can beat him if he brings a corrupting pot into lane\ncass beats him at all points of the game\nhe scales poorly\ngnar destroys him and he is worthless if u build gnar like a competent person","replies":[{"poster":"Mishli","date":"2016-11-16T04:45:07.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't claim to be an expert, but in my experience with gnar, if he gets a hold of you in either form without jump up you're basically already dead, mini is so squishy he just melts (like vs irelia) and as long as he times it right, even if you land w in mega form he can still shred you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2016-11-14T04:59:07.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"After he Q's burst him then back off if you don't think you can kill him before his Q comes back up. \n\nIf you play around his Q you win the matchup, same way you play around Riven's cooldowns.","replies":[{"poster":"Mishli","date":"2016-11-16T04:46:19.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"literally cannot back off without dying.
