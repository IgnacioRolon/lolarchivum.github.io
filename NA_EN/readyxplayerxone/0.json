But to date Rengar hasn't ever been addressed and the rework was just a fucking joke. I think the only reason we don't see champs like those at worlds is because they don't want them nerfed lol.\n\nCan you imagine the number of penta's a fed darius would get at worlds?\n\nRengar wouldn't be so bad since they'd actually ward... but still, he'd be pretty brutal.","replies":[{"poster":"Kilanost","date":"2016-12-24T02:20:44.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, because the pro's dont play to win....","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-12-24T02:09:28.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius was played at worlds plenty after the Juggernaut update.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2016-12-24T00:19:58.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ReadyxPlayerxOne,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4trnAqck,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-12-24T00:16:40.456+0000)\n>\n> Literally never seen a champion this unbalanced.
