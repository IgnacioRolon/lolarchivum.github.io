I'd post the replay and show you how every one of those kills was not only my kill but the assists were me not taking the kill, I also tanked the most damage, warded the most, healed the most by over 10k and had the most gold but it's not even worth spending more time talking to you. \n\nSo glad I met a worthless person on these boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2016-12-22T22:35:35.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The truth hurts man.
