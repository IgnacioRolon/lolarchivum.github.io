It&#039;s not fun to fight 1v5&#039;s. It&#039;s not acceptable that I play support and my adc has no intention of building correctly, poking, csing well or even being in the correct lane for mid game. It&#039;s not acceptable that the jungler can&#039;t clear camps, never ganks, never pings, doesn&#039;t build correctly and has no clue how to use the map. It&#039;s not acceptable that mid lane doesn&#039;t ward, doesn&#039;t combo, barely pokes, ults the wrong people and might as well be a turkey. And a million other examples.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m tired of having dead weight teammates. I&#039;m tired of teaching them the game only to have them think I&#039;m being toxic, trolling or am stupid for asking them to do the simplest fucking thing in the game... ward.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s the only reason I get upset at this game. I don&#039;t like being forced to carry absolute garbage who can&#039;t even listen to me help them. It&#039;s not cool to play with people who can&#039;t listen or do the absolute most basic parts of this game. And it&#039;s even worse when they don&#039;t want to listen to me explain how to do the thing they&#039;re royally fucking up.\r\n\r\nWhen do we get a better team recruitment method? When can we force these people to either get better or play by themselves?\r\n\r\nWhen is this bullshit going to stop?","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2017-01-05T05:02:42.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"you posted this earlier, starting to think you just want people to think you're better than everyone","replies":[{"poster":"ReadyxPlayerxOne","date":"2017-01-05T05:06:56.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leo1024,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E0Q0mjXh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-05T05:02:42.958+0000)\n>\n> you posted this earlier, starting to think you just want people to think you&#x27;re better than everyone\n\nNo, some dumb fuck mod deleted it.

Maybe that's too assumptive for them.  I also look at the responses I got in gameplay... and they're completely lacking. The PB&M crowd was MUCH better received and MUCH better understood. The ONLY person who didn't understand the post was the mod. ALL YOU'RE DOING is giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nEveryone makes this mistake. You believe you know something about me that you don't. I don't focus on their behavior. I look at my gameplay and do everything I can to win. THAT INCLUDES TRYING TO HELP MY TEAM. But it's extremely frustrating when that's met by toxicity, ignorance, insanity, assumptions and complete unwillingness to do anything but what they want to do.  In a ranked competition, any of that behavior isn't acceptable.\n\nI think both queue's suck pretty much right now. Autofill is a failed concept and if it isn't removed it'll be a detriment to the game for years to come.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-05T05:29:05.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't want to sound condescending, but it seems you just need to climb higher if that's the kind of teammates you're having.

I've literally had diamond players on alts try to carry the games I get queued into and they fail.
