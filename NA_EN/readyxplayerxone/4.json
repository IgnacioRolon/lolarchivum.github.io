But I really have no idea how to help the 0/8/0 Twitch by 7 minutes who suicided into lane every second he could EVEN WITH ME using a Tahm Kench to w him out half the time.  Seriously bugs me when those scum of the earth higher tiers decide I'm absolute shit class because I can't carry that sort of thing. They couldn't either. Guaranteed.  \n\nPersonally, I blame the matchmaking.  Should be impossible for ANYONE ranked above silver to queue into leveler accounts.  I'd say ANY rank but well, I'll settle for less. How it's acceptable that a Diamond tier player with full runes and masteries is able to queue into level 18 or below accounts is simply a complete FAILURE in matchmaking code. It's disgusting.  I'm all for letting players of all ranks fight each other. But at least make that be level 30's fighting each other. Not leveler accounts vs. Diamonds and Plats. That's unacceptable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-11-09T02:53:15.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That normally happens after season end, and people don't start playing right until season is about to start again","replies":[{"poster":"ReadyxPlayerxOne","date":"2016-11-09T03:02:22.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Bloo Banana,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=q9t1sPqj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-09T02:53:15.878+0000)\n>\n> That normally happens after season end, and people don&#x27;t start playing right until season is about to start again\n\nFuck the season, I'm a fucking levelers... queuing into DIAMOND AND PLATINUM PLAYERS... not smurfs... legit on diamond and platinum players and my team feeds 9000 kills before we're level 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-11-09T12:47:18.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's because they don't care... early preseason is basically just normals or aram for most people, them smurfing or not doesn't mean anything.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2016-11-09T02:43:27.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Blowing steam after not getting to where they wanted?
