Post-11, Kha can rely on his reset mechanic for maneuverability but since he doesn't paint as many targets with damage as someone like katarina, he needs a fallback plan for getting around (handily enough, the stealth is less effective as mobility than the jump so it seems well designed as a fallback plan). Kha'Zix already falls off hard enough in the super lategame that removing his survivability via stealth would be very harsh.\n{{champion:107}} : Relies completely and entirely on the element of suprise. Sure his burst is incredible, but he can USUALLY only eliminate one MAYBE 2 (if lucky), threats from the enemy team before being taken down or forced to back out. Does not do well if forced to jump into clusters unless SUPER ahead, or given opportunities via enemy mistakes.\n{{champion:35}} : Relies on his Q stealth for initiation, escape, repositioning.

(phantom dancer especially).\n{{champion:91}} : Ultimate stealth is important to either getting in or getting out, already struggles in group settings.\n{{champion:17}} : as much as i hate to say it, lategame pinks would hurt teemo too much, his ability to keep shroom cover is already gated by moving sweepers.\n{{champion:29}} : wouldn't be hurt too much by this in the lategame I don't think. In a group setting, he already tends to use his stealth for the attack speed buff in combo with his ultimate.\n{{champion:67}} For almost the exact same reasons as Kha, vayne needs her invisibility to function in super lategame due to her short range nature.\n{{champion:62}} : initiation / escape you heard the spiel before :P\n\n\nLook, I get why you would want this, however I hope that if you read this, you can see how this lategame lack of space for pinks is an intentional balance choice.","replies":[{"poster":"IGII2","date":"2016-05-05T15:31:03.127+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just gonna disagree with your comment about LeBlanc and her stealth mechanic, I find it of high importance as a jungler to carry a pink ward with me whenever I'm about to gank LeBlanc in order to take her down. Otherwise the extra second in stealth usually means that she escapes or cancels your auto that could have killed her. It also counters all forms of direct targeting while she's stealthed.\n\nNow back to the original topic: I agree so much, I want an extra inventory slot for pink ward since the removal of oracles. Like what's even the point of not allowing us to have it?\n\nNow I understand the reason behind removing oracles as it completely cripples stealth champs BUT there is absolutely no reason to deny us buying pink wards with full build while you could have been buying them the whole game before that moment and effectively counter any stealth champ (probably most worthy of mentioning are Akali, Wukong, Kha as it's their only way of surviving in teamfights). \n\n**It actually feels wrong** to use that last inventory slot to buy that one last item as you are basically saying \"alright <insert stealth champ here>, you are free to do w/e you want\". I learned that relying on your teammates (especially supports who usually have that extra inventory space) to carry with them around pink ward when dealing with stealth champs is just a bad idea as they just won't do that for whatever reason (which shouldn't be happening, but well, what do you do). And if you go to super late game, where completely everyone has full builds, you are faced with a decision: Leave that one last item in base to pick up a pink ward in order to counter Rengo / Eve / Wuk / whatever or let them rampage through your team. I find this thing to be very unhealthy for game.\n\nEither make Pink wards not reveal stealth champs (while still leaving them useful to gain vision control over a certain area by revealing enemy wards) or give us the one extra inventory space. There's not much logic in the interaction between stealth champs and pink wards as of now.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-05-05T16:23:51.935+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I see a few possible outcomes.\n-We get a pink-specific slot: Most (if not all) stealth champions need balance adjustments varying from small touches (likely twitch) to huge changes (Rengar, Akali and the likes) If these champions are not adjusted accordingly / untill they are, they will see little change in low elo but the higher you get the more useless they become.\n\n-We do not get a pink specific slot: things continue as they are now. Shitty low tier ADC's will split push vs rengar and die over and over. Meanwhile the higher you go in elo, the less of that you see.\n\nRealistically, the only stealth champions that WANT you to group are Twitch and Wukong. Everyone else has a harder time if the enemy clusters. Sure eve can get a big shield, and arguably since vayne is a mid-late champion she might TECHNICALLY like grouping but whatever.\n\nTry this on for size: Instead of giving EVERYBODY pinks, give us an upgrade option for the yellow totem that gives you one pink per fountain visit. That way you don't have junglers running around with green smite + Sweeper + pinks, or supports with ruby ss + spooky ghost + sweeper + Pinks.\n\nTLDR: Grouping doesn't take up an inventory space.\nShitty carries that refuse to let people protect them do not make stealth champions overpowered.

Pinks wouldn't stop him from getting to you, and by the time you see him, he jumps. \n\nAnd as for the other champs, you have tools available already that do that job, and do it for free.

You kill them, because now they can't use their stealth to survive longer than they should and win the game because their carry is dead and you're not.\n\nIt's really not that complicated to figure out. Just because you have 6 item slots does not mean you have to fill them all with big-ticket items, despite Riot's insistence that it's the entire point.","replies":[{"poster":"statelesskiller","date":"2016-05-06T21:37:35.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so your saying . . . that in order to use the \"proper counter\" to a champion. i need to give up a expensive gold item . . . for pink ward (can you buy multiple pink wards that then stack in the same slot? ive never tried buying more then 1 at a time) if your ask me. no matter who you are thats not worth. lets use the game i did this as a good example. \n\ni was a udyr. and my build consisted of. warrior (i was tiger stance dyr) swifties frozen heart hydra zz rot and a banshees. now as udyr. there is not a single item in that build that i would sell for a pink ward. none of it. absolutely none. i was split pushing because i was ahead and i used the rot to apply pressure in the top while i was in bot. i had warrior for obviouse reasons.  hydra because i needed lifesteal and wave clear. swifties because swifties. frozen heart because vayne and CDR and banshees because of the spell shield and MR.\n\ni could not even for a moment entertain the thought that selling just one of those items to deal with vayne was worth. i could get rid of banshees sure. but all that does is make me vulnerable to her CC which even if i had a pink ward she would condemm me into a wall and i was dead anyways so that cant happen. cant get rid of rot warrior or frozen heart cause those are core for the strategy i was doing (and i won the game by doing anyways) and i cant get rid of hydra because then i would have no wave clear. so what? sell boots? thats stupid on alot of people. and if i did that then i DEFINITELY couldn't do anything to vayne\n\nevery item i build (as with anyone really) you build for a REASON. and even a rampaging vayne does not give you enough reason to remove a entire item for a single pink ward that could MAYBE possibly help you kill her\n\nthis even matters to the support. i mean they only have 3 item slots (they build support item sightstone and boots (kinda sorta maybe i dont build the ward support item that much))  or two depending. but you know that they have tons of useful items to build. they can get locket randuins frozen gauntlet ardent censer mikaels and alot of those items are simply more valuable and useful then a mere single pink ward that COULD be helpful\n\nim sorry but if the only way to beat a vayne thats doing well is to literally regress your build something is wrong","replies":[{"poster":"ForeverLaxx","date":"2016-05-07T04:05:58.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=statelesskiller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dHnksjZl,comment-id=00020000000000010000,timestamp=2016-05-06T21:37:35.582+0000)\n\n> im sorry but if the only way to beat a vayne thats doing well is to literally regress your build something is wrong\n\nThis is the essence of counterbuilding, and the sooner you learn it the better you'll become. I'm personally sick of this notion that players should be able to \"build whatever they want and still win\", and when that doesn't work, they come crying for nerfs for champions that don't necessarily deserve it.\n\nStop making excuses and get better at the game.","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2016-05-08T18:44:48.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually you are wrong. Players SHOULDN'T have to sacrifice an item when there was an item that could do the Job properly. It was a bad change on Riot's part which has been brought up on board every now and then. I believe they'll bring back true sight (except pinks). It's paramount against stealth champs.\n\nAlso, getting a pink doesn't even guarantee much since you place it in one spot and wait. True sight follows the user allowing for easier detection.

And players *should* have to make sacrifices to their builds if they want to increase the chance of winning. If he really wanted to keep everything his items were doing, he could have sold Banshees, traded out Swiftness Boots for Merc Treads, and traded Frozen Heart for Randuins. That covers the CC he's so deathly afraid of, gives him the attack speed reduction he wants and offsets the health loss of losing Banshees. Is it a perfect cover? No, but it's a compromise that has to be weighed against just letting Vayne run rampant.","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2016-05-09T10:57:17.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I'm not offended. Secondly, making sacrifices is okay in the examples you gave. But sacrificing a potential 2.5+k gold item just to get a 75 gold items is outrageous. That's like sacrificing a sedan for a bike simply because a bike isn't hindered by traffic. It's unreasonable. Also have in mind that a pink doesn't guarantee anything. Vayne could flash away or move away from the vision range and still kill enemies easily. So it's a disadvantage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KarKzz","date":"2016-05-06T15:16:42.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One less item > Vayne freely rampaging.

The reason there's no pink ward exclusive slot is so games actually end in a timely manner (most of the time). If everyone had a pink ward and placed it in the late game, there would be so much vision compiled with the bules and yellows that no one would be able to get anything done. Right now, 50m+ games end when everyone gets to 6 items and the better strategic guess infers where the other team will be at any given moment. So if you give everyone a pink ward, the skill that one needs to guess where an enemy will be and counter it is gone and games will go on for a much longer time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FourVsFive","date":"2016-05-10T21:38:07.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would not mind a special slot for pink wards, but if they do it the special slot should only be able to hold a max of 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-05-10T16:34:43.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its like we miss the pink ward trinket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-05-09T11:04:26.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss being able to upgrade my trinket to pink version so I could take sight stone AND pink trinket for better vision control.","replies":[]}]}
