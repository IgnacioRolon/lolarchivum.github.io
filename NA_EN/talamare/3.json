Say you build a Randuin's, which gives you 500 Health and 70 Armor.  Say your champ already has 80 armor when you build it, and has 2k health, so you now have 2.5k health and 150 armor.  Having 150 armor means you take 60% less physical damage (compared to 80 armor, which mitigates around 45% of physical damage); that 70 armor means you take over 33.3% less physical damage than before.  With Randuin's, at full health, the damage BotRK passive will do on hit is 80 damage; without Randuin's, you will take 88 damage at full health.\n\nThe ratios are similar with Sunfire Cape and Ohmwrecker (the only other health + armor items).","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non Ã¨ male","date":"2015-01-01T22:34:45.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that you make your enemy spend 2850 gold in a defensive item to absorb basically 0 damage and you can spend those money to get extra damage on him\nPlus a lot of tanky champs have more than 2k health late game with their base health, and you are assuming this champ buy 0 health through the other items, which is really not likely for a champ that goes through a defensive itemization path (a guy that build a Randuin is likely going to build AT LEAST some hundred extra health through MR defensive items like SV or Aegis items)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PatMcGroyn","date":"2015-01-01T18:13:45.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ale non Ã¨ male,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j2p5aGYl,comment-id=00000000000100000000000000020000,timestamp=2015-01-01T17:03:49.792+0000)\n>\n> How does armor mitigate Atk speed?\n> And yeah, theoretically Armor mitigate BoTRK Damage, BUT armor itemization forces you also to build health, except for {{item:3075}} , {{item:3110}} , {{item:3025}} (that can't be built by anybody as its armor is kinda low and mana and AP got wasted on a good amount of champ), and {{item:3026}} (which has low armor anway)  **health which amplify a lot BoTRK damage** (after all, BoTRK was created to counter health), so basically when you get armor through the itemization you **increase** damage dealt by BoTRK, unless you don't build Thornmail or Frozen Heart, of course\n\nArmor mitigates the damage the AA damage that Attack Speed enhances, was my point.  Armor mitigates ALL physical damage, and is therefore a counter to BotRK.  It doesn't make BotRK useless, because it's a great item, but it is the proper stat to build to mitigate BotRK's damage.  Also, because building health technically increases the Passive % health damage of BotRK, whereas building flat Armor only mitigates BotRK's damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yuumi or Lose","date":"2014-12-30T12:03:56.633+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish Trundles and Urgots ult would last that long.
