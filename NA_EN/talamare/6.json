I'm all over that. ^_^\n\nOff topic for a second... and not to be flippant, but  did you know that \"Role-Playing\" has a board. Although few even know it is there. http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/roleplaying\n\n(Truly Complete aside, but did you know Riot used to host RP'ing events and reds would act as the champs and important characters while the rest of us roleplayed as summoners of various skill, or even just important, or in a lot of cases not so important people of Runeterra...\n\nOne of the Hallmark RPs was the release of Maokai... which was RP'd by a grand number of people and was hosted by Feral Pony and Shurelia.\n\nSome fought a dragon... others tried to assist the champs as Maokai rampage through them, still others sought there own goals... was a grand event.)\n\nTo really answer your question let me ask you a few in return...\n\nWhy does the \"League Videos\" and \"Roleplaying\" boards exist?\n\nWouldn't clearly both fit in \"Community Creation\"?\n\nI would put forward that it is due to the nature of just how broad \"CC\" is... that it ends up with people who are there for art but nothing more, and people that want vids but nothing more, people who wish to Roleplay but nothing more, and people that want to write and read fanfiction but nothing more... And that at the end of it all these people just end up stepping on each others feet most of the time.\n\nPost of fanfiction and videos that took hours to make as swept aside by art that someone found cool while doing a google search.\n\nBasically these topic all move at different paces. RP and Fanfiction general benefit from a slower turn over... where as Vids and Art which people can easily see in mere seconds garner many more comments, and thus crowd out the slower moving styles of community creation.\n\nAnd before anyone says that fanfiction is not worth reading... I challenge them to read this... and maintain that opinion. http://archiveofourown.org/works/1040588?view_full_work=true","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-03-02T01:04:12.827+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ark (can I call you Ark?)\n\nYour suspicions are correct - I did *not* know there was a roleplaying board!

But I'll paint the general picture and give an account of the story that unfolded for kicks. ^_^\n\nIf I remember correctly, and hold me to none of this, the event was advertised on the RP boards a week in advance of the champ launch and everyone who wished to participate had to fill out a character bio(which is normal for these kinda events and allows for some screening of inappropriate characters.).\n\nAnyway Then the day of the patch, at a certain time there were several threads made that where like \"Event Room A\" \"Event Room B\" \"Event Room C\" and so on and so on. Each player that had an approved Bio was asides a room. the room had rough caps of 10 to 16 or so players. \n\nIt was made clear up front that only Rioters would control champs, and that interaction with champs would be somewhat limited from the Player Characters, at least at the start. Although some of the people playing did play as the summoners summoning the champs to the field... these players however I think where buddies of the reds so idk. XD \n\nThe RP began with everyone entering a kinda press box which overlooked the twisted treeline. At least in my room people were playing everything from Noxain Royals to low level summoners who had managed to scheme enough free time and privileges to get a ticket.\n\nSo the way it all worked was that every 15 minutes or so... a Rioter would post an \"event\" that moved the story along.\n\nThe first of these was Ezreal walking into the jungle early and finding Mundo there... who promptly cleaver'd him in the face, and there was the classic lvl1 TT fight. Soraka healing Ez, and then we were given time to have our characters interact.\n\nThen given updates on the match and then strange signs started showing... minions started spawning malformed.... the Dragon began to wonder the map oddly... both Nexus start to glow brightly... the sky grew dark...\n\nWe got more time to react, the low level summoners made jokes about how much trouble the people summoning the minions would be in, and a few other thing went happened...\n\nThere was a fight for red buff and just as it was about to die...\n\nMaokai manifested, killed all 6 champions on the map by himself(they must have know what he would be like season 4 and 5) and all hell broke loose. The minions started to attack the crowds that where watching the match, dragon also, some went to help the crowds others rushed to aid the champs in subduing Maokai, still others rushed to the Nexus to try and stop them from going out of control.\n\nSome grabbed items from the shop to aid them and in general it was a silly but wild and fun RP that lasted about three or four hours.\n\nThe amount of effort put in by the Reds was massive. I'm not sure how many \"Rooms\" were made but I know I was in \"Event Room A\" and I had a friend in \"Event Room F\" who told me about playing a Yordle who was visiting the match on her first trip away from Bandle City.\n\nI guess in short to some extent the event self limited... but the Reds also put some effort in to making sure that it could scale if need be.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-03-03T08:15:51.811+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I mentioned to Ark - I managed to make myself misunderstood and that's my fault.

I shall contain my hype for now... but urge to hype growing. ^_^\n\nHey, Ark,\n\nHad that chat with the guys in charge of the NA Boards today - nice blokes.  They were explaining that the form the boards currently take is not how they'd like to keep them - that with the NA Boards being the first of the new boards system, a bit experimental, there's a bit of happenstance to how the different boards were divided.\n\nThey were really keen to discuss the possibility of a fan fiction board - without committing to having one immediately. :)  In fact, they thought that it would be a good idea to get players involved in the inevitable conversations regarding how content creators like fan fiction writers (and other creators) could be best served here.\n\nThere's a non-zero chance they'll be turning up to talk about it in a non-geological timeframe, but no firm dates or anything.\n\nBeyond the mechanical side of things, we talked about how we can get more rioters over the fear of taking part over here, how grey and miserable Edinburgh can be on a bad day, and the psychology of content creators.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ark Angel HFB","date":"2015-03-03T20:28:14.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=s1J8F24f,comment-id=0001000200000000000000000002000000000000000000000001000a,timestamp=2015-03-03T17:31:01.652+0000)\n>\n> No!

All will agree that limiting toxic trolls is a good thing... on the other hand, hold a bird and it will be safe, but never fly.\n\nThe reason as far as I know that that board was removed from listed after only being up for a short while... was a massive invasion of trolls. However oddly enough in the time since, a few of those trolls have stuck around and are just kinda part of the community taking part in RPs and general adding to the enjoyment by all.\n\nAlso, there is a good chance the RP board may become listed again soon... just not sure if it is \"soon\" or Riot's \"SoonTM\"\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/roleplaying/rFfAsGqA-want-to-try-making-this-board-public\n \n> I can send an email tomorrow to ask them if they think the graph of interest and the graph of difficulty (or time) of implementation overlaps nicely.  *I do not promise any result*, except to ask the question.\n\nFrankly I expect no results, but I can hope and the effort is greatly appreciated. Many kind words and thoughts.\n \n> Last two things:\n> \n> 1. In your opinion, would a fan-fiction board benefit from NOT being listed on the sidebar, like the role-playing board?\n> 2. Is there a desire for a separate board from the rest of that segment of the community, not just yourself?  I'm not questioning your wishes - just trying to get a handle on whether this is a wish that lots of fan-fic writers and readers want, or it's from a dedicated few.\n\n1. Yes there would be benefits, you even listed a few in regards to trolls and shealtering the community as it grows. Still I feel the lack of visibility would also be hindrance, idk for me if you can't handle a few trolls you probably should just avoid the internet.\n\n2. I simply do not know. Threads asking for separate boards for fanfiction are uncommon on the feedback board, but the few I've seen tend to get a positive response. I can't say that those that up-voters would ever really uses the FF board though, or even that they really care.\n\nStill, on FF.net there is close to 3k fanfiction for LoL... more on AO3's site. A lot of fanfiction writers moved their stories there when the board change happened... but neither of those sites work well for conversing with fellow writers and readers.\n\nAnd I guess that was what really was lost. not so much the stories, but the community of readers and writers that had functioned fairly well for about 4 years. weekly and monthly writing challenges... request threads for stories, people plugin there stories, what if post.\n\nI completely understand cost vs benefit thinking.(I'm a computer science major) If it turns out one more board is a hassle which consumes to much time that people could be working on something else... then yeah I understand that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-03-01T21:16:00.356+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry if we're scaring you off.
