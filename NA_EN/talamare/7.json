He has the highest win rate of all supports in games that last >35 mins, but as Riot as pointed out quite often \"auras don't FEEL powerful.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-24T05:23:32.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its more cause late game when getting caught means certain death, he can front line and heavily and reliably punish squishies who stray.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sherogarth","date":"2015-02-24T09:20:27.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted my [rework](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/rk2ORkAg-taric-rework-my-idea-and-thoughts) idea for Taric a while back where his E is a cone blind (and silence if empowered) and his stun is moved to his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ardent Slurt","date":"2015-02-24T05:00:27.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe it could be in a cone and stun the champions farthest away while blind the champions closer to the radius?","replies":[{"poster":"freeformline","date":"2015-02-24T07:09:03.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or stun the close ones and charm the distant ones.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aratez Treaty","date":"2015-02-24T05:36:03.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And if you really want to play Taric, just get his Bloodstone Skin, which is awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-02-24T06:46:39.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aratez Treaty,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XkdYFwIv,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-24T05:36:03.372+0000)\n>\n> And if you really want to play Taric, just get his Bloodstone Skin, which is awesome.\n\nPink is the only way to go. Bloodstone is his only \"non fabulous skin\" Default and emerald are passable. But to truly be a master of Taric, one MUST purchase his pink armor.","replies":[]}]}]}
