I think Winterfox had better individual players across the board; they just played horribly. Esp. since they wont have Alex Ich? I think? He was literally the only one who looked competent the entire 5 games series. The rest of the time it was Seraph being Seraph and the rest of them failing everything.\n\nJust Winterfox played worse for this set. I think if Alex wasn't subbing in, they would have just lost 3 games in a row. The good news is, at least Alex Ich still has it.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-04-27T06:44:34.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The hilarious part was the casters talking as if having Alex mid was a handicap since he's a sub.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-04-27T03:14:37.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd blame the coach.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dyvius","date":"2015-04-30T02:33:36.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TDK hired the Russian mob boss to carry them all the way to the LCS.\n\nThe hit was successful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SinatraZ","date":"2015-04-28T12:48:46.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They must not be that amazing.

It really seems that in a lot of games, it's decided on who gets Sivir...look at the EU LCS finals for example. It was pretty much the team that had Sivir won (I think there was maybe one where neither team had her, so it was a toss up). This isn't saying she's OP or anything, but she really can decide games in the Cinderhulk Tank meta, as she gives the engage potential the tanks need to break open the enemy team.","replies":[]}]}
