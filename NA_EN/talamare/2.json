I am pretty sure most players have tryed simple items to change the battle. His early game is to strong, and he does need some fixing. You may not agree, but the idea that a champ can dive at 6 and get free kills with not much risk is pretty Op in my book.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kise","date":"2015-02-02T04:17:07.174+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"dw guys he's getting his attack speed reduced\n\n:|","replies":[{"poster":"Markus Vakarian","date":"2015-02-02T08:22:04.202+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"attack speed is not the problem on assassins","replies":[]}]}]}
