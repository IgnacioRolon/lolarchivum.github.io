Sorry for my bad English, I will try explain what happened. I was about to buy 3days exp boost for 2,5euro in my legacy client (I had not new client because I just didn't installed it) and I couldn't because I got no TAN code to buy over sofort Ãœberweisung (was some bug while picture didn't loaded). So I decided to uninstal LOL and install it again with new client. 1gb or more of client was downloaded, after that I logged in game. I couldn't see my level or player Icon (right top corner). I could surf over my champs, profile, match history etc. So I decided to buy RP while game were downloading \"13gb\". I did payment, money was taken and client didn't refreshed my RP status. I just thought it will refresh after update. I even checked RP purchase history and there was RP purchase log (sadly I didn't made a photo). After I logged in into updated client there was no RP and even in purchase history it is gone now. Can you speed up support? I want exp boost to lvl up faster to 30lvl. If support will answer me after 3 days or so... Then I don't need that RP anymore cause I will ryse lvl by myself in that time. Even support had to section about RP purchases... ITS SAD! Request #25257639 - its my support case.
