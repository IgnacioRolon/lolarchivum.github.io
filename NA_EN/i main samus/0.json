I'm not angry because of how difficult it was but how it was handled. The team I was on was on our back foot already after losing a baron but when the enemy team decided to jump straight to mid and shove super hard for the win my teams support the morgana decided to afk right in our jungle. That part alone infuriated me on the inside because well.. It's an afk, I'm pretty sure we all hate those. \r\nThe worst part of this though after the match which I actually said little in up until the very end, was that when I asked for a report on the morgana my jungler told me \"Well we are all together, so you're getting reported.\" That alone is bull because shortly after I get a warning of verbal abuse which I once again said very little the entire match, and only asked for proper positioning when a team-mate decided to be in river while we were defending at another point in the match, and I would give everything in my wallet right now to say that the morgana who afk'd on purpose knowing what was to happen if he/she did has gone off with no warning, no punishment, and gets to play scott-free to afk in another match the exact same way... Once again. Thanks for reading if you did and Riot. Please for the love of god remove the ability to play normal draft with only 4 people. That's just causing people to become victims of something they shouldn't be afraid of.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-04T02:10:29.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not scott-free. You don't need a volume of reports in a single match for it to count. Just one. Their 4 reports on you mean absolutely nothing if you did nothing wrong. You're one report on rage-quitter Morg is all it takes in that round to count in Morg's report history when time comes for a ban-decision on her. This is why people need to stop asking for reports. I do it some times, 'cause I'm ticked at the moment and not thinking rationally. But in all honesty, if I'm reporting, nobody else needs to.\n\nPeople need to stop assuming that the banhammer is run by people with the same childish logic as the people who need bans. It's not. There are ACTUALLY mature people out there in the world, and THEY'RE the ones generally running a monitoring system like this.\n\nCommon ally logic you'll see in-game that you need to just sluff off your conscious awareness when it happens. It's stupid crap, but it's common, but it aint what affects bans:\n\n-Grouped = Excuse to rage/grief\n-Your KDA = Excuse to rage/grief\n-Others' KDA = Excuse to rage/grief\n\nIf you're gonna use the idiocy of people who think like this to tell me my group queue number should be restricted, you're just contributing to the problem, not helping.\n\nThe correct response to this: There are doofuses in chat. They are bothering you. Mute and report. \nThe DEAD WRONG response: Whine to everyone else in the community about it and tell them they can't group queue at cap-1 anymore, because you assume the words of doofuses have an impact on anything.\n\nRegarding warnings: I get them all the time. It means nothing. Riot likes to let people know when they get reported. It doesn't mean you're in danger of a ban, or that you even need to TAKE NOTE of it. Learn to know when an ally report doesn't matter and your report does.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-10-04T00:31:37.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you aren't toxic those reports won't do anything to you.
