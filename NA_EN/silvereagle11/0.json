The last time she received a skin was God knows when, and you are considering this as a skin, and you are also unsure if said skin will be Legacy or not.  You really should not make it Legacy out of respect for the players who main her.  Same with any champ you give a skin who hasn't received a skin in a super long time.  Otherwise, it's a humongous slap to the face to anyone who mains the champ.  \"Oh here you go!  A skin for your champ, finally, after years of waiting, but you only have a limited time to buy it before we 'say fk you it's gone'.\"  \n\nYou guys really need to do a better job of not making it seem like you appeal to your most commonly played champs because they bring in more money.

While the community decided on the champion who would receive the skin, Diana won't be wearing an esports jersey, or look anything like the World Championship skins. \n\nI am unable to say if she is legacy or not because that information hasn't been publicly announced, so that would technically go against my NDA in this case.","replies":[{"poster":"Bellows","date":"2016-04-01T22:13:32.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Aurelion Sol needs double tap q for toxic talon.
