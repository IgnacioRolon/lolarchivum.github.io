In other words, they just needed to stick to lanes and try to siege while being careful of Maokai flank (very easy to do with gragas disengage and Karma) but they kept taking fights in the jungle or at least getting engaged on/being chased into the jungle where they fell apart.\n\nTL did something similar with the baron baits.
