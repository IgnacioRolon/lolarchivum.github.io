I made up around 3150 ip. Out of curiosity, I went to the shop to check out Urgot's abilities since I remembered a game where I was destroyed by an Urgot. When I moused over to click learn more, I clicked too early and bought the champion by mistake. I already used my refunds up, so is there any way I could get my ip refunded, or is this an rp situation only?","replies":[{"poster":"Kmanfk3r","date":"2017-09-18T01:34:45.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for informing me of this.
