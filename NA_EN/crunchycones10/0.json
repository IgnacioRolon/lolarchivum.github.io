I never got into fights with anyone and never did anything to get me banned, so why is my account disabled, and can anyone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-14T02:55:02.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find any PBE account associated with *this* account, but overall there's a good chance that the PBE account you had may have been disabled after a certain period of inactivity or simply because of how old it was. As the email said, contact our player support in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and choose the option \"I need help recovering my account\". Make sure you give them the Summoner Name of the main account that your PBE one is tied to.","replies":[{"poster":"BirbMan530","date":"2017-08-14T03:09:27.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that to stop people who bought PBE accounts?
