That fits perfectly in the US right now, you would be surprised how many people don't know what two countries border the US.\n\nYou used the word right there. Scary. It's fear tactics. Nothing more. In hopes that the average American isn't intelligent enough to understand these things. Again, everyone wanted to cry socialism when FDR enacted a minimum wage (Which by the way, was defined as the minimum wage you can make a decent living. Not \"a no skill job for high school kids.\"). You seem to insinuate that those people are voting for Sanders, yet poll numbers show by and large Trump supports are the most uneducated voters.\n\nIt's very simple. You outsource all your decent paying jobs in order to benefit the pockets of the 1%, you will have a lot of poor people. People want to bitch about how \"lazy\" the new generation is. Let's take the same low skill working now vs earlier. You used to be able to get outta high school and go get a good paying job at the factory. But then, all these innovators' kids started inheriting their companies. They lost all the principles the company was founded on and \"Oh look, I can make $10 mil a year instead of $8 mil by shipping my jobs to Mexico! Better bribe congress to enact all this legislature to enable me to do so.\" So now, those SAME EXACT low skill workers get starvation wages at Walmart and McDonald's.\n\nPretty much the only way to get a decent living in this country is through education. Higher education isn't for everyone. And it shouldn't have to be. But then, republicans want to get confused as to why they lose the general election when they put up a candidate that, when asked about his policies decreasing government funding of education to save a couple cents (literally) off your paycheck, says, \"just borrow money from your parents.\" LOL. Sorry Romney, not all of us can do so. Had people like Romney or Trump been president while I was applying for college, I would not have the opportunity to be a pharmacist. Just because of the family I was born to. That is not \"capitalism\". Just like having a decent minimum wage isn't socialism.\n\nTeddy and FDR have to be rolling in their graves right now.\n\nTrickle down economics don't work. Never have, never will.\n\n>Bernie is a socialist.\n\nReally? Where has Bernie suggested taking everything in the country and dividing it up equally among each citizen? That's what socialism is.
