If you recently updated Windows 10, it auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been causing fps drops for some players.  Disabling that can help restore your FPS, but if you continue to have issues then go over our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to troubleshoot this for the fix.
