But the question that keeps coming into my head over and over again is whats stopping from actual assassins from playing support. It can be argued that Pyke was poorly designed for support, his q and e offer some cc but he is intended to build damage. I know so many people hate it when people play off meta, but in reality no position in league is locked in. Mages and assassins do not have to go mid, top laners are not restricted from going mid. Although each champion may seem perfectly suited for their role, support is not all that unique. You could play a variety of champions support and buy a relic shield or redemption and be classified as a \"support.\" What seems so wrong with an assassin or a mage going support but getting a little less gold but still picking up some kills, I mean in theory wouldn't an extra source of damage be beneficial to a team. This is where the term utility gets thrown in, maybe an assassin like zed wouldn't bring \"utility\" to support but I mean one shotting someone seems like a pretty reliable form of cc. Of course this is just me rambling out of boredom please do not torment teammates by playing an assassin support against their wishes, you always need permission to try these things out. Do not be afraid to use the comment section to flame me uncontrollably about how idiotic this sounds, or comment the state of League of Legends and if we can ever expect a complete change in lanes by certain champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-06-04T04:24:16.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue tends to be typical assassins need gold/levels to snowball, both of which the support is lacking in typically, providing they're not taking cs/kills.

Theres no guarantee of a snowball though, which is why taking other assassins support is typically deemed unwise.

They can fend for themselves with mobility\n2. They have the highest damage for the least gold\n3. They rely on picks, vision, and positioning to do their damage, not items.\n4. They are more XP based class than Gold Based.\n5. They like to roam, and we are currently in a meta that every normal support roams.\n6. Top lane is your leader, and ADC counters top lane. Assassins counter ADC, so you remove them from the equation early if you win lane. Most people will agree a bad adc doesn't win the game, and so sending an Assassin bot to give them a hard time can be more beneficial than letting them farm up for mid game fights.\n7. They almost have as much wave clear as mages, if the adc dies, they protect lane with damage. Braum sits there, and even gets dove, Assassins clear waves, and it's actually difficult to take their tower because of it. ADC's are babies letting freeze minions do half the tower hp so they have time to walk down lane. Just give the gold to the Assassin.\n8. The main purpose of support is warding. Anyone can ward. Whatever you bring with that, you have brought something if you control vision on top of it. This is why Assassin supports that can turn invisible are slightly more valued, for deep wards.

Therefore the general case is, low gold means low combat stats and low kill pressure. This basic premise keeps most damage oriented champions out of support role. \n\nwhat happens if an assassin type character gets to brake this premise? that while having low gold, will still have high kill pressure and can combo 100->20% or similar of opponent whenever skills (+ult?) are up? Does this mean opposing ADC can no longer lane because own support can not respond in time, and even if can respond, response is ineffective? \n\nThis is doubly true if the assassin in question has an unanswerable combo like some previous zed iterations (complete combo and snap back before opponent response time, begin combo with untargetable) or previous rengar iteration (complete combo before opponent response time, have megatank stats to absorb fght back and attack speed for follow up)\n\nWe've seen Rengar support. Whenever that was viable, it was incredibly oppressive. He'd try to go for you at levels 2-3 with full bar, and if he'd succeeded with some supplementary damage from his ADC, he could start killing you solo from that poont on, which would happen whenever he had his ult.... unless ofcourse you are playing one of the few dedicated point defense champions and stuck to the ADC like glue, which was no fun at all. \n\n2 I really like roaming as a play style for support players. This requires 2 things - that you are effective against your roam target, and that your ADC doesn't get insta-dived the moment you roam. the question i am posing is this: by putting assassin as a support, are we raming up threat against ADC to the extent that roaming solo is not viable for support player?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-06-04T04:59:49.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Death it's the best CC.
