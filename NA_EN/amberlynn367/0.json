The game has done its initial download and allows me to log in and brings me to the home screen. In the upper left-hand corner, where it would say \"play\" I assume, it always says 0% 1 of 1. When hovering over this, it says Downloading | Game with MB/ KBps and an ETA that only seems to get higher. In the time I've written this post it's gone up 10,000. I've tried going to different locations with different internet but nothing seems to work. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T02:49:36.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like that client may not be able to actually get a good signal from our download servers if that time limit just keeps going up. Let's make sure that there isn't anything blocking that connection by going through each step in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Be sure to pay close attention to port forwarding, and let's also make sure that your firewall is setup to allow Leagues connection through.","replies":[]}]}
