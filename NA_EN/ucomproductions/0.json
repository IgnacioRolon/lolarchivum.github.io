These are just some observations I&#039;ve made against him.\r\n\r\n-Level 1 insane poke especially against melee champs. \r\n\r\n-A huge shield that pretty much makes all damage useless.\r\n\r\n-Once he hits level 6 get ready to sit under turret because he will punish any mistake you make by ulting you and killing you.\r\n\r\n-The amount of damage and tankiness he offers is just too strong.\r\n\r\n-Late game he just becomes a unkillable beast that can 1v1 pretty much anything and with unsealed spellbook it just makes him even better.\r\n\r\n-If you want to beat him you pretty much just have to play a tank and afk farm against him and hope that your jungler will help you.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t look at this as me &quot;crying because I lost lane against him&quot; I haven&#039;t played against a Urgot in a long time, it just feels as if he was meant to be a lane bully. \r\n\r\nAny tips vs him would be helpful.
