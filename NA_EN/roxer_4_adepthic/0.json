I see that you've already responded letting them know that your account needs to be sent back to its original server, so your best bet would be to wait for the agent to get back to you in that ticket. Remind them about the fact that you were at a tournament, and that there's a pretty good chance the transfer and compromised happened while you were there.","replies":[{"poster":"RoXer 4 Adepthic","date":"2017-07-10T01:58:44.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i apreciate your response man , i got worried cauz at first it took them 2 or 3 days to even respond to me , i hope they can transfer it back , if not then RIP","replies":[]}]}]}
