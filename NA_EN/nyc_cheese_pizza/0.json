So I am stuck in bronze 5 and I have come to accept how mind-numbingly bad I am. Nope, nuh uh uh, don&#039;t tell me to not think that; you know its true and are probably laughing at how bad I am somewhere deep inside yourself but I just want help. \r\n\r\nOk I&#039;m a &quot;Riven main&quot; apparently; I have 200k points on her for some background I still can&#039;t do fast combo (partly because mouse is garbage) but like I can do some of her most basic animation cancels. IE; double casting with E and to A VERY SMALL DEGREE I can do a deformed shycombo. I wouldn&#039;t say I am an abomination at Riven but I am approximately the distance between the sun and pluto away from achieving anything close to something the average gold player would consider good. But the thing is, I love riven; her kit is fun, her complexity is also fun but people just tell me to stop playing her. \r\n\r\nThey tell me that Riven is too hard for me and I should just give up on her until my basic game knowledge takes me to like gold. Most of my good friends (they think they are god tier for being silver 3-5) tell me that I am garbage and that I should give up and play annie. You see the most difficult thing life so far for me has been maintaining 90&#039;s in school but it was trumped by me having to laugh and pretend to consider my friends advice of playing annie. \r\n\r\nSo I did what any person what do; I researched what I should do. I researched things I should be doing and how I should attempt to look at games. In normal games I tried to learn how to obtain vision, tried to farm 75ish cs every 12 minutes so I could improve. I played some flex on other accounts (which are also god damn b5) and got really good at it. But as soon as I hit ranked games I see my KDA go to something as decent as 7/4/5 234 to something like 5/12/5 135. I know this is my fault to blame but I don&#039;t understand anymore; am I just naturally bad this game and should just quit? I really love league, I really love it; and as I am starting to prosper in real world like getting good grades and make new friends I had a switch in my mind. I become open minded and I really feel like I can get to challenger (no joke intended) and I want the league communities up most opinion on me. Should I quit? Should I just idk play annie until I git good? Should I play countless hours and ruin gpa average that took so hard to maintain? Do I stick to being a casual and playing normals? How do I bronze 5 player who sits down and plays league and smiles somehow now and ignore rude comments for once get out of Bronze 5.... \r\n\r\n\r\nI am open to literary anything but boosting lol. I am ready for the trolls :D :D :D :D. \r\n\r\nMore info: \r\n\r\nIf you have any advice on champions I should play leave them. Also tell me if I should play low mechanic champions until I get apparent game knowledge and than play complex champions or just one trick my beloved Riven until I am boxbox.","replies":[]}
