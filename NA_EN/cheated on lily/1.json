Looking into this for you, I can confirm your application was received, but we can't force admissions.  In regards to the error, it is a known issue and VPN was able to help some players.  I know that's not the case for you here, but hang tight until we get everything back up and running in order.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Cheated On Lily","date":"2017-04-05T15:36:47.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, i hope i get accepted!
