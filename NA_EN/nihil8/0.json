It could be something with your internet (even though its new), a 3rd party program, a setting on your network, or something else entirely.  The best way we can figure out the root cause is by eliminating some of the most common causes to lag spikes first.  Therefore, make sure to complete all of the steps in this Knowledge Base Article:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/26932010-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nTo be completely fair, there is quite a lot of steps in this guide.
