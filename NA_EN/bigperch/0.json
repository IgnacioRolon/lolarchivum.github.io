I bought Teemo knowing I could refund him later when I had enough to buy Yasuo. But when I look to see if I can refund him, Teemo doesn't show up in my purchase history.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-08T01:08:47.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like Kokua was right about this one. I checked your account and it looks like Teemo was bought over 90 days ago so the system may not let you refund him on your own. I would go ahead and hit up our game agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if they can get this done manually in exchange for a refund token though!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-07T12:34:40.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could check out the [Refund FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ). It sounds like you played for a while and went inactive for a long time, now coming back wanting to refund a champion. One of the refund policies is; \"You will see a list of all your content purchases in the past 90 days.\" I am going to assume that you purchased him over 90 days ago.","replies":[]}]}
