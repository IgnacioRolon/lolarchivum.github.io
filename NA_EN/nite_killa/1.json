Or even worse, they got an ace last game vs the bots so they think they can do it vs people and then cry saying it was all your fault that it didn't work this time and they again got pooped on.\n\nI just want to play the game and have fun again.

I think in this situation, these player's behavior is less caused by them potentially being in a premade and more of them having a bad game and taking it out on others. The best thing you can do in a situation like this is to mute them in-game if they're bothering you, then report them after the match. In this way, you'll help us prioritize who we look at for negative behavior.\n\nCheck out our [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player) for complete details on how this system works.

The first step toward improvement is admitting your own mistake in order to work on them and to correct them. If you honestly think you're punished because you made a right call and your team didn't like it, you're blind to your own problems. Yes \"sanpping\" is looked down upon\". But \"snapping\" is not \"being a leader\", \"calling things out\" or \"being good at the game\". And you're punished because you snap, not because of the other 3 things. \n\n(And ffs, what \"fame\"?
