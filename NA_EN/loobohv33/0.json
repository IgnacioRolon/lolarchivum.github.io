Yet you guys cry for the slightest things said. \r\n\r\nStop playing a game where you need to defeat the enemy and then get offended by words, this game is not for you. \r\n\r\nIts like boxers punching each other and then apologizing and making sure the other person isnt hurt in any way. \r\n\r\nThis community thrives off toxicity and you guys promote it heavily. You want to sit in a losing match that isnt a ranked game for over 30 minutes frustrating yourself and possibly your team mates creating a toxic environment. If half the games that were already known there was a loss would be surrendered and the team could move on to a possible better experience in the next match then that would be healthy for all players. Instead you guys force each other to sit in games that create a toxic environment because you dont want to surrender early and move on to your next game. \r\n\r\nThis community cares more about visual and materialistic/ shit that doesnt matter over stuff that should be cared about more. \r\n\r\nYou guys care more about what someone said rather than how they are playing to create the certain environment you are looking for. \r\n\r\nPoint blank period this game is extremely toxic in multiple ways for random players being forced to play with other random players, of lesser skill, lesser intent of winning, lesser intent of playing as a team. This is extremely unfortunate for players who enjoy this type of game but cant play it cause of how majority of you players act and especially THINK. \r\n\r\nthese games wont have good communities until they focus more on the game and play style of players as opposed to what they say, with features given to them where they wont need to hear or read things they dont like. I.E. words and statements other players say. \r\n\r\nMaybe its extremely hard for people who care about what other people think or say about them, but i can easily ignore someone without needing to mute them. But being forced to sit in a 45 minute game where i cant leave cause i will face a punishment is not so easy to ignore. Literally the only choice you leave me to is \"pretending im playing bad or a new player and making the loss to my team much quicker\". \r\n\r\njust sharing some thoughts on a community ive been in since beta and continue to come back to cause i enjoy moba and strategy games. but i dont know anymore.....its just getting time consuming....\r\n\r\nAsking to surrender cause your \"adc\" is new and the enemy is 6+ kills fed within 5 minutes should not be considered negative attitude or being toxic.","replies":[]}
