High morale goes a long way. \n14 days is a long time if you play every day for hours, but not that big of a deal overall. \n\nPermanent ban is the real threat. \n\nAlso, Anivia supp is a viable pick. \n\nI know you think that it isn’t fair to get a suspension for that, you did try your best after all. The game is about gameplay, not chat, isn’t it? \nBut, your teammates, whether you accept it or not, are affected by what you type in chat. \nI for one, really hate when someone flames me for dying in lane couple of times. \n\nI don’t want to seem condescending or anything, but the real advice here would be — to take a break and come back in couple of weeks. \n\nJust remember to keep your chat in check because they will ban you for a single one offense. \n\nIn some games stakes are very high and you must stay calm to achieve your victory. \nImagine that your teammate is a 14 years kid. You wouldn’t flame a kid for having a bad game, would you?\n\nBest of luck bro.","replies":[{"poster":"Bernard Marx","date":"2020-02-15T00:24:04.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ty  dude finally someone that helps me in the forum, much appreciate it. \n\nHave a good one bro!!! :)","replies":[{"poster":"GoldsmithSmarty","date":"2020-02-20T03:17:43.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad that I was usefull to someone=) \n\nBest of luck bro (^_^)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-15T00:08:43.288+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps you should focus more on yourself and less on flaming others and giving up.

But I can see that you have a habit of blaming others (blaming naut and we as shown in the 2nd logs). As the system doesn't punish based on severity alone but punishes based on consistency x severity, meaning you can be punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many many games of mild toxicity, your constant blaming others throughout many games is what caused you to be punished.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-02-15T07:41:51.843+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">Bernard Marx: im better than you\nBernard Marx: 1 3 6 and fkin typing muted\n\nWhy you score shaming him and flaming him when you was 0-7-1 and he had almost twice more damage than you , and he played ornn and you was the adc...","replies":[{"poster":"Bernard Marx","date":"2020-02-15T14:15:40.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NF Remilia,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jeq1LXLP,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2020-02-15T07:41:51.843+0000)\n>\n> Bernard Marx: 1 3 6 and fkin typing muted\n> \n> Why you score shaming him and flaming him when you was 0-7-1 and he had almost twice more damage than you , and he played ornn and you was the adc...\n\nOmg is that flaming??

I wish it was me so i could show you how its done. Its not a troll pick. It works quite well against a lot of bot lanes. Idk if he was trolling or not, but either way, insulting players is against the rules. There are no stipulations that allow you to break the rules, sorry. If youve had chat restricts before, this is just the next step. Its because youre now consistently breaking the rules, showing no interest or a lack of ability to follow them, so the punishments are gonna get harsher and harsher until you do show you are capable of following them. Next is a permaban, so be very careful.
