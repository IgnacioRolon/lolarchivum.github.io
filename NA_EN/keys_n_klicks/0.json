Iv seen tons of complaints form the last 3 days  saying something to the affect of my ping is too high/lossing packets/ high ping in game but no resolved issues. im halfway through doing this again > https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#section-windows  for the second time, first time nothing worked , dropping 40 bucks on rp and having this happen the next day for 2 days is kinda of depressing id really like to get back in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-25T04:52:34.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've worked through our connection guide again (after the Win10 upgrade) and are still having issues, the problem may be along your network routing to our servers. In order to check this, we'll need to see a full traceroute log using [**WinMTR.**](http://winmtr.net/) After loading up the app, plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace.
