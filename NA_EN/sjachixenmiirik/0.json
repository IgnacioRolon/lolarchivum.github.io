But i still had a had a refund or two left. But Syndra was coming out. So i Bought Uydr cause he was on sale at the time. But then Syndra came out so i refunded him and something else, this way i could get Syndra and her Justicar skin. However not to much later i noticed i still had uydr. I should not have him so i don&#039;t know if this is necessarily a bug but it prevents a friend of mine from gifting me a certain uydr skin. So i don&#039;t know what else to do about this. I mean i did recently buy a skin for him, even though i shouldn&#039;t own him.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-18T17:21:59.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SjachIxenMiirik,\n\nFor something like this, please [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Player Support so we can take a look at your account and see what happened. :]","replies":[{"poster":"SjachIxenMiirik","date":"2015-08-29T02:35:44.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do i put it under? technical issue?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-29T03:01:18.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[This one](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4584).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-08-29T02:38:08.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just put it under technical or account issues. shouldn't matter","replies":[]}]}
