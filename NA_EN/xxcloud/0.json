So how this bug works is when you walk up to your target and fling him and quickly turn around the enemy will be knocked up instead of thrown backwards.\r\n\r\nThat was my bug report...\r\n\r\nNot entirely sure if this has anything to do with ping/ms but hope I get a answer soon ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wittrock","date":"2014-10-25T00:56:19.135+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xXCloud,\n\nThis is a known issue, and a fix is being worked on.

This only happens when the target of the flip is at max, or beyond max, range of the flip at the time that it activates. If you are well within range of the enemy (ie. standing nearly on top of them) the bug is not reproducable under any circumstances. When the target is fleeing, as they often do when a singed is running at them, it will occur almost every time. \n\nTLDR Bug only occurs when attempting to flip someone at max range or beyond.","replies":[{"poster":"xXCloud","date":"2014-10-25T13:40:53.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for explaining the bug to me I was already kinda wondering if it really was a bug where if you walk away from the enemy and fling but seems like it isn't the issue :P I sincerely apologize if I confused anyone and thanks again for explaining it to me BigNuttz xD!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DEN TEL0S","date":"2014-10-25T07:57:15.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same issue, but turning with the flip doesn't seem to effect it.
