Calling out Dyrus for basically terrible play, bjerg for questionable picks, santorin for being afk, bad warding, bad team fighting and just generally being bad- even in the 1 game they won. I think the tsm critiques have pretty much been on point.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-05-08T22:31:48.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can see the downvotes I have got on a serious question.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Takahashii","date":"2015-05-08T22:35:02.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is BJK even in this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2015-05-08T14:58:24.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
