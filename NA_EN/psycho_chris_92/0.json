My HUD and other details around my item slots and character portrait were crisp and clear. I got the Chroma pack and chose the Ivy green Bard skin to play with. When I got into the match, my HUD was blurry, the gold coin icon looked like a yellow blur. It was difficult to see my teams portraits in the right and see when they had their ult up. When I levels up, my ability icons became distorted and patchy. Anyone else have this going on?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-04T17:40:48.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Psycho Chris 92! \n\nThanks for the report!
