Making \"good\" posts instead of **FUCK YOU RIOT YOU SCUMBAG** posts has no difference anymore and people now use the boards to vent frustration towards a company that has made its new meta lying to its long time player base. Having a Riot employee come here and say \"gee gosh why is everyone so mad, if only you were nicer and made well thought out posts we would probably listen\" which is a complete load of shit that hasnt worked in ages.\n\nThink of it as giving Riot the appropriate feedback. I havent seen so many people defend one champion since this game existed. Everyone is pissed off at the Veigar/Morde nerfs because everyone knows that Riot flat out LIED and now all of us are thinking \"well if they lied to 5 year veig/morde mains my champion could easily be \"\"COMPENSATED\"\" next\".\n\nHence, saying **FUCK YOU RIOT **does hold a lot of value and is an accurate representation of how the community as a whole feels about the direction this game is going. I am so close to trying DOTA2 for the first time ever. I don't want to play DOTA2 and I don't want to learn a thousand different item/champ/ability combos all over again. I want to play LoL and I want this game run in a way that is beneficial to the players and not LCSBIGPLAYS and not giving favoritism to hyper mobile champs who sell a lot of skins.\n\n*TLDR: Riot ignoring great posts and feedback and continuing to make poor decisions no one wants while lying to its long time player base causes people to get pissed off.

The incompetence of this community is really making me sway on my decision to continue to play this game.\n\nIt hit targets up to ~1025 I think range away. I don't see how that counts as 'short', honestly. It has one of the largest max potential ranges in the game for a basic ability.\n\nBut to me a skillshot requires some sort of projectile time, windup period, or delay. There has to be a reaction option that is more than just 'watch the champ' because WATCH THE CHAMP works for targeted abilities too. If you see annie walking towards you, you can walk away and 'avoid' her q. She'll never hit you if you're out of range right?\n\nA skillshot is something that has some aspect of the ABILITY that allows you to dodge it. The delay makes it have that now. That's why it is a skillshot now, because now it's not just 'oh if I pick the right place you're stunned'(which is actually what it was before, if you were in range of it and he didn't target the wrong place, you were getting hit) it's 'if I am able to SKILLFULLY predict where you're going to be and target it in such a way that you either can't avoid it or that you have to run into it to save yourself, it'll hit you'. Unlike before, if he's in range and he doesn't use it smartly, you won't get hit. Before all he had to be was in range and you WOULD get hit, you had no choice. That's not 'skillshot' to me.\n\nSkillshot HAS to have some sort of reactive component. You see the spell and can react. Some skillshots are VERY fast which makes them difficult to react to - like blitz/thresh hook - but if you're good enough you still CAN react after the spell is cast. If it doesn't allow you to react to the spell itself, it's not a skillshot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2015-02-27T19:50:49.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Veigar's is a skillshot NOW but it wasn't before.\n\nSo this statement makes no since, since the actually casting of the spell did not change.\n\nIf it was before it has to be now.\nIt it wasnt before it isnt now.\nIf it is now it was before.\nIf it isnt now it wasnt before.\n\nIdk if you can comprehend that, but the casting of the spell its self and how it was cast HAS NOT CHANGED.

Nid had a huge damage nuke at long range, and Veig had an instant 2.5 sec 1000 or so range stun. Both reworks were made to address these mechanics to allow for more maneuverability, in other words to knock those specifics down a peg so pegs can  be raised elsewhere without seriously breaking their power. Sorry if I'm stating the obvious, I just want to make sure that's out there.\n\nBasic points:\n\n>Nid is OP\n\nI would argue no. Is she strong? Definitely! Can she snowball out of control? Of course. However I would not say she is overpowered. Her kit completely revolves around her passive as well as requiring commitment (assuming she's going cougar for a full combo). \n\nNow, one thing I will give you is invisi-spears. They piss me off to no end, but not so much in a \"Nid is OP\" aspect but more as a \"Oh come on, this is still a problem?\" kinda way. I'm not considering that in the OP or not OP point as it's not intended behavior.\n\n>Nid's rework was better than Veigar's\n\nHands down agree. The rework was better because it changed her playstyle greatly while still retaining it as fun for both new nid players and old nid players. Really boiled down I would say this is just as much of a case of Nid's rework being very well done and Veigar's rework being 'meh'.\n\n>Veigar's rework was bad (2 abilities don't work)\n\nI believe the jury is still out on this one seeing as it hasn't even been two days yet since he was reworked. On my personal prediction I think it will end up being fairly good, but I will also agree that it is a noticeable change and rocks many Veigar player's respective worlds. However I will say I can be wrong if more time proves that as such, I am not a Veigar main. \n\nThe logic behind the E delay is alleviate his abusive mechanic. Giving any enough power to Veigar's kit while he retained a 1000ish range 2.5 sec multi-target stun would make him incredibly unhealthy for the game. Not because of the numbers alone but simply because it's instant. Making it on a delay allows him to keep the numbers he has (more, actually, because of the range increase).\n\nNow the Q change (I assume that's what you mean by the second ability) was, if I recall correctly was to allow Veigar's to ramp up AP faster as well as increase his farming range as a trade for his lack of instant self-peel.\n\nAre they satisfying changes? No. Are they overall buffs? I'd also say no. However, I would say that he is in a healthier and easier to adjust state than where he was. Does he need tweaks? Yes, and not because he's overly weak, but because he was just introduced and like any major change it's never perfect out of the gate.\n\n>Promised buffs to Veigar\n\nDependent on previous point. If the rework turns out to be an appropriate increase in his power then it's good, if not then yes they failed on their promise.\n\n>Is it not fair to say that Nidalee holds a certain bias towards Riot that Veigar does not?\n\nYes, it is not fair. Because I think there was just as much thought but less execution and room to maneuver with Veigar. Think about it, Nidalee already had the core Spear-->Cougar-->Leap-->Q combo going for her pre-rework but it wasn't being used because people just sat back and chucked spears. All they had to do was readjust power from her spear to the rest of the kit, but to do that they needed to give her more options to close the gap (passive) and an incentive to actually go in instead of staying back (leap reset). True this is hindsight, but overall the train of thought is not as long as you'd think. Not to mention she, as you mentioned, has almost twice the abilities so it's a lot easier to mess with her kit than Veigar's.\n\nVeigar had somewhat the same issue. He could sit back and the second someone came within 1000ish range a skilled Veigar could stun and burst you down before you could do anything. Sure you could get a banshees, but once that's popped? Rinse and repeat. So he needed counterplay to his stun (removal of instant), tone down on unjustified one-shots ( as in 'can one-shot if Q is farmed enough'), and a compensation for the fact his main form of defense (bursting down his opponent) was now gone (Lower mana costs and higher Q range = more harass)\n\nNo was it *executed* as well? No, I agree Nid rework was better than Veig's. Hands down. But to imply favoritism like that is like saying reworking something as qualitative as a champion's mechanics is downright confusing to me. For all the balance team's talk of levers it's not like they have a dial on a champion's power and are turning it backward with maniacal laughter. It's not nearly that simple.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-02-27T01:52:27.077+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to just hop in here to say that, IIRC, Veigar's changes weren't billed as an actual *Rework*, more just some changes meant to compensate for the removal of DFG (was this successful? I personally have issues with it but the jury is still out).\n\nI think Veigar will need an actual rework before he has a chance at being at a better spot. What I mean by a rework is an honest and complete look at a champions kit and larger scale changes around a cohesive theme, rather than smaller whack-a-mole style changes.\n\nFor example, Nidalee's rework was built around her Hunt mechanic, most of her kit interacts with this and utilizing it is now core to her gameplay. Even Cassiopeia's rework is focused around her passive; many on Boards would argue this is was a failure, but what I'm trying to say is that an actual rework takes this form of making a champions kit work together, as oppose to Veigar's case, where imo they just jerry-rigged together some changes based on some long standing issues he had; his kit, which was already pretty awkward, no longer feels cohesive.\n\nWill a full rework solve this? Not sure; Gragas is more of a mess than ever imo; Kassadin and Sona continue to be pinballed around the balance team despite their reworks; a lot of people despise Cassiopeia's rework, to put it lightly. At the same time, Soraka's rework was pretty cool imo; Viktor and Sion are actually seeing play now; Xerath is seeing a ton of success all over the world. I think it's the best shot at actually making Veigar better, though\n\nRegarding Veigar, though, I don't really see a full rework happening anytime soon; these changes aren't the \"gutted until we rework them\" changes that Soraka or Ryze got, especially since he wasn't that hyper priority pick that Soraka or Ryze were (Ryze might not be the best example since we're still waiting to see how his rework turns out). Unless Riot is taking up the policy of doing series of partial reworks on champions until all the changes together, collectively, equate to a full rework (which seems difficult to build a cohesive kit this way), I think whatever follow up changes Veigar gets in the next few patches are going to be the only changes he's going to see for a while.\n\nEDIT: To try to get back to the topic you were discussing, re: favoritism:\n\nI think GC actually commented that there *is* this sort of \"favoritism\" (flame war inc.). What this favoritism for, though is \"healthy play patterns\" (more flame war inc.)\n\n\"But MrBuffington, how can you say Zed/Nid/Lee/whoever has a healthy play pattern?\"\n\nFirst I ask you to consider the opposite; Riot has this idea that Veigar's core theme is being able to delete a champion with a single button press (his ultimate). Ignoring for a second the actual manifestation in game, this is a pretty freaking broken theme; in fact, this is exactly *why* Veigar has been kept weak for years (same goes for Morello's infamous comment on Poppy).\n\n\"But what about Nidalee's toxic nuclear spears?\"\n\nHere's where I give the classic \"It's a skillshot\" defense\n\nThen you respond with the classic \"I dodge them all game but she only has to land one\" rebuttal\n\nAnd that, I see, is crucially the point; Veigar's ultimate is targeted, and, from Riot's perception of his theme, is *necessarily* targeted. To fill that fantasy of \"I press R, you die\", the skill *must* be targeted. Conversely, in most games, Nidalee will miss a significant portion of her spears; not from bad aim necessarily, but because it is a slow single target skillshot with one of the thinnest hitboxes in the game; it's one of the easier skillshots to dodge on a 'thematic' sort of level. Tangent: If Blue Ezreal had the same hit percentage with his Q as Nidalee with her Q, he'd be near useless; the trade here is Ezreal gets reliability where Nidalee gets higher potential damage; taking these factors into account, total damage output by their respective Qs is probably relatively similar; getting hit with a Nidalee Q just 'feels' worse because it chunks you for more \\endtangent.\n\nSimply looking at kit mechanics, there are more (interesting/dynamic) ways to play or play around champions like Zed/Nid/Lee (dodging abilities, strategic positioning, etc) than champs like Veigar (don't get in range to be stunned). How this is all manifested in the game is more a matter of number tuning than inherently healthy or unhealthy play patterns. Does this mean that Zed/Nid/Lee have objectively healthy playstyles? Maybe, probably depends on your champion selection as well (you'd probably have a more even chance playing someone like Fizz as oppose to Karthus). Do they have a healthier play pattern than old Veigar? I would say yes; if Veigar stuns you, you're pretty much dead; if he misses, he's pretty much dead. Does this mean that Veigar is unbalancable/doomed to be forever underpowered because he has a problematic theme? I actually don't think, when looking at all the other champions in the roster, that Veigar's theme is inherently unbalancable; I think there is some clever solution out there, and I don't think that solution is going to come from these current changes. As I said before, I think he needs an actual rework","replies":[{"poster":"SephAgro","date":"2015-02-28T01:56:24.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigar's burst was a one-off, one time nuke.

Veigar can sit back, stun, go in after stun. Lissandra and Vi commit to going in to get the stun. Zed Kassadin and Nidalee all put themselves into immediate danger. I have played the new Veigar and its not a big deal to hit with the new stun you just have to adjust. Give it a little time before we start declaring champs dead or not viable before we have seen how they work and even if they dont work better in team comps they maybe werent as healthy in as before. \n\nShould be important to note we are still waiting on the new 120 ap item and who knows how that will play into it as they seem to want to help the champs hit by DFG (however slight it actually is) with this item. Who knows who is going to become suddenly strong because of it or even who will become weaker. Happens every patch, rework, and new champ and new item. Stands to reason we will see it again. If Veigar is affected by this, of course, we can only speculate.\n\nI guess all in all it seems to me we like to forget that this is an ever changing and evolving game, and while you would like your champion you have played since the beginning or developed a love for (probably due to something that changed in a patch or item change) stay the same forever; be realistic its not going to be the case with a game of this nature.
