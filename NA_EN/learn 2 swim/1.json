Its more about ADCs being worshipped and forced to be excellent kiters to be useful. To catch a Kalista you now need point and click CC/two gapclosers or more/Veigar's E/long range abilities. To catch a Vayne, you need pinks/not be any kind of tank or bruiser because of her anti-melee kit/longer AA range/AoE effects/a pull.\n\nMeanwhile, to catch an older ADC like Ashe, all you need to do is approach her from a location that isn't warded, she won't dash, knock you back or anything, and even if she does stun you or flash, one gapcloser that isn't Volibear/Garen/Udyr level of frustrating will catch her.\n\nThe high damage dealers are in a state that they get to burst down defense stackers that are in the game precisely to punish them for focusing the tank. BotRK, LW, VS, lifesteal and all that %HP you see everywhere is another hit to the stomach of the feeble tank race that hardly even manages to stand up now, because engages are becoming more and more pointless, burst is ten times more cost efficient than defense, and every support/ADC gets to completely nulify any attempt at picking off a carry unless they make a mistake so big that the game is already 1-sided by the time teamfights start.\n\nThen we also have the mana regen nerf problems, that make buffing assassins impossible since they already dominate mid. We have ranged champions going top, bullying better than most melees and outscaling them too, we have the insane mobility meta that makes running as a gapcloser completely pointless, we have little viable tank items, low mobility tanks that can't even fit the meta, an overall anti-melee meta enforced even by the new champions that have come out (Kalista/Gnar).","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2015-02-03T21:11:32.624+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is, ADCs are hard to adjust.

Bring back carry top laners (vlad, riven, renekton etc.) and bring back less safe ADCs (Vayne, Draven) champs that rely on kills and not farming to level 18 (trist+cait) and the only way to make this change happen would be Riot buffing the carry top laners and the aggressive ADCs.

Which route you go honestly only varies if you do % health damage and do better with more speed, or if you're a caster and or semi-caster/Auto Attack adc and build straight damage with one speed item. Their itemization has more to do with making their own strengths shine and becoming overbearing rather than being reactive to a teams build. So in a sense they are inherently powerful and are given more or less free range to ignore any items that may be picked up to be used against them, because there arent many items that are built to go against ADC's. {{item:3153}}  will beat {{item:3083}}  , {{item:3075}} ,  and {{item:3143}} . To shut down an ADC who uses BORK you need to look for hard CC or straight burst damage. {{item:3035}}  Only makes the problem even worse along with {{item:3031}} , which saw a 5% crit \"nerf\" but honestly it still works great. To top it off they get more HP than they really should have through {{item:3072}} . The only reason ADC's are so potent is because their items are so gold efficient and there aren't any defensive items that can mitigate their potency. Shutting down adc's can be done of course but to do that you have to do so using powerful champions and coordinated team play. Trying to lessen the effectiveness of damage in game is a lost cause, Damage items>Tank items. Tank items only benefit those who can hard CC, engage and potentially blow up squishies because they have some form of damage behind all that tankiness. {{champion:39}}  Is one of my favorite examples for this. Only having to build {{item:3078}}  and then go full tank (if you're really confident sometimes can also go {{item:3142}} , to compliment Tri even further).

Every role has to have some kind of weakness, and ADC's just being squishy clearly isn't cutting it, especially since most of them have some kind of dash.{{champion:222}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:133}} (I know she's buggy, but if her kit actually worked....) plus the rest of them.... {{champion:51}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}}  and kind of {{champion:15}}  with that furor on everything. {{champion:29}}  can go stealth (I know it's delayed in combat)  The escapes are a bit ridiculous. I think that needs to be touched up a bit. League of Escape Mechanics anyone?\n\nAlso, a bit off topic, what is it with all the knock ups with the new champions?

Hence why I said what I said. To OUT heal it's damage. Meaning, to heal more than the damage being received from the item. I was also specifically referring to ADC's who generally get {{item:3026}}  as their only defensive item, so they generally don't have a lot of MR. Between 80 and 90 depending on runes and masteries if they pick up {{item:3026}}. I don't know the actualy percentage reduction that would be and I really don't have the time to figure it out, but based on the fact that 30 MR reduces magic damage by about (please correct me if I'm wrong) 40-45% if I remember correctly, and, again if I remember correctly, 200 MR reduces magic damage by about 70% (again, correct me if I'm wrong. Please.) assuming an average of 85 MR with {{item:3026}}  for ADC's, that would reduce the damage by about 50%. So, {{item:3075}} reflects 30% of damage dealt from basic attacks before resistances. To make math easy, I'm just going to use 100 damage. I know it's unrealistic, I'm just lazy. So 30 damage would be shot back at the ADC attacking, reduced by 50% from the MR, so they would actually take 15 damage. Taking into account the damage reduction from armor of about 140 (taking into account armor per level and {{item:3075}}  that would give approximately 140 unless at really high levels, I'm trying to get an average assuming not level 18 sorry), which I think would reduce damage by about 57% (?) so that's 43 damage they're taking. Healing based on that 43 damage would have to be 34.88% lifesteal to break even. I know the numbers are unrealistic. I'm lazy. Again, please correct me if I'm wrong on the actual percentage reductions. I don't actually know them.\n\nI don't really see how buying more armor makes the damage from {{item:3075}}  scale up. It's completely reliant on the damage being taken BEFORE armor is taken into account, not after.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-02-03T21:41:50.944+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:21}} \"Sure we are...\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2015-02-04T04:00:28.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"When haven't ADCs been in control again?
