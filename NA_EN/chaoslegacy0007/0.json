Also, it takes more than just calling for reports to get a punishment.\n2) you likely had at least 3 prior warnings in the form of 2 chat restrictions and a temporary ban. If that's the case then no, Riot is not stupid for permabanning you when you proved to them that you had no interest in reforming.","replies":[{"poster":"Times Knight","date":"2017-01-07T19:18:11.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"This is actually not true, they recently ban a player for playing singed support due to number of reports.","replies":[{"poster":"Reket DeAlk","date":"2017-01-07T19:21:08.812+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Times Knight,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=U9aq5Idk,comment-id=0001000000010000,timestamp=2017-01-07T19:18:11.897+0000)\n>\n> This is actually not true, they recently ban a player for playing singed support due to number of reports.\n\nHe got banned for what he was doing, not because of how many reports he got.\n\nThat's an old issue that was covered by Riot.
