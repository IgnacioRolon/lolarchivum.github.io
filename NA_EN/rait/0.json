What is Rengar's identity in this game?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"WAIT, before you down rote me to hell, hear me out first please!\r\n\r\nAlright so, after the whole 30% bonus ad nerf to 20%. My good old assassin {{champion:107}} , kinda was force into going bruiser. Now hear me out, ik going straight RAW ad is still unbalanced as hell on Rengar. But why is he getting soooo much more attention then every other reworked assassin?\r\n\r\nSo the newest update on pbe, is gonna make it so Rengar can&#039;t remove cc anymore. But this got me thinking, is there ever gonna be a chance for someone like Rengar to just stay in meta for a decent amount of time like Lee sin has been for all these years. \r\n\r\nI love how I can go tank, ap, full ad and bruiser on Rengar. But I don&#039;t know how am suppose to play him anymore with these constant changes lately. You offer him this mobility cc break through, so he can be like every other assassin and have an escape?  Now I feel like if I jump in on Rengar, I should just jump in and one-shot, then die for my move, unless my team bails me out.  \r\n\r\nTo be fair, the Rengar rework was trying to fix something that was not balance, but not needing this type of rework. I&#039;ve always wanted Rengar to be something like {{champion:19}} , or atleast the new one. Where his jump is a skill shot or ult I guess. why not make Rengar&#039;s passive bushes jump a skill shot? it would atleast offer some counter play to Rengar instead of building an hourglass on adc to avoid the crit damage and still dying afterwards. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry for ranting for so long, but as a Rengar Main and a guy who loves his main. I just had to get this off my chest and talk about him a bit. But my question is, what do you guys think Rengar&#039;s identity is? like in all seriousness, what do you guys think he should be? A tank? an assassin? Bruiser? or something else? Please tell me, as I main this champion and am confuse as to what he should be and how he should be played anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2017-01-29T09:04:28.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jumpscares.

When rengar jumps on me I usually murder him because I like to play tanky top laners who can usually deal with him but boy do I hate him on any other role.\n\nBeen having so much fun with the new Warwick. I guess by the 4th attempt (rengar release, then 2 reworks and then ww) they finally got the idea of a hunting down prey right and also made it balanced.\n\nAs for the title question.  Rengars Identity?  idk tbh.  I've always seen him as the bs champ who I ban when he is strong. When he isn't broken you literally never see him and when he is viable (he is usually op coming off of some big buff or rework) then his only identity has been \"one shot from stealth\".   \n\nI suppose his identity is a big game hunter but if they were gonna do that they should have tried a garen style villain mechanic.  The biggest threat/last one to kill/most kills/most gold etc and give him extra dmg vs that target or some reward for taking them down instead of the others (extra gold? or), say this is where his bonetooth necklace comes in and gives other bonuses.  Idk just spitballing here.","replies":[]}]}]}
