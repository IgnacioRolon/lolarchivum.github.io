But I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on Sion's new lore.\r\n\r\nFor me, my burning question is this:\r\n\r\n**How would Riven react to seeing Sion?  ** {{champion:14}} {{champion:92}} \r\n\r\nI mainly ask because Sion was a Noxian legend way back when and Riven was considered the poster child of Noxus (before the Noxian invasion) so I would find it interesting to see how the exile would interact with the undead juggernaut.\r\n\r\nProvided she knew who he was, she would be extremely conflicted to fight Sion, because Sion is all that she strove to become: a strong Noxian warrior who found glory on the battlefield. But has been cursed by the plottings of the former Grand General and LeBlanc to be a mindless killing machine. (And even if she didn't know who he is she would still see a strong Noxian warrior made mindless killing machine).\r\n\r\nMaybe in Sion, Riven sees Noxus itself: a once great and powerful land made twisted by machinations.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe it is in Sion she sees her chance at redemption. If she seeks to purify Noxus she must first overcome Sion who embodies what Noxus has become in her eyes: a twisted shell of its former self.\r\n\r\nSorry I'm ranting now. Just wanted to know if there would be any interesting lore there that's all.\r\n\r\nSo thoughts anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-10-02T03:30:24.237+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Given the timing and lore, Sion really could have been one of Riven's heroes growing up; really nice catch!

Of course Riven as well as any other military upstart has heard of him.. If not trying to emulate him, to try and push themselves to outshine him and become the next great battlefield icon.\n\nRiven would have mixed emotions...\nShe would have great honor and awe in seeing Sion before her..\n\n But once the started mixing it up, and going at one another, she would be angered, horrified, and scared.. He is not the battlefield legend that she grew up hearing about.. He is a husk of his former self, bodily remains, stitched back together.. A sacrilege if you will.  She would look to end the abomination once and for all, in hopes that this once honorable Titan would finally peace in death.\n\nI see this story line of Sions recreation as a great way to plug in a Riven subplot:\n\nThe element of fear that I had mentioned, \n\n\"if a person is mad enough to do this to a celebrated war hero, a nations savior, where would they draw the line?!\"  \n\"Is the same sick, twisted individual responsible for this abomination also behind the attacks on Ionia and Noxus?!\" \n\" I must find the person or parties responsible and end it once and for all\"\n\nThis story arc puts Riven on a war path, re-ignites her battle ferver, and takes her from a wandering exile (lost in limbo, atm) and gives her purpose. Alone or grouped up with other Champions in an alliance..Take out Sion, find out about Singed and go after him, find out any associates of Singed and go after them as well.. All of a sudden you have a whole bunch of champions stuck in limbo (Singed, Mundo, Warwick, Sion and anyone else who is related to chemical warfare, chemical experimentations, mutilations, human experimentations) back in the mix with alliances, story, lore and purpose.  It gives Champions a fresh story line, opens the door for skin themes, special in game events and modes..

I recall one of the Rioters suggesting that Darkwill did all he could to bury Sion's legacy, and his fall, and thus that most Noxians today wouldn't be familiar with him.\n\nAs someone who has done more than a little Riven stuff in their time (Hence the name), my angle on Riven's opinion of old Sion had always been that she found the Rite of Reclamation distasteful. Not because necromancy was 'evil', but because bringing back fallen heroes to fight once more both denied them their peace and showed a lack of willingness to put your faith in the living, and Noxus could never grow stronger while it continued to rely on old glories and men who should be long dead. Much like Darius now, I think there also would have been an element of \"That could have been me.\"\n\nNew Sion basically represents most of what Riven believes is wrong with Noxus: He's a twisted monstrosity, and parody of a once-great warrior, who has been engineered to do the dirty work of men who neither fight their own battles or care for collateral damage and friendly casualties.  Much like the Zaunites' designs in Ionia, new Sion is little more than an indiscriminate weapon of slaughter who you turn towards the enemy before letting loose. He isn't a soldier - he has no honour or desire to prove and better himself - he only exists to kill and kill as many and as often as possible. \n\nOne the other hand, I do think there's another side to this story that could be very interesting indeed should it ever be played out:\n\nGiven what we've heard from Riot about Sion recovering some of his sanity in battle, it makes one wonder just what might happen should he and Riven ever come to blows ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dan Squared","date":"2014-10-02T07:41:58.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly it would probably be mostly horror and pity....Sion was of old Noxus.  He would have been exactly the kind of Noxian hero she would have strived to be.  Perhaps a bit more of a killer than she is now, but she likely lost a good deal of her taste for battle and blood, if not all of it after Ionia.  Even Sion back in his ideal self would likely not be what Riven currently strives for.\n\nAs for what he is now, she would almost without question be horrified by it and seek to destroy him.

Just...bleh. It feels like they were trying to make Noxus not just \"Big evil dudes\" and then failed completely by failing to give her any actual motivations that are both good and in line with the core ideals of Noxus.\n\nI don't think you're right. She has motivation, a patriotic one. She strives to get Noxus back on what she believes was the right Noxian way to greatness. She wants a strong and glorious Noxus and that's not evil. If you define \"good\" to be \"let's save all the kittens in peril\", there's actually no one in the setting to be so. Indeed, if you read Lux's judgment you'd find out Demacia wasn't meant to be the fine place one simplicistically is brought to believe it would be. Ok, judgments are no longer canon, but I don't think they'll change the indoctrinating aspect of Demacia.\nFor a proud warriorish society, Riven is GOOD and pursues a JUST cause.\nTo portray Noxus differently than \"the big bad guys\" it doesn't mean you have to make them what they are not, it's not evil a society so hellbent on power and strength if those are meant to be the signet of pride, martial prowess and effort spent in a fair valorous way.\nWhat Riven doesn't like it's the cowardly turn Noxus took from the righteous route of valor.\nThe late Sion reasoning that they should not stay besieged protected from their walls, but gloriously march and charge against their enemies in a triumphal battle would find her completely in agreement.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-04T17:41:57.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see why she'd have a problem with him. \"What is broken can be reforged\", is that not your motto, Riven?","replies":[{"poster":"Diahane","date":"2014-10-04T18:05:11.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't see why she'd have a problem with him. \"What is broken can be reforged\", is that not your motto, Riven?\n\nI do agree.
