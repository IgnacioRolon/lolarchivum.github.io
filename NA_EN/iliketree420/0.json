There's are time I forget to tab in after load screen and got remake. I was fully connected for the whole time.\n\nAlso, I had a game where a darling took the wrong summoners so he told us he'd afk so we can remake in game chat. He did and we got a remake.

So if its the same, you actually arent connecting while you are alt+tabbed.\n\nBasically if i alt tab and dont show till 3 minutes later, my team has the option to remake cause i never loaded to 100% in the load screen. But if i let it load, then alt+tab, my team cant remake because i connected.\n\nYour PC may treat the load screen differently, but that's how mine operates with the client.

Glad I could help you let out some frustration. Maybe go for a walk, or get a punching bag? I hope everything is ok. What is troubling you? Girl problems? Penis size? The LOL community can help we are here to talk if you need! :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}
