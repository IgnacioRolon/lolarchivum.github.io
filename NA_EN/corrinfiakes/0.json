It happens with every rework. Many of the mains get angry how the new rework looks, and after a month or two of it dropping, the rage subsides and we move on. \r\n\r\nThough, this rage seems justified. Aatrox, lore wise and game play wise, has drastically altered. This really isn't Aatrox anymore. This rework, along with others in the past (Galio being the worst offender), is a new character being made that shares some of the same characteristics, while deleting the old character at the same time. \r\n\r\nAatrox, before his rework, was regarded as an Auto Attack duelist/diver. The thing that separated him from other AA duelists was his W, Blood Price/Thirst, making the player have to decide if he should have Blood Price toggled on to deal more damage and fill up his blood well to reach his steroid and G.A. in a fight; or, toggle his Blood Thirst on in order to give him more sustain and surviveablilty in a fight. His Ult contributed to this fact, giving him a magical damage burst around him and increasing his attack range. His Dark Flight allowed him to gap close and his Blades of Torment offered poke and a slow to stick on to enemies easier.\r\n\r\nNow, what quite a few Aatrox players where wishing for in a rework where changes to his Q (Dark Flight) and his E (Blades of Torment). These two abilities are considered the wonkiest and worst abilities in his kit because his Q radius for his knock up is very small (ontop of it being a small hitbox to begin with) and it offered nothing other than the small amount of damage it does. His E needed changing because of the skill's slow travel speed and weird hitbox. His W and his Ult (his ult, while underwhelming and could use some buff like bonus MS, feels like it doesn't need serious alteration)\r\n\r\nWhat we have now is a Bruiser that primarily uses **Abilities** to trade and deal damage. The only things that has been kept is part of his Q on his third Q cast, his Blood Thirst being proced on his new passive, and his ult now has his revive. (Oh, and I guess his wonk hitboxes on his first two Q casts)\r\n\r\nThis is the issue with the rework, instead of being an Auto Attacking Duelist/Diver that could sustain himself **or** deal more damage, he is now a Bruiser that relies on casting his abilities more than using AA's. He is being mostly compared to Riven as a clunkier version of her. \r\n\r\nGiven how many Aatrox mains where willing to give their input on how to fix these issues on places such as the boards or /r/Aatrox mains, seeing Riot do what they did with the Galio rework, where they sprinkle in things from his old kit while.It has also been note that Riot has been quiet inside the Aatrox main's committees, possibly giving the implication that they new they didn't really rework him, just rather redo him from ground up.  Very few changes could've been made, but they went with this grand scheme of a rework, for reason I can't really find or justify why so many solutions have been made by the community itself.\r\n\r\nLore and character wise, listening to his full VO you can tell they really tried with it, and I will give credit where it is due. With Aatrox's new lore, it fits him nicely and seems to be well done. He's angry at a lot of the champions, specifically the Targonians, but has some really deep and somber lines sprinkled in, giving him more character than \"edgy demon who wants to kill everything.\" Despite him yelling that he is a God killer and World ender, making him sound like a done to death villain, its good **in my opinion**. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that its not the Aatrox we know and love (or hate). It feels like they could've done this rework without changing his model or personality. Aatrox was calm and collected. He craved war and bloodshed, but wasn't angry because Zoe existed because he never had had a reason to.  They could've worked off of what they had, instead of only keeping the Darkin idea and scrapping the rest of him.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Aatrox was a Diver/Duelist that relied heavily on AA's that needed fixing. He was considered to be one of the most requested characters to be reworked because of how long since he has been touched meaningfully. What ended up as a result was a complete overhaul of a new champion that shares little characteristics with Aatrox. This has angered many fans of the original Aatrox, as there will be no way to play the old character they fell in love with. This rework will attract many new fans to him, but at the same time, cause many of Aatrox's old fans to leave, being forced to find a new main or stop playing the game entirely as Aatrox gets essentially removed from the game. Such was the fate for other characters, like Galio.  \r\n\r\nI mean, at least we still have his dance.","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-06-17T04:22:13.946+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":44,"body":"All 7 Aatrox mains?","replies":[{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2018-06-17T06:20:37.875+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Attticus Finch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6Fq4VFGZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-17T04:22:13.946+0000)\n>\n> All 7 Aatrox mains?\n\nshould have been super easy to get feedback from them though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2018-06-17T09:21:02.222+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"The joke has been missed so hard that day lol","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2018-06-17T11:14:26.707+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"people took that comment too seriously","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2018-06-17T21:33:45.253+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Try to laugh from the death and replacement of your main champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-06-19T13:51:43.467+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean the bland \"I'm the Where's Waldo of War Gods\" who's background amounted to retellings of how angry he made people who were losing wars?

All of his changes have been for the better, and have given him actual characterization and a place in the world that has him interacting with other characters. He's no longer just a vague afterthought in the lore.

With no % dmg in a tank lane on his abilities (only 2 of which do damage IIRC) He either DOES or DOESN'T do enough damage.\n\n2 His play patter IS that of a riven when it comes to Q EXCEPT he locks himself into place casting an AOE not dissimilar from Camille and Darius baring needing another ability to move. Not only that but unlike them this is his CC and missing that ability (just by dodging to the weaker part) removes the CC from his combo. Darius still has apprehend and a auto attack-slow, Camile still has her ult and her wall jump stun. Attrox has his W but guess what? It needs his Q to land! Your best bet is to always start with W for the slow then Q and then aim 2nd Q where the W pulls to. Granted, the synergy is nice, but should any part of that ramping CC combo fail you loose most of it...\n\nOn top of that, his ults move speed, even though nice, doesn't allow you to more easily land your Q and its CC+damage areas. MAYBE ult giving cast time or your E scaling with Move-speed (for distance or CDR?) would help. But as it stands (and this from someone who has PLAYED new Attrox on the PBE), he will have to be buffed at least once when he first comes out, probably twice maybe even more than normal due to learning curve. \n\nWe all know what happens when a champion comes out too weak... The balancing process is a drag.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-06-17T16:17:48.284+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"There were other ways to fix this that would have kept the mains happy and brought in new mains.

He has cemented history on Runeterra and has real motivations and grudges to keep him going. \nFor the most part, his voicelines are a good mix of lore, character building and the rest but I do feel disappointed with how they've handled the voice. I and a lot of other Aatrox mains, REALLY liked the old voice and while I don't have anything against Slavic accents, I don't really feel Aatrox was or is a 'Cheeki Breeki' type of guy. IMO, the new voice can be really harsh on the ears at times and that's not something I'm looking forward to.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, while I'm open for him taking a different style for combat I am severely disappointed that they removed one of the most fundamental aspects of his kit - his auto attacks. I can live with the 'sustain by battle' mechanic getting scrapped because of its historic issues with balancing (even though this is another key aspect of Aatrox) but don't completely erase how we used to play him, please. Besides his Q strikes, his kit doesn't really emphasize the fact that he is a living sword and is meant to cleave through his foes. Literally 1 ability (two if you count the passive that you're going to be using on minions 90% of the time). Balancing aside, he feels clunkier and this doesn't help his previous image of being a master of his blade especially with the voicelines that imply he keeps this thematical tie with old Aatrox.\n\nI REALLY want this rework to be a success but as it stands now, there's really no appeal to me or other Aatrox mains who were waiting to see a better Aatrox and not a completely new Aatrox.

I and a lot of other Aatrox mains, REALLY liked the old voice and while I don&#x27;t have anything against Slavic accents, I don&#x27;t really feel Aatrox was or is a &#x27;Cheeki Breeki&#x27; type of guy. IMO, the new voice can be really harsh on the ears at times and that&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m looking forward to.\n> \n> In terms of gameplay, while I&#x27;m open for him taking a different style for combat I am severely disappointed that they removed one of the most fundamental aspects of his kit - his auto attacks. I can live with the &#x27;sustain by battle&#x27; mechanic getting scrapped because of its historic issues with balancing (even though this is another key aspect of Aatrox) but don&#x27;t completely erase how we used to play him, please. \n\nAlso...did u kno that now...u can sustain off of EVERY AA? Its not just when u toggle W anymore, so u can live with the sustain by battle theme, and u can build AS on him, the only things they changed about his AA was moving the additional DMG to a passive with a CD and taking the AS off the ult and passive. U can still play him as an AA base champ, all they did was move some stuff around and put more focus on ability cast. Dude i bet u right now u can play him with almost the same pattern, its just that is healthier now. Go ahead DO it, just make sure u build AS on him.\n\n>Besides his Q strikes, his kit doesn&#x27;t really emphasize the fact that he is a living sword and is meant to cleave through his foes.\n\nwell if U land more abilities u get to AA stronger more often!\n\n>Literally 1 ability (two if you count the passive that you&#x27;re going to be using on minions 90% of the time). \n\n...But the Old Aatrox didn't use ANY ability for swinging the sword actually! His W only changed the effects of his AA and was a passive...so actually this new Aatrox emphasize the fact that he is a living sword meant to cleave through his foes MORE than the old one, because he's got an ability that cleaves through foes in 3 separate casts! and then u also get the passive which changes the way he holds and attacks with his sword.\n\n>Balancing aside, he feels clunkier and this doesn&#x27;t help his previous image of being a master of his blade especially with the voicelines that imply he keeps this thematical tie with old Aatrox.\n> \n> I REALLY want this rework to be a success but as it stands now, there&#x27;s really no appeal to me or other Aatrox mains who were waiting to see a better Aatrox and not a completely new Aatrox. Riot has replaced 90% of the champion we played and there&#x27;s literally nothing we can do about it.\n\nJust give him a chance, it may not be the old Aatrox you wanted, but can u learn to kinda like the new Aatrox...i mean at this point everyone should expect that if a rework is coming their champ is gonna get fundamentally changed. Don't tell me u sat through like more than 5 reworks that were VGU's where the champ changed a ton and DIDN'T expect it to happen to Aatrox.\n\n> Damn.

You sound clearly misinformed about the state of current Aatrox as well as how bad the new Aatrox in pbe is in comparison. I'm sick of hearing these regurgitated sheep comments\n that were created during Aatrox's initial release.\n\nAatrox hasn't been a 'drain tank' ever since his light-rework. His healing is flat and ONLY scales off missing health. If you build health, you don't get to build as much lifesteal. The first iteration of Aatrox definitely had better sustaining potential as he got a triple healing buffer when he was under 50%, allowing him to be this 'drain tank'.  He doesn't heal for as much anymore and if he chooses to heal while in combat his damage drastically drops as he takes his 'defensive' stance over his 'offensive' stance. By the way, old Aatrox DID enhance his sword theme if you haven't noticed W made it so you chose between offense and defense, E while kind of tacked on was meant to emphasize the magic aspect of the blade - sending out 'BLADES of torment' and R emphasized the organize component of the blade, extending it and giving it range. While these themes could have been explored and depicted better, they were there nevertheless. \n\nAs for new Aatrox, well he feels like he's been pushed into the jungle role because I really don't think he has what it takes to take on the top lane. I HAVE tried new Aatrox and I made suggestions that most testers have voiced with the clunkiness of the new Aatrox. If you think you can build attack speed and suddenly Aatrox becomes auto-attack reliant again, you're an idiot. There's practically nothing in his kit besides maybe his useless passive that emphasises auto attacks over using your Q when it's available. I'm not hating that he has a new kit, I am just severely disappointed that riot kept almost nothing the same (except his passive revive and to be honest, for how much controversy this ability has gotten in the past, I'd rather they scrap it and give him REAL defensive abilities).\n\nPeople think Aatrox isn't balanced because of what's been going on right now. Aatrox has been a decent pick for a long time now but it hasn't been until guinsoo's and conqueror AS WELL as the nerfs to tanks and ADCs that Aatrox is finally able to shine. He has a VERY simple kit that has clear weaknesses in that, his abilities have long cooldowns, they are all extremely telegraphed and he has to get in range to actually deal damage while not actually having chase/stickiness in his kit. I've always thought of Aatrox as one of the best template/beginner champions. He has enough in his kit to be decently versatile but at the same time, he emphasises on honing the fundamentals to climb and not just simply being more mechanically skilled. \n\nNow having said all this, I definitely did think Aatrox needed a rework to keep in line with Riot's new direction and champion philosophy but... I wanted a rework not a complete redo. Of course I'll still give new Aatrox a shot and who knows, maybe they'll eventually hit the spot with him. BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW, I am mourning the death of my champion and regretting what he has become.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkria430","date":"2018-06-18T04:10:45.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"“Also...did u kno that now...u can sustain off of EVERY AA?

If u want more healing then build AD and AS. With the old Aatrox the only way u controlled ur was through 3 ways, ur passive which is largely out of ur control if the enemy disengages, ur E which cost HP and ur W which only healed on the 3rd AA. The new Aatrox heals for all the dmg he does and will have a greater chance of keeping an enemy in range with W, knock ups and a faster dash with 2 charges. His new passive gives him more range than most melee champs. His ult only appears lackluster because it MOSTLY about the revive which is a VERY powerful mechanic that eats up most of the ults power budget. Now he's a juggernaut skirmisher that embraces the theme of war more than the old Aatrox could, because he can dmg groups of people instead of just one which allows him to heal more and keep going. His abilities only look clunky in a duel in a lane, but in a clustered teamfight it will be easy to hit multiple targets with Q, this new Aatrox is meant more for team fights which encompass the idea of war MUCH better than dueling. Also being a diver whos also a drain tank isn't good for balance. Im sure Aatrox players would rather Riot keep the drain tank aspect than the Diver aspect. So thats why he's no longer a duelist diver, because teamfighting fits war better than dueling and a diver can't be a drain tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkria430","date":"2018-06-27T02:19:02.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok ignore my comment i played him more on pbe and he finna lit i did that comment after 3 games, i played 15 and hes fun and good i still just wish there was more to the ulti","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-06-27T02:24:38.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Darkria430,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6Fq4VFGZ,comment-id=000200000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-06-27T02:19:02.418+0000)\n>\n> ok ignore my comment i played him more on pbe and he finna lit i did that comment after 3 games, i played 15 and hes fun and good i still just wish there was more to the ulti\n\ncool","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-06-17T13:34:55.894+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not an Aatrox main, but this is a criticism I very much agree with. I think we can generally agree that Aatrox has some pretty serious gameplay issues, but he also had a distinct style of play that was worth keeping, namely one with a focus on basic attacks and three-hit bonuses, that we've seen succeed on existing kits (e.g. Ekko, Vayne, Vi, etc.). On top of that, Warwick and Irelia are both examples of heavily autoattack-dependent, sustain-based champions whose reworks were successful, as they preserved their general playstyles, including their autoattacking strength and persistent sustain, while making them healthier. The stage was effectively set for the same to happen to Aatrox, and even those unfamiliar with the champion seemed to agree that he mostly needed updates to the less interesting parts of his kit, rather than a complete redo. It is therefore disappointing to see that this does not seem to have even been attempted, as the new Aatrox plays completely differently from his predecessor even in ways that have been proven to not require such drastic changes. The fact that this new kit is also very similar to Riven's, right down to the way his abilities are meant to be comboed, adds insult to injury.\n\nTo reiterate, I'm not complaining simply because I feel the rework could've hypothetically been made closer to the old Aatrox. Rather, the features that players are asking for are features that have _already been successfully preserved in other reworks_. If this were Riot's first ever VGU, maybe there'd be more room for guessing, but we've had many complete champion overhauls that have succeeded far better in preserving their champions' identity, including overhauls to champions with issues very similar to Aatrox's, e.g. Warwick and Irelia. By contrast, we have also had several reworks that are notoriously *un*successful, precisely because they did not even try to capture the original champion's feel and playstyle: Karma's failed overhaul is still heavily criticized to this day, and whenever Galio stops being OP, he gets exactly the same complaints, as well as a massive drop in popularity that amply demonstrates his lack of a true core fanbase. When these reworks hit, their success was generally easy to gauge even before they hit Live, as players right from the get-go could identify how much integrity and creativity went into the VGU. Within just a few days, the new Aatrox is already largely being seen as Riven 2.0, including by people who tested him on the PBE, and he has already attracted a huge amount of negative attention due to how drastically he departs from the original. This in itself is not great, but it is all the more unfortunate that Riot's development process means he is likely to sit in this state for years. We have yet to see a VGU get reverted, and I fear Aatrox's update will be no different in this respect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4th3t0s","date":"2018-06-17T06:43:42.804+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"https://i.imgflip.com/2cdccx.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2018-06-17T09:31:38.660+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Never thought I'd see the day when \"many\" and \"Aatrox\" were used in the same sentence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-06-17T17:20:37.181+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a titan of a monster who is older than war and desired to inspire men to reveal the horrors within them...yeah, pretty underwhelming.\n\n\"I know what lurks within the hearts of men.\"\n\nSomeone who would force them to lose themselves to the atrocities commited by their own hands, revealing the truth.

Many of the mains get angry how the new rework looks, and after a month or two of it dropping, the rage subsides and we move on. \n> \n> Though, this rage seems justified. Aatrox, lore wise and game play wise, has drastically altered. This really isn&amp;#039;t Aatrox anymore. This rework, along with others in the past (Galio being the worst offender), is a new character being made that shares some of the same characteristics, while deleting the old character at the same time. \n> \n> Aatrox, before his rework, was regarded as an Auto Attack duelist/diver. The thing that separated him from other AA duelists was his W, Blood Price/Thirst, making the player have to decide if he should have Blood Price toggled on to deal more damage and fill up his blood well to reach his steroid and G.A. in a fight; or, toggle his Blood Thirst on in order to give him more sustain and surviveablilty in a fight. His Ult contributed to this fact, giving him a magical damage burst around him and increasing his attack range. His Dark Flight allowed him to gap close and his Blades of Torment offered poke and a slow to stick on to enemies easier.\n> \n> Now, what quite a few Aatrox players where wishing for in a rework where changes to his Q (Dark Flight) and his E (Blades of Torment). These two abilities are considered the wonkiest and worst abilities in his kit because his Q radius for his knock up is very small (ontop of it being a small hitbox to begin with) and it offered nothing other than the small amount of damage it does. His E needed changing because of the skill&amp;#039;s slow travel speed and weird hitbox. His W and his Ult (his ult, while underwhelming and could use some buff like bonus MS, feels like it doesn&amp;#039;t need serious alteration)\n> \n> What we have now is a Bruiser that primarily uses **Abilities** to trade and deal damage. The only things that has been kept is part of his Q on his third Q cast, his Blood Thirst being proced on his new passive, and his ult now has his revive. (Oh, and I guess his wonk hitboxes on his first two Q casts)\n> \n> This is the issue with the rework, instead of being an Auto Attacking Duelist/Diver that could sustain himself **or** deal more damage, he is now a Bruiser that relies on casting his abilities more than using AA&amp;#039;s. He is being mostly compared to Riven as a clunkier version of her. \n> \n> Given how many Aatrox mains where willing to give their input on how to fix these issues on places such as the boards or /r/Aatrox mains, seeing Riot do what they did with the Galio rework, where they sprinkle in things from his old kit while.It has also been note that Riot has been quiet inside the Aatrox main&amp;#039;s committees, possibly giving the implication that they new they didn&amp;#039;t really rework him, just rather redo him from ground up.  Very few changes could&amp;#039;ve been made, but they went with this grand scheme of a rework, for reason I can&amp;#039;t really find or justify why so many solutions have been made by the community itself.\n> \n> Lore and character wise, listening to his full VO you can tell they really tried with it, and I will give credit where it is due. With Aatrox&amp;#039;s new lore, it fits him nicely and seems to be well done. He&amp;#039;s angry at a lot of the champions, specifically the Targonians, but has some really deep and somber lines sprinkled in, giving him more character than &amp;quot;edgy demon who wants to kill everything.&amp;quot; Despite him yelling that he is a God killer and World ender, making him sound like a done to death villain, its good **in my opinion**. \n> \n> The issue is that its not the Aatrox we know and love (or hate). It feels like they could&amp;#039;ve done this rework without changing his model or personality. Aatrox was calm and collected. He craved war and bloodshed, but wasn&amp;#039;t angry because Zoe existed because he never had had a reason to.  They could&amp;#039;ve worked off of what they had, instead of only keeping the Darkin idea and scrapping the rest of him.\n> \n> In the end, Aatrox was a Diver/Duelist that relied heavily on AA&amp;#039;s that needed fixing. He was considered to be one of the most requested characters to be reworked because of how long since he has been touched meaningfully. What ended up as a result was a complete overhaul of a new champion that shares little characteristics with Aatrox. This has angered many fans of the original Aatrox, as there will be no way to play the old character they fell in love with. This rework will attract many new fans to him, but at the same time, cause many of Aatrox&amp;#039;s old fans to leave, being forced to find a new main or stop playing the game entirely as Aatrox gets essentially removed from the game. Such was the fate for other characters, like Galio.  \n> \n> I mean, at least we still have his dance.\n\nI used to play a lot of jungle aatrox and I hate that they are literally making him into a shitty Riven. Who the fuck asked for that? He needed an update or slight changes. Not a bloody brand new champ. They basically mixed Riven with Swain and called it a day","replies":[]}]}
