Sword and Sheen. It would be nice if it had CDR, but you can&#039;t just create the stat in a build path.

It can't get Armor Pen, so my only thought is reducing the amount of AD, but giving it Zeke's Herald's aura or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Renaille","date":"2015-04-15T21:40:02.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"An AD grevious wounds item would either make sustain champs useless or never be bought.","replies":[{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-04-16T16:17:41.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xuldin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bYIhMenx,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-15T21:40:02.982+0000)\n>\n> An AD grevious wounds item would either make sustain champs useless or never be bought.\n\nRemember, it's about balance. It will make sustain near useless, as long as the opponent is below 40% HP. Buying a Runaan's Hurricane would apply the Grievious Wounds to multiple people as well.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-04-15T21:41:42.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But now it's spellblade.
