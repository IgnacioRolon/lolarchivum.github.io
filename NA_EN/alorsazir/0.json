I would like to inquire if this a recent trend or if i have just hit such a low point in my league mmr that i can be put with these sorts of fellow.\r\n\r\nNow, for those who would shun me for calling other bots on the account of them being simply inexperienced, I would like to raise the fact that I was playing Azir, and for those who never tested Azir against low level bots, bots do no register soldiers as a threat, making bot identification one of the many abilities of this wonderful champion. Indeed, by simply placing a soldier next to a bot, it is possible to see their lack of reaction to the possibility of getting stabbed, proving their artificial nature.\r\n\r\nI thank you for taking the time to read this,\r\n\r\nAlors Azir.\r\n{{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T21:52:43.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots aren't really something new to League, but they do mainly end up staying in lower mmr matches.
