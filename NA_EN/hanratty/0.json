I started my account in Canada and switched my account back having played less than a few months of a ranked season so I ended bronze I believe. \r\n\r\nSince coming back to EUW I climbed to Gold, and then from Bronze after placement to Diamond in two seasons ago. Since transferring back, my MMR has been changed back to Bronze when I left about 3 or more years ago, although I have high borders/icons etc. \r\n\r\nJust wondering if there's any work around for this or if I really have to Grind for yet another full season (bronze-diamond).\r\n\r\nThanks if anybody can help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-29T22:35:13.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like Chermorg was able to cover up most of this, but just a little tidbit to help this make a little more sense overall.\n\nYour ranking/MMR is a score based off the other players on your region. It makes sense to say those scores are you placement among your regional/server peers. When you transfer, you're going to be playing with a *completely different set of people*, so that rank from the old server doesn't really mean much anymore, which is why you have to place again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-29T04:27:20.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your MMR is server-specific. Someone who is ranked Gold in the NA server may not be as high in a different server, or may be even higher in another server yet. As such, when you transfer, your MMR is \"frozen\" on the server you have, as well as being factored into your new server. If you transfer back to your old server, it is your \"frozen\" MMR you are going to return to - this is both due to skill discrepancies between servers as well as to prevent abuse of the transfer feature to artificially gain ranked.\n\nSorry I can't help more.","replies":[{"poster":"Hanratty","date":"2018-01-29T04:33:35.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have to climb from Bronze again and there's nothing I can do about it? {{item:3070}}   Sent a ticket to Riot hope they can do something","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-29T04:35:06.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly there is nobody at Riot able to edit MMR of an account - this is to protect the integrity of the ranking system.\n\nIf you are of a skill level higher than Bronze on the NA server, your climb should be quite fast - the system takes into account players playing well above their matchmade skill level and adjusts your LP win and loss rate accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"Hanratty","date":"2018-01-29T04:37:44.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I know it won't take too long just seems like all the games from bronze - plat is just purely grinding.
