So after the wait i l played a game, lost and queued for another and while it was my turn to ban, it wouldnt let me click on a champion so the timer ran out and it was just there one 0 secs.. I was still able to chat to my friend about it. I even have a picture to prove it and this isnt fair cause im losing lp stupidly and getting punished for things that going wrong with the client.\r\n\r\nHope someone sees this and help me out.","replies":[{"poster":"Reakwon","date":"2017-04-26T14:00:02.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems you even have it rough on your end bro.

Yeah, nothing can be done. Support wont help you. It's a problem on their end, pretty sure has something to do with faulty net code. As of now there is no way of preventing a d/c. What I can recommend is that if it happens in the middle of a match try resting your router asap, it should let you back in game. \n\nAs for support, I'm pretty upset that players are getting falsely leave busted and that you guys wont at least remove it for those who are dealing with these d/c issues. I've had to deal with it twice in the last 2 days, haven't even been able to play with my friends cause they don't want to have to wait.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T17:19:01.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear that you're getting these crashes and stacking up wait timers.  I'd like to help!  It sounds like your connection might be unsable and losing sync, so you're failing to make selections during champion select or getting left behind completely.  Even if it's not intentional, [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) is still treated equally.  \n\nYour best bet in this case would be to run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and strengthen your connection.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
