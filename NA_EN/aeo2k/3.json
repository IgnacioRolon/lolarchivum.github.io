I was instead helping mid and top and decided to give up bot. I told him to stop inting and play a little smarter and that's where it began to go downhill. He started to actively call out my position in jg every few minutes and he proceeds to afk farm bot lane taking the cs from yasuo. I then called him a brain-dead r%%%%%%%%%%nderstand my choice of words were not exactly the best but in this scenario would both of us get banned?\n\n\nAlso please do something about PBE. I recentlly joined PBE hoping that the environment would be much better than standard league. In fact I was horribly wrong. It's somehow exponentially  more toxic and cancerous. This could be due to the fact that there is apparently no punishment system in place. With what I experienced I doubt any of us actually deserve to be in there. You WILL experience someone leaving in the middle of the match because of selfsh reasons. You WILL be forced  to play it out and waste your time and in the end it won't matter cause all they get is a timer for dodging. \n( WHY IS THERE NO REMAKE OPTIONS AVAILABLE WHEN SOMEONE DC???)","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2019-09-29T02:14:43.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, assisting the enemy (which is what calling out the jg position is) is a 14 day ban, because it is a gameplay offense.\n\nCalling someone an inter, and your other insults also run contrary to the agreement you signed. As that is a chat offense, it will contribute a black mark against your account. It will contribute to an eventual chat restriction, if your severity over time score goes too high.","replies":[]}]}
