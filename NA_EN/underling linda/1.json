BUT, my wifi.... one year ago, it was so bad, i finished only 1 out of 3 games, and i got a lot of penalties, like 5 minuts waiting, 10 and 20. Now, a year later, my wifi broke down 3 times in 2 days, i had 1300 ping in a ranked game, and 2 times it disconected me from normals,and guess what, NOW BECAUSE OF THIS I HAVE 5 TIMES 20 MINUTS WAIT, ARE YOU SERIOUS??????? 5 times 5 minuts would be enought!!! I never left a game in the past year, i got disconnected from 2 games now and got a total of 100 minut wait time.

A trend of disconnections really impacts everyone in your matches and that's where a penalty like this comes in. It really does suck when you can't stay connected to a match, but regardless of the reason for the disconnection, it negatively impacts everyone in the match. \n\nIf you're still experiencing disconnections, I strongly recommend switching to a wired connection (ethernet) directly to your modem to see if the router is the exact cause. It would also be beneficial to work through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if your issue persists.","replies":[]}]}
