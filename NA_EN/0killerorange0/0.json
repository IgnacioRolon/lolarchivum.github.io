However when I clicked the link to get in to it it was to be an alpha tester. Now, I don't want t sound ungrateful or anything cuz i don't mind but i think something wrong happened. What should i do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T21:33:48.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your summoner name isn't showing on here, so I can't look into your specific case.  In general though, PBE and Alpha are separate applications.  Being accepted to the PBE does not also admit a player into testing the alpha client.  Below are the links for each individual sign-up:\n\n[EUW PBE Sign up\n](https://pbesignup.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe)\n\n[EUW Alpha Sign Up\n](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/euw/en/alpha)\n\n\nI hope that helps clear some things up!","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-07-27T10:06:19.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought all PBE accounts had access to the PBE alpha client though?","replies":[]}]}]}
