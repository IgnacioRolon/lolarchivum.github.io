I&#039;ll continue to keep you guys involved and skin giveaways on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nIGN - Tigatron | Crayociraptor \r\n\r\nI do ranked in a number of different brackets to try and teach others how to carry games at different skill levels. Each level of ranked requires a different style of play and multiple means of carrying games. I try to interact with my viewers often and play games with them throughout the night. Ranked, Normals, or even ARAMs. Having fun with you guys and laying down some knowledge is what I am all about.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have decayed down to Plat 4 on my accounts, but am working back up to hopefully get Diamond again before end of season.\r\n\r\nPast two seasons I had 2 accounts in Diamond with my top one at Diamond 1 and another account in Diamond 5. I went from Gold 1 to Diamond 1 playing almost exclusively Teemo. The only times I didn&#039;t play him were when I needed to fill a different role. Like any player out there just trying to move up and hopefully working my way to diamond. Recently started seeing a lot more success as I&#039;ve changed my attitude. Below is a link on how you too can climb if you want to, maybe help change your mentality towards ranked. \r\n\r\nI am a huge fan of Teemo but like to change it up from time to time. I tend to enjoy some of the lesser played champions such as Garen, Warwick, Galio, Cassiopeia, Malzahar, Volibear, and others. \r\n\r\nMy Champion Guide\r\nTeemo - http://www.lolking.net/guides/55297\r\n\r\nMy Red Post Thread - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3695770","replies":[]}
