Morellos needs to be good without the passive or else nobody would get it.\n\nThe new LW upgrades are differnt. there are 2 (riot even said a 3rd is probably coming later this season) options. One that reduces healing and the other one increases AA dmg by up to 15% if a target has more max HP than you, which is the case for most champs comapred to ADCs. AD assassins, brusiers, juggernauts, casters, ... even backline supports with Sightstone have more HP than ADCs. With only +500 HP a caster takes 15% more AA dmg from ADCs. So a caster that builds ROA or Rylais actually wasted all the gold for the HP stat because he will die in nearly the same time against an ADC.\n\nHaving to decide between healing reduction and that +0-15% AA dmg passive, most people will go fo the AA enhancement except they have a very problematic Mundo or Aatrox on the enemies team and no Morellos and Ignite.

It also costs 900 more gold and has no smaller version that can give you sustain. if you want to go for a certain stat/passive/active and you need to wait for 3.4k gold to actually get it, it makes the stat/passive/active very unattractive for the early game. \n\nLook at the current ER.

The only good thing about it is that it also offers the 3 sec dmg delay for 12% of the incoming dmg. that was good when it was 20% or if it would still be 5 sec, but that passive is not that strong anymore and the item loses to most other dmg items for giving less sustain than WotA for way more gold when it comes to AD casters.

Or just some general gameplay changes for them. Those both seem to be a pretty awkward state. Feast/famine or over/under tuned. None of those seem to have a happy medium with the way the game works around them.\n\nEG: panth seem to be in an 'ok' spot right now, but getting a buff by way of blocking AA based cc's....he might go to OP levels, then a minor nerf to his stats to fix that might make him unviable. No middle grounds.\n\nI know people want tanks to work, but I feel like tanks can be fixed by number tweeks/slight item buffs/nerfs. I don't think they need as big of an overhaul as people think.\n\nAkali, Kat, Eve, and Kha are more or less known to be unbalanceable by way of numbers. Because they've been changed a lot, and still have not felt right in a long time. They need something bigger to make them work out.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-11-03T12:53:11.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually i do think tanks need an overhaul and not just numbers tweaking or item buffing. They are simply to binary now they become hard to kill and have cc thats it. Yes they are slightly different but thats pretty much what they do engage and soak damage. In which case the most reliable one's will always come out on top. lIke Malphite or Maokai their cc is hard to dodge and they have good defense steroid.\n\nBtw Mundo and Olaf are not ad casters they are aggro tanks with good innate sustain damage and tenacity. they sit on your caries are difficult to dps down and bring good damage whilst being hard to peel off. They are actually a kind of tank with a very clear unique kind of ability. Think of them as fighter/bruiser tanks.\n\nBut all the other tanks do very similar things. They could differentiate in tanking capabilities. Sion needs his passive to stack hp in order to become tanky in the first place, what if for example the health he stacks is added as a red bar, or red health, this hp would be immune to all kinds of %hp damage including %hp true damage(but not flat true damage). Then give his shield a bit of an overhaul too where it lets true damage pass through hitting sion directly but as long as the shield perists he receives 30% less magic damage. This would make him strong vs hyper carries like Vayne and Kog but not any different vs jinx for example, in fact he has low base armor making him the weakest of all tanks vs normal carries. He can potentially become a hypertank but only by stacking this health, which compensates for his weak early game, he only gets more defense vs dps ap and therefore also alot of %hp ap damage if he does not use his shield for damage. meanwhile the rest of his kit is still high risk high reward in terms of cc peel and damage, everything needs to charge up for cc and damage and they are also skillshots making them easy to avoid, but devastating if they land. \n\nMalphite for example already has a powerfull armor steroid and scales with armor. This could be emphasised more by giving him maybe an option to increase his base armor aswell. This would make him very strong vs normal ad dps but less so vs true dmg and magic damage.\n\nJust an example of ideas here. But giving tanks stronger different tanking niches makes one tank more valueble then others in different situations. On top of that they can also differentiate in damage more in terms of overal damage potential, burst, dps, reliable damage, skillshot dependant, magic damage heavy, physical damage heavy. And differences in teamfighting by having better engage or better peel. More utility can also be added to tanks giving them better different niche roles for tank diversity.\n\nWhile i do agree assasins are in a somewhat bad spot at the moment they can literally only be good for 1 situation and that is picking off soft targets before a fight starts. they often need high base damage and good scaling with mobility, and this often creates problems when they snowball they start bursting tanks and squishies alike which is a bit unhealthy. using mobilty to get some low risk high reward plays which makes it more unhealthy when they start snowballing, i mean look at Riven for example she never has to fight if she doesnt want to which is somehwat unhealthy for snowball reliant champions. First riot needs to find a way to make these champions less snowball reliant, and i dont really have an idea how, right now its stomp or be stomped with alot of peeling otions in items making hings difficult as the game progresses, give them too much free stats and power and they start facerolling over everything else again.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2015-11-03T14:32:16.232+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bane Saber,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GE26aGB8,comment-id=0000000c0001,timestamp=2015-11-03T13:52:54.082+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:86}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:238}}\n\nHm, yah, and maybe {{champion:157}} too.\n\n\nWith riven and zed and yas and talon all having huge balance problems.

But still ad casters. (As in, a higher amount of their damage comes from casting skills, other than autoattacks, with champs like {{champion:23}} {{champion:266}} or {{champion:122}} being on the opposite end of that, with their skills mostly being for positioning/survivability/etc, and AA's being most of their damage...)\n\nI feel the flaw is AD caster items being the same (for the most part) to AD assassin items. With the items being tuned for AD assassins. So the AD casters will either be strong or weak, depending on how well the AD assassin items work with them. Having their own item class would help a lot. As you could tune the items that are good for AD casters other than the AD casters themselves...which, historically, just doesn't work out.\n\nNow the option is closer to-\nBuff AD assassin items...and Talon becomes Warlord Destroyer of Worlds again, Riven becomes even more of a pain in the ass...and assassins themselves turn out 'ok.'
