Assuming the other trees are more offensive, or perhaps utility based, the tank stats would be very powerful on them.\n\nGuess it's as you said, we'll need to see what the other runes are before gauging their strength.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-06-02T02:00:01.443+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Balance will likely take a while to get smoothed out yeah, hence the pre-season release (we originally considered a mid-season date, but amongst other things amount of gameplay disruption felt really high for that). \n\nIn terms of champs currently depending on specific masteries or runes to function properly we'll be doing an extended pass on that to avoid leaving champs abandoned.
