If the Teemo was using hate speech and was reported, you may be sure he was punished as well. However, threatening reports is a punishable offense in and of itself, even disregarding all of the general negativity and toxicity in your chat.\n\nIf someone is being toxic to you, mute them and report them after the game, WITHOUT retaliating. \"Fighting back\" is pointless and will only be detrimental to you. Riot doesn't tolerate being toxic to a toxic player because you have the ability to remove yourself from that toxicity, simply by muting their chat.\n\nEven if someone trolls you in-game, you just have to learn to deal with it. It happens. More often than anyone here would like. Fortunately, the worst trolls are also toxic in chat, so reporting them for that will get them punished. The problem lies in the fact that intentional feeding is very difficult for a computer program to discern from simply a bad player.\n\nSo, depending on how many offenses you've had previously (I'm guessing this is a permanent ban, and you've had chat restrictions and a 14 day ban before), this punishment was warranted, regardless of whether or not your teammates were punished. If you were permanently banned for this without having had chat restrictions and/or a 14-day ban previously, you may be able to open a ticket to discuss lessening the punishment, because there was no hate speech in your chat logs, which is one of the only ways to be permanently banned without warning.\n\nI hope this clarifies any confusion you have about your ban.
