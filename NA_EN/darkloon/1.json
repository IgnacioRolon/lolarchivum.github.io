I went fid jungle and my top WW decided he wanted to steal my blue instead of help me get it... Then when blue spawns again the ENEMY ww was in the bush so i lured it up and pinged danger and assist me, he comes and steals it AGAIN then ints it to the enemy WW by chasing him all the way to tier 2 top tower from our blue buff. repeats this 3 or 4 more times all the while my mid (Yasuo.... shocker that hes a fkin twat right?) tries to tell me im in the wrong for telling him to stop stealing my fkin blue buff as JUNGLE FIDDLE when my W eats my whole fuckin mana bar to kill multiple mob camps. he persists to troll me the entire game and int my jungle buffs to the enemy warwick and the yasuo defends him for this, we ultimatly lose because of it... like... i HONESTLY dont understand the stupid ass fkin people on this game, the ones who do this, and the ones who defend it.... Can someone explain to me WHY anyone would defend this type of trolling? they werent duo que&#039;d from what i could tell. the yasuo player was simply stupid. I cant even express how bad i wanted to explode on both of them but I didnt. playing this late at night seems to draw out even more of the shit stains that smudge up this community than normal.","replies":[{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2017-06-07T17:14:38.685+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this is why you don't play Blind Pick boys and girls.","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2017-06-08T13:53:23.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beat me to it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-07T06:23:06.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is why we have a Mute option, also take a break from league... if you actually have to vent on the boards you just need to stop playing for like a couple days or so.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-06-07T19:32:37.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Venting on the boards is actually one of the correct usages of the word 'vent', and one of the correct places to vent.\n\nConsider an overheating boiler. You vent the excess pressure to avoid an explosion [damage to yourself] and it's vented to a place where it causes no damage to others. Flaming in chat would be like venting the boiling steam onto the train's passengers, not the best solution.\n\nOr consider working under a fume hood with toxic chemicals. It is vented away from you, through a filter/processor to be harmlessly released. No damage to you, no damage to your coworkers, and hopefully no damage to the environment.\n\nHe's venting on the boards, through a filter. Note the lack of vile imprecations. No damage to him. No damage to his team. And hopefully, no damage to the readers (environment). It looks good to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-07T20:11:59.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah yea, you also don't seem to understand and take everything at face value.\n\nI'll just be straight out with it since y'all seem to have trouble understanding.\n\nSince he's venting on these boards, which if you look at all... is filled with constant toxic behavior, so him venting here must mean it was pretty bad and that he should take a break from league and come back when he feels better.\n\nBut hey, do you if comprehension is a struggle, it's a struggle... gl with it all.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkLooN","date":"2017-06-07T20:28:54.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll just say this....
