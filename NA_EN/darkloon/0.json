I had an ADC that was duo&#039;d with the top laner who then started harassing me and saying i was useless even tho he was 0-1 at this point and i was 4-2. I had a jungler who LEFT THE GAME at level 6 to never return. and i had a support who doesnt play support, ever. And an enemy team that harassed me because I was literally their only competition. (I had 5 of our 7 kills...our AFK jungler had one of the others.)\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, FUCK you ranked, never again. Ranked in this game is absolute aids and I will honestly lose my shit if i even bother trying with it due to the people, not the game.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-06-08T06:07:55.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is it your first ranked game ever when you have the Season 6 silver rank reward for your summoner icon?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkLooN","date":"2017-06-08T06:44:15.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Friend quit the game a long time ago and gave me this account and i got it perma banned.

It is, but you have to get used to it.\nIf you don't rank, you'll never be matched with better people, so you won't improve. And if you don't improve, you'll still be at this toxic elo.\n\nAlso, this is all based on one game. That's a lot of salt for only one game! Just tell yourself that the enemy team is as likely as yours to have afks/flamers (unless you play like garbage, your team will probably flame you but that doesn't seem to be the case). If you're a good player, you will have more than 50% w/r, and you will get out of this crap.\n\nIf you have the chance to get to mid-gold, stay there. You're already better than ~80% of the players, so there's no point in climbing unless you're competitive.\nSomehow, the elo is not toxic at all. It was really fun. Good ol' times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scelto","date":"2017-06-08T06:06:54.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WELCOME TO LEAGUE OF LEGENDS","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-06-08T05:57:27.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to ranked.
