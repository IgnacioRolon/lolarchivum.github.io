It froze for a second then flickered over to google but when I alt+tab back into the game, there has been a white bar at the top, similar to how it would be on top of a browser with an the standard x and minimize buttons in the top right. It only happens in game and occasionally my screen will flash pink and freeze then recover with a notification popping up saying the the display driver stopped working and then recovered. I have gone through every way I can find to fix the display driver and have come to the conclusion that it must be league seeing as it only ever happens in game. I think the display is also shifted downwards or something similar as a small band on the bottom of the screen is cut off to make room for the white line on top (ex. half the gold amount/shop button is cut off by the bottom of my screen) as well as in unlocked view I cannot pan down as the cut off doesn't allow me to put my mouse against the \"bottom\" of league (although it is as far down as it will go.\r\nAny suggestions or fixes? I've looked for similar threads but haven't found any but I'm also new at using the forums.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T20:59:59.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have a series of different issues here, ranging from your drivers being outdated to possible corrupt game files.  As a first step, I suggest usign our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to get your game back in top-top shape.  In addition, if you recently updated to the anniversary Windows 10 update then try disabling the [Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  I've heard some cases where it's been causing some game processing issues with League for a few players.
