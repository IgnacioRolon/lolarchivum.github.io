But when I want to play Nami with her Chroma skin, I&#039;ll have to go to Blind Pick, since that&#039;s skin only works there...Hopefully this is soon fixed :/","replies":[{"poster":"Dannywolf","date":"2015-09-03T20:56:30.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does it still not work 2 patches later?

We're currently investigating an issue where chromas sometimes do not register in champion select. \n\nAre the chroma swatches displaying in champion select? \n\nDid you have a chroma selected from the game prior? I main Nami, and I often use the chroma pack. I always re-select the chroma I'd like to use, and so far, I haven't had issues with it.  (Not an ideal scenario, which is why we're looking into the root cause of the issue.)","replies":[{"poster":"Namiholic","date":"2015-09-05T16:03:17.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey KateyKhaos! \n\nThank you so much for investigating that bug.\n\nThe chroma swatches (do you mean the little colored squares?) are displayed. Before, I didn't have any of the Nami's Chroma Skin in game, when I selected one in Teambuilder. Now, I can only have the \"smoky\" one, even though I wanted to play with the purple one. I tried to reselect the skins, switching between Spirit River and the default one, to try to reset the whole thing, but it doesn't seem to work...And it gets annoyingly complicated.\n\n(btw, are the Chroma Packs limited skins? I can't seem to find any in the store)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-08T21:05:46.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the chroma swatches where you can select the different colors. Chroma packs currently aren't limited, so they should all be available in the store. \n\nThanks for the additional information - we're still working to fix this issue, so steps like you've mentioned above are wicked helpful.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Namiholic","date":"2015-09-03T21:29:09.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had a game with Nami in TB, now the Chroma Skin seems to work o_O I really hope it does.
