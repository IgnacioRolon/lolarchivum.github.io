Content gifting should be fine to use on the legacy client, but not available on the updated yet:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI'm sure she'll love it!","replies":[{"poster":"Bick Jivas","date":"2016-12-04T03:53:19.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so I did what you suggested and riot took my RP for gifting Elementalist Lux to my girlfriend and took my RP for gifting Jinx and Wildfire Zyra Skin to my brother and neither one of them received their gift. i just bought 35$ so i could do this what am I supposed to do now?","replies":[{"poster":"Poppy Airlines","date":"2016-12-04T20:17:02.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing just Happened to me.

Simple go to the log in place and at the right hand side below the forgotten password link, you can see launch legacy client. Simply press that and you can gift all you want.\n\nThank you anyway but i found out the solution lol\n\ntake care all","replies":[]},{"poster":"shark music","date":"2016-12-07T11:56:57.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the gift recipient also logs in via legacy client, they should receive the gifts immediately.","replies":[]}]}
