But now since the 6.15 update, my games have been crashing each and every time mid game, it is frustrating, i have done everything i can, repaired the system, reinstalled the game 2 times already and many more. I'm not completely blaming the game, it might be my mac book itself that is the problem but when i do anything else, this never happens.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not bug splat or anything else, the game starts normally; go in the character select and wait for it to load. A few minutes everything is completely fine but suddenly the screen freezes and im unable to log off or do anything and my laptop turns off by itself in a few seconds.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions at all???","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T21:44:21.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your description, it sounds like your Macbook may be experiencing hardware issues.
