As mentioned, I&#039;ve deleted the game (after spending over 500 on champs and skins) and I won&#039;t ever be coming back. \r\n\r\nAs a person with high social anxiety, league was a sort of way for me to be around people without being around _too many_ people. But it&#039;s not like that anymore. I&#039;ve grown _tired_ of the rampant toxicity that has grown unabated in this community. Chances are extremely high that someone will begin flaming in any given game I play, including games in which I am trying to introduce new players to League. And the extent to which these disgusting people are willing to go to make people feel bad is beyond reprehensible--**it&#039;s an outright condemnation of Riot&#039;s management of their own game and community**. \r\n\r\nHaving expressed the aforethought, it&#039;s with no heavy heart that I say goodbye to League.\r\n\r\nCiao.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-05T05:45:10.765+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"If your anxiety is so intense that you struggle with verbal abuse in game, then you should probably see a doctor about that. I have pretty bad generalized anxiety but I'm able to somewhat control it. When I'm having days that it's particularly bad, I have medication for that.

Anytime anybody asks for a report, I pretty much always report them instead. It's against the rules to ask people to report others, after all.
