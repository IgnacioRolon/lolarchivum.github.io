Her only other steroid is her ultimate, which--while respectable--is average at best, even for an ultimate. Most (primary) Marksmen have an AS steroid above 50%, usually along with another steroid, significantly multiplying their innate damage scaling, but Vayne just has her ultimate and Tumble, which only affects one attack every 2+ seconds.\n\nYes, I know the exceptions to that AS steroid rule. Kog'maw only has +30%, but it's literally always activated unlike most, and his kit's power is mostly loaded in the active abilities. Varus' passive is a wonky +20/40% AS steroid that's basically nonexistent; frankly, he needs an Ashe-style kit tweak. Corki's kit lacks a common steroid, and instead deals bonus True damage and has innate Armor Shred. Lucian doesn't have a regular steroid, but has his attack/spell weaving combos that let him multi-attack for Tons of DamageÂ©. Caitlyn doesn't have any real steroid, other than her passive every few attacks, and could also use a bit of kit tweaking imo.\n\nJust not even going to mention *that* one, considering the hate spewed about that particular marksman...\n\nAnyway, point is, Vayne has her true damage instead of an AS steroid. It scales on health, because she's built to be more of a tank buster than the average Marksman, and Silver Bolts does that job very well.\n\n*Having said that,* removing the flat damage on Silver Bolts would be a very logical nerf.\n---\nAs for Riven, her shield scaling on AD doesn't really do very much for her. There is a grand total of **five** (5)--count them out, five--end-game AD items that provide direct defensive stats. Two of them provide MR (Mercurial and Malmortius), and three of them provide Health (Mallet, Trinity and Cleaver).\n\nWith the addition of Sterak's Gage, there will be six.\n\nHealth itself is not very powerful alone, especially since increasing the efficiency of %HP damage works against the user, and MR is completely useless against physical-focused champions. There isn't an AD/Armor item to make that shield's scaling very useful against most top-laners.\n\nHer shield scaling on AD means that she has a defensive tool that *doesn't* increase her vulnerability to another damage type, and that doesn't force her to build a pure defense item to be able to withstand a fight. And if you look at *all* melee carry type champions, they *all* have defensive tools that make it possible to play without building pure defensive items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"air tiger","date":"2015-08-13T18:19:23.057+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can **definitely** feel that way, especially if you get countered by them or if they get fed.
