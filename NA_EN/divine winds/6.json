With devourer I was 1 v 5 people with the old WW.  25+ kills a game with maybe like 4-5 deaths.  It was a bit insane although delayed as you pretty much stayed in jungle until sated.  So you could be winning the game and suddenly a sated jungler comes out and rolls the whole team for the win.  I do not think it should have been nuked quite so hard though.  I liked melee sustain champs, which pretty much do not even exist anymore.  It is all about burst kills in 1 second.","replies":[{"poster":"Pokemonred200","date":"2018-04-29T13:29:15.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it may not have been _just_ farming, that was apparently their primary reasoning, since \"the primary problem with 'farming junglers' is that you don't see them for half the game.\" -> Their exact words, as per patch 6.9:\n\n>While Devourer is an incremental improvement over past incarnations (shout-outs to those who remember Feral Flare’s insane healing and vision control), the primary problem with ‘farming junglers’ is that you don’t see them for half the game. Junglers are an integral part of how teams in League operate, and incentivizing them to AFK for the 15 minutes is too high a cost to be healthy long-term. We still want to support junglers that like high attack speed and on-hit builds, but this isn’t the way to do it.\n\nI personally feel like the concept could have been balanced, but the double on-hit passive made sated too good when on-hit builds allowed for offtanks. Maybe what could've happened was giving it another passive, while moving Phantom Hit to {{item:3124}} like they did. But who knows; it's in the past now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-04-29T01:45:44.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i remember that item that made  it hell on earth if you played against shyvana\n\n\n... or if you ever saw your jungler pre 30 mins","replies":[{"poster":"TaroBunni","date":"2018-04-29T08:07:19.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, I think I started playing after this item got taken off.
