from him...\nBut then he remembered...that one with the hat was suddenly behind him and then took his Knife and then dove off the ship, as if he wanted to die with it.\nDamn, the world has more then its fair share of fools...but that one took the cake.\nHe heard a door creak open and soft mutters, almost like whispers but also more like they weren&#039;t there.\nThen a blurred face comes into view, his eyes couldn&#039;t focus or make out the figure, all he could see was the light blow out and the figure only slightly made out in the dark.\n\n\"Where am I, Who be yee?\" he spoke, but no voice passed his lips, it was almost as if his voice was gone but still he felt the air on his tongue, was he deaf? \nThe figure only hovered over him...then it spoke, he could hear it speak but it wasn&#039;t due to his ears, it was in his mind.\n\n\"It matters not where you are, Captain, all that matters is what you do now\"\n\nwith that he knew he could speak, so he spoke again despite not hearing himself.\n\n\"What matter of being are you?\" he asked, \"I can&#039;t see well.\"\n\nThe figure was silent, then it spoke again.\n\n\"I am...Karthus\"\n\nHis body went ridged, he knew that name, knew it all too well for the years he had to fend off the Black Mist.\nhis gaze and voice went cold \"get out and leave me be ya dried up ol&#039; specter, Death is not scratchin&#039; at MY door\"\nKarthus simply laughed \"ohhh but it is Captain, and so does it to all living things, your no different then anyone else\"\nHe simply lurched his head away from Karthus and looked at the wall. \n\n\"I suggest ya get out before my arms figure out how to grip my cutless and gut ya like a fish, if ya got any left to spill that is\"\n\nKarthus was silent, then he whispered one last thing to Gangplank\n\n_\"You can&#039;t evade my song forever Captain, remember that...remember that...\"_ \n\nKarthus&#039;s voice faded like a gust of wind in the sails of his ship.\nHe had told Death to leave and it did, Gangplank&#039;s pride would have made him grin if his body didn&#039;t feel like it was scuttled by a barge.\nFinally the candle in his room flickered back to life, and his gaze finally fell back into the darkness.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHis eyes finally squeezed in pain and then slowly opened again, he felt worse then before, and all he could hear was a dull ring.\nStanding over him where five crewmen who had the symbol of the Ravens, a Gang in Bilgewater that he himself owned.\n\n\"Oi&#039; he&#039;s wakin&#039; up he is\"\n\n\"Shut yer yap Briggs\"\n\nGangplank could only hear them as a dull soft speech, most of it was just soft mumbles and muffled jabber.\n\n\"Ya Alright Sir? we managed to fish ya out before the Razorfish got ya.\"\n\nThe one who spoke was a young strong lad with Blond hair and a missing eye by the looks of it.\n\n\"Where am I?\" Gangplank spoke his voice still strong but coarse and sore.\n\n\"On the Silver Maiden sir, last Ship loyal to your rule, most of the other ships have been sunk thanks to Captain Miss Fortune\"  \n\nGangplank nearly choked on his own breath as he heard the title \"Captain\" behind the name of that roddy little Wenches name.\n\n\"Captain Miss Fortune?!\" he said trying to get up but the sound of broken bones in his chest led him to second that choice.\n\n\"Ay sir, Captain, she took the title after she destroyed The Dead Pool and made claim she had ended you once and for all\"\n\nGangplank just laid there, for the first time in his adult life, he was blindsided, it was at this point he questioned if maybe the Old lich&#039;s offer was not a half bad idea, a world where that Runt of a bounty hunter was a Captain?\nNo, knowing him even if he Hadn&#039;t known he would still be rolling in his grave.\n\n\"Is There anyone of my Crew left, Any Dock in town still loyal to me?\" \n\nThe men looked at one another, but no one said a word.\n\n\"TELL ME!\" Gangplank Barked before hacking upon his own words.\n\nOne man stood up and answered, \"Sir, you have been out for a whole week, anyone who is still loyal to you is on this ship right now...we are all that&#039;s left of &#039;Your&#039; Town\"\n\nGangplanks eyes went from shock and stupefied bewilderment to red with fury, that little sea witch took HIS ship, HIS crew, HIS Title and now HIS town! \n\nGangplank grabbed the sides of his cot and pushed.\nMen jumped to their feet and rushed to his aid, but not before Gangplank saw his trusted Sword next to him, the tip still red with magic flame.\nHe took hold of it and pointed it at his men.\n\n \"Any man who lays a finger on me to assist me I&#039;ll run them through and use their entrails to HANG that red headed Bitch who Stole my Town!\"\n\nThe men stopped dead in there tracks and stepped back as ordered. \n\nGangplank growled, these men still feared him, even now, broken and crippled, they still feared him, Good, that meant they still would follow orders and follow his command.\nAs he stood he felt the pain in his chest and stomach grow, almost to the point it felt like hot lead was lodged in every pore of his upper body.\nHis leg felt like it was broken in half, but as he looked down he felt alot worse.\nHis body looked like it had been dragged through the Slaughter Docks four times and was left for chum in the bay.\nHe grabbed his sides in agony, but he gritted his teeth and stood again.\nHis eyes looked out at the door in front of him, he wanted to rip it off of its hinges and blast the whole thing apart, his rage fueled his steps.\nHe knew in his cold Black Heart, No Lass was going to run HIS town while breath still filled his lungs, and the waters of Bilgewater would be black and blood red before he finally let her keep that title.\n\nHe finally reached the door, and with all the strength he had in his body, he lifted his broken legged boot and kicked the door wide open.\nWhat he saw was a deck filled with those loyal to him, every man worthy his salt and blood, all feared and respected him and now here they where ready too prove it with blood and gunpowder.\n\nAs he looked out at his new crew he didn&#039;t even smile, not now, there was too much work to be done...to much to do.\n\n\"Alright lads...\" he spoke to the men, \"I have heard that &#039;Miss Fortune&#039; has taken my Crown as Master of this Port...\"\n\nnot one man spoke...\n\n\"Well...I&#039;m not gonna let that slide, Nor will I let her get away with this\"\n\nHe then pulled his sword up to meet his chest, then thrust it out at his crew.\n\n\"Any of you Scurvy Dogs want a chunk of her, you're more then welcome to stay on this boat, but if any of you give two thoughts of jumpin&#039; ship before this is over...\"\n\nHe then suddenly grabbed the Pistol of the Blond crewmen and then aimed it, Fired, and blew the apple out of the hand of the man at the Bow of the ship not paying much attention, then fired again, killing the man sending him falling to the waters below.\nThe crew stared in terror at what Gangplank had done and then back to him.\n \n\"...Your fate will be mine to settle...\"\n\nHe took a second to let the thought sink in to the empty heads of his new crew.\n\n\"ANY OBJECTIONS?\" he shouted.\n\nthe crew responded with a Resounding \"NO SIR!\"\n\n\"Then get this bucket ready to sail, We make for Noxian Waters, now HOP TO IT\"\n\nThe crew exploded with activity, readying the ship for travel by their Captains demands.\n\nThe Blond crewmen stood behind his captain with confusion before Gangplank slowly turned and returned the pistol.\n\n\"Nice gun, where be mine?\"\n\n\"Lost in the shipwreck sir, we tried as best we could\"\n\nGangplank simply sighed \"shame, I liked that gun\"\nHe then simply Walked past the Blond Crewmen into the Captain Cabin, not before the blond crewmen stopped him.\n\n\"Sir, why Noxus? odds are the welcome will not be a warm one\"\n\nGangplank stopped and slowly looked over his shoulder, the glow of anger and hate burned in his eyes at the crewmen\n\n\"You questionin&#039; my orders boy?\" his voice hinting that death depended on blond mans answer.\n\nThe man stood terrified and shaking \"N-no Captain...sir\"\n\n\"Then keep the men busy and your questions of where we dock to yourself\" he then took hold of the door and pulled, the suddenly stopped\n\"...and bring me some oranges if ya got any\"\n\n\"Yes Captain, Right away!\"\n\nGangplank then closed the door and then dropped back onto the cot he once slept in...but sleep would not find him tonight, his blood boiled with rage and revenge.\nHe WOULD take back his Title, He WOULD get back his City, but most importantly, he WOULD have the head, of \"Captain\" Miss Fortune.\n\n-To Be Continued...-","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-30T05:32:26.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, THEATOMBOMB035 - you are FAST!\n\nI like how you've written this - getting inside Gangplank's head and conveying his though processes.

German, I think, does a lot more capital letters than English - so I wondered if that might be the case, or, again, it was because the Muse had you in its grasp and there was no time for such niceties.  ;)","replies":[{"poster":"THEATOMBOMB035","date":"2015-07-30T06:46:55.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank ya mate!\n\nhaha I fixed the typos you pointed out, man I hate having such twitchy fingers, happens when I type and when I play League\n\nand sadly that Caps problem comes from me not being taught correctly on how to write. mostly I am self taught.\nI often cap the letters of words I want to emphasize on, so that's also a bad habit I have\n\nthanks for all the point outs and notes, and I hope you enjoyed, might do another as time goes on until Riot says whats happened to our Good Captain ","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-07-30T07:28:00.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta say, Grade S stuff you've written here.\n\nI also wonder if GP would have any thoughts of letting his men \"use\" MF before he \"hangs her by her entrails\".
