The thing is, the lowest rank in this game is pretty much populated by a few unlucky people, and people trying to get there (like the trolls you encountered). So long as they reach their goal and make it to their intended rank... They can \"ruin other trolls games.\" They can be matched with other players who also want to ruin others games, and the two troll teams can fight it out to see who makes the other team win first... If they get banned, they will make new accounts and start trying to get those accounts demoted to Iron 4 ruining that many more matches in the process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nhika","date":"2020-01-26T00:48:19.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe they are just really bad, hence Iron 4?","replies":[]},{"poster":"mts25","date":"2020-02-15T12:23:43.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot does't care, in fact to prove it a friend of mine inted on an account from silver 2 down to iron 4, he would select mid go smite and follow the jungler around stealing his camps and feed the occasional kills and he would be reported in all games but as long as he doesn't type in chat he never got banned,on the opposite his honor level got improved (the irony),\nbut if someone flames in chat or decided to open and the others report him he would get banned.\nIt doesn't make sense, riot needs to work a system that would detect trolls/inters because it's getting frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"s10 talon","date":"2020-02-11T04:50:35.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT does not care and won't do a thing about it. **They ONLY punish chat, and leaving games.** \n\nYou can report them after the game but that's more to just make you feel like someone cares.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tyralie","date":"2020-01-25T22:54:25.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"the issue is that support don't give a fuck to people complaining about inter and troll they only care about the chat if you dare say something that can break the snowflake mentality of these troll you will get chat restricted and you will not recieve your season reward sad but its the truth","replies":[{"poster":"Hell5Fire","date":"2020-02-10T23:17:17.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tyralie,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=PLJ99ylo,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2020-01-25T22:54:25.974+0000)\n>\n> the issue is that support don't give a fuck to people complaining about inter and troll they only care about the chat if you dare say something that can break the snowflake mentality of these troll you will get chat restricted and you will not recieve your season reward sad but its the truth\n\nYup, get a perma ban because I told the guy who was telling us to FF and just quit  to F off and because this is the second time ive argued with an inting player.
