It's a slog. Even making their slots not juggle around would make a big difference.\r\nEvery bit of streamlining makes league a bit more sleek and professional. It seems a minor complaint but I think we can all agree the more intuitive and seamless every thing is the better for League.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nYour humble whiny fan.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-25T04:39:17.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just tested this out and was able to reproduce the *slog* that you mentioned. This definitely doesn't seem intended, but it is a Beta Client, meaning our teams are always on the hunt for bugs or weird interactions. I strongly recommend reposting this report to our [**Client Discussions Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) so the team members that work on the new client may see it.\n\nIf you have any other questions, hit me up.","replies":[{"poster":"GrimmR","date":"2017-01-28T01:21:35.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
