Over a year in trying to get actual help. and counting) \r\n\r\nP.S. my account name isnt ruruable. whoever hacked it changed it to that. it was originally Saiishi, then saii senpai, then alucard senpai, then saii senpai again. not like that matters tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Bolt Up","date":"2016-11-03T18:53:01.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're not actually reading from a script.  What's happen, most likely, is that they are using what's referred to as \"canned messages.\"  These are messages that are saved and a click away.  They are used to answer common questions to save time.  This is good for people that have typical questions or very general questions.  However, it causes problems when they think their canned messages will help, but they really don't.  If you keep responding and letting them know that they aren't answering your question, you'll eventually get a message that is not a canned message.  Don't hold your breath for this to change.  More times than not, a canned message will solve the problem (maybe not yours, but the majority of messages that they get).","replies":[{"poster":"Saiishi","date":"2016-11-03T22:40:18.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Certainly explains a lot.
