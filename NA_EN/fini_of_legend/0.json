I have always looked at viegar as someone who counters those more all in ap assassins and i think he still has that feel. He might need buffs in the future we shall see. \n\nI think a really cool way to make him more viable against those all in type assassins make his dark matter fall alot faster or with no delay at all when done within even horizon. It promotes strategy and isn't a simple click and kill but much rather a skill shot :)\n\nAnywho just my opinion","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2015-02-15T04:59:18.032+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks this was good to see. I'm the OP of one of the threads on the front page right now complaining about the Veigar rework. I'm happy to see that the projectile speed on Q looks darn snazzy and that you can still manage to catch the likes of Zed (albeit more difficult now and this is only two games of evidence).\n\nI am curious how laning would go against a mobile mid, not another immobile mage like Malzahar. This video has alleviated a few of my fears, but I still think it needs some tweaking, as several fears remain. How often were you able to last hit 2 minions with your Q on a single blast?","replies":[{"poster":"Fini of Legend","date":"2015-02-15T17:28:30.286+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly don't think Zed is that horrible of a matchup compared to the likes of Talon and Leblanc, but we'll see.\n\nAs usual, early on getting the stacks with q is still mana costly and a bit slow. Double Q-ing is almost impossible early on too. However, when you get ap, mana regen, and more points in Q the double q-ing gets pretty decent. Since his q behaves similarly to Lux Q, you can double Q two low minions who are next to each other but not necessarily one behind the other, which helps quite a bit. You can also use your W to set up double Qs (or just autos). I think good Veigar players will on average have at least 120 bonus AP by 25 minutes from minions and kills. \n\nFor my game against Zed, I watched the game on 2x speed and counted my minion Qs. About 29% was double Qs, however if the game went on longer and I actually farmed more later (in which it is easier to double Q) this might have increased (remember I went 14-2-6, 113 cs in a 28 minute game). BTW that Zed went 11/6/5 with 155 cs. Even though he looked silly in the clips I showed, he obviously did a lot of work across the map and farmed more. \n\nIt's definitely true that Veigar's weaknesses just got weaker. Now every ability except his ult can be juked or juked more easily. Riot probably wants to reduce his 'instant stun and kill' gameplay, but his defensive game is also taking a hit for no reason. They should consider a number of options that would either give him back some offensive power at the cost of his defense or simply give him some defense. Regardless, I don't think his new E should be released as is. Riot should at least be more tentative and reduce the delay to .5 seconds. \n\nHope this was helpful!","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-02-15T20:40:42.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't had many games on the new Veigar yet (nor am I an especially great Veigar player), but this basically aligns with my experience so far. If you're in a low pressure lane and have more practice, you can probably get close to as much AP from Q as you have CS (you're getting more AP from cannon minions, and kills and such add to the total. I'm not the best at farming but I was able to do this in a custom game vs bots). Can't say how higher skill players (than the ones I was matched against) will react to his E, but I think he's still okay if he were released as is; hyper mobile blink champions that used to counter him still counter him, and he has to play a little more defensive and wait for a good opportunity instead of forcing one (because his E is less reliable), but he didn't feel as weak as a lot of threads are suggesting.\n\nI think his E is in an okay spot, a reduced delay would really be helpful but I would rather them buff his Q ratio or W for some other utility than just delayed damage and brush checking or R range or his passive (I've been going morellonomicon since DFG is gone, I never find myself out of mana with morello and his passive).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kDrakari","date":"2015-02-15T08:15:28.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't look as bad as a lot of people were expecting, but it DOES look like he's weaker than live which is already weaker than when he had DFG. The nerfs don't change the fact that he's got a bunch of free AP and huge ratios, but where previously a good Veigar could all-but guarantee a stun with E against any target and follow it up with the rest of his abilities, his W is extremely hard to land reliably against a good opponent with enough mobility to dodge the stun, his Q can be blocked or dodged as well (though it's looking sufficiently effective at least, I find it pretty unsatisfying though), and his R has a substantially reduced AP ratio. The lowered cooldowns and mana costs won't be enough to create any kind of viable alternative to burst and aren't extremely useful FOR burst so aren't much in the way of buffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fini of Legend","date":"2015-02-15T01:54:00.056+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Haha if that's sarcasm then unfortunately I don't think those two games can represent how he will be in terms of power.
