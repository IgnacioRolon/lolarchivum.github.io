It takes probably hundreds of hours of game time to get to a decently functional level of play.\n\nI agree that smurfs sometimes ruin the integrity of the matchmaking system. Luckily, smurfs usually pass on through your elo quickly on their way to their true skill tier. You may think you have smurfs constantly, but as a Silver IV player I meet a lot of so-called \"smurfs\" that are obviously lying to try to mind-game my team. Just because someone gets ridiculously fed doesn't mean smurf. Snowballing happens all the time.\n\nMatchmaker is kinda derpy until you log a few hundred games. By then it has figured out your skill level and your games will be more stable.\n\nA few words of advice: Don't play ranked until you've logged a couple hundred games and are decently familiar at all roles and a good pool of champions. Play Draft Normals if you want the \"ranked\" experience without the stress. You don't want to jump right into ranked because you're still not really familiar with the game, and you'll just trash your elo. Ranked is for earning your true skill tier, not for practicing. Never play a new or unfamiliar champ in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BakugoBestBoy","date":"2015-01-05T19:46:08.974+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you played your provisionals as soon as you hit level 30 I feel really bad for you.

I only started playing on a whim from some friends who suggested I download the game and start playing. They were not very eager to help me, so I spent A LOT and I mean A LOT of time teaching myself the ins and the outs of the game. Looking up tutorials, watching the LCS, and experienced players in Platinum/Diamond/Master leagues on Youtube. I took loads of time and interest in every game I played. Every time I died I took what I may have done wrong and took it into consideration. (Lack of Vision, Bad Positioning or Overextending) \n\nTaking loads of time playing, I reached level 30 around mid-late July, and boy was I not ready to jump into ranked. Which I didnt. I focused a lot on learning more and more, and opening my horizons to other roles. Buying champs that suit me, and learning the insides and outs. \n\nI finally felt comfortable with 2 champions to every single role. That's right all 5. Mid September I decided \"GO FOR IT\" and jumped into ranked. Finished my provisionals and ended up in Silver. After I qualified for Silver, I really took climbing elo slowly, and I am now placed in Silver III, and I am really satisfied with where I am at. 1 year is coming up and to be decently knowledgeable and be placed in such a higher expected league than I thought whereas a lot of my friends are stuck in Bronze, I'm pretty happy. \n\nTo this day, I have a total of over 300 normal games won. (Somewhere around 330-350 to estimate) and I really do feel like I have a lot to learn climbing through Silver and promoting to Gold. \n\nI really dont fully remember leveling to 30 because of the learning curve I had, but I did enjoy learning the game and being a doofus whilst doing so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GeoPeter","date":"2015-01-06T00:05:13.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a lvl 12 player, I actually rarely find myself going up against players that I can definitively say are smurfs. I would say that most of the problems for new people come from lack of knowledge. Knowing what abilities champions have and how they play are a HUGE part of the steep learning curve. Understanding the meta (and when/how to break it) is another important thing for new players. When I try a new champ in bot games, I almost always see a champ in a non-meta role or lane. \n\nHonestly, watching videos of people playing on youtube is the best way to learn the game, because you can take the time to analyze and understand the champions you see without the stress of being blown up or worrying about costing your team the win. No one is going far in ranked because they watched videos over actually playing, but they have personally helped me clear the learning curve and I can usually hold my own when I play duo with my gold-ranked friend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chessburger","date":"2015-01-05T22:17:56.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can see your points, it was different back when I started because everyone was a noob and smurfs were pretty much a rare occurence. But why in your right mind would you jump into ranked when you hit 30 with no actual gameplay experience. It took me over 500 normals to get a good grasp at what I was doing to the point I was confident enough to try ranked. And then I noticed most people in ranked are like you it only started getting half decent after 1500 elo (old and transparent system).\n\nI actually really enjoyed getting stomped by high elo people in normals because I always learned something. Up to the point where I could reliably play vs 2000+ elo people (D1+ by todays standards I think) and not get shit on. See it as an opportunity to learn, if you look past the emotional part of getting your ego shattered to sub atomic particles and start noticing what the experienced player was doing and what you were doing to allow what happened to happen.\n\nA friend of mine started playing and would play with us and always get platinum or higher enemies and got destroyed every game. Except she learned and got diamond on 2 different servers maining supports (both attempts ended in under 150 games). It took half a year for her to learn what it took me 2 years on my own.\n\nEdit: The real issue new players face is the IP prices. There's like 50 more champs than when I started, too many are 6300 and 4800 when the 6300 were rare back then and the staple was 3150. The IP gains are on average lower now than they were. There's less free IP boosts, there's no more RP compensations for server instability (WTF happened to Riot), and runes are still using this archaic system where a rune page costs the same as a champion and some rune sets cost way too much when they should just be relatively free. I know they're an IP sink but the IP gains are already incredibly small. I've been playing for nearly 5 years sometimes on and off, got almost 3000 hours into the game and currently own 9 rune pages, most of the runes you can imagine (I like experimenting) and am missing 36 champions which are mostly in the 4800-6300 price range. That in itself is the really ridiculous part and if I didn't already owned the champs and runes I do or got banned I would not touch this game with a 5m stick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joushi","date":"2015-01-06T01:21:29.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do/did you have a mentor?

I been playing since July 2013. Almost made it to Gold. Silver 1, and still learning. Almost 700 normal wins. At least you made it to Silver. That should be good enough for now. You should try doubling your normal wins so you can get more experience with the game before aiming for Gold. I would say about 400-500 normal wins before going for Gold unless have natural talent for the game or a very fast learner. Because trust me, the climb from the pit of Silver to high Silver, is utter crap. My duo rank partner, it took him longer to get out of Silver than what it's taking me. It took him 330+ ranked wins to get out of it. I'm almost out around 200 ranked wins. Had 61 points, needed 2 more wins for promos, but lost the next 2 instead. So taking a break.\n\nSo yeah. My advice is now that you're at least Silver, you should stick to normals for awhile and expand your pool of champions for each role and get the basics of them down. That's why I did to get out of the Silver pit. I didn't do rank in Season 4 for like....6 months. lol. So I didn't get out of Silver in time. I stopped cause I needed to use more champs than what I was using. So yeah. That's what you should work on now. =P It seems you like the support role. Thresh should be good for you, he's a god tier support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Easyyy","date":"2015-01-06T00:48:56.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I maybe played vs 2 or 3 smurfs that I can remember when I was 1-30.

Me being level 25 would just dragon my friends down slightly. Not enough that there should be a huge skill gap. But enough that I should be worried I'm facing a gold+ while they're closer to equal footing. \n\nFar as the last one. Jumping into ranked because you're 30 is only going to cause everyone problems. Being level 30 doesn't mean you know the game. There is a reason you have to have 16 champions for it. They expect you to build up your IP and experience of the game before then. The other problem is the image you are giving it and a lot of people give it. Ranked isn't normals. It's meant to play for the competition. Not just the fun. Some people find it more fun this way. \n\nI know Ranked doesn't hold that large of a % of the player base. But it is still a good chunk. And way too many of these players treat it as a normal game.

While I was okay with that, the other team had a level 9 Thresh and a **PLATINUM I** Vayne. The ONLY reason we won that match is because I got fed as Yasuo and could out-duel Vayne 80% of the time.
