If that date doesn't seem to work when filling out the form, just put something else for now and you can clear up the confusion once they respond to your ticket ^_^.\n\nAlso, friendly tip, try not to disclose any of your personal account information here on the boards as others could potentially see it and use that to get into your account!!","replies":[{"poster":"leesin only277","date":"2017-05-14T03:04:27.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHHH yes, that was very dumb of me.
