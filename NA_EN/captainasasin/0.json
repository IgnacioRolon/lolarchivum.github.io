Packet loss happens when your connection leaves your network and is essentially when part of that connection gets lost along the way or damaged somehow. \n\nLet's run a quick test to check for that before we go too much further by using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Grab some network logs from one of those laggy games and let the reader scan it. Grab a screenshot using something like Gyazo, and paste it here so that I can go over it with you!","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainAsasin","date":"2017-08-07T03:45:38.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply.

This means you experienced high ping during this game, which is likely where you were seeing issues. See below for a few recommendations to help out with this.\n\nYour average percentage of packet loss for this game was 3.93%.\n\nOverall, this means you had a high amount of packets lost during the game. This can be caused by various network issues, so please see below for a few common steps that can help reduce packet loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T04:38:16.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeeep I was afraid of that. Typically packet loss originates from outside of your own network along the route that your ISP is sending your connection. \n\nIt might be worth it to reach out to that ISP to make sure there aren't any current issues, but go ahead and reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with those network logs.
