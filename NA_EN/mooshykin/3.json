Even on the alpha client. I first noticed it on the alpha client but it even has done it on the regular client.  If I fix my settings and then go to play again the settings are reset each time on login. Is there anything I can do?","replies":[{"poster":"Mooshykin","date":"2016-11-11T03:09:52.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The video settings stay mostly the same but it kept resetting all of the hotkeys, colorblind mode, quick cast, and some options to do with the scoreboard and hud. Resolution and stuff doesn't change. I found a way to fix it temporarily I am not sure if had to do with server settings but I did this. I noticed the persisted settings file was always changing differently from the config file. After I edited my settings back in the game while the client was still launched I made the file read only just to see if it would still be overwritten when I logged back in. It was not overwritten for me after that. Even works on the alpha client. I know it probably is not suppose to be read only but it solved it from being replaced each time you exit the game and log back on for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T00:35:57.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What specific settings are resetting every time you relaunch the client?","replies":[]}]}
