I am having bad screen tearing near the towers and the home base, and sometimes when running the health bar just seems jittery and blurry. I put the same video card that was in my old pc into this one so I don't understand what could cause it. Vsync i still see tearing and have input lag. When I don't run it and just cap my frames to 60 the tearing is worse. Any higher than that its just really jittery. I don't have any other issues with my other games. I am running a quad core 3.2ghz, 8 gigs of ram, and a 2gig nvidia card gt 420 (not the greatest card but its to get me by for now). Any recommendations on what I could try?","replies":[{"poster":"Kythulhu","date":"2017-09-12T05:22:53.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old post but I was having the same problem, especially with the health bar stutter. For me the problem was worse the closer I was to base fountain or around other champions. So far this has been my solution and I'm able to run at a high FPS at very high settings.\n\nNvidia Control Panel:\n1. Set the preferred graphics processor as the NVIDIA processor for the **global settings**\n2.  turn V-Sync ON\n\nProgram Settings (Nvidia Control Panel):\n1. Use global settings for League\n\nIn game settings:\n1. Uncapped FPS\n2. turn OFF V-sync\n\nI read somewhere that sometimes the in game application wants to chose the NVIDIA card but clashes with the integrated graphics and it can make the game skip around (or both V-Syncs are clashing, tbh I can't remember). This has solved my bar stutter and small screen tearing. If it's still not working try turning off windows aero too. Hope it works for others!","replies":[{"poster":"bahbaha","date":"2017-12-14T20:44:43.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Kythulhu \nThank you. \nworked fine for me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mooshykin","date":"2016-11-30T21:49:22.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Toggling both actually helped a lot.
