Or at least they didn&#039;t when I Locked in the Chroma on Vayne&#039;s Dragon Slayer about an hour ago.  There was no way to choose the color I wanted.  Hopefully it will get fixed, seeing as though Riot disabled the new Select already to work out kinks.  I know a new system may have a few issues so I hope it all turns out well because I did like the idea with that new champ select.{{champion:67}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-14T22:44:45.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey EsKiM0,\n\nThis is a known issue and we're working to resolve it! ^-^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-01-14T22:21:33.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A friend of mine was playing with a skin he didn't even own nor could he buy right now as it's legacy.. so yeah I'd say the system has a couple skin issues in it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2016-01-14T22:21:01.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"chroma's can't be selected in the new champ select, it's a known issue","replies":[]}]}
