Aurelion is a raw force of creation and destruction. Zoe obviously possesses very powerful magic, but her power seems to lie more with traversing dimensions and other subtleties. Think of the ways that Bard and Sol relate, and Zoe is fairly similar.

No idea how this works for non-runeterra worlds) is capable of having a shot at fighting and winning against Sol(but can lose against him too), but Leona cannot as, while she is the aspect of the sun, she only has a fraction of the power.\n\nIf this is true, then Zoe, an aspect that can open a way into the universe without a host, would have all of her power. Which means she can fight Sol and have a chance at winning(though with all the stars flying about, I doubt it would be as easy for her to do so as she pretends).\n\nAnd don't forget, Sol is still shackled by Targon. So even if Zoe is close to his power level, but wouldn't have a chance to win in a fair fight... it isn't a fair fight. With the star crown that is his shackle, every action against Targon that Sol makes costs him dearly. It would be like a Matador fighting a bull. In bull fights, the bull is often weakened in some way(ranging from injuries to things to set off its balance and ability to react), just like how Sol's crown kills off one of his stars(which he refers to his hearts) when he acts against Targon.\n\nIf a full on aspect, not one of the hosts, could not take on a foe who stabbed themselves with every attack they brought against them, then that would be rather anti-climatic.\n\nAs for why they had to trick him, just listen to Zoe's Vo. Would you want to trust someone like that with an important mission if you could help it? I wouldn't. And as presumably all the other aspects have to work though hosts, they had no one who was strong enough(and reliable enough) to subdue the space dragon.\n\nTL;DR\n{{champion:136}} - Injured and shackled, does not have access  to his full power and kills part of himself every time he fights Targon.\n{{champion:89}}{{champion:131}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:44}} - Hosts of Aspects that have considerable power, but don't hold a candle to the full power of the Aspects that they host.\nZoe - Full on aspect that has the power to poke herself through dimensions, does not need a host and therefor has her full power.

I like her character and this different take on a \"Trickster\" archetype. But they made her a freakin god for no reason. She could have been like the other Aspects, had her own journey to the top of Mt Targon, and she could be ancient if they really want her to be, but she would start as human. But instead she sounds like some 12 year old made her up. \"Oh she's really young looking, but actually she's super old, the oldest champion in League! And she's as strong as Aurelion Sol, arguably the strongest champion. She's from Targon too, but she doesn't really care about that stuff! She's just too fun and quirky for that human stuff! Instead she just has a billion quotes for Ezreal and girls, and barely any other connection outside of that. Also she has uh, Fiddlesticks' key! And Bard's chime(you know, that other super powerful omnipotent being?). And the Moonstone Nami's entire character arc is based on! But she doesn't actually care about that stuff, she just likes that they're shiny!\" Doesn't it just sound stupid? All of that is, as far as I know, 100% accurate.\n\nI won't make it any secret that I vastly prefer more \"street level\" characters. I was really happy that this year they stuck mostly to that, with Xayah & Rakan, Kayn and, going a little further back, Camille being pretty grounded. Then they release Ornn, which while I like him, is another god...or sorry DEMIGOD character. I wouldn't mind so much if he hadn't caused Volibear's lore to also completely change. Volibear went from shamanistic, spiritual leader of his people, the Ursine, readying them for the war with the Watchers he saw in a vision, to...God of War? I assume he's still getting ready for that war but it just makes him feel a lot less cool. The Ursine are now just idiots who follow a warmongering demigod, which again, I feel cheapens the race, the character of Voli, and the world as a whole. \n\n\"But it's League of LEGENDS\" I keep hearing people say. But that's thing; it's LEGENDS, not \"League of Myths\". Legends can come in many forms, and some of the most compelling Legends can come from hearing about a regular old guy do some incredible things. Mordekaiser was just some human leader, but his ambition was so great that even DEATH couldn't stop his conquest. Yeah, he's pretty ancient and undead, but he started out as a man, and he's even more unbelievably sinister and awesome for it. Ivern was just some Freljord war leader, probably could have been a Champion in his own right, but this tree's magic made him see the world through new eyes and showed that even the most warmongering Freljordian can become a benevolent being for good. These are still LEGENDS about incredible people doing incredible things, some bad, some good, some neutral, but they are relatable and inspiring...like legends should be! And most importantly, entertaining.\n\nSorry, went off on a rant. I know some people will like Zoe BECAUSE she's a god, but I feel this character could have been improved by not making her stupidly OP and presumably she did nothing to earn this OPness.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-11-14T21:42:25.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mind overscaled powerful characters, actually I like them a loth especially when their \"god complex\" is justified (see old Xerath).\n\nI really want to like her lore too.
