I know two of her abilities are the same but don't know about the others.\n\nHer Q, E and R are the exact same. These are visible in the teaser trailer with their new VFX. I'd make a sure bet on Morg's current passive not surviving the update, I'd be very surprised if it did (innate sustain in a passive is extremely dated now, unless you're Nasus). Her W is the big question. \n\nAs it stands... That ability isn't bad nor unhealthy, although Riot MAY change it to something that interacts with the rest of her kit or a new passive. I'm happy with either. \n\nTo me at least, Morg has always been a champion that has three completely separate basic abilities that are good in their own right, yet no real interaction between them (outside Q guaranteeing more damage from W, or increasing the likelihood of her R proccing the stun, but any CC from any source accomplishes that). \n\nSo I wouldn't consider more interaction or another mechanic to be a bad thing, but not changing it would mean she'd exist as she is now, which I'm also content with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Forhonor321","date":"2019-02-18T19:55:17.170+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally would rather have her keep her helmet on, at least for her base skins and whatever other skins she does have with it.
