If you are punished by one of these systems, are you restricted from earning Hextech Loot and rewards until you've shown progress toward positive play.  This is different on a player-by-player and case-by-case basis, so there is no set time limit I can provide for when you'll be eligible again.  You can read more in-depth about it in our [Hextech Restrictions Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463).\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-06-06T22:00:39.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sure that this isn't the problem: I don't get the message about being restricted from extech anymore and I'm getting the Token reward.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-07T22:19:22.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and double-checked your account and it appears that you are still ineligible to earn keys or chests.

Is the reforming period \"composed\" of 2 parts?
