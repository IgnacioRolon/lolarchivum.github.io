When I am playing him, I will 99% of the time cast my E where I want to end up, and having the fly start immediately would make it a lot harder to judge where I can fly to unless I look at the indicator. Especially in late game, if I want to fly far to make a big Q, I don't want to misjudge where my fly will end because I could stop short and really mess things up{{champion:32}}\n\nThe removal of escape velocity seems kinda weird too but I guess that its more of a neutral change than a nerf or buff. \n\nI like the E only end of the fly, but to an extent. Usually I will end a fly (when ganking) by clicking an enemy champ to attack them. Is the fly not going to stop if I issue an attack command?

Idk what is going on with the internal testing on Aurelion, but I think a lot of his power is in engage/disengage capability paired with always being where the fight is via his E, and his win rates reflect that.\n\nI share starshapers feelings on that anyone who can jump him scores an easy kill.  What makes him so strong (especially in regular games vs. lcs or challenger level) is that ability to jump into a team fight, ult, and give your team a chance to jump in on the action.\n\nLike if Nami could teleport into lane and use her wave. \n\nP.S.

Maybe this is the intended counter play, but it's really frustating. If we are able to detonate Q instantly it would feel much better.

I just wanted to share my opinion on this: Aurelion Sol's pickrate is so low and his winrate is high only on people with 125+games on him, this means that what contributes to this guy's high winrate is the \"surprise factor\" and people still having to master the matchup.\nSol has clear strenght and weaknesses and that's what makes him balanced imo, his strenght is all about roaming and making plays across the map in the early game as he falls off pretty hard in the lategame (he's not at all a late game champ), and hitting that this hard will for sure make his winrate drop by a ton (and I'm barely at 52% ç_ç) whilst keeping his weaknesses intact.\nIn fact you CANNOT play and hope to win with Sol if u don't snowball HARD the game 'cause certain champions will always make u useless if the teams are close in gold value (Yasuo, Fizz, Kassadin) and we would be left with a champion with little strenghts as he wouldnt be able to shove as good anymore AND he really does little with that late-game dmg buff.\nFurthermore, if people realize the strategy behind Sol and counteracts to it (jungler lv2-3 gank while he's shoving at first, counterroams, picks on his roaming, counterpicks, efficient ward placement) his winrate could see a decreasy as its not like his teamfighting/skirmishing is as good as many other mages (or champions in general). I think you could try to wait for this changes until next patch and see how his winrate goes (after all this should be the worlds patch); I love Sol but just when I became decent with him my winrate got hit hard by counterpicks and unlucky throws as u cannot solo carry with this champ, u NEED your team (and there are several replays of pro Sol's  having tons of killd and assists with crazy high kill partecipation but still losing.\nSol does not deals tons of dmg but he is always useful to the team, nerfing his dmg more will basically make him a suppor-like midlanert, and that feels bad on a celestial dragon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2016-09-09T01:58:20.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ohh I'm liking the change to E that looks good since it will make him less clunky","replies":[]},{"poster":"Albuquerque","date":"2016-09-10T15:46:51.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"At first I really didn't like the sound of these changes, but upon further inspection I think these changes aren't too bad. It looks like its just trying to slightly nerf his early game wave clear.\n\nHere, I did some math.\n\nLet's say the {{champion:136}} in this situation has 300 AP total\n\nCurrent damage:\n\n\tPassive: 97+50 = 147 base damage (max W rank) + 35% AP (105) = 252 total damage\n\nNew     damage:\n\n\tPassive: 130+25 = 155 base damage (max W rank) + 35% AP (105) = 260 total damage\n\nSo it actually is a buff! I feel much better figuring this out. So it's a 25 damage nerf in the early game, but mid-to-late it's a very tiny buff. He'll still perform just fine, and if you're good with him and play smart till then you can take advantage of the very tiny buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2016-09-09T02:22:17.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"same problem as taliyah\nclears waves too fast and roams to other lanes within 5 seconds with his ms he gets from e\nthese are deserved early game nerfs \nthey are keeping his late the same i guess which is fine but his early is definitely too oppressive","replies":[{"poster":"Holybambeirut","date":"2016-09-17T19:13:53.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His lategame is not that good btw.\nYes if you get ignored u will eventually deal a lot of dmg, but usually what u do is slow and CC and let others do the dmg and to do that u must expose yourself and be killed quite easily .\nHis early is the only stage of the game where he's STRONG. (and its not like he's omnipresent or omnipotent, if he shoves he uses mana withouth which he cannot fight, and they're capitalizing on this weakness increasing the mana cost AND lowering the dmg, so it's a double nerf that will completly cripple his early from the point of no return.
