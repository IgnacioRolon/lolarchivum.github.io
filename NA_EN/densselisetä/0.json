In the case of game crashes server-side, everyone gets booted and nobody is able to rejoin because the game no longer exists. If you were able to requeue for another match, then this is definitely what happened. \n\nOn the flip side, it may have just been a weird hiccup in your network that disconnected you from our servers as well as Discords. In that case, you may want to adjust some settings following this [**network settings guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and test it out in a practice match.","replies":[{"poster":"DensseliSetä","date":"2017-12-06T09:32:37.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be right.","replies":[]}]}]}
