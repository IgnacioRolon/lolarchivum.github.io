This is my favorite way to blow off some steam. Or if I'm angry and feeling spiteful Riot has pretty much offered the perfect platform for people like me.\n\nI join a ranked game and immediately in Champion Select I make sure they all know I'm going to feed and troll them. This gets them riled up big time. The best part is though, that they can't leave! Yep, Riot has all these nice systems in place that actually force people to get trolled and grieved or else suffer penalties like LP loss or leaverbuster. It's perfect!\n\nEnough about that though. When the game starts I buy some boots and just feed each lane and their jungler once. Then I'll go to whichever lane I choose and soak EXP and feed some more. By this time my team is REALLY upset. Sometimes they even leave when they don't want to sit through my trolling for 20-40 minutes but that's okay, I'm sure they'll think of me when they queue up again and get a nice low priority queue. One of the funniest things that happens is sometimes they will get so upset, and since I'm not saying anything in chat (to avoid getting any sort of punishment by Riot's great automated system) they actually turn on EACH OTHER. And by the end of the game they are all reporting each other. And me of course but I have never been punished because I don't say mean things in chat that trigger their automated system. \n\nSo I just wanted to thank you Riot and Lyte. You are a troll's greatest ally. Forcing people to suffer my wrath or face punishment and smiting those who express their frustration when I've pushed their nerves to the limits.","replies":[{"poster":"HEAljvLykd","date":"2015-09-09T22:07:21.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like someone got rekt.","replies":[{"poster":"Wade Funk","date":"2015-09-09T22:08:55.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No I'm legit serious.
