Sometimes that can happen if you've got an unstable connection with wifi or just some kind of interference. \n\nTry switching to an ethernet connection if at all possible, if not go some general troubleshooting like adjusting your DNS server settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 in your network settings. If you aren't sure how to do that, check for those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[]}]}
