Normal vs. Ranked.) \r\n\r\nSo after having said this I feel that this should be fixed because it does not make a bit of sense to have these dodges shared with ranked matches.\r\n\r\nThoughts everyone?","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-10-19T05:42:22.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no someone in my game is trolling, god forbid I dodge to prevent myself the stress of a 30 min troll game.
