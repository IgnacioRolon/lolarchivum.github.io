No sounds or any image came through for 2 minutes. It was on PBE so I thought \"ok, so maybe it works on the normal NA server\"  but then it still didn't work, and it counted me as dodging the game and gave me punishments for that. Someone please help me with it, I can't even play practice tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T20:31:48.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"These issues and black screen are super common with connection issues struggling to reach our services.
