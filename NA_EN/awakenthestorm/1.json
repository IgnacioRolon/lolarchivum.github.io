I understand the need for it, I don't want to decline games or leave them but sometimes I'm forced to. For example, League sometimes glitches and I don't see the \"accept\" or \"decline\" button to get into Champ select, I get 20 mins LPQ for not accepting. Sometimes I don't see it after I wait 20 minutes, and I have to wait another 20. Sometimes my connection cuts off and I can't join back into the game if I was in one, I get 20 mins LPQ. I just think it's unfair that I have to sit through 20 mins for unintentionally leaving/declining matches.\n\nAlso, I have been trying to make an account for my friend for a while now but it always says \"signup failed.\" I double checked everything, the password meets the requirements, they're the same, has one letter and number, etc. I agreed to the Terms of Uses. I'm not a robot. Username isn't taken. I don't know what could be causing this but it might be what I saw before; they don't support NA users or something like that.\n\nIt'd be nice for some help, thanks. This is an amazing game, I love playing it, it's just these problems that make me a little angry.","replies":[{"poster":"dampIips","date":"2017-03-14T09:38:39.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understandable nothing is perfect but i can say personally i care more about quality, and therefor maybe put less efforts into the appearance of things and more into the speed and receptivity of the connections.

If I type in any character, then choose not to use one of the characters that pop up, but cant exit out or go back to my character select, from the characters i have. Now I have to wait 30 minutes because of a default. ...and on another side note, do not \"sex people\" play a game you want to quit as soon as it starts. Think about what you are doing in life, not game reality, but the other one. \"SEX PEOPLE!\" P.S. \"sex people is the word FUCK, or FUCKING, since riot games does not like cussing. Fuck you guys, programmers who cant think of the obvious things, instead spend their time and money on effects or other b.s. objective qualities. Idiots, ironic the game is abbreviated lol cause I certainly laugh about some of the technical difficulties forgotten and ignored through the years! ...there are others, but this is my night. One game in and two technical defaults.

If they need to recover the account at a later date, it could be a lot harder for them if they didn't make it themselves. Is there a reason why you want to make an account for your friend or why they cannot make their own account?\n\nAs for your issue accepting matches, it sounds like your connection to the server could be unstable, which would prevent the queue notifications from coming up or disconnecting you from champ select. I strongly suggest taking a look at the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a starting point in resolving this for good.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
