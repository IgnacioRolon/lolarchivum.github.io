Just generally in life unexpected things happen regularly.  But if you require me to guess what unexpected thing happened, it's hard for me to do anything about it.  \n\nAnd was it really unexpected by you, or only by me?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-01T16:29:32.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that error messaging can be pretty ridiculous sometimes, but I appreciate the wit put towards that.  It is kind of a dark mystery, and while messaging has improved over the years it could certainly be better.  When exactly was this happening to you, though?  Was it during champion select?  Toss me some more context of your specific issue, I'd be happy to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Xomee","date":"2017-11-04T15:33:33.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue, and the most I can tell you is that it's happening after being afk for a while or coming out of spectator mode. You try to create a lobby and this message pops up. Relogging fixes it but still irritating to relog every time I spectate someone. :<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mysticfire678","date":"2017-11-06T02:35:37.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Xomee said, this is my exact experience. If the client has been idle for a few hours I have to relog or I get the error.","replies":[]}]}
