My first 5* was altera and not from doing the account resets people did. She is an interesting character after having a friend tell me the lore. \n\nWish I had that luck when scathach or whatever her name was not long ago the lancer woman.

I didn't even know account resets existed so I didn't do one :( Its ok though I managed to get 2 SR in my first roll when I joined... although both are assassin class...\n\nI feel like I am so lucky with this game hahahah I got her on my first 10 summon try. I will send some luck your way~~~ Waver is really strong though! Like I've read so many articles and they all recommend him bc he is a great support. OMG I'm so sad for you!! You deserved Scathach!! They need to step up the lancer class. All the rest of mine are also 3 star haha\n\nYes!! I will go add you right now!
