Each time, a text box shows up saying \"unable to connect to the network server please check your connection and attempt to reconnect to the game ingame.\" I was trying to play two games yesterday and both would not connect. This problem has shown up before but I was able to fix this by changing my primary DNS settings from automatic to 8.8.8.8 &amp; 8.8.4.4 for primary and secondary respectively.\r\n\r\nI have combed the \"Troubleshooting your internet connection\" guide and have done everything there. My connection is wired, there are no proxy servers and the list goes on. I have all of my ports set in order. \r\n\r\nI ran the Hextech Repair Tool and looked into the ping test logs. It indicates that 4 packets were sent out, however none were received meaning that I had 100% packet loss. My primary intuition was that my router was blocking some of my connections, but that turned up nothing. I then went onto my internet anti-virus (Kaspersky Total Security 2017) and checked some firewall information there, no Riot programs were blocked and all packets were being allowed through. My Windows firewall is turned off. At one point, I even went through the process of turning every singe firewall and computer security system off and tried to connect to custom game, but that worked to no avail. I came to the conclusion that it cannot be any of my firewalls.\r\n\r\nThe interesting bit of information is that I am able to download games on Steam and use a variety of other internet related software. I chose to go and attempt to play one custom game today. My custom game managed to load and everything was working fine in game. So my two games that I played yesterday would not load, but my custom game would. I have played the two games yesterday and the one custom game today around the same time so I know that my ISP is not blocking anything at this instance of time. I did not want to start playing a PVP game in lieu of not wanting to ruin someone else's game and receiving a LeaverBuster penalty.\r\n\r\nI searched through the boards and tried what everyone else has tried but none of those processes worked. Any help that I can get would be appreciated. Thanks for the time spent in reading this extremely long post.....","replies":[{"poster":"sahauran00","date":"2017-03-26T05:15:39.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I managed to get the issue solved via creating a support ticket with Riot. The part that helped me was disabling IPv6 on my network adapter, however the whole reponse is:\n> Hey there Summoner, Rufio here from the Tech Team. Thanks for reaching out to us and sending those logs! I've got a lot of steps for you to go through, so take all the time you need. No rush at all. I want you to stick to custom games while we do some troubleshooting, so you don't get with any dodge or Leaverbuster penalties.\n\n>I noticed a few processes running that could be causing issues for you. To make sure that you do not have any unwanted programs running, follow these steps on this guide to perform a clean boot. Fire up LoL while in the clean boot, and test out a custom game. Let me know if you see any improvement there.\n\n>I recommend switching from a private DNS to Google's public DNS. Don't forget to flush the DNS after you've changed it, and then reboot your computer to finalize the changes. I've attached a quick image guide from my end on what you should hopefully be seeing when properly changing your DNS.\n\n>I also noticed Windows is using 2 sets of DNS addresses, IPv6 and IPv4. We need to make sure that the IPv4 ones are being used. After you're done changing your DNS addresses for IPv4 (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4), head back to the adapter properties window. In the list of checkboxes, I'd like you to uncheck the IPv6 checkbox, and then hit OK. I've uploaded a pic for reference to help you along.\n\n>Let's be thorough, and also do a power cycle of your router and modem:\n\n>1) Shut down all computers connected to your home network (modem/router/gateway).\n2) Power down/unplug your router, if you use one.\n3) Power down/unplug your modem. Have both devices off for at least 60 seconds.\nNote: If your modem has a battery backup you will need to take the battery out for 60 seconds or use the reset button on the modem.\n4) Turn on your modem and allow it to completely boot up. Wait until the indicator lights on the device stop blinking and display a steady green connection.\n5) Turn on the router (if you have one) and allow to completely boot up as well.\n6) Start the computers and allow it to completely boot up and re-establish an internet connection.\n\n>If you're still having trouble connecting to the post-game lobby, I've linked to an app called the Hextech Repair Tool that has a few repair functions of its own, and also gathers some logs for me to look through:\n\n>Download the HRT here.\nInstall the HRT.\nNavigate to the install folder: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Hextech Repair Tool\\\nIMPORTANT: Run the HRT by right clicking the Hextech Repair Tool executable and selecting 'Run as administrator'\nMake sure the checkbox next to Gather System & LoL Logs is checked.\nPress Start.\nWait for the tests to run and attach the LoL Logs.zip file to your response. These should be on your desktop after the test.\n\n>I'd also like to investigate how your connection is routed to our server. In order to do so, I'll need you to download a WinMTR application, which will run a diagnostic test. Please run this while using your normal connection.\n\n>To run a traceroute or ping on a domain using WinMTR:\n\n>Unpack WinMTR.\nIn the Host field, type in each IP, one at a time:\n192.64.170.252\n104.160.131.1\n\n>Push Start and wait.\nRun it for about 7 minutes for each IP and export it as a text and send me the 2 text files.
