Towers can in no way keep you safe from three people after this point unless they are all fairly squishy, short-range champions with low mobility, which in the meta nowadays is nearly impossible to find. It is generally always better to take the balanced teamfight where you have a chance of coming out on top as a team, even if you yourself are killed. \n\nThe most important thing however is to make sure you have good ward coverage and map awareness to prevent bad positioning in the first place.","replies":[]}]}
