However, if we say you have to play fewer games with Annie because her kit is easy to learn; that negates my biggest issue with people taking champs they've never played before into Ranked. The matchups. \n\nI don't care how easy a champ is, if you never faced a Cassiopeia main, a Kassadin Main, or and LeBlanc main, you're going to get stomped. â€‹Until you've faced those matchups a few times and understand Annie's Kit relative to your opponent kit.\n\nWhich is why I advocated above Silver, the minimum should be less, because I assume that these players have faced these champs at some point in their climb.\n\nIt's why I think that Champ Level is better. The less you win with the champ, the longer it will take you to get to Level 4, forcing you to play the champ more, forcing you to face not only Meta Matchups, but the off-meta. \n\nSo in Norms I play a crap ton of Teemo. I'm fairly comfy vs. his normal matchups (I'm not saying I win them, but I at least understand what I'm up against and the options available to me like Counter Builds and Rune Setups). I struggle mightily with off-meta matchups. \n\nHowever, if you say you are only required to play one game if  N champ us considered easy, you only have to play 1 game? To me it means they are completely clueless with the new champ. True, worse if the Champ is mechanically hard. I'm apt to say if you decide to buy Riven and want tot play her ranked?

Experience against other champions comes with time, but it is a lot less dependent on the player's champions. For example; you can learn how to play against Xerath while playing Annie, and you don't forget how Xerath works if you then play other mages against him such as Lux or Twisted Fate.\n\nEven in Silver and Gold, players will get into matchups against champions they have never played against. This is a separate situation and should not reflect on the player's experience with their specific champion.\n\nChampions such as Riven that require more skill to use effectively should - of course - require more games. I agree with you on that. But it is impractical to expect someone to stop playing ranked for 5+ games in order to gain enough points on a champion in order to select them in ranked.\n\nTrust me, I've been down this road many times before.

I'd rather they not change it if the requirement was 1 game played. \n\nIt's the whole reason Champ lvl makes a lot of sense to me.

Nobody will go along with it. Even the more moderate people such as myself who agree with the principle, will not stand up for, \"require champion lvl 4 or 5 before allowing it to be played in ranked.\"\n\nYou've got to learn more about negotiations.
