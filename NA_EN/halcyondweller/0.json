Maybe hear one or two things about the important characters like Swain or Jarvan but no more than that. Mainly because it could affect the main lore of the LoL and people who will never play this new game would ignore those things.\n\nSo, im more of the kind of people who would be more interested in exploring the world, maybe just a single region or continent.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-02-06T00:43:25.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I understand where you are coming from with that. I too would like to explore regions. Champions could potentially serve as inspiration for stories but I certainly don't think that they should simply be included as much as possible.
