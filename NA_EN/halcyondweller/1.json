Please stop and listen to what I am saying. If Riot is going to listen to feedback it needs to listen to ALL feedback, even the negative. This is a serious problem with corporate culture and it is extremely unhealthy not only for employees but for companies as well. Negative feedback is perhaps more valuable than positive feedback. Because of Y is possibly the most valuable of all feedback, people usually are not spurred into writing feedback unless they either have free time on their hands (end of call/generated survey/polling samples) or because they are displeased with something. Here we have a case of the extreme latter, and with good reason. There are serious issues with the game, over the last several years they have only gotten worse. And now Riot is effectively saying they don't care if the game is so bad it makes you angry, they only want to hear from you if you have something nice to say. Many of the playerbase lack the rational or self control to productively make that healthy conversation, that in no way means that they lack a point or that their opinion is not important.

As mentioned *several* times? And, I&#x27;m sorry, but I&#x27;m going to argue that it isn&#x27;t feedback. It&#x27;s just some pissed off player who isn&#x27;t getting things their way, and not realizing that Riot has an entire *world* to appeal to.\n> \n\nFeedback from other sources is additional feedback, it does not replace feedback from another source. And even if a post is \"riot sucks... ***because of X***\" it is still feedback. Period.\n\n> The whole point of an argument is to convince the other side that your view is right. How on Earth do you expect to do that with nothing but incoherent rage?\n> \n\nNo one said it has to be an argument. The point is not the rage, the point is the message behind the rage. They are unhappy for a reason, that reason is what is important and is what is being overlooked.\n\n> I&#x27;m sorry, but......what? This makes no sense. I mean, I can&#x27;t even explain why it makes no sense, because it is that confusing. You are saying that all feedback will be and goes ignored, because some of it *is* ignored. See how little sense this makes?\n> \n\nI'm not sure how it doesn't make sense to you, in fact I am having trouble reading what you wrote. That's not at all what I am saying, I am saying that Riot claims that it listens to our feedback, but in fact doesn't. If they are unwilling to listen to negative feedback, they can't claim they listen to all feedback, they need to revise their position as listening to only positive feedback. There is an important difference there.\n\n> Except it isn&#x27;t their job. Every time a Rioter posts something on whatever social media platform, it is coming out of their own time. They are not paid to come onto the Boards and answer questions, they do it because they *want* to. Anything that is &quot;official&quot; (by how you are stating it) comes from Ask Riot, Dev Blogs, or anything that comes from official League of Legends profiles. Everything else is not &quot;official&quot;.\n> \n\nAgain, your missing the important distinction that needs to be made. There is a difference between \"Fearless\" commenting on something and \"Riot Fearless\" commenting on something. There is also a difference in Fearless not wanting to read something, and \"Riot Fearless\" refusing to comment on something that he is supposed to address. You completely missed the point.\n\nThe issue is not \"Fearless\" ignoring a bm thread, the issue is Riot not reading a feedback thread because it is negative and may hurt Fearless feelings.\n\n> And who&#x27;s to say it doesn&#x27;t? Someone else can say the *exact same thing*, but in a far more constructive and professional manner, and it will easily get noticed. This happens pretty much all the time: you have 1 thread bashing Riot left and right, making no real argument at all, but then just a few threads down, you have someone who actually thought something up, and made a very good point. The problem *here* isn&#x27;t Riot, but how the Boards work. Which thread do you think will get more upvotes? The quick and easy &quot;RITO SUKS!!1!&quot;, or the well thought out essay?\n\nHow it is said is not the issue, we realize being toxic isn't productive. We all know there are better ways to express themselves. The issue is that effectively Riot is saying they don't listen to negative feedback if it is toxic, but toxic or not it is still feedback that is then being ignored. It's not a matter of someone else may say it better, it is a matter of one person is heard and the other is not. It is censorship plain and simple, and it is a serious issue, especially if Riot wants to remain claiming that they listen to feedback. If Riot wants to claim that, then they need to listen to ALL feedback, not just the feedback that they find easy to hear.\n\nAs long as there is a point to their feedback, there is a voice that should be heard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-01-19T08:17:30.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any idea why you would get such population on a Riot platform instead of on reedit / twitter?\n\nI would think that the ratios of positive:rude people would be around the same regardless of what platform you use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-01-19T13:50:41.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have to go to page 5 of the reddit sub before you see a post talking about balance.

I can't say for sure if that's what you meant, but that's how it reads.\n\n*Please understand* that I am not some head-up-my-ass random here trying to bitch about everything.

But are you saying that you and others (you may not know if that's true) read some of the boards but when a discussion of frustration is brought up (almost always negative threads) that you then avoid reading it? I am hoping that's not true as frustration with champions and feedback on whats frustrating the playerbase was what was wanted for feedback just a few seasons ago. As has been pointed out positive topics are not usually meant for feedback regarding what is posted in the gameplay section (the issue that many have with lack of responses and acknowledgement/reasoning for feedback there). \n\nI feel we are at another ball and gravity generator point in leagues lifespan. When Riot decides to apply more proactive approach to the community they will increase the gravity but applying too much (lots of communication but not on discussions on feedback/unstructured communication) or too late (after change is permanent) will cause the ball (satisfaction with the game) to not be as high or the lack of applying a change will cause the ball to lose height slowly but steadily or rapidly based on the surface (opposing games) in which it hits (is compared too).","replies":[{"poster":"DarkKatalyst","date":"2018-01-19T02:47:33.579+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all depends on how the frustration is worded. Many threads I see are worded as attacks against various decisions or Rioters. When a poster says, \"This game is shit now,\" \"League is dying,\" \"Why are the devs never listening,\" \"RioterXYZ is ruining the game,\" they're being hyperbolic and you already know what sort of atmosphere will be in that post. How can Rioters respond to statements like that? And it's not one occasional post, it's multiple ones every single day. No one wants to deal with the hyperbolic negativity of hundreds of players.\n\nIt doesn't help that angry people are attracted to flashy negative titles like the statements I mentioned. People have the wrong impression that being more and more aggressive will get them their way and make things better. There's no patience, no sympathy for the lengths of time and work it takes for game development.\n\nRiot runs a game, not a country. If they mess something up, or aren't being vocal 24/7 about things, it's not a big deal. But some people treat the development of League as if their lives depend on it. That's not healthy, for the player or Rioters. The only time it's too late to fix something is when players decide it's too late. People need to give Riot breathing space and time.\n\nIf posters on the Boards want to repair their relationships with Rioters, they need to downvote the tactless posts, and upvote the constructive ones. Otherwise, you will see less and less interaction from Riot. It's not their fault they don't want to endure endless taunts, threats, negativity, and hyperbolic exasperations.
