The problem is, most of these runes ONLY stack when you get kills.\n\nWhy don&#039;t the stacking runes work off of tower kills, or epic monster kills?\n\nI understand CS not being a good stat to allow them to stack, because that would encourage uninteractive laning, but at the very least give people some equal motivation so that towers and epic monsters are weighed at least a little bit against kills!\n\n_Edit: Somebody brought up the example of Eyeball collector. This does stack with ward kills, but it's not exactly accessible to everyone like the kill stacking ones are. Kill stacking runes are present in multiple rune trees, while the ward related ones are only present in Domination._","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-25T18:18:14.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean this rewards interactive gameplay and taking risks. you can easily just get a stack by getting a kill yourself on the target that is trying to kill you right.

It's mainly because games with TDM modes usually flaunt a players KDA somewhere on their profile and because that's apparently an online status symbol people would rather pad their KDA than win in most FPS games. \n\nThen there's league, which exploded with popularity, bringing in that crowd. Yes Riot and other sites display KDA, with most agreeing that 3.0 is good, but focusing only on kills doesn't win games in LoL. Which is why Riot tried to make kills less impactful once upon a time, less FB gold, more global tower gold, the first dragon update, etc. But people complainted that objectives were too important and games became 40 minute farm simulators so Riot slowly attempted to push league into a \"hey, fight\" playstyle which brings us to the current meta.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-07-25T19:55:32.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say that the current meta isn't much better in terms of fun, slow games were certainly frustrating, but now we've swung full circle to having games decided way too early and people being forced to fight even when they're behind.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-07-25T18:02:33.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has always wanted to make kills important and relevant because they want LoL to be fun and exciting rather than pure strategy being totally dominant.
