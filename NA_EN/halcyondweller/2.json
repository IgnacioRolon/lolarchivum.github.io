Once upon a time I was a hyper frustrated player on these forums, but a empathetic & listening Rioter tuned in one day and made a world of difference. Last week I was reading through some board posts and realized there wasn't that voice now a days. Hence me posting a crap ton :). \n\nIm not perfect, and will mis-speak. But if I can help I'm here. Even if it means people yelling at me, but they feel like they are heard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-06-12T18:31:58.607+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that makes lots of sense!
