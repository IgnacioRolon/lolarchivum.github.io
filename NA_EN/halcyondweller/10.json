More often than not, I see people who throw around the &quot;safe space&quot; and &quot;snowflake&quot; rhetoric acting like they are victims of some kind of passive system. It just doesn&#039;t make sense to me, if you think league is a &quot;safe space&quot; then what pray tell is the opposite that you so desperately seem to strive for?\n\nLeague is a game, and it&#039;s there for people to have fun. For ALL people to have fun, not just for flamers with no self-control. So if having fun for these people means attempting to ruin others&#039; fun by making them feel miserable then I don&#039;t see why that should be allowed.\n\n---\n\n_Edit: I need to clarify something because people seem to think I'm arguing about whether or not Riot is making league a safe space.

This is ridiculous, and the people who say this are usually just clinging to excuses to avoid questioning themselves or admitting that maybe they went a little too far with their behavior._\n\n**_I'm all for having a discussion about how the punishment system needs improvement.

They cannot be expected to always have the self-control and self-awareness necessary to simply mute someone who flames them. Everyone is human, they're at varying levels of development and varying levels of emotional control. You can't expect them to bear 100% of the burden of self-control and argue that flamers shouldn't also be held responsible too.\n\ntldr; the problem is twofold, and the responsibility for it is shared.

Obviously the physical act of muting someone is easier than most things, but when you take into consideration the self-control required it's a more even issue. Both the flamer and the flamee that gets offended are equally responsible for their failure to control themselves and for allowing their egos to take the wheel.\n\nWhen I see people complain about flamers here I almost always advocate that they should (or should have) mute(d) the person who offended them. But that's still a hop, skip and a jump from claiming that the flamer wasn't responsible for their own loss of self-control.\n\n> Anyways, \n> \n> Freedom for all is what I strive for.

However a lot of people misuse it to wrong others. When I was in gradeschool, a particular kid would often retaliate to things. he would escalate and escalate the situation, even when he couldn't see that he was the one who started it. \"I'm just applying retribution\" he'd say, when in reality the other person was the one who was taking retribution for what he had done. One day he pissed off the wrong girl in class and she wasn't having any of his shit, he took \"retribution\" one time too many and she stabbed him in the hand with a pencil.\n\ntldr; people use freedom as an excuse to act as judge, jury, and executioner on others whom they think have wronged them. It only leads to trouble. Both kids in my story were in the wrong, but it wouldn't have been an issue at all if the boy hadn't had a tendency to always see himself in the right and always think he could and should take retribution against perceived wrongs.\n\n> The punishment system is not fun for all.

Only the &quot;righteous&quot; people have fun.\n> \n> Now we understand why the &quot;righteous&quot; people are so against freedom. The punishment system is fun and benefits the &quot;righteous&quot; people.\n\nAs someone who thinks of himself as righteous, I disagree. I don't like or agree with the current punishment system, it has flaws, and it's methods are outdated, clunky, and excessive. That said, the behaviors that it punishes for, are for the most part worth punishing. People need to learn to not do those things, because they make the game worse for both themselves and others.\n\n1. I think Riot should revamp the punishment system to give more leeway to the punished. But I won't go in-depth on that here because it's off topic for the thread.\n\n2. I think that Riot should do more to teach others alternatives to flaming. Because there are lots of better ways to get what you want out of teammates, but people just don't know how or they take shit too personally and then try to seek retribution against their teammate when really that's just counterproductive to what they really want in the end, which is just a fun game where everyone plays their best and tries to win.","replies":[{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-05-29T21:09:11.648+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":15,"body":"> responsible for their own loss of self-control.\n\nIt's not Riots or the communities responsibility to punish loss of self-control.

Some people even have had accounts since season 1 and are still getting banned. Hell, EVEN Imaqtpie got a chat restriction and everyone loves him. I don't really see anyone touching on the main issue of concern here and that's money. People buy RP everyday and it makes Riot even richer. Then they start banning accounts like crazy and next thing you know people make new accounts and buy more RP. Can't you see the scheme? Riot wants more money.\n\nI remember back in Season 3. I got a shitload of chat restrictions before I even got a two week ban. And then I started getting more two week bans until they eventually decided I was a lost cause and perma banned my account. Then like a year later they actually unbanned my account.\n\nNow it's, 3 times you're in trouble straight away a 2 week ban. Then the system just looks for any reason to perma ban you.

People tend to have a set way of doing things, a set way of how they want things done, and little room to be able to have an open and fair conversation about it. Said another way, people tend to lash out at things that are unfamiliar and different, and blame it if everything doesn't go there way. Despite how we try to teach our children against it, it becomes a societal norm. The only way to combat that is to find someone having a bad day and blaming everyone else, give them a hug, and give them a cookie. First we have to calm them down, then we have to let them know that it isn't so bad, and you are willing to give something of yours to them to let them know that you are someone willing to do this for them.\n\nThat goes the same with playing. I often encounter players who are downright mean to me, but I approach it with the attitude that I would want to be given. Great job when they get the kill, excellent teamwork when they get the turret, and letting them know that its ok to die in game and that we'll get to the end together. Calm, cool, collected, you can influence a player who is having a bad game and beginning to tilt into someone that is willing to listen to you for the better, without directly trying to, thus affecting the game in a positive direction.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-05-29T22:49:26.827+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with everything else you said but I just want to highlight this one thing that is especially awesome:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ı Sona ı,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4N6LVtXe,comment-id=000b00000000,timestamp=2018-05-29T22:38:43.155+0000)\n>\n> The only way to combat that is to find someone having a bad day and blaming everyone else, give them a hug, and give them a cookie.

Why ? Because there is a functioning mute system and a report system if they immediately went too far. So let people go out of their way to say what they want so long as it isn't hate speech.  It really doesn't matter because just like they have the right to say what they want I have the right to mute them and keep playing my game while minding my own. EASY DAY. \n\nSo the current system caters to willing victims and makes the game cater to the \"Safe Space\" idea which from a maximum playerbase standpoint is a sound business strategy. Yet it does cater to the \"Safe Space\" still when there are already tools at any player's disposal to prevent them from being affected by someone else's communicated bullcrap.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-05-30T02:04:42.430+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":">They LITERALLY CHOOSE that.\n\nThat's not how emotions work.

I know this might be hard for an SJW to understand but sometimes this is just banter intended to be funny. \n\nThis goes both ways you're expecting the \"flamer\" to conform to your cultural norms. While refusing to conform to their cultural norms. The difference though you want the \"flamer\" banned, while the \"flamer\" just wants you to hit a button that takes 2 seconds. \n\nThere is also the self defense angle that gets ignored which is if someone trying to punch me(flames me first) and i dodge the punch and put him in a headlock(flame him in response) the SJW types still think i should be \"chat restricted/banned\" ","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-06-02T02:32:48.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">I know this might be hard for an SJW to understand by sometimes this is just banter intended to be funny.\n\nI'm going to stop you right there.
