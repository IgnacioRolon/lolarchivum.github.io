I&#039;m not going to advocate for or against nerfs. This is just to discuss why certain things are or are not problems.\r\n\r\nFirst lets talk about his kit:\r\n\r\nI want to propose that what makes him powerful and what makes him un-fun to play against are separate things. Him being powerful _does_ make him more frustrating, but not any more than any other character being powerful would make them frustrating.\r\n\r\nYasuo has an overloaded kit. He has two passives, and two abilities that are spamable. Now this isn&#039;t inherently the problem, as there are other champions with overloaded kits that are not as widely hated. But it does contribute to people&#039;s frustrations with him.\r\n\r\nI think that the most frustrating thing about Yasuo is that his Wind Wall takes agency away from enemies; there is something inherently frustrating about being negated that is so different from simply being out-played. Instead of playing around the opposing ultimate, it erases it and takes away the &#039;cool moment&#039; that player could have had by using their ultimate. On top of that it isn&#039;t at nearly as much of a cost to him as it can be to them. A number of ultimate abilities with much longer cooldowns than Wind Wall are projectiles that can be unmade by it.\r\n\r\nHis dash used to be a big problem, such as it&#039;s stacking damage allowing Yasuo to lvl 1 cheese his opponents, but that has been nerfed. It takes practice for Yasuo to learn how to get the most out of using his dashes, just as it takes practice to learn how to predict and play around it. That said, it is still very frustrating to play against if you can&#039;t predict it and end up missing all of your skillshots. The fact that this skill requires practice to learn how to predict may be part of the reason he is so much more of a problem in lower levels of ranked play, because those of us that are in that level of play may not have as much time to practice or learn how to play around it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow on to behavior and expectations:\r\n\r\nI propose that Yasuo has a higher skill floor than people expect. Everybody has at some point seen a godlike Yasuo player dominating a game. IT doesn&#039;t look hard, and he&#039;s got a lot of up-front power that we expect should help him stomp games. I think that leads to people just starting out with him to expect to do well (obviously this is a mistake, but it is one that a lot of people make nonetheless). What results is a situation where the player can do poorly -&gt; not understand why -&gt; start looking for other reasons for the game going poorly. This isn&#039;t a problem that is unique to Yasuo, it is prevalent throughout this game and makes up a majority of the toxicity we see in game.\r\n\r\nThe other reason I think Yasuo is so hated in this community is actually confirmation bias. We are more likely to remember negative experiences than neutral ones. It used to be a survival trait from humanity&#039;s early days, something we did so that we wouldn&#039;t eat poisonous plants or go near dangerous animals a second time. After many many Yasuo games, even if they are equal parts good and bad, we are more likely to remember the toxic, selfish and childish players than the mature ones who did their job and played carefully.\r\n\r\nI think that the combination of his kit&#039;s expected power, the frustrating parts of his kit, and common toxicity and confirmation bias cause a larger than average amount of hatred for the champion and his playerbase in this community.","replies":[{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2017-04-16T23:04:31.904+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"agency\" is the key word word.

I find it the easiest when I'm with {{champion:122}}  or {{champion:92}} , where if he is close to me he is the one in trouble, and I can zone him from my minions so he can't dash.\n\n\nSomething that I want to see is his E having an ammo system, something like 3/4/5/6/7, recharges every 6 sec and refills in base (not necessary this numbers, I  want a low number early and definitely not infinite uses at max rank), I think this would solve a part of his frustration, and wouldn't hurt as much good yasuo players as they usually dash only when necessary and look for good angles to reach their target faster, but would solve the frustrating cases like after trading and running back with half hp you see your own minion wave coming and you feel like \"you little traitorous bastards\" as they seem like they come to aid yasuo, not you.\nMy goal with these changes is having yasuo care about how often he uses his dashes and give the opponent a chance to leave yasuo immobile if he makes him use all his dashes (or yasuo wastes them).\n\n\nI also like one of your ideas in having his W a health bar, but instead of being like yorick's W, that bar would show how many hits can block and be consumed if it blocks something big (and maybe not having its hp decrease the 1st 0.5 sec to reward good yasuo players for the right timing), as I find his W be the most annoying in teamfights, and it feels the worst when your ability got blocked by accident when he W to block something a few seconds ago, and all this time also making adc useless.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-04-18T02:23:07.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

I think his Windwall is actually the least frustrating thing about Yasuo.  Now Windwall was the initial thing that brought Yasuo hate. It had the full level of frustrating that you'd expect, but in the present it isn't difficult to play around.\n\nNow I propose that almost every other part of Yasuo's kit has something that makes that spell more frustrating to play against than Windwall. Let's start with his passive. His shield is basically a \"you don't get to poke during laning phase.\" As a character that excells with an all-in playstyle having his passive counter a playstyle that is strong against his playstyle is inherently frustrating, and the fact that it is only half of his passive makes it twice as frustrating.\n\nOn the topic of his passive, there is the other half of it. Yasuo get's free crit chance, that is inherently frustrating. \"But there's a drawback.\" you say? Well there is a drawback that is almost entirely removed with one item that is core to any crit based build. My proposition is that IE should interact with Yasuo's passive differently than it does with basic crit in a similar way that they made IE interact with Ashe's passive.\n\nNow for his Q. It's a spamable spell on a manaless champion that gets extra utility when used in succession and a larger hitbox when used with another spell. Did I mention it can be used for animation cancelling making Yasuo do a lot more damage than otherwise?\n\nI proposed his W isn't annoying and am still on that.\n\nNow for his E. It's a spamable movement spell. Not only that but it has the Kha'zix and Tristana effect in that after being used aggresively it can also be used to escape, but unlike Kha and Trist who have to get a kill Yasuo doesn't have risk attached to it, at least in laning phase.\n\nNow for his Ult. The only major thing I propose is annoying about it is that if he uses it on you under turret the turret won't target him until the end of it allowing him to pretty freely turret dive. \"It's not like he has to hit you with something to ult you. Hur Sarcasm.\" Yeah he has to hit you with something he can get on a moment's notice and doesn't take and resource.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-04-18T02:35:47.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a good fix for the Q would be to make it an auto-attack reset, thus allowing him to use it after auto-attacks, but then putting his auto-attack on cooldown, instead of allowing him to weave auto-attacks in between casts.\n\nI agree that the dash is too low-risk for the reward he gets from it.\n\nBut I disagree with you about the passive shield and about Wind Wall.\n\nThe shield is only partially broken, and I think it counters melee champions instead of poke champions. For poke champions, auto-attacks or low cooldown poke spells are enough to burn off the shield before laying down some real damage. I think that it hurts melees a lot more, since they can't poke it off him before he engages on them, basically giving him free damage prevention in trades with them.\n\nThe Wind Wall is frustrating because it takes away from opposing players' glory moments. Now that in itself might not be such a big deal except that then the ability has so many ways it is frustrating; it lasts forever (in terms of a teamfight), it can block ultimate abilities with much longer cooldowns than Wind Wall, costing Yasuo very little while costing the opponent so much, and it can erase abilities even if they barely touch the edge of it - making abilities that look like they should have got around it just vanish.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cryo00","date":"2017-04-17T07:54:29.472+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"It also doesn't help that he has one of the most toxic player base out of all the champions.","replies":[{"poster":"An Enemy Sutando","date":"2017-04-17T18:52:58.886+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it just me, or are the people that hate on Yasuo players more toxic than the actual Yasuo players? \n\nhttps://media.tenor.co/images/4b7399689d7c8d618b7ea21bcec6be6d/tenor.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2017-04-17T15:50:30.470+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be perfectly honest, I've seen WAY more toxic Yasuo haters than the fabled toxic Yasuo main.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2017-04-17T04:03:11.321+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"i hate yas because of wind wall. 1 wind wall cast gives yas enough time to kill anyone whos kit the wind wall negates being most adc's and mages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LemurMonster","date":"2017-04-18T09:42:01.343+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because f**k that windwall.

There are a number of things I've thought of that might help deal with the problems I've outlined in the post above, so I'll list them out here (I'm not advocating for all of these, just raising the possibilities for others to consider).\n\n* Make it so that it doesn't block 100% of an ability, maybe just make it so it halves the damage and cc of it.\n* Make its cooldown go up if it absorbs a much longer cooldown ability.\n* Give it a health bar like how Reworked Yorick's wall works.\n* Make it absorb abilities up to a point (like its HP bar) and then disappear, but grant him a shield equal to some % of the effects or damage absorbed.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-04-17T14:18:28.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you nerf the Windwall, which is a huge portion of Yasuo's power budget, he'd have to get some pretty serious compensation buffs in return to keep the change power-neutral.

The first makes it into a strictly worse braum shield, the second is bad for everyone since pretty well no one can figure out when it would be off CD again and it's not like it comes up more than once per fight, and the latter two would make the windwall pop pretty much instantly during endgame fights and in the face of certain abilities. \n\nAbility duration and width are good tuning levers if you feel like eschewing cooldown as a possibility.

Mid lane, with mages that are unable to stay away from him and their own minions, without unWindWall-able CC, it's a simple matter of Q, E+Q, Windwall, E+thirdQ+auto+R on the Yasuo's part, and that's a Flash blown or a kill. Against those who can, it's a skill match up, but being able to do that just feels bullshit. And it makes you think you can do that with everyone, which makes it feel bullshit when you pull off your ult and then lose the duel afterwards.\n\nChampions who Yas can outtrade toplane and don't have the capacity to stick to him are also fucked.
