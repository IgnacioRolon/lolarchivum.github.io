I have changed my stance to the following:\n\nPlayers exhibiting the behavior described below should be subject to immediate chat restriction (possibly across all of their existing accounts) and some sort of notification or reform card. This is not too harsh, and it also would clear any doubt they had as to the system's ability to track and punish them.\n\n> Original Post:\n\n&quot;I don&#039;t care if you report me, I have # other accounts.&quot;\n\nSeriously, this is the most tilting thing to hear from a teammate ever. They take the system and spit it in your face with such contempt. On top of that it usually accompanies a whole host of other toxic behavior which they were already told to stop.\n\nThey&#039;re clearly being extremely shitty humans; they clearly don&#039;t intend to reform, and they clearly don&#039;t care about the impact they are having on their fellow teammates. This deserves a zero tolerance policy. Any player who says this should instantly lose their account, and maybe even get put on a watch list for identifying alt accounts to watch more closely for toxic behavior.\n\n> EDIT:\n\nIt's clear from people's responses that I didn't clarify well, and I came off sounding very extreme. So here's a better explanation of what I mean here:\n\n I specifically am talking aout players who are already being unsportsmanlike, toxic, and hurtful to others. When they respond with,\n\n\"haha I don't care Riot's punishment system doesn't apply to me and you can't do anything to stop me!\"\n\nThat is the sort of situation I am talking about.\n\nThe player is already being toxic, already exhibiting behavior deemed unacceptable by Riot and the community. It's taking it one step further and holding the system in contempt that I believe is the final kicker. That is what I believe to be a fair reason to permaban.\n\nIt's not just the act of saying that that I believe should be the reason to permaban. It is the act of saying that in addition to already being toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-06-12T16:05:46.621+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":26,"body":"I personally don't think Riot should allow players to have more than 2 accounts per IP address (1 main account, and one smurf to play with less skilled friends if necessary), but they don't really have a way to control smurfing at the moment.

The problem is that there are ways around that. It would be very difficult for Riot to track individual machines. One idea that I've had for this is if Riot implemented a Unique ID for each game client, something that would not change if the IP address or other methods of tracking were successfully avoided. It could be hidden somewhere within the game files. Similar to how every legal gun in the US is made with a unique barrel design to scratch it's own unique identifying pattern into any bullet fired with it.\n\n> Your way of saying is &quot;we cannot punish these jerks as somebody might be using same computer&quot;.

Heck, they could even have the account put on low priotity queue starting at 10 mins for that. There are ways to deal with this kind of thing and it probably should be delt with as well but you have to keep a level head about these kinda thing. \n\nGoing foward with this stance you have to take into consideration the various situations that actually could occour. For example if you were to continue with the insta-ban goal and it comes to fruitation there could be situations were RIOT gets into hot water for banning someone who says they have multiple account _just_ to piss someone off or act tough at the threat of a report and then they go public with this and they can't prove they do. \n\nBut anywho your thinking about this more level headedly so I'll leave you to your quest.\n\nGood day, sir.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-06-13T03:48:41.725+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's that I smell?

This deserves a zero tolerance policy. Any player who says this should instantly lose their account, and maybe even get put on a watch list for identifying alt accounts to watch more closely for toxic behavior.\n\nThe biggest issue is, most of the time this behavior starts because of the other player's teammates. Do you want examples? Here:\n\n* [Player] picks Singed ADC or some other questionable champion for X role. Player does nothing wrong, team starts flaming him automatically because of his champion selection.\n* [Player] is having a bad game, or is on a losing streak. He's trying his best, however for his team it's simply not good enough. They accuse him of feeding the entire game and keep saying they're going to report him when he's doing absolutely nothing wrong. \n* [Player] is building \"the wrong items\", farming the Jungle because he's behind, not grouping, or a host of other things his team doesn't like. None of what he's doing is wrong or report-able however his team is making fun of him and giving him a hard time because they don't approve of the way he plays.\n\nYour team is your worst enemy in League of Legends, the mute button is your best friend.\nVery few players cause problems without someone being unjustly rude to them.\n\nInstead of making flame posts like this one, how about you examine yourself because that's the best way to avoid these situations from happening in the future. I've never played one single game in 5 years where someone on my team has began behavior like this where myself or someone on my team wasn't the root cause of the problem. Sure you can't control another player, but you have the power to mute the conversation if it's giving you that big of a headache.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-06-13T17:31:48.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I wasn't clear enough in my initial post.

What caused this player to reach this level of hostility? He surely didn't light himself on fire (so to speak) and without something to feed his flame.. he wouldn't continue the behavior. Someone else on his team is instigating and causing him to keep being hostile, it doesn't matter what you say to a player who is in this mode.. you should simply say nothing to them. Once someone is \"tilted\", \"sparked\", \"on fire\", the best method to prevent further issues is to simply pretend anything they said isn't there and don't aim anything at all towards them (not even a \"Nice\" or \"GJ\", nothing).\n\nI understand fully your logic that things being said like this are unacceptable and should be punished, but often there's a lot that leads up to something like this being said that cannot be overlooked. Players do not just start off like this and it IS possible for a player to clean himself up and get themselves into a better mindset after being so heavily disturbed.\n\nMany times I've said things I don't mean while playing this game, I've been chat restricted a couple times. Does that make me a bad person? No, not really. In fact I'm probably one of the nicest people you'll ever meet in real life. This game is very competitive, it's hard, it's frustrating to do your best and still struggle against another player who is better than you. It's not easy to control your emotions dealing with the amount of stress League induces when you are really trying your hardest and still losing. People say things they don't mean, their behavior gets out of check.\n\nNone of it means they deserve a permanent ban the instant they believe they're above the system. Once someone gets chat restricted or temporary banned they'll soon realize that they are not any better than anyone else and that they have things they can lose as well. That's the entire point of having the system, is to make players realize that they need to adjust their behavior because they're out of line.\n\nYou wouldn't call the police on your child simply because he told you that he hates you and hopes you die, the League system is set up to be no different. The system isn't going to permanently  ban someone just because they're agitated, ignorant, and begin saying things which they really don't mean. Not everyone will learn and adjust, but a lot of players likely will and it wouldn't be fair for those players to get permanently banned the first time they slip up and say something stupid like this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"radetari","date":"2017-06-13T16:34:55.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats why i learned not to be toxic and say sorry when im feeding as yasuo or any other champ, sometimes u just meet better palyers, an sometimes its just not your day","replies":[{"poster":"radetari","date":"2017-06-13T16:37:40.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"instead of **** you say lol or something idk, be friendly, this relates to normals more than ranked, in ranked its somewhat justified to flame, cuz u wanna win and climb up ( in bronze its a nightmare), but in normals u just play to grind for ip, and with new missions comming out, maybe even get free skins or gemstones","replies":[{"poster":"bloodybadger1","date":"2017-06-14T01:54:37.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agree with your first comment, but i don't believe its ever justified to flame","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"korg023","date":"2017-06-12T19:27:15.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Why?
