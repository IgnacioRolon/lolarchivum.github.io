It would not hurt normal or intended gameplay to make the CDR from every item unique to the item (so that having 2 of the item won&#039;t give twice the amount of CDR). And it is entirely unfair for champions to be able to build tons of tanky stats while still retaining high damage output.\n\n\n\nThis is a case of players optimizing the fun out of the game. They found an unintended exploit in the mechanics of the game, and they are doing gamebreaking stuff with it like being able to assassinate opponents while still being near-impossible to kill. Stacking the same item repeatedly is not compelling gameplay. And I highly doubt it was an intended effect when you introduced the Transcendence rune.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2017-11-15T19:14:09.774+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-11-15T19:35:16.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Then it seems like a trap, and something that should be fixed so that players do not fall into the trap.\n\nWhat fringe cases?

While it's true that the main goal of the excess CDR conversion was stated as an attempt to validify fringe builds like when a support tries to grab a lot of active items and breaks the cap, I'm sure if early playtests had shown Cleaver stacking to be obviously way out of line, then we'd have seen something like making the CDR unique already. Maybe they're wrong, but there's at least a CHANCE that these builds are functional without being game breaking. Maybe it feels super strong in a game where your opponents don't have any good BotRK users to shred your high health low resistance booty?\n\nRe: stacking same items feeling bad - I get that seeing the same icon side-by-side-by-side LOOKS repetitive and having lots of the same stats FEELS less diverse or interesting, but instead of looking at it in the game theory abstract, try looking at it though a League of Legends item build specific lens.\nMost upgraded items have unique abilities that take up enough of their power budget that stacking them is bad, and almost all builds are collections of unique items. It's very easy to kneejerk when this system has trained us to see multiple pairs of boots or whatever, something in your LoL player brain screams \"something's wrong, same items bad!\"\n\nIf some of these builds are actually viable, then they're ironically unique compared to the usual collections of unique items.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-11-16T05:36:35.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that makes sense.
