Is it poor design to have the 3-hit passive of Denting Blows effect taking up an entire ability slot? Why or why not?\r\n\r\n2. Is her ultimate unfair and too badly lacking in counterplay? if so, should it be changed? And lastly, if it were changed, what possibly could replace it to still deliver on her theme and gameplay fantasy?\r\n\r\nI'd like to reiterate that I like Vi as she is, and I'm not necessarily in favor of changing her. Simply expressing my confusion and doubts as I discover that my ideals clash with her kit design. What are your thoughts on the matter?","replies":[{"poster":"Mens Hair Club","date":"2017-09-13T00:36:17.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Is it poor design to have the 3-hit passive of Denting Blows effect taking up an entire ability slot?

Pre 6 she has a Q that does great damage and if it lands it will probably take a good chunk of enemy health.\n\nAfter 6 she has an ultimate to use when engaging and q saved for the cc or when the enemy flash. I used to remember Vi running from the enemy turret by like flashing first and using ulti. I couldnt even see her until she flashed close enough for her to ulti. That was the horrible days really. Usually it is free kill for Vi's team everytime she ulti on midlane apc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-09-13T00:14:55.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Not only that, but Vi's ult has such a substantial CD that it would take **AGES** to actually proc the rune and lower that CD substantially enough to matter.\n\nAs great as that lowered cooldown would be, I suspect Vi's probably going to want something that more directly impacts her jungling and/or how effectively she can dive, as opposed to how *often* she can do so.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-09-13T16:12:34.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for contributing!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AFilthyCaitMain","date":"2017-09-13T01:20:34.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it definetly wont break Vi.

Yeah, if it were change I'd like it to still be something really big and cool. The animation and sound effects are cool, but the effect is kind of lackluster, like you've stated.\n\n> The 3 hit mechanic is something Rito has talked about in game play, pretty sure it was Ghostcrawler.

So it is pretty balanced.\n\nI apologize, I was unclear. I'm not opposed to 3-hit passives. I'm just generally opposed to them taking up an ability slot instead of being part of a champion's inherrent passive.\n\nI play mages and assassins usually because I enjoy having a variety of different abilities to cast and more choices as to which ability to use in a given circumstance. Champions like Vayne waste an entire ability slot on this, leaving them with less options and actions that they can take besides auto-attacking.\n\nExamples of good ways to use 3-hit passives: Old Xin Zhao made up for it by having the active of the ability grant attack speed. Tahm Kench is another example, the 3-hit passive interacts with the rest of his kit, but he still has 3 basic abilities to choose between when deciding what to do.\n\nAnd now that I think about it Vi partially makes up for this by her E being on an ammo system. But now I wonder if it should maybe be switched with her passive to give her an active ability that offers her a shield. Thematically speaking there is a lot of cool potential there.\n\n> Also Vi is one of the seven champion that still has a resist reduction mechanic. Used to be eight but RIP Xin Zhao.\n\nHuh, that's a fun fact if I ever saw one.
