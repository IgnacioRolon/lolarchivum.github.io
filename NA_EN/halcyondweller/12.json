It would not automatically result in punishment, instead it should be combined with other tracking techniques such as matching heat-maps and champion-pools in order to build up a case surrounding the accounts on that connection. That said I do understand the issue of multiple users on the same machine or connection, as shown in my comment: \"How should this be handled to prevent mistaken punishments against internet cafes, gaming lounges or college dorms where a user could bring down punishment on other users nearby?\"\n\n2. Should be simple enough to hide multiple files and encrypt them all, just to make it harder to tell which to figure out. Also keeping the encryption keys and algorithms on the server and only working with the file there would prevent the user from decrypting it. Then whenever the game patches (or at random times if Riot wants to really enforce it) the client could upload the file back to the server for decryption. If the file were messed with then it can be reasonably assumed that the user modified the file. Additionally a new file encrypted differently could be downloaded to replace it in order to ensure that the user could never decrypt it.\n\n3. Trace Route would be able to track the machine through its connection route, even different computers will still have to use the same network, so if a user has similar heat-maps, champion pools, and other factors tracked by Riot then Riot may be able to verify if it is the same user on a different machine.\n\nI'm not saying the proposed system is foolproof. But I do think that it is reasonably believable / reliable for the purpose of flagging potential accounts to watch out for.","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-10-20T19:13:03.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't get me wrong, I'm all about keeping the perma banned assholes as far away as possible.
