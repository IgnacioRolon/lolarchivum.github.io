AFAIK, they never finished their contracts with ATT/Verizon/Cox and I was wondering if they have any updates on that? They said it was going to be done in a few weeks and well, it's been two months. \r\n\r\n> weâ€™re currently in talks with Cox, AT&amp;T, and Verizon, and expect to have inked and implemented peering deals with all three within the next couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nCan we have an update on this? If they already did, can someone link me and we can just ignore this thread. Anything would be great, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-11-04T18:58:49.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lasterus!\n\nI know this is a super late reply to your question, but I wanted to let you know that we updated the [Chicago Server Move Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204246204-NA-Server-Roadmap) earlier today and AT&T, Verizon, and Cox all have updates.\n\nWe want to give updates as soon as we are able to, but I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to call us out on some updates!
