The problem mostly lies in having low HP all the time - Eve and Hecarim lose quite a bit of health clearing, while Naut's clear takes ages, resulting in him losing a lot of HP unless he gets a super strong leash. Naut's ganks are still strong as fuck - you can't go wrong with 4 CCs in one kit - but he just doesn't have the HP to gank very often.\n\nI also find it rather amusing that you claim Naut doesn't have much pre-6 CC when he has more than 90% of other champions in the game.

Chilling smite mostly makes it so that when you actually do have the HP to gank as a jungler it's more likely to net you a kill or assist. Basically, in the current season compared to previous seasons, most junglers have traded frequency of ganks for more reliable ganks due to chilling smite.

Hitting him twice with E is a problem because their is a brief delay between when you can hit, and only a short distance a laner has to go for safety.\n\nVi's knockback works as a gap closer as well and is much better then Lee Sin's gank.

Excellent and sustain are not the same thing, yes he can clear the jungler slowly but healthy, but so can most junglers that upgrade the machete, WW deals single target damage, and weak early damage, he clears slowly. I know this, He was my number 1 pick in Season 4, he doesn't clear fast, he can't counter jungle, he can't gank pre 6, and thanks to his gutting, his Ult is on a 2 minute cooldown with less base damage, making him incredibly shitty at ganking now. He remains invalid because he IS still an old champion that never really fits the meta properly. \n\n> Not necessarily, because Chilling smite's range allowed you to smite them, and allow you to catch up in the event it was a champion such as Leblanc, Ahri, Zed, character's who are capable of blinking through walls.\nYes, Hecarim can do an over the wall gank, but he requires his ult to pull it off and this does not work very well against high mobility champs.\nParticularly in bottom lane where you must deal with champions with mobility such as Kallista, or high CC supports such as Leona.\n\n> Chilling smite gave him another tool to keep up with the likes of Lee SIn, and whether you wish to admit or not, its still a nerf\n\nI never said it wasn't a nerf, I am basically saying people are morons who think junglers weren't doing fine with ganks before the item even existed, I also said in order to gank as hecarim you get up close to them anyway putting you in range of it. Ahri can't blink through walls. Just wait for Zed to waste his W, Le Blanc is Le Blanc. Kalista is bullshit.\n\nYour not really stating large compelling reasons you nitpicking little bits to help justify it, 150 range is miniscule, and no one would have noticed if they didn't put it in the patch notes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2015-02-15T20:55:00.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelyn can damage gank.
