Rot Portal.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"An apostrophe, though mostly used to indicate ownership or form a conjunction in English,  also can denote a glottal stop, usually when transliterating from another language that makes use of them into English text. A glottal stop is generally a consonant is pronounced absent any vowel sound. When you say &quot;Z. Z. Rot&quot; like you say Z. Z. Top, you&#039;re actually not pronouncing the letters, you&#039;re naming them. A Z doesn&#039;t actually have a long E sound when it&#039;s used in a word. It&#039;s inconsistent to spell out two letters of a word and then pronounce the rest of it normally, but that&#039;s what you&#039;re doing when you say Z. Z. Rot.\r\n\r\nTL:DR It&#039;s something like zrot, or zuhrot. Either works. Zuhrot is probably a decent Anglicization, so go with that. Just stop spelling it like a bunch of old bearded men are going to come out of it and play a song.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2018-08-02T05:41:45.127+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy... does NOT get laid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-08-02T04:46:13.275+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who cares.
