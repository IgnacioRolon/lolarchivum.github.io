When I start a game my ping is normal. Then I start another game and my ping is double what it was the first game. If I play another game my ping maintains doubled. If I play a 4th game my ping usually goes down to the normal ping. And if I play a 5th game my normal ping gets doubled again.\r\n\r\nHas this happened to anyone? Does anyone know how can I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Boss Apple Sauce","date":"2015-10-28T16:11:20.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your computer specs?
