I couldn't remember my Password so I tried to have it reset. Well it says it sent an email with a link.. Ect ect but I never get the email. I started a ticket trying to get help and followed the recovery steps. But Apparently I didn't remember enough about my account to validate that I am the actual owner. I have pretty much all the emails confirming my Riot Points purchases. How is that not enough? Can someone Please please assist me? I spend a lot of money on that account and I really enjoy playing this game. Thanks in advance ( Ps This is just a alt account so I can Post. )","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T22:45:22.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We take account recoveries seriously, and want to be sure that it's being restored to the owner.  If the information provided wasn't sufficient, all I can advise is to try again.  As you mentioned already having a ticket open, keep communications open with the specialist and they will help out as much as they can.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
