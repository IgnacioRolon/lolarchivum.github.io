A good deal of people responded, and some of those people disagreed, saying I just &quot;hate enchanters&quot;...which CAN&#039;T BE FURTHER from the truth, or I &quot;wrongly think that skill shots are the only form of skill expression&quot;. This is a post designed to straighten all this out.\r\n\r\nWhen I say &quot;Enchanters have no counter-play/variance&quot;, I&#039;m not necessarily saying &quot;There&#039;s no feasible answer to dealing with enchanters.&quot; I&#039;m saying &quot;When an enchanter does a thing, there is no *real* counter-action for that thing outside of waiting until it goes away or bashing your face through it.&quot; Let&#039;s take a few examples:\r\nFirst up...Lulu\r\n\r\n{{champion:117}} \r\n\r\n- Can&#039;t do shit about her passive...obviously.\r\n\r\n- Q can be dodged. More on this later.\r\n\r\n- W on allies is a buff, so you can&#039;t do crap about it. W on enemies is a targeted polymorph, so you can&#039;t do much about that besides &quot;Wait until it goes away&quot;.\r\n\r\n- E is a shield. Can&#039;t do shit about that besides &quot;Break the shield&quot; or &quot;Don&#039;t do shit until it goes away&quot;. E on enemies is a targeted, damaging placement change for Pix, which then moves Q so it basically comes from either Lulu or *right on top of that enemy,* thus making it so they can&#039;t dodge Q, either.\r\n\r\n- R is another ally buff. Can&#039;t do shit about it besides &quot;Wait it out&quot; or &quot;Kill them through the buff&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a champ that has very *little* variance in their kit. If I click W on an enemy, there&#039;s no missing here. If I click R on an ally, there&#039;s no &quot;partial success case&quot; or &quot;failure case&quot;. Anything Lulu chooses to do, save her Glitterlance, gets full value the second you use it. There&#039;s nothing to play around. No timers, no skill shots, no &quot;low points&quot;, no *nothing.* You could very well put Sona in this space and it&#039;d add up to the same thing.\r\n\r\nNext up...Janna\r\n\r\n{{champion:40}} \r\n\r\n- Can&#039;t do shit about the passive. Fair enough.\r\n\r\n- Q is a skill shot. Can be missed. Can be dodged.\r\n\r\n- W is a targeted, damaging slow. She slows down in movement speed afterwards.\r\n\r\n- E is a targeted shield on allies. Can&#039;t do much here.\r\n\r\n- R is an aoe knockback from herself that heals allies.\r\n\r\nNow, this kit actually has more variance than Lulu&#039;s, objectively speaking. In *practice,* however, some of that goodwill goes out the window. The thing is that Janna&#039;s VERY reactive as a champion. This means that much of what she does is going to be after enemies do a thing, right? So if I&#039;m diving someone with a champ like Kled, and Janna comes up and shields in reaction, I can&#039;t play around that shield, so we eat through it. Then she presses her W. Can&#039;t play around that, so we wade through the slow. Then she&#039;s pressing R...still can&#039;t play around an instant, massive, aoe knock back that heals allies inside of it. So we&#039;re starting to see the issue that, although Janna isn&#039;t necessarily *as* bad as Lulu on paper, in practice, once again, only Q has any feasible amount of variance to it, and Q&#039;s more of a side thing than a defining part of her play. Soraka is also defined by this &quot;paper =/= practice&quot; sort of issue.\r\n\r\nLastly, let&#039;s look at Nami\r\n\r\n{{champion:267}} \r\n\r\n- Insert bullet for passive here.\r\n\r\n- Q&#039;s an aoe suspension that can be dodged.\r\n\r\n- W is targeted, but you can move its landing position so it doesn&#039;t bounce back to her team.\r\n\r\n- E is a buff for damage + slows on AAs. Can&#039;t do shit about it.\r\n\r\n- R is an aoe, slow moving knock-up with a slow after it.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a more modern, proper enchanter kit for today&#039;s times. Not EVERYTHING here is skill shots. Not EVERYTHING is targeted. There&#039;s a strong mix of reliable moves and moves with strong payout for landing, given their variance. You could fit Taric&#039;s kit here...even though he&#039;s mainly a Warden with enchanter bits, and it&#039;d basically add up to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s the point being made here. Problem enchanters have an issue where the only feasible counter-play is &quot;kill them&quot;, rather than &quot;do a thing to get around that thing&quot;. I&#039;m not saying every enchanter has to have skill shots on every button. I&#039;m saying that you can&#039;t have a kit be functional and healthy in today&#039;s LoL when it&#039;s so heavily set on reactive, guaranteed output. There needs to be some shit to play around *when you&#039;re alive.*","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-09-05T21:05:09.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You can wait out the shield, you can wait for Lulu to use her W or E offensively before going in...\n\nHow is 'wait it out' not acceptable counterplay? \n\nI don't try to fight a Jax,  Trundle, or Illaoi with ult up. Same with Lulu; if she blows ult, back out if you don't think you can eat through the extra health.\n\nAnd 'Sona always gets full use out of her abilities' is just plain wrong. So much of their benefit is tied to the auras that positioning is crucial. You don't get full benefit out of her W if you don't shield anyone; it's very mana inefficient healing and can't be targetted.

For Nami's E, you can wait out the E before trading so you don't take bonus damage from enemy AAs and get slowed. For OTHER parts of her kit, you can *actually dodge them.*\n\nIn Lulu's case, you wait out the E, then the R, then the W. Like, *what?* So Lulu's \"counter-play\" is to \"wait it out\" **on almost her entire kit?** Not to mention that, with cdr, that shield's up time is gonna be massive by mid to late game.\n\nAs for Sona, due to the cdr aspect of her ult, Sona's up-time has been drastically improved. By the time she's finished Ardent/Athene's/Oasis/Tear, basically anything that anyone brings up about these weak \"positioning counter-points\" is thrown out the window. Riot's mini-rework made Sona significantly dumber to play. You just stack items and scale into a team fighting monster.

Once you reach a certain skill level she just becomes worse than other options like Nami who actually scales up with your skill.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-09-06T15:57:12.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's a part of it, yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-09-05T21:51:25.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If Lulu is staggering her spells, then she's going to be significantly weaker, and if she's not staggering her spells, then she's got a fairly large window of vulnerability.

Yeah, that shield has a way too long duration, but her ult is an ult. Plus, if she uses her W offensively, she can&#x27;t use it defensively. \n\nYou're looking at this the wrong way: Lulu is a *defensive champion.* In team fights, she isn't using her W on offense. She's using it to stuff someone else's offense.\n\nIf I'm a smart support player, and I identify the enemies on the opposing team that are actively diving my adc/apc of interest, I know *exactly* how to react when they get in my range as Lulu...or whichever. Thing is, for THAT GUY, that guy has no answer to my initial interaction with him. If I E my ally, it's full value. If I ult them, full value. W the enemy? Full value. This is why it's obnoxious when Lulu's strong. There's nothing to work with. She does her thing and you die by it.\n\nMeanwhile, for Nami, if I see her in range, I can attempt to dodge her bubble. I can attempt to dodge her ult. I can't do much about her W and E, but there's key parts of her interaction with me that I can work with, hopefully to my advantage. That's the difference.\n \n> Sona&#x27;s mini-rework made her significantly harder to play, what? \n\nNo it didn't. It made her simpler. Slightly weaker early, but straight up ridiculous in shield power later. Only thing that truly ropes her in is mana, but if you buy a tear, that's not a problem, either.\n\nRiot specifically said in those patch notes that they were looking to solve Sona's game play issues by just making her spam more. This was influenced by the fact that a lot of people were spamming the Rioter responsible for the mini-rework with \"I want Sona to play like URF\" comments. We ended up with this rework. Made her objectively...about the same as before, but when enchanter itemization started getting worked with, she started becoming better until we got what we currently have.\n\n> The only thing that really changed was that the permanent auras were changed into non-permanent auras with significantly smaller range.\n\n...wrong rework. The *mini-rework,* not the game play update. I wasn't here for her original kit.\n\n> Buying Ardent&#x27;s/Athene&#x27;s/Oasis/Tear does nothing to change the fact that if she doesn&#x27;t get a shield off on at least one other person, it&#x27;s a mana inefficient spell. \n\nA mana inefficient cast of a spell with basically no consequence due to her ever decreasing cds and her ever increasing mana pool.\n \n> (and pre-emptively going &#x27;the pro&#x27;s dont count!&#x27; is a really shitty way to deny criticism, you know.)\n\nThat was just in case you threw it in there.

If you gave those guys a catcher ability like Nami they'd be busted.\n\nHaving said that Riot is looking into the interactive-enchanter type with Bard and Rakan and it's pretty successful, so it can work, it just seems very hard to pull of, and I have to point out people generally build those two as tank or AP supports so it's not a linear comparisson.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-09-05T21:38:24.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"- Bard and Rakan are catchers.
