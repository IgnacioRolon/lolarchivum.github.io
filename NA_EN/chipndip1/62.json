They'd say that marksmen would use \"burst per second\" to out-burst and out-dps assassins, so assassins couldn't do their jobs of killing marksmen.\n\nNow we're going BACK to bps'ing assassins because it \"feels better\". Not even because crit is ACTUALLY weak (Sivir and Xayah, and Lucian building RFC + IE as 3rd and 4th items shows that crit was still useful as a mid/late game option when you're playing League and not solo queue'ing), but just because it \"feels bad\".

Marksmen are all stat sticks. They're either on or off. There's no \"fair\" middle ground with marksmen because if they don't clean up fights and push lanes and scale more efficiently than everyone else, they failed the one thing they're on ~~the team~~ every team in the game for. Whichever marksman is good enough to meet that end the best is the good one, and the rest are the bad ones. If you HONESTLY think that Riot's going to find a middle ground between marksmen power levels in the game and everyone else's **while also** making it so marksmen feel good to play, you're mistaken...horribly.\n\nCalling it here and now: This shit ain't it, chief.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-12-22T20:24:31.497+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xMcEEgQf,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-12-22T20:14:29.261+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s there so marksmen don&#x27;t &quot;burst per second&quot; everyone in the game.
