Targon's Brace is 9.4 gold per 10 seconds, if used on the most valuable minions. This is pre-20 minutes, after which it jumps to 12.2 per 10 until 35 minutes, and 18.7 per 10 at 35 minutes.\n\nSpellthief's Edge is 24 every 30 seconds, up to 45 per 30 seconds with Frostfang.\n\nAncient Coin is hard to calculate, as I'm not sure of the exact rate of coins dropping. That said, it's 25 gold per coin for the Ancient Coin, and 40 gold for Nomad's.\n\n----------------------------\n\nOf the base items, assuming optimal play and 90 second intervals (to account for a single siege minion somewhere in the wave), Spellthief's is 72/90, Relic Shield is 67.5/90, and Ancient Coin is at minimum 25/90. My guess is that in three waves you've gotten between 1 and 2 other gold coins, so Ancient Coin is likely at 50/90 or 75/90, meaning that on average its 62.5/90 for gold generation.\n\nIn ideal play, Ancient Coin seems like a gamble between slightly better or significantly worse, with less durability and tankiness to back it up.\n\nNon-optimal play drops the others far more though. I'm not sure how frequently this happens, of course.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-10-23T22:08:15.143+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Whoops, forgot to pull the table for this before I left for the weekend, so here we are!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/h40z6ro\n\nSo most of you guessed correctly in that the order goes Coin > STE > Relic shield as you can see in the top graph, but the biggest difference you can see is the amount of avg gold differential you see by the 8-10 minute mark. At that period, both STE AND relic are neck in neck, with coin quickly getting reaching ~100 gold differential. As the game goes on, you see that 100 gold difference between Coin/STE remain constant, while Relic shield drops off quite substantially (the number of times I have 4 procs ready late game and my team just clears the whole wave in front of me is clearly what accounts for this). On the bottom graph you can see that the std for coin fluctuates a lot once you get into the later stages of the game (38 min > beyond). Those spikes are likely what causes you to see games with screenshots of gold from coin that seem ludicrous, but are likely from games that get super bloody once you start entering frequent team fights and the supports on the winning team are collecting an additional 40-200 gold in a fight where 1-5 of their opponents die. \n\nInterestingly, you don't tend to see that Relic shield users are petitioning for that line to give more gold, and that's likely due to a few factors. One which I alluded to above is more along the lines of the ceremony for the gold collection, the second is the value of the stats the item actually gives you. Coin in comparison to STE and relic lines is quite inferior in terms of combat stats, but what it does let you do, and what we've seen in pro play when optimized around, is let you hit your power spikes earlier due to the early game gold differential between coin and other two lines. Those choices come at cost though if you're opting into things like an early Ardent Rush. You'll have far less vision on the map because you forgo sight stone and be fare more susceptible to ganks / agro play from your opponent. Now, I'm less happy that the only reason you might opt into that style is to get 1 single item, I'd personally prefer that you felt you had multiple options to hit an early power spike if you wanted to, but that's a longer and more serious investigation than I can go into on this post.\n\nPro play tends to skew player perception over what is optimal quite heavily, so we need to be careful about balancing/designing around what is actually to strong versus what just appears to be too strong. We haven't nerfed the gold gain on coin for months, and that's been a deliberate decision. That being said we've been talking about some changes that could be made to how they coins drop and maybe some tweaks to the passive, but in general the fairness between these items is a lot closer than I think people give them credit for. \n\n**Oh, and on the note of how player perception can be altered based on pro play, this is a graph that highlights the purchase rates of relic shield on marksman before we nerfed ardent on 7.19, on 7.19, and when the group stages of World's kicked off.\nhttps://imgur.com/rQMWq3F\n\nThis is a trend we see quite regularly over a variety of metrics, and can be cause for concern / can point to a problem. Other times it's more to do with perception which can be far harder to act on.\n\nHopefully this was informative, and sorry it took so long for me to get back to this!","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-10-23T22:26:58.569+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would argue that the gold game for supports is non-optimal, but I had the impression that you designers already kind of know that. \n\nAs a frequent Taric player, I *am* a little annoyed at relic shield's problems in the late game, but it's so much better than the old system that it almost feels bad to complain about it.

With the nerfs to Ardent Censer shipping this week, we'll likely see supports going back to getting Sightstone as their first item, but is that world really better? Firstly, it's an item that doesn't offer much excitement for the support - and yes their role is to multiply their adc, defend from ganks, peel etc, but is buying an item that grants more vision something that a support is super pumped to do? It's certainly valuable, but having sightstone be an early purchase also means we're likely to see less agro bot lane fights due to it being harder for a jungler gank, it being harder for the laners to use FoW to their advantage to scare you into thinking their jungler is there by playing more agro in the lane etc.\n\nIf we were to somehow do away with sightstone, or at least make it so the support didn't need to buy it, we'd likely see satisfaction in the role increase across the board as players got to make more exciting decisions in the item system. That world is harder to solve for, as the continuous narrative of how do we best support supports goes on. I think this year was a  pretty marked improvement, but there's still some issues that need to be ironed out. If a support is intended to multiply the adc, giving them more gold and powerful items means their adc will be that much stronger. There's more to figure out than I can go into here, but it's a constant discussion that we're having on how we can improve the situation.\n\nEDIT: Adding a small disclaimer to the bottom of this since it got cross posted to Reddit. My first sentence should have read as \"didn't have to buy Sightstone as a first rush\". A world where the support doesn't need to build it all because of other means to gaining vision is an exciting world. What if there were other ways of establishing vision that weren't based on an item purchase? Things like Zombie/Poro wards in runes reforged come to mind when I think about it, but maybe there's more that we could do. I certainly didn't intend this as an official stance on Sightstone and it's place in the game. This was just my personal opinion on something KempyreanPirate was curious about.

If a support is intended to multiply the adc, giving them more gold and powerful items means their adc will be that much stronger. \" We saw some major wins for the support class as a whole this year, but there was also some drawbacks. One thing that we see a lot right now is the sentiment that a game is won or lost based entirely on how your bot lane performs. While not entirely true, there is something to be said about making the support role on your team function as a whole champion (gold income and items). When a support can have comparable power to the rest of their teammates, it means that 40% of your team strengths come from that lane. If your bot lane comes out ahead, the loss of a portion of the 40% of strength on the opposing team feels quite sharp. \n\nTL;DR - Yes there is a potential issue with supports just being able to turn on their adc earlier, but don't think we should suppress a class because of it. I think there's other much larger solves to the problem that need to be figured out in order to make it less of an issue.

I like the system of buying an item which enables me to take control of various situations in a way no other role can, without having to rely on mechanics that seem gimmicky and unreliable like Zombie/Poro wards. Delaying {{item:2049}} for Ardent Censer was painful and I hated it.\n\nIn my opinion, having access to tons of reliable vision at all phases of the game is an integral part of supporting.  It's especially powerful when my teammates aren't buying pinks. I don't feel like I'm really playing support until I have a Sightstone online because it's so integral to the feel of playing the role. Sometimes, I want to be able to walk into the enemy jungle and drop 3 wards. There is no phase of the game when that volume of vision isn't useful. A support needs access to reliable vision. \n\nIf you do push other item starts over sightstone, please try to push a proactive playstyle. Items like {{item:3504}} were not more fun to buy first than Sightstone.  {{item:3107}} and {{item:3222}} are items that push a proactive playstyle. Items that make you simply a stat boost for your adc are not fun ({{item:3504}} ).

It's just not healthy. Isn't that why Riot had to forcibly implement Fill? You know, because people were getting 20~40 min wait times due to no one wanting to play the ~~slave ~~ support position? Well, people other than me anyways. I played Support so I had 4 second wait times. It was just like queuing up for a dungeon finder in literally almost every mmo ever. But I digress.\n\nThe gold items, in order of which item needs help the most to least, should be re-balanced for:\n\nRelic line -> Wardens like Ali/Taric/Braum. Something really needs to be done about sitting at max stacks due to your afk farming team obliterating waves before you can even get near them. This item needs the most help by far.\n\nSpell line -> Aggressive Enchanters like Sona/Lux/Morgana. Pretty good spot. Maybe a larger stack pool upon last upgrade for when there are no nearby enemy champs or towers. Perhaps letting dragon/herald/baron proc stacks since they're objectives?\n\nCoin line -> Defensive Enchanters like Nami/Janna/Soraka. By far the best gold item due to extra gold from assists. It's only let down by its sheer slot inefficiency come late game. Perhaps convert the hp regen into mana regen for Chalice/Unholy Grail to use? Heck, since we're losing Windspeaker, why not toss +10% Heal power on there instead? That gives it something to make it stand out other than \"I give lots of gold\".\n\nPS. Seriously. I will **happily** pay another 300 gold for +10% healing power.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2017-10-24T04:31:08.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This. I entirely agree with you. A team with 5 players should not require one player to gimp himself in favor of others.\n\nPart of the solution, i believe, is to make the entire vision system based on an expanded Trinket system, and to remove both Sightstone and Control wards, which would be incorporated into the expanded trinket system.\n\nAs for the system itself; I would recommend allowing all players to choose two trinkets, one which detects in various possible ways depending on which trinkets you use (Control ward?, localized true sight, current detection, etc.), and the other which puts down vision, with more options than we currently have.\n\nThat way supports can directly go and build what they need instead of delaying their champion's needs to buy wards. It also pushes the warding responsibility to be equally shared across all teammates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-10-24T00:10:27.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maple Nectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EMqpe7dX,comment-id=000a0008000000030000,timestamp=2017-10-23T22:33:15.465+0000)Do you just put power in the kits?\n\nAlmost certainly not, since then you'd have to mass-rework if the gold generation ever shifted, and solo-lane viable supports (or off-supports) like Lulu, Thresh, Morgana, Karma, Alistar, Brand, Zyra, and Vel'Koz would become potential nightmares.\n\n>Do you make the items more efficient?\n\nAlso a no, since then you get non-supports picking up support itemization, and you have to end up jumping in design hoops to make items that ONLY appeal to supports.\n\n>Do you increase gold income for supports?\n\nI really think this is the best option -- or, at least, the one with the least potential to cause major issues to general balance. The trick is that you have to find a way to do it that doesn't feel super forced AND doesn't skew other lanes.\n\nGiving gold to champions on nearby ally minion kills might work, as that might also open up some other jungle options by giving them a little more gold when they commit to a push. There are clearly problematic edge cases here (relying on your carry farming, for example, or late-game team pushes), but this might open up more jungle options, help supports, and maybe even allow some crazy gold-sharing shenanigans with unusual bottom lanes. My concern here is a meta where junglers want to just sit around lanes, so you might need to build an unusual system around this.\n\n#Actually, now that I think about it, I'd favor building that mechanic into the gold generation items.\n\nYou'd have to opt into it as anything BUT a support, but supports would now get greater gold generation in a way that's not as abusable by non-supports. Thoughts on that? Giant problems I'm missing?\n\n**Edit:** After reading your recent comment, this solution would ALSO avoid the \"last-hitting no longer matters\" issue (since it's on ally kill, not just enemy minion death), which seems a strong point in its favor.\n\n> On the relic shield note...I wonder if we just made it so that minion kills that happened around you after 35 miuntes or something automatically proced fotm charges. That's a bit...ham fisted, but it's a frustration point that might be nice to smooth out a bit. That's just me thinking though, not necessarily something that'd be implemented.\n\nThat's definitely an option, although it definitely does feel a little ham-fisted. Maybe you could standardize the gold income in the late game and let it function on jungle camps as well? That opens up some more opportunities to use it on things like mini-Raptors or mini-Krugs while still letting your team wave-clear. That's still rather clunky though.

My problem with that is that it makes for a less fun experience for supports. STE doesn't give enough mana for the supports who need it.

I see Rioters talk about how coin doesn't offer that much more than the other lines, but those claims constantly run counter to my experience *unless* I feed. So if the comparison is being made, wouldn't it be best to compare the gold gained by *winning/losing* coin games vs. comparable STE games, rather than just unfiltered averages? Of course if I win with STE, I'll have more gold than if I lost since I have more freedom to get more gold, right? Something needs to properly explain why Rioters can make this claim about the gold gen of these items when I don't see STE users running around with 2.5k+ gold on their item in comparison to me.\n\n2) On top of point 1, if we're just overreacting to anecdotal evidence and perceived gold gain, why is the pro scene completely wrapped around gaining gold super fast with coin + gold runes? If STE gave the fastest gold, they'd just AA each other with STE as aggressively as possible while using gold runes, right? Hell, Lulu has like 650 range spells to use, herself.\n\nAs for answering the question: No doubt, I think coin makes the most gold, due to its consistency. Spellthief's should make the least since you can't use it while you aren't fighting champions, so its gold gain decreases after laning and all that jazz. As far as average differentials, I'd assume coin gets at least around 500 gold on STE, give or take 100 gold, assuming coin gets near 2k and STE gets 1.5k (which is kind of generous to STE if you ask me).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2017-10-21T12:16:37.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys have already said that the gold income items are quite close to each other in reality so I'll rank them as Coin > STE > Relic with a very small difference between all of them, biggest between STE and Relic.

However if you can't trade back, the value drops quickly.  \n* Coin gives you a 25 gold pick up every 90 seconds, plus another 25 pickup every other wave.
