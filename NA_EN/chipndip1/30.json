Because what you said was a load of bull.\n\n1) Assasins are not designed to scale poorly, quite the opposite, they scale insanely well, the problem is that for them to scale they have to get kills because unlike other classes they dont have good farming tools. Assasins scale insanely well because their main job during mid-late game is to take out an enemy carry and then escape, that is why they are weak early too.\n\n2) Noone is talking about nefring hyper-carries here except you, what the person you responded to said is that hyper-carries reach that state too early, without having a full build, which should not happen. Again, as an example from a well balanced moba, let us take Dota and Sniper. Sniper is incredibly weak during early-mid game when having a low ammount of items. However, in lategame he is a monster due to his range and the ability to use strong items safely. As such when he reaches his full build (5-6 items, because that is what a FULL build is) he is a monster, as he should be. If he reached that ammount of power at 2-3 items (Something that mid game champs do) and did not fall off, then it means that something is wrong with the hypercarry.\n\n3) I am sorry, what? Did you just say that adc's have to divert attention between crit and ad items? Did i see that right? You do realize that almost nearly EVERY CRIT ITEM has ad in its statline? Right? You do realize how easy it is with only 2 items to reach a respectable ammount of crit and ad without needing to sacrifice either? And THAT is on top of other defensive passive those items give.\n\n4) \"ADC in 2017\" Was a meme created by SHIT adc players who could not handle adc being balanced. Adc's were getting killed when they were not protected and out of position by assasins and juggernauts (As it should be), it is a meme used by shit players that have no skill and then call the entire class bad because its not op but balanced anymore.\n\nSo here it is boy, before talking bullshit, please read up on what actual moba balance is, you would not last a day in Dota with such bullshit that you say here.

He doesn't even have any want for waveclear because his resourceless [Q], [E], and autos are already so efficient at it.\n\nTo put this \"budget bonus\" into perspective, this is the most common Yasuo build:\n\n{{item:3046}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3026}} \n\nAnd this is the \"typical\" ADC build:\n\n{{item:3031}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3072}}  {{item:3036}} {{item:3026}} \n\nYasuo's autos average 225% AD. The typical ADCs' average out to 175% AD.\nYasuo can replace Frozen Mallet with Maw, Mercurial, Death's Dance, or even a Last Whisper.\nYasuo also gets 50% bonus armor penetration from his ult, so he usually doesn't even need a Last Whisper.\nYasuo also benefits from AS more in the form of static CDR on his [Q].\nADCs have to sacrifice lifesteal or (more likely) armor penetration to build more crit or survivability. More often than not they can't even build any CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-08-14T02:40:09.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't most marksmen build 80% crit instead of 50% these days?\n\nOutside of that, marksmen tend to bring their own steroids. Yasuo's steroid IS the doubled crit chance. Marksmen *also* fight at range. Yasuo fights up close. It's those subtle differences that separates Yasuo's late game power in comparison to hyper-carries. He's not BAD late, but he's not some hyper-carry monster like people make him out to be.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2017-08-14T04:58:41.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, like I said, they have to forgo something in this otherwise \"rounded out\" build to have that much crit. ADCs with AS synergy like Twitch, Tristana, or Vayne can skip over their BotRK or IE for another Zeal item.\n\nThe point I'm making here about Yasuo's passive is that his steroid is so powerful it lets him skip items in his build entirely. Unlike Vladimir, Ryze, or Tahm who have to build around their steroids, he's more like old Azir - who double-dips into items, hits the cap, and has no apparent loss in power budget to show for it.\n\nYasuo is a hyper-carry monster. Like how Kayle uses her ult, or Twitch and Vayne use their stealth, he can invalidate anyone trying to focus him with his Windwall. Even though the main method of dealing with melee carries is kiting them, you can't exactly do that with Yasuo because his ult is his main method of engage, and he'll more often than not kill you before you have a chance to escape.\nNot even the likes of Yi, Trynd, or Fiora are that bad because they generally have difficulty getting into range even with help.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2017-08-13T08:20:08.618+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And because he has armor penetration built on his kit, he is more than free to build items that can give him survivability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-08-13T00:36:19.170+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget he also double dips in atk spd too with his auto scaling and Q CD scaling with atk spd instead of CDR.","replies":[]}]}]}
