{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-11-24T23:31:18.064+0000","title":"People on the Boards act like they know better than professionals and it's sickening","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":94,"down_votes":98,"body":"**Crying about not having comebacks/not being able to carry:** You guys DO realize this shit is two sides of the same coin, right? In a world where your comeback is possible, someone else&#039;s carry is negated. Thus, *do you honestly think* that you can make a game where you have realistic chances to rebound a bleak game &quot;a lot of the time&quot; WHILE that same game is one where you specifically can snowball and win games single-handedly or close to it &quot;a lot of the time&quot;? NO. It&#039;s an asinine request in the first place. Comebacks in competitive games **are earned, not given.** When Dunkey made that video on him quitting League that everyone circle-jerked for a damn year straight, one of his main points was that other competitive games like Street Fighter rewarded people for playing well, whereas League was a game that punished you for playing well through bounties. Shit&#039;s all good BACK THEN, but NOW everyone&#039;s crying that the game doesn&#039;t hold your hand from start to finish. You want to not get rolled over? Play better and *stop getting your ass beat.*\n\n**Damage complaints here:** Look, we&#039;ve gotten to a point where Riot&#039;s made a good deal of changes to address early damage. However, *this is a strategic game.* Your choices matter, and if you want your games to turn out some way or another, sometimes that hinges on **your strategic choices.** If you want a less damage-packed solo queue, people in general would have to play less damage-packed champions. THAT&#039;S IT. That&#039;s honestly the remedy. Now, is that the *only* remedy? No, because Riot added a good bit of upfront burst in itemization and pre-game runes that they had to shave off over time, but we&#039;re reaching a point, especially with the stat shards, where if you want to take the defensive, safe approach, you can alter your champion pick/pre-game setup and make that defensive approach. \n\nHowever, if you think that the ideal for the game is &quot;Everyone takes 2-3 ults to the face and still survives, even Sona&quot;, you need to fucking stop. Hell, honestly, even in season 5, the **bEsT SEaSon eVEr,** THIS WASN&#039;T TRUE. You wanna know what REALLY happened in season 5? **Everyone played fucking tanks everywhere.** Mid lane had Cho&#039;Gaths and shit. Top lane had Sions and shit. Jg had Sejuani and Cinderhulk Jarvan/Vi/Lee Sin for crying out loud. EVERYONE typed into full-on defense save one team&#039;s Jinx and the other team&#039;s Vayne, and every game would just be drug out to a 40 minute team fight so the early game didn&#039;t even fucking matter. The reason why &quot;damage wasn&#039;t too high&quot; in season 5 was because **nearly everyone was full tank.** The carries and enchanters that weren&#039;t full tank? They STILL got ran over, but it was worse because it was a fat pig that just sat on them for 10 seconds, which is why Sejuani got gutted the first time IN THE FIRST PLACE, just in case you guys needed that history lesson.\n\nLong story short on this topic is that game pacing has been more or less clumsy since pre-season 6, when we had a ton of games being *decided, not surrendered,* by 15 - 20 minutes with the original Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust, when Yasuo and Tryndamere were insanely overpowered during the first masteries change (which they stated was a proto-type for the original Runes Reforged changes that would come later). These turret changes *may need tuning,* but it&#039;s done a massive job in giving us back a reasonable laning phase experience.\n\n**Fire the balance team:** The balance team is PAID to work on this game. You aren&#039;t. The balance team also isn&#039;t a bunch of Silver/Gold 5 players on the boards whining about champions they have no business whining about. Once again, you are. You guys have no real idea on game balance. They do.\n\n&quot;Bu-bu-bu-&quot; no buts. You guys constantly complain about how Riot doesn&#039;t balance around low elo, and everything they do is LCS-oriented? Aight, Riot stops {{champion:13}} putting massive work on LCS-problem champions {{champion:429}} and Riot {{champion:86}} nerfs champions that are specifically balance issues FOR LOW ELO, which is YOUR(ick) ELO {{champion:83}}. Low and behold...you guys complain that Riot nerfed Yorick and Garen. Hell, you guys also complained they nerfed {{champion:267}}, but Nami had a 54% general win rate *in Diamond* on like a 10%+ play rate by the time the nerf went through, and she&#039;s still doing perfectly fine right now. You guys ALSO complain about {{champion:84}}, but for any elo range that any of you reside in, she&#039;s statistically been proven to be a *walking win for the enemy team.* People that see this champ in Bronze - Gold should be *fucking ecstatic* for the free lp, but you guys STILL want this champion nerfed.\n\nAnd let&#039;s not forget how you guys complained that picks like Ornn and Sejuani keep getting held up by the LCS. Riot says &quot;Sure, we&#039;ll tune them for solo queue.&quot; How do you do this? You make their strategic, team-oriented parts worse while making their snowballing, hard-carry elements stronger. In other words, nerf utility and buff da- &quot;BU-BU-BUT YOU CAN&#039;T BUFF THEIR DAMAGE CAUSE THEY'RE TANKS!&quot;. So the fuck do you want them to do with tanks!? They can&#039;t be cc bots because that makes them good in organized games. They can&#039;t do damage because tanks shouldn&#039;t do damage. They STILL HAVE TO FUNCTION, but every direction you could go has some Silver II crying over it. You can&#039;t get a good feel about what to do with the game&#039;s direction because there&#039;s never any positive feedback no matter which direction you go. \n\n**Riot doesn&#039;t listen to us:** Imagine being in a room full of toddlers that never stop hysterically crying. The reason why they&#039;re crying changes, but they never tire out to a reasonable volume and they never outright stop. If you don&#039;t lose your mind after being in that room for 5 minutes, you&#039;re definitely tuning those babies out. These boards are a room of hysterically crying toddlers.\n\n**What&#039;s the point of this thread:** I&#039;m not saying people can&#039;t complain about the game. I&#039;m not. Honest.\n\nHOWEVER, I would love and adore if you guys would take a bit of time to think a bit more big picture so you can truly capture what needs addressing when you complain. Making a million fucking threads about getting people fired or threads about &quot;Wanting a new balance team for the holidays&quot;...you guys are the reason no one that&#039;s worth taking seriously should take you seriously. The mods don&#039;t want people hurting each other&#039;s feelings on the boards, but I&#039;m being honest. No one worth being taken seriously should take Gameplay seriously the way it is. Why do you think most Rioters don&#039;t talk around here and do it elsewhere?","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-11-25T00:16:22.106+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":12,"body":"inb4 wE r NoT a HiVeMiNd. \n\nBeen here for close to 5 years and this board is beyond any shadow of a doubt a hivemind","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-11-25T00:21:53.029+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":3,"body":"Unit #4530 you are speaking out of line please return to the factory for realignment","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2018-11-25T03:36:45.374+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Earth King has invited them to Lake Laogai?","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-11-25T02:07:16.770+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"This is why you're alright by me, guy.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-11-25T02:55:54.315+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes everyone alright by you because hive mind","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-11-25T02:46:11.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"All the good and sane people have already left Boards, now only remaining are the vile, the masochists, and the jaded.\n\nTo say Boards isn’t biased and without an agenda is completely false and isn’t even remotely in touch with what the actual playerbase thinks.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-11-25T03:09:32.770+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"which one are you","replies":[{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-11-25T03:46:07.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of the above","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeBlanc Jameś","date":"2018-11-25T03:43:03.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eedat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uLbJHIyp,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-11-25T00:16:22.106+0000)\n>\n> inb4 wE r NoT a HiVeMiNd. \n> \n> Been here for close to 5 years and this board is beyond any shadow of a doubt a hivemind\n\nBro, it's not \"this board\".

Professional doesn&#x27;t just mean a pro player (like how a doctor might say &quot;in my professional opinion&quot;)\n\nThe lead designer in City of Heroes' initial year or two was a guy that had zero programming background, zero gaming background, and zero design background. He graduated with a degree in History, specifically greek/roman. He gathered people that knew how to do the things he wanted, and when he tried to change the game to be more like WoW he got voted off the ship. For the record, I absolutely loved City of Heroes and wished NCSoft never canceled it.\n\nBeing a \"professional\" can often just be a meaningless title that says you make the rules. This doesn't even take into account that one doesn't need to be a professional chef to know if a dish is bad or if the milk is sour. Tasting it is enough to form an opinion, and while the chef himself may disagree about his dish on principle, that doesn't change the fact that people don't like it.\n\nShows like Restaurant Impossible, Kitchen Nightmares, Bar Rescue, and a plethora of other \"rescuer\" shows illustrate just how often blind faith in someone claiming to be good at something can put your business in an inescapable pit.\n\nImprovements come from criticism, not praise. It just doesn't help that Riot ignored their own boards in favor of the Reddit Echo Chamber years ago, so the people left here are frustrated. Our criticism has turned to vitriol that Riot uses to justify their avoidance of the boards even though they left long before it got to that point.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-11-24T23:39:57.801+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":19,"body":"downvoted for excessive exageration\n\nit's not the first time I see you doing it anyway, whenever we argue about \"should offensive blantantly outscale defense\" you use the same argument","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2018-11-25T03:19:28.750+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure.\n\nWhat about all the complains professional players at LCS/LCK/LPL/LMS/etc. have?\nWhat about Faker stating how less fun the game has become for him?

The main takeaway however is to see that throughout many patches, pro players, streamers and content creators echo many sentiments you'll also find in The Boards._\n\n> What complaints? Burden of proof when you make a claim is on you. This isn&#x27;t my claim, so you bring evidence of these complaints.\n\nAre you kidding me? Fine, here's just a couple for you (like you haven't seen them before):\n\nRemember the Zoe complaints? Yeah:\nhttps://youtu.be/IRQf3qMPDR8\n\nDL's Video that even got a response by Ghostcrawler:\nhttps://youtu.be/PhI-QLG_DJU\n\nRekkles on the ADC destruction of Mid Season, echoing how many ADC felt during that period:\nhttps://youtu.be/oy5m2LMdBRw\n\nAnd do note the following: I'm not saying everything The Boards say is right and that every Pro agrees to them, but the fact alone that there's many examples of Pros and High Elo Players (Will get into that in the Streamer section) that echo some of the biggest concerns you see here, that alone proves the problems are not _\"Just a silver thing\"_ like you're trying to sell.\n\n> Clearly he likes the 5v5 team game that LoL&#x27;s supposed to be over the cluster fuck that is solo queue that the Gameplay boards keep screaming at Riot to focus the entire game around. You should read your own quotes.\n\nWhile that's not wrong, we then have this:\n\nFaker: **One side always explodes right here [pointing to the botlane]. It's never a 50/50, the game is always one sided. Then what is mid/top/jg? Are we playing League or are we playing slot machines? If other lanes are mismatched, it's still a 1v1 so the difference is not big but because there's two people bot, the gap is too big. How are you supposed to win a game if a 200LP/200LP Masters botlane is matched against an 800LP/800LP Challenger botlane?**\n\nDid you forget how much people were complaining about the Bot Snowball during the time of this Faker quote? It was the exact same complaint. According to your logic, everyone complaining about Bot back then were a bunch of clueless Silvers. How come Faker had the exact same opinion as most of those complaints? Turns out it's not even an isolated case because I've already shown you above a bunch of pros echoing The Boards sentiments.\n\nI find it very strange that you only used the quote that served your narrative, when the ADC quote was right there and you could read it easily. You just chose not to pay attention to that quote for some reason.\n \n> You guys ALSO complain about {{champion:84}} , but for any elo range that any of you reside in, she&#039;s statistically been proven to be a walking win for the enemy team. People that see this champ in Bronze - Gold should be fucking ecstatic for the free lp, but you guys STILL want this champion nerfed.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dJplbJG9_9E?t=12\nImportant to note that what he considers the most busted part of Akali is her stealth, **which just so happens to be the main thing people in The Boards complain about**. Maybe you should take it to Perkz next time. I think it's pretty safe to say what most people hate about Akali is her Shroud, the very same thing Perkz commented on.\n\n> You didn&#x27;t say anything about them for me to say anything about those streamers...\n\nI don't know if you didn't understand or if you're playing me, but I'll hope it's the former and explain before I drop some vids on you:\nI meant streamers and content creators (a lot of them high elo) have also voiced complaints and concerns similar to those that you'll find in the Boards. So let's get started...\n\nHere's Scarra:\nhttps://youtu.be/k1wsNBxenXM\n\nAnd again Scarra:\nhttps://youtu.be/LrdF1Y4aPPw\n\nHAT-TRICK:\nhttps://youtu.be/oiOBO4sKBBQ\n\nYou'll find many of his opinions are in line with how people feel about many aspects of the game. Pace, some champs balance, and many more themes.\n\nHere's someone else who's usually at the top of the ladder, and who puts more hours into the game than many people in NA:\nhttps://youtu.be/oiP3tqoabqM\n\nNow: If you have a problem with these High Elo players' statements and arguments, then take it to them, not me. I'm just showing you they exist.\n\nAnd now for some content creators that have had problems with directions the game has taken, that also echo many feelings in this forum:\n\nFirst this unknown dude:\nhttps://youtu.be/VjzgbZL12VI\n\nThen there's this guy:\nhttps://youtu.be/7cFso3bYoxc\n\nA Diamond V hard stuck guy:\nhttps://youtu.be/w6tfYuv7Vhw\n\n_\"Burden of proof\"_.... are you really that blind to how everyone feels about the game? Do you simply chose to ignore all those pieces that have been around for *MONTHS* and ask me for proof? Isn't it clear that is people across all levels of play that get extremely frustrated with what the balance team do sometimes? Do I need to post the many angry comments by pros on the horrible Funnel thing that happened specifically for Pro Play earlier this year?\n\nNow: Do I know how to fix the game? **OMEGALUL** of course not.\n\nYou'll rarely even see me post something about balance unless it has to do with Tristana, and even then I post rarely. I just think you're not being fair at the many legit complains that show up in the Boards, and I'm also afraid you're missing the whole point: Even if people posting here are delusional enough _think_ they know how to fix the game, the bottom line is that** people are just not happy with the state of the game**, and since a bad change seems to lead to another, people wonder what's even happening anymore. The day people stop complaining about a game they love is the day they stop caring, and then the game will be truly dead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-11-25T04:08:45.445+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":11,"body":"They literally do not matter.

Tanks should not have _excellent CC, excellent damage, great lane priority, _ AND _inherently high-value late games._ Tuning Sejuani's E stun down by .2 seconds doesn't mean you can throw 200 more damage on her rotation.

Full stop. Nobody wants to play a tank who's not tanky, and in season 8/season 9 if you don't have a fat shield, % damage reduction, a REVIVE or just absurd amounts of HP, you're not tanky. You take Ornn's shield away and he has none of that. It doesn't solve anything. His worse matchups will just become unwinnable because his shield is his only means of meaningful defense.

I don't agree.\n\nHowever, what I do agree with is.... is that people who generally COMPLAIN about no access to comebacks..... generally don't know how to. Barring a few exceptions, (2-3 fed tanks with a fed Jinx  behind them is a pretty solid bet of a difficulty in turning a game around. If the Jinx is alone, and on a poke team, the comeback might be possible......) comebacks are possible. \n\nGenerally though..... comebacks involve coaxing the 0/10 feeders to slow the game down, defend, and farm.... defending turrets from pushes, sacrificing some drakes, and letting those who are reasonably better call shots. \n\n(Ofc that's wishful thinking if they are 0/10 in the first place. They're more likely to go on doing exactly what they've been doing, and adversely affect the attitudes of their teammates).\n\n\n-------------------------\n\nI generally agree on damage output. However, for different reasons. There were plenty of players playing non tanky builds. In fact, Life steal was more meta than tank, even after the Tank update. Players were not as mobile in adjusting their meta, and were still carrying over life steal from Season 4.\n\nFurthermore, they were trying to counter Feral Flame, and later the % damage jungle item, and life steal was better pathing for that than tankiness.\n\nBut...... we didn't have all these new champs, and game lengths were actually similar to now (maybe 1-2 minutes longer on average)\n\nPeople were more patient, and willing to coordinate. They hadn't given up on the climb, and took their time farming. \n\n_**More importantly: Everyone had access to limited mobility and wards were ABUNDANT.

Balancing team, their words by the way, \"We didn't think people would build him AP.\" Literally what they said. \n\nBut, it's not even just those very amusing instances.  It's been the consistent fact that a lot of the balancing decisions they made never **actually** fixed problems.  I can go onto OP.GG right now and can pretty much bet that Graves/Xin/Camille/ Sion/ Janna/Sona are all hilariously overtuned.  The best part? They have been for entire seasons basically.  Aside from one very brief stint. Graves has been a meta extremely over bearing pick since his creation.\n\n\"Games too snowball,  Jungle too strong.\"  \"Jungle difference.\"\n\nLiterally all these factors are determined by \n\n1. Level 2 gank/scuttle\n\n2. wave clear + prio from lanes.\n\nRiots go to was nerfing EXP and making bad jungle match ups even worse. At the end of the day the jungler that ganks/invades at level 2 is still going to invade level 2. They do not give a flying crap if it takes 4 camps to hit 3. Their time to shine is right after they hit 2. If they profit? Well, see above.  \n\nMeanwhile, mid is literally \"who wave clears better.\" And then they run down bot and dive with the jungler. All of this right here is what creates 80% of the problems. \n\n\nAt the end of the day, my biggest issue is the fact Riot legitimately admits that they intentionally leave some champs over tuned because they're popular, and it's \"interesting.\" And as long as they continue to maintain this type of balance style all of the problems I listed above are going to continue to happen.  You can change how we play the game all you want. If  Graves is stat for stat one of the best junglers in the game and has the base stats for it he's going to keep 60% of the roster out. And if Camille is stat for stat one of  the most abusive level 2 junglers in the game she's going to keep the other 30% out and skew a lot of match ups one way or the other simple because of how much power she has in one ability. \n\n\n\nAs for my personal experience with the game on this patch?  Nothing has really changed. A lot of the same champs are still stupid, all the turrets really do is escalate snowball further, but at the same time it discourages play making due to hilarious bounties. So, it evens out to be roughly the same only with a little armor/mr sprinkled in.  The game is as virtually unenjoyable as it was last season and if it doesn't get resolved I probably won't even play this season.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
