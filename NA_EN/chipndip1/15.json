Here's what I think ACTUALLY needs to be dealt with in the game rn.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":101,"down_votes":14,"body":"**Lethal Tempo/Press the Attack:** One of these need to go. The overlap is too much and one or the other is going to outdo the other one at all times. One of the two needs to get the boot. Personally, I think Lethal Tempo is the healthier option out of the two. Instead of just granting free damage from all sources for AA&#039;ing someone a bit, it rewards sticking to your opponents and maxing out your reward from the rune. Either way, one needs to go.\n\n**Dark Harvest:** This is the reason why I made this thread, honestly. This rune needs to be altered. Burst damage from a source like this should not infinitely scale, and games where this thing&#039;s fantasy is realized are beyond miserable. WELL beyond miserable. Games where a Dark Harvest champ pops off are just INSANELY snowbally since that guy basically has &quot;Electrocute on steroids 5.2 edition&quot;. Predator is nice because it&#039;s mostly used for the speed. Electrocute is nice because it&#039;s the more generalized damage option. Dark Harvest, even if it&#039;s the scaling option, should NOT infinitely scale. Either scrap the rune or work with it a bit so it can be capped somewhere.\n\n**Conqueror:** It may be overtuned. Idk for sure. True damage gets people&#039;s panties all bunched up, regardless of details, but true damage conversion *on top of* bonus AD *on top of* it constantly refreshing for fighters might be harsh. You could dial down either the refreshing thing or hit the true damage a bit...maybe by 5%. Make it so the refresh caps at 6 or 9 seconds? Idk, but address it a little bit, not too much.\n\n**Marksmen:** Here&#039;s what I think on the subject. Ultimately, the result of the changes made were amazing. **Don&#039;t move the finish line back, Riot. However, you may need to smooth out the track.** Nerfing crit synergy was the smart play, same for nerfing the Zeal items...but all the changes as a whole were heavy-handed. Maybe you guys could tackle the recipe for Infinity Edge so it&#039;s easier to work with somehow? Maybe tackle Zeal&#039;s pricing (not the things it builds into, just Zeal itself)? Idk, but I think the reason why crit marksmen are so devastated right now is because making to your build&#039;s checkpoints (unless the enemy ints) is the real killer.\n\nAlso, marksmen are way too closely linked to bot lane. More marksmen should be tackled and dealt with so they aren&#039;t too crummy in solo lanes. \n\n**Damage in general:** This is a very complicated topic.\n\n- Some of this is actually true. Front-loaded damage has, once again, become an issue at the forefront of the boards. This time around, it isn&#039;t from crits landing 800 damage on someone&#039;s head. This time it&#039;s from lethality-users like Rengar jumping out the band-o in attack mode and removing someone from play. Now, *this is kind of the community&#039;s fault.* Riot realized that people didn&#039;t like being 1-shot like hell, so they slowed down assassins with burst patterns that were faster than the likes of Zed and Fizz. In the case of some of these guys, the boards complained **incessantly,** and Riot changed them *back.* Now we&#039;re in an earlier game meta, where assassins are picked, and well, people are pissed...AGAIN...over a problem we already solved, then went back and made into a problem again. What can we even do about it?\n\n- Some of this is actually the usual whining we always see. League is a snowbally game. If Zed gets 2 or 3 kills and some good farm, he&#039;s GONNA pop you if you&#039;re a mage or a carry pick. That isn&#039;t new, so don&#039;t act surprised. It&#039;s his job. If you draft bad or build shit builds, you reap what you sow. Sure, you could say &quot;Games shouldn&#039;t be over in champ sele-&quot; this is partly a strategic game. In strategic games, unit selection is as important as unit utilization. If you can&#039;t understand that, blame *yourself.* Sure, you COULD win going LeBlanc into Kassadin...but we **highly** doubt it. Some match-ups are good, and some suck dick. That&#039;s any game with characters in it, not just League. Like, I just had a game with a Talon that was whining about being popped by Syndra all game, and when I told him &quot;Build a drinker&quot;, he bought {{item:1036}} {{item:1036}} {{item:3134}}. Like...come on...\n\nAnywho, if you ask me, I think that Riot should nerf lethality a bit. Not a whole lot, but a few bits. They should also buff Exhaust or nerf Ignite. No, they should NOT just nerf damage as a whole. That&#039;ll be a massive buff to tanks and supports. Think before you guys circle-jerk.\n\nThat&#039;s it for my thoughts. Short story of each:\n\n- Dark Harvest is toxic or useless.\n- Lethal Tempo and PtA just can&#039;t coexist.\n- Conqueror can use a slight power down.\n- Marksmen itemization is a *little* too harsh on crit marksmen.\n- Some marksmen could do some good being liberated from bot lane and Riot should look into making that happen.\n- Damage is kinda &quot;bleh&quot; atm, I&#039;d agree. It&#039;s not solely Riot&#039;s fault and the community is cancerous as hell for constantly blaming the balance team for their shitty decision making.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-07-10T04:57:02.531+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually fairly reasonable post.

That and items were still more expensive. They were a little more cost effective, but their base prices made it so that mid laners and junglers had clear windows of opportunity to exploit their lack of damage. Now you can get your first full Lethality item by ~8-12 minutes and you just roflstomp in terms of damage.\n\nYou were never able to do this before Lethality became the new \"armor pen\". Youmuu's wasn't even that great, most AD assassins still rushed Tiamat first and at times went straight into Last Whisper. Also RIP Last Whisper, the old LW was actually amazing.\n\nAlso stacking armor pen. besides Youmuu's+LW was pretty much trolling unless you needed Maw for the defensive passive. Nowadays you just stack Lethality before it's simply THE best option. Plus, Lethality builds invalidate every other build for AD assassins. \n\nRengar would love to go full crit., but Lethality is outright better. Shaco would love to go AP or crit., but Lethality is outright better. Kha'zix would love to go Tiamat or Manamune based builds, but Lethality is outright better. Talon would love to go full burst cheese build, but Lethality is just that and better. Zed would love to go BotRK and crit. based builds, but Lethality is THE best option. \n\nLethality is so good that it just invalidates any other possible build path for AD assassins, with Duskblade being the core of the issue, acting as a crutch item for AD assassins. The fact that it's killing off other potential build paths should signify that the statistic is extremely good as well as cost effective.","replies":[{"poster":"bbQsauçe","date":"2018-07-12T07:01:18.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-07-12T07:05:43.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I can agree that it is the ONLY option, but the items are still really amazing when put onto AD assassins.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2018-07-11T05:16:10.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lethality is healthier version of flat armor pen.\n\nThe issue with Dirk is the extra 40 damage after a minion kill, not the ~7 armor pen (since lethality scales with level).

It&#x27;s because there are more sources of damage.\n\nI would agree, but ever since its debut Lethality has caused nothing but issues.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-07-10T22:02:43.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Landing your abilities on the target\" in many cases amounts to \"right clicking\".","replies":[{"poster":"bbQsauçe","date":"2018-07-10T22:38:55.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Forfeit","date":"2018-07-11T03:41:39.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:40}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gene Freakz","date":"2018-07-11T00:05:05.301+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Title check out; turns out you are a man of reason. I enjoyed the post. I like your point about game strategy being equally as important in champ select, but I don't see a lot of that happening. I agree with the principle that a person should play a few champs well, but often people don't consider the team synergy and what champs the other team has and just stick to their one-trick pony. I also agree that it is on squishies to position, ward, and read the map when the other team has an assassin like a zed (or you can just ban him, easy peasy). \n\nI play Janna quite a bit and while she has good cc, she can't always stop a fully loaded Zed who ults her with no turrets around. The game has a lot to do with awareness and I describe it like fast-paced chess. A player has to constantly think about what could happen at any given moment and read the board and future moves. If you are squishy and roaming deep with no wards, as you say about Zed \"he's Gonna pop you\" because \"it's his job\".\n\nP.S.

Its only reasons for being in the game are literally because\n1. According to studies players get a big satisfaction feedback out of seeing the animation+damage spike\n2. When Riot held a poll over what keystones players would like to see in RR T-Lords was easily ranked one because as mentioned before lots of players are addicted to the FREE DAMAGE and have spent a entire season already incorporating the rune into their champion playstyles\n\nSo basically the only reason its in is because it \"feels good\" and there is a sunk cost fallacy type thing going on along with \"Without T-Lords my champ would be trash again cuz he would lose a bunch of power \".\nAlso you can nerf BURST but not nerf DAMAGE.\n\nFor Instance\n\n{{item:3095}}  NEW PASSIVE: Every 150 physical damage OR crit done to champions grants 5 Attack Damage (max 50 extra Attack Damage)\nsee how that still allows damage to outpace defense without just resorting to one-shot instagib territory?\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-07-10T10:40:57.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You managed to write a post, I would, have written toxic as fuck.
