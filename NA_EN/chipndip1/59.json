If you don&#039;t group and you don&#039;t have someone for Ivern to work with, Ivern is SHIT tier. If Ivern has some dudes and gals around him, he&#039;s a bit better.\r\n\r\nHe still needs buffs though, but even with buffs, you&#039;ll need teamwork to use this champ.\r\n\r\nSide note: Rylai&#039;s makes Daisy&#039;s punches slow. Maybe RoA + Rylai&#039;s + Liandry&#039;s should be a thing on him?","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-10-15T10:33:12.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support Junglers are really strong when played right as long as you don't try and kill things yourself.
