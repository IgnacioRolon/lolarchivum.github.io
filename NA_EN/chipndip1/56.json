How do you guys honestly think you&#039;re hot enough shit to go around wasting my elo and time by taking my hard work to make you into a threat and throwing it away like Amanda Bynes does with fame and sanity?\r\n\r\nI can understand when a support is going like 0/5/5 or something if their adc is going like 4/2/1. I can see that the support just made the hard choice repeatedly.\r\n\r\nI SHOULDN&#039;T BE 2/1/14 WITH YOU BEING 4/9/6.\r\n\r\nAnd holy shit why is it that I find people building MF like Busty Demoness would? WHAT TYPE OF CORE IS FUCKING THIS?\r\n\r\n{{champion:21}} : https://i.gyazo.com/32f1fd592af7b1fc3a403ce56fd543a9.png\r\n\r\nFor the love of tap-dancing Teemo, why are adc players the bane of my existence?
