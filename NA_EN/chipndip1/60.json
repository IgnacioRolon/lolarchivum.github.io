Gonna try to keep it brief, but spoiler: This isn&#039;t going to be brief. With that said, a great reading strat I learned is that you can get a good gist of a paragraph by reading the first and last sentence of it, so use that to get a makeshift tl;dr if you need one.\r\n\r\n&quot;Riot is making a ton of supports available to get more people to try it&quot;: If the support role was better designed, this wouldn&#039;t be an issue to begin with because people would be interested in it and wouldn&#039;t be driven away by the negative stigmas held by it.\r\n\r\n&quot;Riot&#039;s looking into gold made by the role to make it interesting&quot;: Wrong direction to look in. Like, who cares if Soraka/Janna get 15k gold instead of 10k? What are they going to buy? What does Janna or someone like her even NEED to buy with 15k gold? In this general direction, though, supports do have an exp issue. They lag behind in exp way too hard unless they&#039;re avoiding higher level support tactics like deep warding and roaming. Hell, just me warding farther up the river causes me to steadily begin to fall behind my adc in exp. We need something to help keep up.\r\n\r\n&quot;The support role is way better than it used to be&quot;: I mean, I started right before Season 5 started, but from what I heard from just about any seasoned source is that supports were even worse than they are now. Always gotta pay respect to progress.\r\n\r\n&quot;Riot is supporting all kinds of support styles&quot;: No, they&#039;re doing that halfway. In champ choices, this is true. Zyra/Brand make great offensive mages, Soraka/Janna make good defensive ones, Braum is a strong defensive tank...so on and so forth. *However*, like I&#039;ve said for a long time on these boards, support itemization really only encourages defensive play. Like, look at every passive and active on ALL the support items. How many of them are defensive or have a defensive edge? It&#039;d be easier to count the ones that don&#039;t, honestly. Even Redemption, which Riot promoted as &quot;The enchanter item you get when you want a lil offense&quot; is shitty on offense. In practice, Redemption&#039;s true damage doesn&#039;t do enough to any individual target to really matter, thus making the heal way better. Everything in the support role is well thought out and implemented *for defense* to the point where we&#039;re almost spoiled for choice. For *offense*, the role is almost completely bare. This isn&#039;t just for mage supports, either. Tank supports don&#039;t have anything that promotes a more aggressive play style out of all the tank support items as well. Hell, they made it worse by making Banner a tank item. -_-\r\n\r\nNow, there ARE a few support items that lean towards the offensive side of things, but only Ardent is actually any real good out of all of them so let&#039;s not bother going down a list to explain why they all suck when we can just understand that together and move on.\r\n\r\n&quot;The main support play style isn&#039;t all that fun&quot;: Well...no shit. Like, why would a good number of people subject themselves to being a glorified Locket Pocket (the item actually got BETTER if you time it)? Most traditional supports do nothing but defend adcs with shields and heals, with a *lil* something to hit someone for 50 damage. I mean, look at how mid lane mages play. They do well, they buy ap, and they can feel the gratification for doing so when they land another spell later. As a support, you don&#039;t *get* to scale even if there&#039;s space for it all over your kit. You grab a new toggle or passive, but you rarely strengthen your champion&#039;s actual kit. Some of these effects are great for what they&#039;re used for, but once again, almost all of them are simply babysitting tools, and not everyone likes a defensive play style. There isn&#039;t much that promotes the dynamic play that you want to see from this game outside of timing shields and cleanses and dropping that Redemption.\r\n\r\nThis also bleeds into the champ kits as well. Before Sona got her mini-rework, I was making threads about how this wouldn&#039;t solve the underlying issues in her kit with how it&#039;s so hard to get her in a nice spot, balance-wise, for low and high levels of play. Although the changes helped the champion, the underlying problem generally persists, and whenever I got to LeagueofGraphs, Sona is generally dominating the shit out of the lower tiers even if she&#039;s pretty aight in the higher ones and absolute shit in pro play as usual. There&#039;s just no way a kit like hers, or Janna&#039;s, or Soraka&#039;s, is really going to feel strong and impactful without being a bit (or a lot) overbearing, seeing how 1-dimensional these champs are. The route Riot took was to make it so that these champs just need to scale into later stages of the game to be strong, but seeing how they want us to scale one aspect of these champs rather than their entire kits, now they just overall lose out to supports that bring strong hard cc since hard cc is allowed to be strong early and it&#039;s just as useful all game long. The other route is to do a class-wide enchanter rework or a few VGUs where we give these champs more dynamic play styles with more room for counter-play to get through their defenses outside of &quot;kill them&quot;, so as to give them more appreciable risk/reward curves and margins of error, but Riot doesn&#039;t want to put in that type of dedication to the support role. So now we&#039;re stuck between a possible solution that might work that Riot doesn&#039;t want to fully commit to, and another possible solution that might work that Riot shrugged off months ago. With this said, who are the top dog supports? The more dynamic ones with more appreciable risk/reward curves and higher margins of error like Braum, Alistar, Nami, Bard, and even Zyra. These champs are easier to balance because there&#039;s a difficulty curve to work with here. In the others&#039; case, it&#039;s all point-n-click, guaranteed payout, so it&#039;s hard to make them feel good to use without being terrible to fight against, and the role suffers for it on that front just as much as it does on the itemization front. Story&#039;s been the same this whole time...just repeating it.\r\n\r\n&quot;No one recognizes when I&#039;m doing well&quot;: I mean, that depends on the support you picked. The ones I mentioned earlier are way more noticeable than the problem girls that got nerfed out of being pick/ban (Janna/Lulu/Sona/Soraka in case we&#039;re wondering, and yes I know Lulu&#039;s was a while ago and primarily a pro play thing but still...). This is still going to be a problem that&#039;s just inherent to the role in general, honestly, but it&#039;s easier to be recognized when you do more than just shield and heal all day. Yes, I know it&#039;s not THAT simple, but that&#039;s a *large* chunk of the pie of what we&#039;re doing if we&#039;re being honest.\r\n\r\n&quot;Sightstone is forced down your throat/Power progression ain&#039;t looking too hot&quot;: Sightstone is a necessary evil of the role, but power progression could be fixed with better itemization options...at least by a good lil bit. Like, I&#039;m still amazed that Riot thought &quot;We need an offensive Enchanter item&quot; and happened to make an item with 400 HP and regens for stats. It&#039;s like making an adc item with MR and out of combat movement speed. Then we&#039;re scratching our heads again trying to figure this out.\r\n\r\nThe playstyle one gets from playing Zyra/Brand/A mid laner taken bot is way more fun than the traditional support style: And yet when I bring up the notion that supports may want to actually *fight the enemy champions*, and that we should open up itemization options to this line of thinking, people flip their shit around here. It&#039;s a thing and people want to do it. It&#039;s time to stop cowering about it and really bring that mindset and strategy into the game instead of leaving it halfway through the door. Hell, maybe Riot might tone down their base damage if they have something to build into?/&#039;&#039;\r\n\r\n&quot;People not playing support hurts all of us&quot;: Duh. Talked to death when Season 6 rolled in initially. If no one supports, queue times go up and fill becomes support. Hell, we lost out on role exclusion probably because of this, where people could say &quot;Fill, but don&#039;t give me support&quot;, and thus no one could find a support. So now everyone&#039;s getting auto-fill, but no one gets role exclusion. Joy!\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s about all of the major points that Curious brought up in his vid, and half the vid was triggering me cause it felt like someone else was &quot;discovering&quot; half the crap I&#039;ve been saying here for a while now in one fashion or another.","replies":[]}
