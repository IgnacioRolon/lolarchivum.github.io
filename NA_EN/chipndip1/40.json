Got tweaked quite heavily from season 5 to be in a very appreciable balancing spot today.\n\n{{champion:44}} : He&#039;s part Enchanter, but his core strengths in games lies in his ult and usage of his W to land his E stun. There&#039;s very high variance in his E and ult based on positioning and timing.\n\nEnchanters: Low counter-play magic casters that spam one button all game for *most* of their appreciable contributions, save Nami.\n\n{{champion:40}} : Where&#039;s the counter-play to anything Janna does? We get that defense is a niche to fill, but Janna&#039;s TOO good on reaction, and coin rewards a low-interaction play style, which basically rewards her for doing jack shit besides pressing E.\n\n{{champion:37}} : No counter-play to anything in her basic kit. Either she loses too much ground before she gets her Ardent/Athene&#039;s core, or she doesn&#039;t and she runs you over in team fights while giving her whole team a constantly present Censer boost to maul you with.

One again, she&#039;s too centered on her defensive value in healing and healing some more, with nothing to do *outside* of this one core strength that&#039;s impossible to play around outside of &quot;kill her&quot;.\n\n{{champion:117}} : Literally only Q can miss on this champ, and you can even put it right on top of the enemy so it&#039;ll most likely not miss.\n\nWhereas the other types of supports in this game have appreciable variance in their overall output, many enchanters do *not.* Their game play revolves around simply shielding or healing someone or multiple people repeatedly. The enchanter class as a whole needs major work if we want to avoid dumpstering the fuck out of enchanter items to bring them in line.\n\nAnd I better see *at least* you Karma QQ&#039;ers on here.

There are a few examples in the game right now, such as Tristana's E (you can't stop the bomb application but you can prevent it from being charged up) or Blitzcrank's W (he gets a speed boost but then slows himself), and generally double-edged abilities like Kindred or Bard's ults tend to offer options to both sides. However, this hasn't really been applied to enchanters, whose on-demand abilities would otherwise make them perfect for this kind of counterplay, and as a result a lot of utility on enchanters' kits feels both uninteractive to the enemy, and boring to the player.\n\nLet's pick Lulu as an example for this: as an aggressive support with a core theme of whimsical fairy magic, she should have abilities that are volatile and exciting, to the point of almost feeling out of her own control. In practice, though, three of her abilities offer _extremely_ reliable utility, damage and CC depending on who she uses them on. The worst instance of this is her W: on allies, it's a pretty generic speed boost, and on enemies it's a point-and-click silence, disarm _and_ slow, all rolled into one. It's part of what makes her such a strong anti-assassin, but it's conveyed in a manner that is not only boring in itself, but shuts down more interesting plays. There is no front-loaded counterplay to these abilities, as they cannot be dodged or anticipated, but there's also no back-loaded counterplay, as there's nothing you can do to exploit those effects to your advantage if you're her opponent. This is also why Lulu isn't allowed to be a successful top laner, as this kind of ability causes her to fundamentally lack interactivity. She's definitely reliable as an enchanter, but she's also far less interesting than she could be, and this excessive reliability is damaging both her viability out of bot lane (and in bot lane too, when top lane Lulu gets strong and she gets nerfed as a result), and even her fulfilment of her own theme.\n\nSuppose, to pick one crazy example, that Lulu's W worked differently: instead of having two separate effects, it polymorphed _any_ target she used it on, but instead of slowing them, it buffed their movement speed for the duration. Things would change significantly: assassins would still have their offensive power shut down if they get near Lulu, but the speed boost could help them retreat or reposition. Similarly, using this ability on an ally or self-casting it could help Lulu or her ally reposition in a pinch, but would also leave them otherwise defenseless, due to the pacify effect. It's an effect that would be extremely predictable in what it'd do, but that would also carry far more interactivity in how it could be exploited by everyone involved. It could potentially fit significantly better into Lulu's theme as a whimsical Yordle witch, while also giving her enough counterplay to be allowed to become a more viable solo laner, as well as giving her enough unreliability to afford her more power in other aspects of her kit.\n\nBeyond that, there's also much more that can be done to improve the design of enchanters: too much importance is placed upon their reliability, which often makes their kits uninteresting as a result, and I think their kits need to have some power shifted around so that they _keep_ their ability to make clutch plays and saves, while losing the ability to simply provide generic protection and thereby negate plays made by their opponent. Shortening shield durations could help with this, as would tying those shields' secondary bonuses to them staying up more consistently (Janna's shield only provides bonus AD while it stays up, but Lulu's shield also gives her target Pix for 6 seconds no matter what happens, for example). More generally, there should be more emphasis placed on the timing of those abilities, so that they achieve their maximum effect or don't backfire, rather than just the constant application of them, as is often currently the case, particularly since supports max out on CDR very quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-09-04T03:32:57.492+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"This comment is gold in text form.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2017-09-04T06:09:57.088+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bit of a read, but very, VERY good arguments.\n\nConcerning Janna's shield: What if her shield \"siphoned\" power from nearby enemies, instead of giving the full boost up front?
