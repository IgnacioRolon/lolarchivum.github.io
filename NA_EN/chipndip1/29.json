As such the majority of support items become niche because how many supports can effectively use something like unholy grail?  Supports have much more diversity in terms of the items they want than any other role, as such most items are niche items that have to be balanced around their abusers rather than the majority of champions.\n\nIt just makes sense right?  ROA can be built by just about any mage, even if a lot of them don't like it over other items.  That is because all mages want the same general stats.  Supports as a role though is highly diverse and supports fill in a lot of small niches that require niche items.\n\nThen there are a couple support items that just about any support can pick up, namely locket and to a lesser extent redemption.  These items are just solid support items like most other support items.  The difference is that they aren't niche, so almost any support can pick them up, just like how almost any mage can pick up a morello and be happy.\n\nWindspeakers and those shield items are part of a niche in support itemization, which I believe is why they are allowed to interact, because they are meant to add power in one area at the cost of other things (in their case usually combat stats)\n\nI don't think locket and redemption (post nerf) are exactly overtuned.  They are just good items and stand out because they are some of the few support items that aren't super niche.  Unlike most other items in the game they are also super visually apparent.  Sure that infinity edge does a lot of work, but does it look as impressive as giant glowing orbs enveloping the whole team as a sweet ass sound effect goes off?  Not really.\n\nLocket and redemtpion are good items that almost any support can pick up and they come with really powerful visual effects.  Those three things combined can make them seem really powerful when in reality they are just good items, kinda like how any crit ADC will pick up an infinity edge.\n\nVisual/sound input can have an amazing effect on how we interpret things, why do you think companies spend millions of dollars on advertisement?  Another way to put it is there was a gun in Halo I believe.  Everyone was always complaining about how it was super weak.  I got to talk to the guy who \"buffed\" it, stopping all the complaints.  He upped the sound on it.   No damage, no reload changes.  He just made the gun a bit louder.  No more complaints.\n\nSound/visuals are a major part of how we interpret things and Locket/redemption have some of the most powerful visual/sound effects in LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-02-17T19:44:42.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a fleshed out answer, and I appreciate that, but you're missing a few key things:\n\nLocket and Redemption ARE overpowered in comparison to their niche items. Not only are they generally strong...they're blatantly strong. At level 11, Locket gives a decaying 420 hp shield on 5 people. Yeah, it decays, but it starts at a high base and shields are primarily used against burst, rather than sustained damage, in the first place. Even if you were fighting sustained damage, damage comes out so fast in this game that you still get good gold value for it. Compare that to FotM or Knight's Vow. A weaker shield on less people and 12 damage off per 100 damage taken by an ally and 12 damage healed per 100 dealt by that ally. Look at how blatantly weak those sound compared to a 420 hp shield **at level 11**. It still gets more room to get even stronger + it can be increased by up to 50% of its overall power if you build full shield/heal power. That isn't an issue of being \"good, but generalized\". That's \"ridiculous in comparison to its competitors\".\n\nThis is basically why I keep making threads against Locket/Redemption (mainly Locket). Redemption is a key ingredient to the issue, but Locket is the main thing, ESPECIALLY since Riot failed horribly in making Locket less mandatory in the role. It's more mandatory now. If someone could take that type of insight into these items and STILL make a solid case for how they're balanced, I'd honestly concede the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-02-17T20:00:05.733+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBF Locket's power is mostly in it's active, the stats are just OK for a support.  Face of the Mountain has CDR on it as well as it is part of a core upgrade path that provides gold income and healing throughout the laning phase.  I am not sure the 3 core support items (relic, talisman, and spelltheif) are fair to compare to other items in the game because they fulfill a very core purpose in the support role while also being pretty much essential.\n\nAs for Knights Vow it is always up unlike locket, and reducing damage is only half of what it does, it also heals you as your carry does damage.  It is kinda hard to compare support itemization to each other because they aren't easy to compare.  Locket is a big shield, but it only lasts a short time and it has a pretty decent CD along with not providing anything for the team while it is down.  Knights vow comparatively is always useful so long as you have an ally near.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-02-17T21:30:41.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So let's assume that we forgive FotM because it's a gold gen item, and one could say that its gold gen properties are part of its overall power. It's a solid claim to make, so let's go with that.\n\nThat doesn't forgive Knight's Vow, or any non-gold gen item, though. Locket's extreme power comes from its extremely powerful active. Quite frankly, there's no real point in elaborating on if something's always up or not given the context. If something being timed allows for it to be blatantly stronger than its surroundings, then all items should be either timed or not timed. As it stands, it just shows that Riot can't balance support itemization around both actives and passives.\n\nBecause, like I said, Knight's Vow only mitigates 12 damage per 100 taken, and heals 12 per 100 dealt. That's saying that, in a 2k damage burst rotation, you only block 240 damage. Meanwhile Locket can ramp up to 600+ damage blocked on up to 5 people every 90 second. Sure, it's windowed, but we aren't in a constant state of team fighting. Once you team fight and blow the shield, by the next team fight after farming, claiming objectives, healing, and buying...the item's up again anyway. The potential power gained from it in comparison to anything else you can buy is heavily skewed, and that's before even looking at how bad some items are. Things like \"Why did Riot make Athene's depend on damage dealing when there's hardly any support items that emphasize any sort of damage dealing stat or play style?\"\n\nI hope what I'm saying is getting across, because it usually never does.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-02-18T00:57:40.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I get what you are saying, I just don't think you realize how influential constant power is.  It is the whole Aura effect all over again.  Auras tend to be removed because they have to be incredibly overtuned to make up for how weak they _feel_.  \n\nOld Taric is an excellent example.  Shortly before his rework he was considered one of the 5 worst champions in the game.  Yet his ult could be active more often then it was down, did damage, and granted over 12k gold worth of stats to his team.  It was one of the most ridiculously overpowered ultimates in LoL.  Most people didn't realize this because his ult felt weak since it was little more than an aura.\n\nIn the same way Knights Vow has a lot of power, you just don't notice it because it isn't obvious.\n\nLets look at some math though.\n\nKnights Vow: \nCost: 2300\nRaw Stats Value: 1764\nAbout 77% Gold efficient.\n\nLocket:\nCost: 2200\nRaw Stats Value: 1680\nAbout 77% Gold efficient.\n\nSo what can we conclude?  Base stats are equally gold efficient and thus not worth comparing.  We only need to look at the passive effects.\n\nKnights Vow:\n12% damage absorbsion + 12% healing from bonded's damage.\n15% Bonus movespeed towards bonded target.\n40 armour when near bonded target.\n\nLocket:\n70-665 shield, 90 second CD, does not stack, reduced locket effect for a short time.  Decays over 2.5 Seconds.\n\nWe can assume that since both these items are ally reliant we can run them both in optimal situations to compare them.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk lets get into the nitty gritty details.\n\nWe are assuming these are both operating under ideal conditions, that means you are near your bond for knight's vow and grouped as 5 for locket.\n\nKnights Vow:\n15% Movespeed = 592.5 Gold\n40 armour = 800 Gold\nDamage reduction/healing to be discussed.\n\nLocket:\nNow there is no gold efficiency stat for shields, but I think taking the gold efficiency of health and dividing it by it's uptime is fair right?  Logic is that you have that much health for that much uptime.\n\n665 health shield X 5 targets = 3325 health.  This has a roughly 3% uptime.  However during that uptime we lose 100% of the shield.  Therefore the actual amount of shielding per second we get is half that at 1.5% uptime.\n\nWe get roughly 50 health (rounding on the generous side) gold value from a locket shield on 5 targets every 90 seconds.  This means that the active on Locket is equal to 133 gold.\n\nOf course that is just looking at the raw statistical uptime value of Locket's shield, realistically it has more worth by virtue of being an anti burst mechanic.  In regards to that we have what I will assume is a more generous way of calculating it's value.\n\nLocket provides 3325 effective health gold value per cast.  This is meant to counter burst.  Lets take AP since that is the common AOE burst form that locket is best against.  I would say Brand's ult is the best example of something locket is designed to counter right?  Brand's ult has a 125% AP scaling and 1500 base damage total.  \n\nWe can take the base damage off what the shield negates (3325-1500 = 1825 shield left)  1825 shield vs a 125% AP scaling.  So for every 1.25 AP worth of gold we can call that equal to 1 point of shield.  That means the shield is worth 1460 gold of AP, or 31,755 gold.\n\nNow that is a lot of gold value, but we left out a few things.  The shield decays over time, which means that on average (especially vs something as delayed as Brand ult) we only get half the shield value per cast.  That lowers us to 15,878 gold of shield.\n\nFunny how looking at the same thing different ways can give such different results right?\n\nThat leaves us looking at the items like this:\n\nKnights Vow:\nBase stats + armour passive + movespeed passive = 3157 gold value\nThat is 137% gold efficiency so far.\n\nLocket:\n~800% gold efficiency under ideal circumstances.\n\nHowever I don't think that is fair.  Locket does, like it or not, have a CD.  That CD matters.  So I think we still need to apply that 3% uptime to the gold value because it matters when you don't have locket, and it matters a lot.\n\nSo 3% of that 15,878 gold value active is equal to 476 Gold.  Better than calculating the health uptime by a lot, but still not all that impressive.\n\nLocket (again):\nBase stats + active (with uptime included) = 2156.\nJust under 100% gold efficiency.\n\nOf course the calculations will differ depending on the ability you are using to calculate it's gold value.  I used Brand since that is the biggest general reason to buy a locket IMO as it hits all 5 targets and has a pretty good AP scaling.\n\nSo we can see that in terms of gold efficiency Knights Vow actually wins out even without having to do that damage taken/healed passive which is wonderful because I have no desire to math that shitfest out.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-02-18T02:53:14.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not gonna lie, it's refreshing to actually have a conversation on the topic for once.\n\nWith this said, I think the main thing I disagree with is how you work out shield gold value. A shield's value is basically \"effective health\", right? So a shield's value is only to be determined when it's used up. If you never hit a shield and it goes away, you gain nothing. If you use up its full value, you basically had that much bonus health for that small moment in time. I think it'd be fair to say that Locket's shield value is a spectrum based on its remaining shield strength. Of course, using that logic makes it hard to churn out numbers for, but it's the best way to pay respect to its possible strength as well as the strength of non-decaying shields, so long as they're actually struck.\n\nSo with that said, yes, I don't think someone should have to do the hard math to figure this shit out, because that's ridiculous. And yeah, you have a point that passives that are always up have value we don't pay attention to. However, something that remains is *context*. Why buy Knight's Vow when you'd buy it for protecting others, mainly carries, when good timing on Locket already does way, and I mean WAY, better at that job? Think of it like this: How much damage does one have to take in order for Knight's Vow to absorb, say, 600 damage? That'd be 5k damage. On one target. All that for Knight's Vow to mitigate just 600 damage for them. Meanwhile, Locket can and shows that you can block like 3k damage with it in one game. Why bother with Knight's Vow? Why bother trying to skew calcs for Locket's shield value when it's usually up for every team fight? For what it's used for and for how it's implemented, there's nothing Knight's Vow does that Locket can't do.\n\nAll that's on just Knight's Vow. Imagine comparing some of the even worse items. Perhaps a solution would be to put Locket on a significantly longer cd? That'd solve the issue with it being too powerful against items that are \"always on\" if it wasn't up every 90 seconds. It's practically never down for a team fight, so the value of having things that are designed to not be down is decreased by it tremendously.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-02-18T03:36:27.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh thank god you didn't ask me to math that lol.\n\nI totally agree that Locket has a lot of value in how it is used, which is why I also mathed it on how much gold worth of stats it blocks in one go, which was VERY high.

What I think makes the item problematic is the current meta - with so many assassins and AD casters being picked in every game Locket just becomes mandatory, as you said, since it acts as such a solid counter to stuff like {{champion:7}} 's passive proc or {{champion:202}} 's final shot from his ultimate. \n\nAs a lowly support main I definitely agree that it doesn't feel good to be forced into building Locket almost every game. I find that it's not so much rewarding when you use the active at the right time but more so frustrating when you don't get to use it the way you intended to. Furthermore, I feel like Enchantress supports especially are being affected by this assassin-heavy meta since... well try playing against {{champion:7}} or {{champion:157}} or \n{{champion:121}}  with {{item:2301}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3504}} as your core items... you'll get deleted before you even have a chance to react. Consequently what I dislike the most about items such as Locket (and Redemption to a lesser extent) is that they reduce the diversity in viable builds for Enchantress supports.\n\nTL, DR: Locket is frustratingly mandatory to build right now because the meta is full of high burst assassins and lethality abusers that force you to build a defensive item early to counter their mid game power spike.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-02-18T03:29:50.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing I have to correct here: Locket has been strong in nearly any type of meta. Tank ones. Assassin ones. Divers. Hell, even in ADC metas. Reason for it is simple, and that's the notion that a big, fat, aoe shield is never a strategically bad thing to build. It has no drawbacks or conditions save its own cool down, and that's the issue. Only thing I could think of in this situation is make the cd itself the main drawback, but then you get a Crucible situation where the item's down so long that you'd almost *never* build it. That's why I personally think the active needs looking into. It's way too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"BunnyStella","date":"2017-02-18T23:39:52.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree, personally I wish that Locket's power would be more connected to its stats rather than its active which would not only solve the issues you mentioned about the giant AoE shield being way too useful and versatile (*cough* pre-nerf {{champion:43}} *cough) but also make different supports feel good about going for what I'm *assuming* is their intended build path (obviously builds should be situational and also influenced by personal preference). When I play Lulu I'd rather build {{item:3504}} because I personally feel it synergises better with her base kit rather than being forced to build Locket to not be at a disadvantage because a) the enemy support is sure it get it and b) its active is just too good to pass up. It would be interesting for the item to have more situational uses, although I can't really picture a situation where a shield wouldn't be useful (unless it became a magic or physical shield only). Like I said - changing the stats on it so you don't just get some magic resistance and armour (I mean when are those stats ever not useful) could perhaps help to make the item less problematic. I also feel like that's the reason why Redemption had a lot of potential with the bonus heal/shield power it offered making it a great choice for enchantresses considering how well the active synergises with their kits - before everyone realised that the active is so good that even Vanguards build the item (even if they go top, e.g. {{champion:111}} ).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hay5eed","date":"2017-02-18T06:22:55.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is {{item:3190}} a thing?\nWhy is {{item:3107}} considered balanced?\nWhy is {{item:2049}} forced on every support?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-02-18T06:08:35.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is my decision process.\n\nI can go for damage items that have AP on them, or i can go for tank items that have HP/resists on them. Then I can got for main line items, or for support items in each category. \n\nDamage purchase \"value\" (what I use instead of gold efficiency when I think about whether to buy stuff) is pretty low UNLESS you reach a certain threshold (there are several of those, the big one being 120% of the enemy ADC's total HP pool), in which case it is worth a lot. Since I am playing a support reaching the value thresholds on damage is not feasible therefore tankyness who's value graph is much steeper with less \"value jumps\" is worth more than damage. Thus I generally build some form of tank.\n\nOnce I choose to go into tank stats there are really only a limited set of options. I can go with the locket / banner line, I can go knight's vow, can get redemption or go for the MBT items like randuin's omen.\n\nI value knight's vow very highly specifically because of the sustain and the damage reduction that I can give to a fellow diver (yes i put it on the jungler not on the ADC), but at that stage of the game I am mostly concerned about the enemy AP (mid lane) which is who I want to kill so I am looking at MR items specifically. Locket gives good MR which I can combine with HP from other items. It just seems like a superior choice to BV and SV, from my position as a support player (am I incorrect?).\n\nAs for the other support items being niche items. \n\nAside from {{item:3109}}  {{item:3504}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3107}}, non of the other support items fill their niche effectively. {{item:3512}} used to be a very good and fun item but now it only works in too limited a scenario and is useless for anything else {{item:3060}} does not push well enough on its own, does not occupy the enemy character for a long enough duation, does not help with sieges by offering a character that survives against the enemy AD {{item:3050}}  you don't get the active when you need it. {{item:3069}} {{item:3800}} can't close the gap well enough with these. {{item:3174}} only useful on supports that are heavily mana gated and they have to get it for this purpose {{item:3222}} follow up CC/burst already landed (unless you're a challanger playing on 0 ping).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hige","date":"2017-02-18T02:56:13.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knight's vow is also incredibly OP ._. but lethality has made people think Armor is not worth it -.-","replies":[]},{"poster":"no to toxic","date":"2017-02-17T21:58:57.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I tell you why: Cause it feels good to heal and shield your team for over 2000 dmg and then make them invincible for 2.5 seconds {{champion:44}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-02-17T18:17:04.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"somehow Riot simply loves Shields.\n\nit's the most overloaded thing in the game.\nwe still need some Items or other ways to counter Shields.\n\nLike items/a mastery that increases your Damage against Shields by a percentage.","replies":[]}]}
