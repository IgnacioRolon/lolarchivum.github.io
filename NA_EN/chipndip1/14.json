They can't do damage, they can't tank, all they have is situational things. Granted, used tactically, those can be huge in both laning and teamfights, but even so. Take away a mage support's damage in favor of utility, and they can't accomplish much in the long run unless they're absurdly on the ball with their kit, and take enough utility off the damage and you may as well just go midlane (although I take {{champion:161}} support half the time I get filled, so there's that too)\n\nHeaven forbid a support should actually be able to be helpful if their lane is doing poorly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-29T02:00:13.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if riot can actually balance them for once then i'd be all for it\n\nonly if they introduce some bruiser supports though hehe","replies":[]}]}
