Because they don&#039;t sympathize with laners or admit that they fucked up with their priorities/pathing. Jungling is easy to mess up, and if your eye&#039;s not on the map to witness things that need tampering with, you probably shouldn&#039;t be jungling. Yet these junglers will up and blame laners for actually needing their jungler to do something instead of admitting that they should have been there to do that thing.\r\n\r\nSure, laners can be stupid, but junglers are no different. You&#039;re just as stupid as the next laner, and the next laner can be just as stupid as the next jungler, so I don&#039;t get or care to get jungler sob stories. You guys tend to grind my gears too...but not as much as toxic adcs, usually...at least there&#039;s that.","replies":[]}
