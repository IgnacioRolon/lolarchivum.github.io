If I'm getting bot lanes that go 1/7/0 in laning phase, shove blindly without warding, ignore mia's and danger pings, and FORCE fights vs enemies they fed (as though they stand a better chance of winning now that the enemy has 1500 gold more in items and they couldn't win when it was even in gold); I want to lose less Ip for this if I perform above average. The problem is, much of this can be immeasurable by statistics. Kda can be a horrible indicator. Gold farmed - well, we've seen in the pro scene some of the best adc's don't actually have the highest gpm, but when you look at their opponent's gpm, it is half of what is expected from that opponent because that best adc zones the opponent off farm so well.\nSimilarly, you might have low kill participation, but be winning a difficult matchup while being camped by the enemy jg or constantly roamed on by the enemy mid and bot laners or top laner. So it LOOKS like you did little to help your team, but in reality, you absorbed a TON of pressure, remained relevant, kept up map pressure as much as possible, and still won 2v2's or 1v1's whenever not being ganked. Or maybe, you got your opponent's tower really low w/o any help from your team, but then due to need for lane rotations an inopportune fight causing you to have to leave, you miss out on killing the tower and the gold it gives; then it just goes into stats as an accomplishment by minions or your teammates while it doesn't look half as amazing in your stat line even though you did most of the work. Conversely, you could feed all of laning phase, get carried by your teammates mid game, be relevant in terms of damage by late game, carry ONE fight all game, and win. Then, if you'd \"ks'd\" well in those mid game fights to become relevant, you have an amazing kda; meanwhile, your teammate who had to carry those midgame fights and die every time so your team would come out ahead has a mediocre kda by game's end even though he/she did much more work than you. Thus, your Ip gain might be inflated while his/hers might be lower than it should be based on actual performance. Stuff like that is the only problem I can see with making Ip gain/loss performance-based.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FourVsFive","date":"2017-12-13T20:23:19.076+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Afkers should lose more LP and feeders.

There are so many people of varying skill levels and so many variables that the system can only be so accurate when it comes to judging how good you are. I have a dozen friends that play at all levels (bronze-diamond) and while a few of them definitely belong where they are I can honestly say most of them are pretty even skill wise. Ranked is more about who's willing to put in the time and effort to move up as opposed to who's actually better. I've also spectated literally hundreds of games over the years (especially back when it was easily accessible on the client) and I see absolutely no difference in play between gold and diamond games. Hell, I've even watched challenger/pro players in solo queue and it's nothing like people would expect (LCS) and even those games become massive blood baths of people feeding with low cs counts. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying this is written fact, there are definitely outliers of extremely skilled (or unskilled players) in ranks they may or may not deserve to be in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Battalion","date":"2017-12-13T09:16:41.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm unaware of these \"SR\" gains.

For example, there were several people playing only Mercy with around 35% win rate in Grandmaster (basically Challenger) who got there solely by hiding and not participating in the game and then using their ult to revive their entire team at any time they could, even if it was a total waste and it throws the game. Sure, they got a lot of big revives off, but a lot of them were detrimental to the team or complete wastes. The game didn't consider that though and just looked at the big numbers.\nTo put it in League terms, imagine if you could get to Challenger as Soraka by just staying in fountain and ulting every time your team got low HP.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2017-12-13T18:02:15.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leetri,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ITHPP6nX,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-12-13T16:26:00.304+0000)\n>\n>\n> To put it in League terms, imagine if you could get to Challenger as Soraka by just staying in fountain and ulting every time your team got low HP.\n\nand it isn't possible\n\nso why are we making this thread?","replies":[{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2017-12-13T21:33:01.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=D357R0Y3R,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ITHPP6nX,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-12-13T18:02:15.222+0000)\n>\n> and it isn&#x27;t possible\n> \n> so why are we making this thread?\n\nBecause if it was ever implemented it'd be a trash idea because of outliers like that\n\nOverwatch had to keep tweaking ranked so SR gains on every hero was balanced and it still penalizes you if you swap heroes which is a core game mechanic because it only cares about your scores for the average for that hero.  It makes competitive rank you wildly low unless you're a one trick and a bunch of one tricks are getting temp bans for \"Refusing to communicate\" so its a fucking mess overall.  \n\nNow given everyone selects roles beforehand and you get one champion the one trick thing is less relevant but if there were metrics like wards placed or successful ults giving you bonus LP you could end up with scenarios like he mentioned, where a Soraka warding in shitty spots but rapidly and pressing R in fountain to boost the healing # would basically reduce LP loss or increase LP gains despite not actually factoring game contribution, merely your average compared to other players on that champ.  Riot has no plans to implement this system but anyone that suggests this should be aware of the consequences of trying to implement this mess of a feature just to buffer LP loss in hard games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2017-12-13T22:58:38.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The fuck is SR?","replies":[]}]}
