Senna highlights a massive problem with the enchanter roster","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"**THEY'RE FUCKING BORING**\n\nThat's the short version, lemme give the in-depth version here: I've been playing League since season 5. Been a long time, yo. Since I started playing, we've seen one new enchanter kit in any shape or fashion. Literally. Think of all the marksmen since Kalista. All the assassins. All the juggernauts. We got some mages, too. We've had a whole slew of supports. That's not even considering all the reworks for these champion sub-classes. Meanwhile, enchanters, since Nami, didn't get anything in terms of reworks (like Taric, Poppy, Urgot, Nunu, and so on) or new kits until Yuumi...like 7 years later.\n\nSo here's my issue: These enchanter kits feel like super dry takes on the exact same play style and concept while all the more interesting kit ideas are used elsewhere.\n\nAOE healing area ult when you take down a target so your team can clean up? {{champion:114}} Why is this here and not on someone else? {{champion:114}} \n\nMassive global damage/shield ult? {{champion:235}} I get it, and it makes Senna pretty fun, but come on. {{champion:235}} \n\nTargeted ability that does 0 damage but makes it so a specific enemy can't escape? {{champion:164}} On a support, this would make some cool synergies, but on Camille, it kinda just nullifies the existence of Vi. {{champion:164}}\n\nDelayed, aoe stun that you'd expect would be amazing for shutting down aggressive divers and vanguards? {{champion:518}} Nah we put that shit on the burst mage that spends fights spell slinging from a distance {{champion:518}} \n\n{{champion:10}} I'm still wondering why the ally-usable invincibility ult is on a fucking hyper-carry instead of an enchanter...or even a support at all. {{champion:10}}\n\nHell, Yuumi, who was initially designed to attach onto front liners, would have made a ton of sense with an ult like Camille's, which would enable front liners to pick off caught targets...but they gave her a delayed, aoe root. Idk...\"neat\"?\n\nThis isn't me saying that these other champs are a mistake, or are bad, or are overloaded, or whatever. This is me saying that all the cool ideas aren't being allocated to enchanters, so OF COURSE enchanters are usually fucking boring to play for most people. All most of them do is just spam heal. Even Yuumi's being pushed in that direction now. There's so much emphasis on the heal button and they don't even think of interesting ways to incorporate them into the kits, but then Senna comes out with a line skill shot heal/attack and an aoe global skill shot shield/attack. When do we get something cool for enchanters, for crying out loud? **Enchanters are really dusty, boring champions, Riot.**\n\nEdit: Before this thread gets silently down vote spammed for no good reason, I've played way more of the enchanter sub-class specifically than plenty of people play League of Legends in any capacity, so I'm not biased against enchanters.\n\nEdit 2: When I say \"No enchanter has been reworked since\", I mean *a new kit,* like a game play update, not just some shuffling of numbers and calling it a day.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-12-26T20:47:43.072+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka's been reworked since Nami.\nKarma has been reworked since Nami.\nJanna has been reworked since Nami.\n\nRakan was released. \nYuumi was released. \nBard was released.\n\nP.S.

If you do, you will disrupt her W viability, heal out of a 80% damage hit, and all she has left is her Q and R, and her Q is in no position to outtrade/kill you and R won't execute. If she doesn't escape, she's dead. If she tries to chase and do it again, you can bait her into a bush since she has no nontarget dashes.\n\nZed: Tougher. Might need some armor items, or and if a Novice a Zhonya's. You can dodge shadows, so keep moving. If he manages 60% of your HP, heal, but save Q and R for after he has used his Living Shadows, or he will just shadow through the CC. If you go into this fight expecting him to outtrade you and play the first half defensively to just survive his R, you can win. If you're scared of R and try to pre-empt it, you'll usually die.\n\nTalon: Just predict where he will have to run when he R's. Move in a perpendicular motion from where he R's or Q's as to avoid Bleed procs. If you can land a bubble after he has failed a Q, it's your trade.\n\nQiyana/Akali: Just wait until they shroud, and track their visibility. If you learn to spot stealth shimmers, you can land CC even in their protected status, and if you can waste their time using their unpredictability, you can force a trade when they are visible. If Akali lands an E, make sure to save a self Q for if she begins the dash animation, Cast R in her direction, and you will have a secure 3-4 second stun, and she will be lower on mana. If she has R still, you might lose this one, or just use the CC to escape and reset.\n\nFizz Diana Ekko: Build Resists.

They reworked her to remove those abilities and she's been *largely the same heal bot* since. Even if we wanted to give Soraka the second \"rework\", that's still 5 years since Riot's said \"Hey, let's TRY to make an enchanter kit that isn't the same old shit slapped together slightly differently\".\n \n\n> Karma was simplified. All abilities boosted to compensate.\n\nThey're all boring as hell. Karma mains have been complaining about it for so long they got bored of doing so. The primary complaint I see about Karma *to this day* when it comes from people that dislike this iteration is how *boring* it is. The point is that they changed the champions from being overbearing way back in the day and never came back to the sub-class to make them *interesting* after gutting all their kits from what they used to be.\n\n> Janna's rework is MUCH stronger and actually puts her into the game instead of being a bot.\n\nYou have NO IDEA what Janna used to be able to do if you think this. E on a way shorter cd? Passive movement speed in all directions? Higher values on her E and R? Janna spent much of season 6 getting chain nerfed until they were forced to \"rework\" her to gut her, then had to nerf her some more. Janna's a shell of what she once was if you're talking about pure effectiveness in the game.\n\n> Rakan is a dual class\n\nJust because you have a heal, doesn't mean you're an enchanter. Alistar is not an enchanter, no? Rakan is not a defensive champion. He makes picks and plays. If anything, he's *most vulnerable* when used defensively, as he's forced to clump with allies while being fired on by aoes if he wants to shield or heal them. He's a catcher.\n\n> Bard literally has 2 enchanter functions: Stasis\n\nWHEN HAS STASIS BEEN AN ENCHANTER-SPECIFIC FUNCTION TO MAKE THIS CLAIM?\n\nAnd as for the heal: His healing is just a laning tool at best. After laning it's more a MS tool for catching people than it is a heal.\n\n> You dismissing Nami as simple just tells me your actual credibility level.\n\n1.4 million mastery on the champion and 2.6 million on Sona.\n\n> Because speed doubling waves, and Book, are not interesting.\n\nNami's ult is \"OK\", actually. Doesn't excuse Riot being this lazy with the class after making the champion in 2012, but I wouldn't complain about Nami's ult specifically. Yuumi's ult is pretty boring, but at least her W's something different. None of it excuses how lazy they've been with addressing the rest of the sub-class when they double-triple-quadra dip into marksmen and juggernauts *over and over and over* again for the past few years, now. The game doesn't even need this many marksmen in it since they all do the same shit, anyway, but they're infatuated with making them. All I'm asking for is for some effort.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HamburgerJunior","date":"2019-12-29T08:05:20.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard isn't an enchanter, karma wasn't really reworked as much as she was objectively obliterated having everything that made her unique and cool taken away.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keiaga","date":"2019-12-26T22:01:02.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds more like enchanters are personally not your cup of tea, and not that enchanters as a concept are flawed.

Cam has true damage on a low cd vs. Vi's cute little W that doesn't even have an active.\n\nShield passive? Cam gets double the scaling value (20% vs. 10%) vs. the type of target she's facing so it's just bona-fide better.\n\nOutside of Riot tuning numbers, why would I EVER want Vi over Cam? Vi is trash.\n \n> Champions are roles sure, but they're also characters.  Even though Fiora is best at splitpushing, and an AoE heal forr a good ult isn't the most efficient thing for her, it makes sense and feels right on a character-driven, lore-based level.\n\n...there's plenty of other benefits you could gain for stabbing up your target than an aoe heal. An *single target heal to herself,* for example? Maybe boosted stats for a small period? I'm not even super mad about Fiora having the heal, but it shows how little they think of making enchanters more exciting in comparison to damn near any other class in the game. They hardly even bother trying to begin with.\n \n> A hyper-carry like Kayle is also an angel of justice...\n\n*THAT ISN'T EVEN THE POINT.* You can be an \"angel of law and order\" in a *myriad of ways* that can fit \"hyper carry\" more than **targeted invincibility** of all things. And, once again, even if we just leave it as it is, why is it that she gets THAT and enchanters get shit like \"A slightly more powerful version of my Q skill shot\" or \"A line stun...that's literally it\" or \"a knock back with a heal tacked onto it\". It's all so incredibly basic.\n\nPersonally, I don't even like Kayle's ult, but it makes the case of \"Why are we putting these support-like effects on carry ultimates?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Keiaga","date":"2019-12-26T22:47:17.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your incapability, or refusal to fully comprehend a differing opinion is astounding.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2019-12-26T23:06:32.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keiaga,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kpXGrHl9,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2019-12-26T22:47:17.178+0000)\n>\n> Your incapability, or refusal to fully comprehend a differing opinion is astounding.\n\nHere's the thing: I read what you said and responded.

GP, a carry, can, but no enchanter can. Blocking AAs? That's on Jax and Shen. Blocking skill shots? Braum and Yasuo. Invincibility? Taric's got some...and he kinda dips in to the enchanter play style, so we'll give Riot 1/2 a point for it. But the point is, and I'ma bold this so we're on the same page, that **Riot hasn't put much effort into designing kits for champions that are PRIMARILY ENCHANTERS that are exciting or new, whether that's reworks or new kits. Most of them fall back into the same trappings, with similar strengths, weaknesses, and play styles. It's boring.** Even Yuumi is now being pushed this way more and more because the Garen/Yuumi strat is really fucking toxic to deal with.\n\nOnce again, it's not that enchanters are icky, otherwise I wouldn't have a combined total of 4 million mastery between two of them. It's that Riot's hardly innovating in that space unless they make it a \"enchanter splash on a warden/marksman/whatever kit\" like they did Taric and now Senna.

Lulu does a small amount of poke with a focus on shielding her ADC and CCing the enemy. Yuumi is literally a force multiplier. Soraka heals, Slows, Roots, Silences. etc. These champs aren't independent agents. They exist to be a force multiplier for their team. Senna is an Independent agent. Her primary purpose is to be a secondary ADC who doesn't need gold funneling like standard ADC's to function. the only part of senna where I go \"Oh yea that is actually a support ability\" is her ult.\n\nPyke is an assassin. Pure and simple. While I don't think he is a support. He at least hides his true purpose better than senna. His Q is single target giving him poor wave clear, His E cant hit minions, His W is just a repositioning tool.

We SHOULD NOT be using Senna (or Pyke for that matter) as ideals for what supports should be like. They are not healthy for the game.
