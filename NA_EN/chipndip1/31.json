They use it to block them off and the slow compliments that. The main goal is to block the enemy off which Aniva's wall does exactly that but better.\n\nIn the case of Jarvan and Bei Fong they both use their ults to secure a kill or force a fight. Jarvan's can be used to do this but Camile's ult does it better mainly because no one can escape from it.\n\nI wasn't arguing the supplamented reason, just the main one.
