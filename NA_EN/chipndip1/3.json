How so? Lemme break this down and explain.\n\n**Regardless of how you feel about them, they offer involving game play for both parties:**\n\n{{champion:84}} \n\nShe excels in targeting back line targets. She excels in taking advantage of carries, who largely use targeted damage. Playing into her strengths leads people into a bad time, and it *feels bad* when you play into bad match-ups. However, she&#039;s not that great in team fights without a lead, and she&#039;s not that great in late game scenarios (like most energy champs are). Her shroud enables her to calmly maneuver during dives, true, but she can&#039;t up and blink out of danger without sacrificing almost all of her kill potential, unlike some other assassins like K6 or LeBlanc. Her strongest tools are also on her longest cds. If you play around her shroud and E, play the neutral well, and *don&#039;t play into obviously bad match-ups,* Akali&#039;s basically an auto-loss for her own team.\n\n{{champion:142}} \n\nHer tuning aside, Zoe&#039;s design as a whole is significantly better than people give it credit for. Her spells are generally &quot;meh&quot; ranged at best unless you utilize the different aspects in her kit. She doesn&#039;t have any escapes or lane sustain, either. Her best self-peel option is a skill shot hard cc that can be blocked by minions and delays in activation. There&#039;s also a ton of in-game ways to mitigate Zoe&#039;s overall effectiveness {{summoner:1}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3140}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3222}}. She IS strong in the jungle, and she does have strong flanks. If she gets fed, she does what a burst mage is gonna do and pops people. Picking her into something that can't aggressively run her down is perfect, but divers, vanguards, assassins, and attentive supports that actually buy Crucible all make Zoe&#039;s infinite life way harder. Riot would be smart to deal with her overall tuning, but her core game play is actually fine if you&#039;re using your head while you play. Don&#039;t play into the jungle where she has a plethora of walls. Play in lanes, pack some spellshields and cleanses, and run her over.\n\n{{champion:157}} \n\nThe undying poster boy of League salt. There&#039;s a good reason why his strongest lane is bot lane, even if no one plays it. Despite his *potential to carry,* Yasuo&#039;s early game, between shoving waves hard with E and Q and having no strong escape tools to avoid ganks or undo a bad engage, is heavily exploitable. Sure, he double his crit chance, but that passive means *unlike Riven, Fiora, and other skirmishers, Yasuo needs to build crit, which makes him insanely glass while being melee ranged.* Sure, he has a shield, but any champ damage knocks it off. Sure, he can ult off of any knock-up, but *he can&#039;t move when he ults, so you can just hard-cc him.* Much of all of Yasuo&#039;s benefits come with some deterrent or another that keeps him weighed down, and the nature of his risky game play causes him to fall short of success time and time again unless you&#039;re pulling the champ off properly. The enemy needs to keep harassing him and whittling him down, and he needs to dodge enemy fire and land combos. The whole gig is harder than it looks, and having a support to work off of makes Yasuo&#039;s life way easier since there&#039;s someone there to bail him out so he won&#039;t feed.\n\n{{champion:429}} \n\nEvery designer has designed at least one bad champ and this is me being fair and honest in this thread.\n\n**Aight, so what&#039;s the point of all this?** The point is that if you take the time to think on it critically, most of CT&#039;s designs have clear strengths and weaknesses. Most of CT&#039;s designs are high skill cap designs, as well. They&#039;re easier to mess up on, but they also offer strong options when utilized properly. It also brings us to the main point to make here, which is that this is the ultimate goal of champion design. Champions that are rewarding when played, crap when played bad, feel impactful when they do things, and are involving experiences for both them and the opponent. Most of CT&#039;s designs have these values baked into each one, if we&#039;re going to be honest with ourselves.\n\n**So why do people hate them so much?** If you ask me, it&#039;s because OTHER designs don&#039;t have these traits. Lemme explain:\n\nMarksmen: Their game play feels bad until it doesn&#039;t, or doesn&#039;t until it does. Because they&#039;re mostly balanced around the timer, rather than their own abilities, they feel limp-dick until they land items, and then they terrorize the entire rift. Shutting them down becomes increasingly difficult and there&#039;s very little to play around in this regard, but if they aren&#039;t like this, then they&#039;re in a state where being able to do anything of impact or merit is a greater challenge than 3D printing intelligent life.\n\nEarly-game divers like Diana/Wukong/Vi: You get that impactful feeling when you blast the life out of someone, but it&#039;s not very involving game play when Diana or Wu just slams into someone. If that one gimmick doesn&#039;t work (ass-blasting), you&#039;re left with no cds and you kinda flounder and die. Feels bad as hell, and their players feel slighted when they get nerfed because they see other more complex champions do all these flips and tricks and shit while their own champ gets nerfed for dashing and hitting someone, but front-loaded 1-shots from a mile away (or even stealth) isn&#039;t very engaging game play for anyone but you.\n\nOlder tanks: Tanks like Malph, Amumu, Rammus, and even tanky picks like Mundo and Trundle are or can be good champs objectively, but regardless of if they are or aren&#039;t, their game play is bland. They&#039;re rewarding for...like...one button in their entire kits, or they just stat check the shit out of people, but translating that objective success into success the player perceives is hard to do. Maybe Trundle beating your shit down is kinda cool at times, but for the most part, older tank designs have issues with people appreciating what they&#039;re even doing. It doesn&#039;t *feel* like they&#039;re doing that much, and when someone like Akali or Yasuo&#039;s dancing around you, it garners spite.\n\nHighly reliable champs (Annie/Sona/Garen/Kayle): When it&#039;s hard to create lower lows for a champ, your highs have to be controlled in rather unbecoming ways as well. Usually you get the marksman treatment, where your scalings are your gates to enjoyment, and they open or close depending on what Riot decides for you. Yeah, what those champs over there are doing looks cooler and more fun, but you&#039;re objectively more reliable than them, so Riot has to cut down on what you get to do because what you do is stronger due to reliability, which isn&#039;t *fun,* but it works so they can rework someone else.\n\nThe main point is *perception versus reality.* CT&#039;s champs feel impactful and powerful to a point where people grossly overestimate their strength, while people undervalue others on the roster, including their own champions. This is how someone like Sona, Janna, Nami, or Jax can quietly acquire a 54% win rate and no one bats an eye, but a CT champ on a 50% win rate causes hell to break loose. They feel way stronger and influential than they actually are in solo queue...which is good. A champion SHOULD make you feel like you&#039;re strong and influential. You SHOULD feel empowered to play a champion. The issues occur when everyone else around you feels like you&#039;re too good in comparison to them because their own game play experience doesn&#039;t get close to yours. Not objectively, but based on perception.\n\n**So what&#039;s the remedy?**\n\nWell, there&#039;s a few aspects for CT designs that I think needs to be integrated into more champ designs.\n\n1) Each skill in a champ&#039;s kit needs to be important. CT designs are usually kits that rely on most of, or all of, their basic spells in neutral game play to make the kit work right. Many older designs have these sort of &quot;dead weight&quot; abilities that are OBVIOUSLY there to make build orders simpler. Teemo, for example, has only one active basic ability. Vi doesn&#039;t have an active on her W as well. Sona&#039;s E is so forgettable that most people put a point in it at levels 4 through 8 rather than level 3. On the other hand, I don&#039; think a Thresh or a Yasuo would work even remotely well if you just up and didn&#039;t care about one of their buttons.\n\n2) There needs to be some part of the champion&#039;s kit that players are actively working towards/against. Most CT designs have SOMETHING that&#039;s on a pretty short cd that players are encouraged to play around. Akali&#039;s Q, Yasuo&#039;s E and Q, Darius&#039;s passive, Warwick&#039;s Q, Zoe&#039;s everything...there needs to be something to keep the players engaged relatively constantly.\n\n3) Avoid front-loading. Most CT&#039;s designs actively avoid front-loading damage. What this does is that it allows you to create more opportunities for players to outplay each other. Sure, Yasuo&#039;s zipping through minions, but at least he&#039;s not Dian-ass blasting you, so you have the time to assess your situation and attempt to react. This is the reasoning behind Darius needing to stack his passive before slamming you with his ult. This is the reason for Zoe needing to land her E before blasting you with a paddle star (sure, if it hits from a long distance, it hurts like hell, but note she has to send the move backwards, then send it flying forwards. You have plenty of time to dodge it, and if she does the prep from out of vision, it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s some massive .2 second burst option). This is the reason for Akali&#039;s damage being baked into her passive and the delayed second shot of her ult. When you aren&#039;t super front-loaded, you create a space where you&#039;re allowed more room for bells and whistles because you&#039;re less reliable. Those extra bits seem cool and strong, but what&#039;s stronger between Akali dancing in her shroud or Rengar just murdering you in a singular jump and walking off? \n\nIn shorter terms, designing more well-rounded basic abilities with a clear game play goal in mind that isn&#039;t extremely bursty upon contact, that&#039;s what will give champion designs more room for cooler and more fun tools to utilize in the game so people don&#039;t feel like they&#039;re missing out or playing something that&#039;s less capable than a CT champ, which drains the fun out of those match-ups despite the reality of the situation.\n\nIf anyone wants to discuss, feel free to do so below.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-08-31T23:43:44.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved!","replies":[]},{"poster":"haaaaaaalp","date":"2018-09-01T00:33:09.581+0000","up_votes":108,"down_votes":0,"body":"His champions are well designed for rpgs or fighting games but not for Mobas.\n\nMobas are fun because they are a mix of both micro and macro play.

Every champion has weaknesses. CertainlyT champions on average get more tools to deal with weaknesses than other champions.

That isn't exactly exclusive to certainlyT's champions, just happens to be more prominent with his champions. Older champions tend to be healthier as they held onto a lot of the design choices that were picked up from dota.\n\n> Regardless, as I said, you keep making claims without backing them up and it&#x27;s kind of getting old.

He tries to give them a tool in every situation which in turns trivialize the macro aspects of the game. Refer to my previous post for more detail. \n\nFor healthier counterparts, compare akali to something like templar assassin. They both do a good job of taking down squishy targets while still maintaining some damage against heartier ones. Their weakness in theory is that they are weak to lockdown, especially targetted ones, and can be focused down in team fights. Templar assassin has defensive tools in refraction and meld but she is still vulnerable to both targetted and aoe lockdown and focus fire. With akali, on the other hand, certainlyT tries to cover up the main weaknesses by giving her protection against targetted lockdown and making it impossible for a team to focus her down even if they hit with aoe lockdown.\n\nCompare yasuo to something like storm spirit. They both stronger scaling carries who rely on mobility and dancing around the enemy team in team fights with their damage and cc. While storm trades off this strength with no inherent defensive abilities and low mobility during the laning phase, certainlyT tries to cover yasuo's weakness with windwall and dashes starting at level 2.\n\nCompare zoe or kalista to pretty much any mage or marksmen counterpart in any moba, I really shouldn't have to spell out why they are problematic for their archetype.\n\nI will admit, I do not believe darius and thresh are nearly as big of a problem as the rest. I should probably clarify then that I don't believe everything certainlyT touches goes to shit, just that on average he tries to give his champions a few too many tools to cover their weaknesses and that the game would be healthier with less of his original designs as opposed to more which was proposed by the topic creator.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-09-01T23:05:50.095+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's my issue: I say \"compare these champs to champs in their sub-class\" and you literally go to another game to pick out examples.

Ekko is a healthier skirmisher than yasuo but what exactly does that tell us about how to make yasuo healthy? We aren&#x27;t going to make yasuo into ekko because we already have ekko. Kha&#x27;zix without his permanent camoflauge is a healthier assassin than akali but what does that tell us about how to make akali healthy? Xerath is a healthier champion design for a long range poke/burst mage than zoe but what does that tell us about how to make zoe healthy?\n\n1) Ekko's an assassin, not a skirmisher.\n\n2) Xerath's an artillery mage, not a burst mage.\n\nMain point: Then you define different aspects of kits and design choices that are healthier that can be implemented in future kits. Not verbatim, but the philosophies behind them. Also, if you make that point, you state **why.** So far you've left all the explaining and position defending to me and me alone while disagreeing with nothing to back it up, and you're apparently oblivious to that fact. You say Khaz is healthier design than Akali. **Why?** If you ask me, Khaz is more front-loaded than Akali and has more freedom of movement while stealthed, which is more liberating than being tied to a area. His general niche as a champion is simply \"pick off isolated targets\", which isn't all that \"niche\" for an assassin since all of them generally do that anyway. If you want to make the point, be prepared to defend that point, because this forum doesn't allow you to just downvote these things away.\n \n> Looking at healthier counterparts in league doesn&#x27;t do too much because we don&#x27;t want to make certainlyT&#x27;s champions into carbon copies of other champions in league.

Ekko's mix of sustain and burst damage lets him do a better job in prolonged duels with tanks than in blowing up backlines in team fights. He also can blow up a marksmen as fast as riven but faces the same issues getting to the backline as her.\n\nAlso, if i remember correctly, riot changed the term melee adc to skirmisher specifically because of ekko not being ad.\n\n> 2) Xerath&#x27;s an artillery mage, not a burst mage.\n\nZoe is an artillery mage who also gets massive burst and a bit more defensive options than she should have, that is her problem. Xerath is what she would be if she was healthier although again, we aren't going to make 2 copies of xerath.\n\n> Main point: Then you define different aspects of kits and design choices that are healthier that can be implemented in future kits.

Kha has good burst, good pick potential but also good counterplay in that a team can target cc and focus him in a team fight. Akali is poorly designed because certainlyT tried to cover up those weaknesses with shroud and end up making a balance nightmare who will probably be permabanned through worlds after which the balance team kalista's her numbers. \n\n> So you&#x27;re saying you can&#x27;t draw examples from League&#x27;s champions when it comes to designing League&#x27;s champions...but you should draw from DOTA and THEIR designs, which are designed around a different game with different logistics entirely, in order to create better League of Legends champions.\n\nAgain, because league is not going to make 2 champions that are carbon copies of each other. If they have champion x to fulfill one niche, they won't make a second champion y to do be a carbon copy.

I answered your question but where did that get us? We aren't anywhere closer to fixing certainlyT's champions because even if ekko, kha, and xerath are healthier counterparts to yasuo, akali, and zoe, we aren't going to make CT's champions into carbon copies of other champions in league. What we can do, however, is pull elements from dota champions who share certain aspect like storm spirit as a hypermobile scaling carry to improve yasuo in a way that does not make him into just another champion in league.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-09-01T03:05:16.431+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=haaaaaaalp,realm=NA,application-id=ELUpwER8,discussion-id=28nNMfnH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-09-01T00:33:09.581+0000)\n>\n> Mobas are fuming because they are a mix of both micro and macro play.

Kalista has a crap tier win rate because her design was so bad that the balance team decided to just nerf her into being unviable until she gets reworked (and had to take an unprecedented step in nerfing her autoattack to .9 ad just to do so). Winrates are tricky when discussing how well designed a champion is because of external factors like high ban rates artificially deflating winrates or the balance team simply keeping a champion underpowered. \n\nHis champions are badly designed for all elo brackets in a moba for the reasons I outlined above. Keep in mind that is different from saying his champions are overpowered or underpowered.

Promoting discussion is fine but it really shouldn't be at the expense of game health. \n\nGameplay's problem has never been that unhealthy discussion gets downvoted into oblivion.

Instead of looking for controversial posts about topics that have been discussed to death, why not look to bring up ones about less talked about issues?\n\nAlso, my biggest problem with putting this specific topic is the fact that certainlyt's champion flaws have already been discussed to death.

At the same time, his windewall and E give him all the tools needed to play around ranged opponents, while his Q+R give him high kill preasre vs any squishy with little retaliation due cc-chain and the passive-shield refresh, while the low cd on Q and high AAdps and his ult %pen mean he can shred tanky targets aswell. They only thing that really shuts him down is reliable burst/cc that he can't windwall or that has less CD than windwall.\nHe also has very little downtimes to play around, windwall in the early but most combos that get denied by it have a not **much **lower cd, same for the passive shield, and his ult though compared to other ults it's also up often.\nAnd he's not even weak in teamfights for beeing so strong in nearly any 1v1, if he has a reliable aoe-displace, he can add alot to wombos and his cleanup potential is huge.\nAnd you also can't say play it save early and outscale, cause he scales pretty massive with a nasty two item spike.\n\n\n\nAkali goes a bit in the same direction, either you make her you're bitch or you're her plaything, very few matchups are in between, though her design has more potential with proper tuneing(more sustain, less upfront damage)\n\nAnd Zoe is just from start to finish disgusting. Her Q+R is basically the thing nida got reworked for, her E through walls is disgusting and has the bubble funktions as unecessary savety net, her W is a pure disaster and never should have been alowed into the game, her CDs overall are so low that you have no real downtimes, and as long as she has something on her W or a summoner, she's very save vs dives with the massive movement boost her W gives, and you can't really use summoners or item actives vs her, which makes engageing on a champ that usually is 1-2 screens away rather difficult.\nMaybe if the W gets fully replaced by something else and her Q+E get visible through the fog of war(and with some solid audio cue or less missle speed) she might be fine, but with the disgusting abomination that is her W and the low counteroly her Q+E offers through terrain, she's staying an issue.\n\n\nHis designs are just horrible to play against and mostly boil down to abuseing mistakes of the CT-champ, which means it all comes down to how the CT-champ plays, with some hardcounter exeptions that usually leave the CT-champ with little to no option.\nIt's just a binary experience quite often because they have extreme highs and extreme lows and overly focused on mechanics over proper tactical windows or strategic counter options other than hardcounters duering champ select.\n\nNow the only thing one has to say for CT is that he's by far not the onlyone, most of the new designs go similar directions basically since S5, and i dislike them all for that, though he really deleivered nearlly all his designs in that form and frequently managed to rach a new 'highscore' for that kind of design, with zoe so far beeing by far the worst design that every haunted the rift.\n---------------------\n\n> Each skill in a champ's kit needs to be important. CT designs are usually kits that rely on most of, or all of, their basic spells in neutral game play to make the kit work right. \n\nNope, Yasuo often had top as his best lane, where most of his matchups completely ignore his windwall so his kit definitly is totally funktional without one of his arguably most powerfull tools already.\n\nZoe does 80% of her gameplay without her W, it's just the little topping that pushes her from very annoying to WTF IS THAT BULLSHIT, saveing her ass ever so often while bringing that extra damage+mobillity that makes the difference between forceing a recall and getting a straight kill.\n\nKallistas E basically is only a gimick that you could remove from her kit and hardly anyone would notice...\n----------------------------\n\n>there needs to be something to keep the players engaged relatively constantly.\n\nJust No, this is(or was -,-) not an action game, you **and you're opponents** playing around menaingfull downtimes is an imprtant tacticall skilltest. It is fine to have some low key low cd thing to cyclle through, but without downtimes, you either always can take on you're opponent, or always loose if the players mechanics are good enough, you should not have acces to the majority of you're power at all times.\nAgain, lol is no a fighting or action game, people do not need a button to press every single second.\n\n>3) Avoid front-loading\n[...] hat isn't extremely bursty upon contact,\n\nIn theory and on some champs like kallista also in practice, but most of his designs have tools to either still acces frontloaded power or high enough power to still burst squishy targets while also haveing all the needed stickiness vs tanky targets to acces their backloaded power reliably.\n\nYasuo once he has some gear has so much damage that he kills most squishys on first contact, usually with e+Q-knockup+AA+R+AA+Q, hard ccing the victim on contact and finishing it off right when the CC-chain ends. If fed, he often doesn't need to prep the knock up and kills with E+Q+AA+Q within 1.3sec past forst contact.\n\nAkali has so much mobillty, you hardly can ever get out of her reach between first contact and the finishing ult, and her E+W make it near impossible for most champs to retaliate duering that time either. \nTher might be some time between first contact and kill, but most of the time the victim is doomed from first contact already.\n\nDarius on releas(which is the version CT designed), would often reach a point where he hooks in a squishy, delivers AA+W+Q and then finishes with the ult, he might have had the passive damage and some of the ult damage backloaded, but his frontloaded damage usually was high enough to kill squishys should he be able to reel them in.\n\nZoe migh have the 'throw Q backwards first' gimick, but she also has the range to do so out of vision meaning it does jack shit on the reicving end, same for her E delay on the hard CC, by the time you get hit by her E, you either cleanse or pray some tank manages to anitceipate than angle of her Q and bodyblock, since the delay also gives zoe all the time in the world to prep her Q from a good angle, and we've seen enough instakill montages to see tha once you fall asleep, you're healthbar will usually disapear in  a split second the moment zoe appears, which is all but backloaded.\n\nZyra might have her plant dps rather than upfront burst numbers, but her CC keeps you in the plant dps till you die, she was one of the strongest combo bursters till her rework(like with darius, CT is responsible for the pre reworke design) and still shouldn't be underestimated.\nIf she goes for the full combo vs a squishy, you're basically dead the moment her E connects unless you have cleanse, as the root last long enough to chain directly into the ult knockup for a total of ~3sec lockdown within her angry garden.\n\nTime to kill might be somewhat higher, but most of the time, you're still basically dead after first contact vs his designs","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-09-02T20:54:12.105+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sire Hippington,realm=EUW,application-id=ELUpwER8,discussion-id=28nNMfnH,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2018-09-01T19:18:13.582+0000)\n>\n> I have to disagree.\n> \n> His designs would be great if this was a PvE game, or a fighting game, but for lol they are not fitting(or weren&#x27;t if they keep their path to becomeing a fully different game that fully cut off it&#x27;s roots...)\n> \n> His designs have a heavy skill celing, but once you get there, thhy just have so much to work with that they usually have all the agency in their own hands and their opponents are left with nothing but hopeing for a screw up. \n> Even if balance, they usually are very frustraiting to play against, especially 1v1, as they feel like they can answer on everything while have tools to cover up their own screw-ups.\n\n> Yasuo for example...\n\n- Like I've said, you're disproven by the fact that **Yasuo does best statistically in the 2v2 lane, not the 1v1 lanes.**\n\n- How does E help him stay out of range of opponents when E *only goes towards opponents?* He can dip if he's in the thick of it, yes, but if *you engage on him, he can't dash away.* It's not free mobility.\n\nLike, look how you describe Yasuo as a whole, and then look at the reality of things. Jax, who cuts all the extra stuff and just ward hops around with an aoe stun and the ability to negate AAs, is SIGNIFICANTLY stronger in solo queue as a skirmisher than Yasuo is. But we're this pressed over the features of Yasuo. Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why that is? It's because you're simply unimpressed by Jax's kit, but Jax is objectively better as a skirmisher in top lane than Yasuo is in solo queue. This is what I'm trying to get people to realize. CT's designs have a ton of *perceived power.* After tuning them to fit in the game, a lot of simpler designs do way better in solo queue just by being easier and more consistent to pilot.\n \n> Akali goes a bit in the same direction, either you make her you&#x27;re bitch or you&#x27;re her plaything, very few matchups are in between, though her design has more potential with proper tuneing(more sustain, less upfront damage)\n\nAssassins all do that.\n \n> And Zoe is just from start to finish disgusting. Her Q+R is basically the thing nida got reworked for, her E through walls is disgusting and has the bubble funktions as unecessary savety net, her W is a pure disaster and never should have been alowed into the game, her CDs overall are so low that you have no real downtimes, and as long as she has something on her W or a summoner, she&#x27;s very save vs dives with the massive movement boost her W gives, and you can&#x27;t really use summoners or item actives vs her, which makes engageing on a champ that usually is 1-2 screens away rather difficult.\n\nWhen you guys get mad over Zoe's Q being like Nidalee's Q, do you guys ever stop to think \"Zoe can escape over walls or heal herself\"? Legit asking. It's a massive difference.\n\nWhen you get mad over Zoe's E going through walls, do you ever think to yourself \"Every skill shot in this game goes over walls\"?\n\nWhen you get mad over Zoe gaining a MS boost from her W, do you think to yourself \"A MS boost isn't something to get mad over or else I'd have to have an issue with just about every champ in the game\"?\n\nHonestly I think Zoe as a champion needs to be broken down for you so she doesn't seem as intimidating on a fundamental level.\n\n> Maybe if the W gets fully replaced by something else and her Q+E get visible through the fog of war(and with some solid audio cue or less missle speed) she might be fine, but with the disgusting abomination that is her W and the low counteroly her Q+E offers through terrain, she&#x27;s staying an issue.\n\nOnly thing that W could stand to have changed, if you ask me, is the damage. Take the damage from there and sprinkle it everywhere else. With that, it deletes her ability to fight people by chaining W's tacked on damage and her passive.\n \n> His designs are just horrible to play against and mostly boil down to abuseing mistakes of the CT-champ\n\nHonestly you're just exhibiting exactly what I was talking about in the thread. You're heavily intimidated by the flashy nature of his designs to the point where you've given up actually trying to beat them, and if you do, you blame the pilot instead of congratulating yourself.\n\n> ---------------------\n> \n> Nope, Yasuo often had top as his best lane\n\nHis bot lane win rate is almost 55% in Diamond as I'm typing this, compared to Yasuo's 50% in top and mid on lolalytics. The only thing is that after marksmen got hard buffed back into being bot lane's kings (yippee...), Yasuo's play rate in the lane went down, but even during that time, Yasuo's best win rate lane was bot lane. Both after 8.11 and now.\n \n> Zoe does 80% of her gameplay without her W, it&#x27;s just the little topping that pushes her from very annoying to WTF IS THAT BULLSHIT, saveing her ass ever so often while bringing that extra damage+mobillity that makes the difference between forceing a recall and getting a straight kill.\n\nShe's still utilizing most of her kit to function at all times.\n \n> Kallistas E basically is only a gimick that you could remove from her kit and hardly anyone would notice...\n\nShhh, we don't talk about her here.\n> ----------------------------\n> \n> Just No, this is(or was -,-) not an action game, you **and you&#x27;re opponents** playing around menaingfull downtimes is an imprtant tacticall skilltest. It is fine to have some low key low cd thing to cyclle through\n\n...so we've said the same thing.\n\nAkali's Q is low cd, but parts of her kit are long cd.\n\nYasuo's W is long cd, and dashes to specific targets are long cd.\n\nDarius has relatively normal cds.\n\nSame for Thresh, but his Flay is kinda short, and landing Q shortens it for him to do it again.\n\nZoe's got faster cds, true, but some champs have faster cds (Cass has pretty quick cds between Q and E, so she's technically always online for running people down).\n\nSo I'm saying you can improve someone like Wukong by giving him more to do instead of his one singular burst rotation. That's exactly what Riot's trying to do for him, too.\n\n> In theory and on some champs like kallista also in practice, but most of his designs have tools to either still acces frontloaded power or high enough power to still burst squishy targets while also haveing all the needed stickiness vs tanky targets to acces their backloaded power reliably.\n\nAnyone bursts when they get fed, even Teemo. By nature, though, they aren't front-loaded.\n> \n> Yasuo once he has some gear has so much damage that he kills most squishys on first contact, usually with e+Q-knockup+AA+R+AA+Q, hard ccing the victim on contact and finishing it off right when the CC-chain ends. If fed, he often doesn&#x27;t need to prep the knock up and kills with E+Q+AA+Q within 1.3sec past forst contact.\n\nHe's a carry. Yi does the same thing but we aren't saying much about Yi because no one gives a shit about Yi until he's overtuned.\n\n\n> Akali has so much mobillty, you hardly can ever get out of her reach between first contact and the finishing ult, and her E+W make it near impossible for most champs to retaliate duering that time either. \n> Ther might be some time between first contact and kill, but most of the time the victim is doomed from first contact already.\n\nAkali LOST mobility with her rework. She's always been about chasing down targets, though, so it's not a problem that she's still able to now. Champions need to be able to have things they do well unless you want Ryu/Ken style copies like we had with Amumu/Gragas/Old Sejuani.\n\n> Darius on releas(which is the version CT designed), would often reach a point where he hooks in a squishy, delivers AA+W+Q and then finishes with the ult, he might have had the passive damage and some of the ult damage backloaded, but his frontloaded damage usually was high enough to kill squishys should he be able to reel them in.\n\nDoesn't he ass blast squishies rn anyway? They're \"squishies\" for a reason.\n\n> Zoe migh have the &#x27;throw Q backwards first&#x27; gimick, but she also has the range to do so out of vision meaning it does jack shit on the reicving end, same for her E delay on the hard CC, by the time you get hit by her E, you either cleanse or pray some tank manages to anitceipate than angle of her Q and bodyblock, since the delay also gives zoe all the time in the world to prep her Q from a good angle, and we&#x27;ve seen enough instakill montages to see tha once you fall asleep, you&#x27;re healthbar will usually disapear in  a split second the moment zoe appears, which is all but backloaded.\n\n1) In all those montages, those people didn't cleanse the sleep, and many of them lacked QSS (or any MR at all) anyway.\n\n2) If Zoe Q's from out of vision, usually it's from over a wall. If she's doing it from out of vision, you *definitely* need to be managing your vision better. If you get hit by Morgana Q from a spot you didn't see, it isn't \"unfair\" all of a sudden. Same thing here. Sure, Zoe extends her spell reach through walls and use of R, but that's why you play smart and avoid being too close to walls when it isn't safe. It's like playing into Poppy and then playing near walls, or playing against Rengar near a bush. You can't blame Poppy or Rengar for that.\n\n> Zyra might have her plant dps rather than upfront burst numbers, but her CC keeps you in the plant dps till you die, she was one of the strongest combo bursters till her rework(like with darius, CT is responsible for the pre reworke design) and still shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated.\n\n> If she goes for the full combo vs a squishy, you&#x27;re basically dead the moment her E connects unless you have cleanse, as the root last long enough to chain directly into the ult knockup for a total of ~3sec lockdown within her angry garden.\n\nI'm not a fan of Zyra myself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2018-09-04T03:42:52.523+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you mention \"other designs don't have these traits\" it reminded me of a conversation I used to have with Xypherous\n\nXypherous used to lament that Riven would have been a MUCH better design if League was a game where EVERYONE WAS RIVEN.

If people are going to act like the strategic parts of the game are important to the experience, then they should acknowledge that the game *needs* to have strong and weak match-ups. If everyone has a \"pretty good shot\" at winning against everyone, then the game isn't strategic anymore and it boils down to finger speed and brute forcing your way through match-ups. That said, some champs are going to need to do some things well and some things poorly. Sometimes those things are based around objectives. Other times they're based on lane match-ups. \n\n> CT kits are in danger of this. Take Yasuo (the poster boy). His wind wall is frankly a polarizing strength.

Mobility and shit? Yeah, but it's not free mobility like Riven or something. Trying to cap it any more than this would make it pretty dang hard to be Yasuo.\n\nI'm glad we're agreeing that Kalista's a mistake.\n\nZoe isn't a mobile champion unless we're saying Sona and Janna are mobile champions.\n\nThresh is DEFINITELY not a mobile champion.

The main one I'd let that moniker slide on is Yasuo (ironic, right?) but even then, he wouldn't operate right without things the way they are. The other kits have features and their game play pretty much stays in that realms without grabbing from too many other places within their designated sub-classes. Akali's big thing is her shroud and reaching targets, so you're not gonna see a ton of extra outside of the things that highlight that. WW is designed around chasing down enemies and drain tanking, and his whole kit revolves around that. Zoe revolves around stealing actives and bursting from flanks...a lot of these kits have about 2 descriptors that lay out what each champ's about.

They simply do not fit into the rest of the roaster and cause balance and health issues in the game.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAnd btw...\nZoe is ANYTHING but good design. Zoe is a horrible kill or die Champion with little to no counterplay which will never be actually balanced. \nFrom dumb RNG to invisible (through terrain) skillshots Zoe offers nearly everything I'd relate to horrible gamedesign.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Koechophe","date":"2018-09-03T05:26:12.823+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I feel much of your tone is raw argument rather than discussion. On a few points:\n\n1) Weak V.S. strong matchups are fine... to a certain degree. But if the matchups are almost unwinnable, then the game turns into a place where the bulk of strategy happens in the champion select, which is not healthy or engaging. This is why clear strengths/weaknesses are fine, but they are unhealthy when polarizing. It's all about whether we want the game to be decided in round, or in champ select. I, for one, prefer the former, which is I why I take opposition to polarizing matchups.\n\n2) Yasuo's statistics being inclined towards bot lane doesn't take away from my point. Melee champions in bot lane is now somewhat meta, and could be easily used as a counterpick. Yasuo himself exists as a counter-pick to range and skill shots, which creates a polarizing strength that is extremely problematic.\n\n3) Your comparison between zoe and sona is asinine. Zoe gets a free flash any time her opponent uses one. Zoe has the potential to get free flashes, slows, ghosts, mini-dashes and the works from every single large minion, which allow her to push with impunity. The speed boost (which is, by the way, 3X more powerful than Sona's at level 1, and more than 4X more powerful at max rank) is just icing on the cake. Zoe can be hyper-mobile in teamfights when flashes are thrown around because she picks them up, and she gets a free summoner spell with literally 100% up time if she kills the minions with the balloons.\n\nAnd Janna is a poor comparison because Janna is the queen of peel. I would be terrified of a mage with as much peel as Janna.\n\n4) Akali has more mobility than before. Akali's W is a free dash to either her shroud or an enemy she hits, at much longer range, and her ult can be used however she wanted. Before, she only had a gap closer. Now, she has the decision-making process on how to use her mobility. In addition, her passive gives speed boosts in fights, making her more mobile yet.\nYasuo is hyper mobile in lane, not in that he can escape fantastically (though he can get away pretty well if he's skilled, anyone will acknowledge that), but because he can dodge almost any damage by dashing around the minions like a mad man, and chase exceedingly well. \nAs was stated before, thresh is an example of mobility kreep because he has a long range gifted dash, which is literally the ability to give mobility to another champ.\n\nAs far as being overloaded:\n-Akali and WW were well done, I don't feel they are overloaded. Akali is difficult to deal with, but lacks in reliable damage, which helps make up for it.\n-Thresh, yasuo and zoe are overloaded. Thresh offers so much utility that his kit has to be balanced on a razor's edge, and he's left as innately squishy to compensate. Yasuo is given far too much defensive utility for a supposed hyper carry. Zoe's W is just overloaded, the rest of her kit is manageable but there is too much power shoved in that thing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dracocrash","date":"2018-09-01T16:49:28.230+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already found a problem with your first line\n\n> \"Regardless of how you feel about them, they offer involving game play for both parties:\"\n\nPeople hate CT champs because they are being forced to play a game they don't want to play. the end.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-09-01T22:45:58.627+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"...you don't want to play League of Legends?","replies":[{"poster":"Ulkusus","date":"2018-09-02T14:44:46.216+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you try to \"play\" against yasuo as a champion with only projectiles?

Listing things she can't do doesn't mean that the things she can do are healthy. Edge of Night is a terrible item that almost nobody buys, as its stats are low and the active isn't useful for anything but ganks and Requiem. Do you think it's good for part of the counterplay to a mid mage to be \"stay out of the jungle; she owns it\"?\n\nZoe's W is \"important\" in that it's way too strong, but it doesn't have anything to do with the rest of her kit except for the fact that it's a spell and therefore turns on her passive. There's no way for that ability to actually be an integral part of her kit, because it's not really her ability. It's item actives and summoner spells.\n\nSkillshots that increase in effectiveness over their travel time/distance are allowed to do that because, in theory, opponents have more time to dodge them. Getting hit by something from fog is a massive design problem for this mechanic, in the same way that Ez is a problem for any on-hit item or mechanic.\n\nI don't know enough about Akali to have an opinion, Yasuo is fine, and Riot obviously knows that Kalista was a mistake (along with Ryze et al.).","replies":[]},{"poster":"SettDownShutUp","date":"2018-09-02T05:27:07.381+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-09-02T06:10:41.595+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you guys come here to actually discuss the game or do you come here to whine and complain about the downvote feature?","replies":[{"poster":"TheSymbolÔfPeace","date":"2018-09-02T12:54:35.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you really getting defensive for him saying you should be thankful for not having the downvote feature?

I hop in after work to see this thread still on fire and my post deleted. Lovely.\n\nAlright let's see what can I add...hm.... Ah.\n\nI believe that if there's anything CertainlyT's record has proven it that the majority of what he touches has constant and severe balancing issues that arise time and time again.  I also find his reworks and recent champion designs to be both disruptive to players and leave a negative, toxic impact on the community as a whole.  Darius, Zoe, Kalista, and Yasuo were practically hated since day one, and were often found by the community (in my opinion and by a summary glance at the forums of yesteryear) unfun to play against.  \n\nGrave and Caitlyn altered a meta for a season due to the infamous League of Marskmen and the inclusion of Death's Dance. I still can't look my friend in the eye and say \"wanna play league\" because he asks whether Graves can still heal to full in a single auto. And then there's an awkward silence for a while.\n\nI know Zyra was a group effort hence I refrain from speaking of her, but I feel Thresh needs special mention.  I love thresh's design and agree completely that this design is one of the golden geese that any champion from now on will have to measure up to in terms of support.  But to that end I feel thresh also caused a severe power creep in terms of what was expected of whoever duo'd with the ADC.  Can you peel, shield, CC, provide escape and also chunk a target at ranged? Why aren't you choosing thresh?\n\nWarwick is the most tame update CertainlyT has ever produced. Maybe he was sick with the flu or something, I dunno. But I think a mellow CertainlyT actually produces better results.  Warwick is one of the few cases where I have to say, he didn't cause an issue. He was a solid champion rework and I wish this reflected on more of his work.\n\n[...Mordekaiser...](https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-reports-eu/fLvuqJ3d-all-180-mordekaiser-bugs-ranked-by-importance-and-sorted-into-17-categories) The LCS will never live down the embarrassment that was the juggernaut update, and how dominating this one champion was.  And let's not forget that CertainlyT ignored the protests, advice and caution of the community for 3 months, which, no, doesn't have anything to do with his designs save for the fact that it showed a complete lack of understanding or willingness to comprehend the fantasies behind playing a walking suit of armor. \n\n\n> [\"Morde needs someone to help cover his weaknesses and actualize his strengths.
