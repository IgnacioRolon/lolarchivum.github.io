Addressed it. Balancing Ahri is still insanely hard. She doesn&#039;t feel like she accomplishes much because she either does so too safely or doesn&#039;t. Removing the Q MS didn&#039;t really *change* that because it becomes the same song and dance after level 6. Honestly, 3 dashes is just super safe no matter how you slice it. They aren&#039;t even small Aatrox-style dashes. These are *big* dashes.\r\n\r\nSo, Ahri&#039;s R needs to change. It&#039;s fine for Ahri to have mobility, but a triple threat of it is overkill and makes it impossible to balance out Ahri&#039;s risk/reward. Her W needs to change as well. It&#039;s...so forgettable and useless...I don&#039;t know what this move accomplishes, honestly. Figuring out how to deal with Ahri would be easier if her W actually meant something to the champ somehow. In 2018, we don&#039;t have a lot of champs that have moves that are *this* useless. There was a time where champs came out looking like Vi, where you had your Q, your E, your R, and some shit on W that no one gives a flying shit about. League of today doesn&#039;t support that design philosophy as much, and similar to you guys&#039; approach to Zoe and Lux when you tried to either bring them up or pull them back down, Ahri needs her power distributed more evenly throughout her whole kit, from R. This is where the problem comes to a head...cause Q and E are already balanced moves, and W is hardly a move. There&#039;s nothing you can do with W to remove power fairly from R so her risk/reward isn&#039;t so lop-sided all the time. That&#039;s the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Salron","date":"2018-07-31T14:14:29.680+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"R is fine\nW really needs to become a new spell entirely","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-07-31T17:06:39.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a fan of R but at least we agree on W.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2018-07-31T13:52:47.415+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"And as an Ahri main, every time she gets picked away from me I play Brand and roast her if she even approaches the minion wave.\n\nComplaining about being unable to kill the champ is playing wrong.

For starters, the least mobile assassin is Eve, not Ahri. Ahri's also not a full assassin, but a mage with assassin bits (mobility).
