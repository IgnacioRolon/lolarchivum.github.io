It&#039;s getting absurd.\r\n\r\nI can understand if you get stuck with something you&#039;re bad at. Can&#039;t help it sometimes. However, if you seriously can&#039;t play ____, yet you lock it in without doing so much as letting someone know, then you&#039;re only being a huge detriment to the team, and all it takes is a little look at op.gg to see your horrendous/amazing/good enough stats with any champion. It&#039;s the reason people say &quot;___ pref&quot; when they get into lobby. It&#039;s so we can all try to figure out who we should send where, so we can hopefully have everyone where they&#039;re as strong as possible given a random assortment of people.\r\n\r\nAll I&#039;m saying, in a half venting, half PSA sort of post, is that if you have the freedom to pick something you&#039;re good at in ranked, then do THAT instead of just locking in something you can&#039;t play well. If you&#039;re last pick, at least TRY to communicate what roles you are/aren&#039;t good in. It actually helps more often than not.","replies":[{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2015-06-16T02:04:14.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went 0/7/0 as maokai top in ranked. first time maokai.... never again. i was really trying to help the comp...  anyway, apparently the darius i went against was like 80% win rate and had atleast a 4/1 kda in ever gaem... so i felt a little less guilty, but still.. it was terrible","replies":[]}]}
