XD\nLee Sin is actually in a bad place right now. Sitting at a whopping 48% win rate, you really have to try hard to win with him because he's not a very easy champ. He has a high skill cap and he pays for it. Sona doesn't really have a high skill cap and she was strong. So it was a calculated nerf.\nNow I can't really say anything about Cho and Warwick. They are both pretty strong right now. Only things that can really touch them are ADCs who build {{item:3123}} or {{item:3036}} (Latter being better than the former IMO) or sometimes mages can build {{item:3165}} and get some decent damage to deal with them but ultimately they are pretty strong. Warwick really suffers from Grievous wounds.\nAs far as Twitch, he's easy to handle. CC or burst (or both), he drops in an instant. His ability to go invisible is strong, but a lot of ADCs have pretty strong abilities. Tris just jumps in and destroys people. Ezreal and Arcane Shift (or, rather, an unlimited flash on low cooldown. XD). MF is stronger than Twitch right now because she abuses Lethality. I mean, there are always going to be busted champs. And Riot is working around those aspects. Constantly changing to attempt to keep the balance. There will never be TRUE balance. But Riot is trying their best to keep it fresh. They know that with a game with so much variability, it's fan base will find a way to break something. Sona was just the one of those that they felt needed to be a bit more balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-12-06T17:38:05.278+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't soliciting opinions on champions that I hate. Sorry, but I don't really care if you agree with my totally subjective, 100% anecdotal point of view. \n\nThe goal of my post is to say that when the champs I listed (amongst others) are **strong** you feel like you're being cheesed. Even a lot of champs with reasonable win rates feel like absolute cancer to play against, even when you win, and Yasuo and Zed are great examples of that.\n\nMy entire point is that of all the major balance issues in the game right now, Sona is one of the few that doesn't directly translate to me having a miserable fucking experience playing against her. \n\nI can see her. I can punish her. I can kill her. \n\nIt's not like WW where he runs you down at 600 MS and kills you with a suppress into a fear while healing off the turret damage. While being immune to peel and following you automatically when you flash.\n\nSo if I have to choose between a 50% WR Warwick pulling that fucking bullshit and a 56% WR Sona that dies to any pick, I pick the overpowered Sona because she's more fun to have in the game. If she assassinates me, I can always say \"well, at least she didn't have 4000 hp.\"\n\nTo clarify, I'm not biased for or against Sona.

Let's do some basic math (pre change), {{champion:37}}  has 46 base attack damage, Sona's Q does 40 magic damage per bolt and gave her a bonus of 20 magic damage on her next auto attack.  Her passive gives another 15 damage.  If we factor in scaling you get about 30 extra damage.   So far assume she sets up the AA reset you are looking at 182 damage before factoring in resistances.  Not even {{champion:240}} MINUS HIS MOUNT has a small enough health pool to be 50% at level one by a full rotation from Sona.  These numbers also do not include base resistance numbers, meaning that the amount of damage going out is even smaller.\n\nWithout factoring in resistance of any kind, and assuming the average health pool for a champion at level one is 550.  Sona is at best 33%'ing you (38% if it's {{champion:51}}  who has the lowest starting health in the game)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RedCyclone","date":"2017-12-06T14:23:48.104+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'll be monitoring her winrates for the next few days\n\nThe moment she goes below 50% I am going to write up a storm","replies":[{"poster":"Darkeus","date":"2017-12-06T14:25:24.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RedCyclone,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BiuYdAPO,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2017-12-06T14:23:48.104+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ll be monitoring her winrates for the next few days\n> \n> The moment she goes below 50% I am going to write up a storm\n\nGet ready soon.
