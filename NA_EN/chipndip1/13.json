What do I scale with best?\n\n- What is the situation? Should I take a more careful, defensive approach to my build or should I race to end-game status, getting as offensively potent as possible earlier on?\n\nIf I&#039;m SUPPORT, my itemization decisions look like this:\n\n- Build the biggest effect that gives the biggest benefit for your team.\n\nThis is *inherently flawed logic.* Where someone playing Ahri could say &quot;That&#039;s a Veigar, so instead of risking getting clicked on in his ranges, I&#039;ma put the Lich Bane build down and get an Abyssal Sceptor instead.&quot; or &quot;That&#039;s a Zed, so I&#039;ma put the Abyssal to the side and build a Zhonya&#039;s&quot;, a support says &quot;I&#039;m going to build Locket/Redemption because that&#039;s thousands upon thousands of hp sustain for my team.&quot; Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re Blitz. Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re Braum. Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re Sona. Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re Janna. EVERY SUPPORT BUILDS THESE ITEMS, and the worst part is that there&#039;s no reason not to. Nothing matches their potency when it counts, and Locket has a 90 second cd, meaning it&#039;s up for basically *every* team fight. There&#039;s no consideration of &quot;My champion is X&quot; because support itemization as a whole disregards this concept. Or rather, *the items worth building do.*\n\nLike, I don&#039;t see why people are scratching their heads on support. Support needs people to actually care enough to fix the problems it has, is all, before we can make it a more fun role. The problems are not even that hard to find. These items are **inherently** broken in the role. We need these items replaced with itemization choices that better fit specific champ classes that find themselves in the role, as well as choices that adhere to specific types of situations, not catch-all answers that are always good, which is what Redemption and Locket are.\n\nSide note: A shameless plug to my last thread on the role\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/TVVuiRr0-the-problem-with-enchanters","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-03-03T13:23:45.185+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because support design in LoL is hot garbage.\n\nIts hard to attach significant itemization that's not overpowered as fuck (Locket/Redemption, hello) to complete garbage design.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-03-03T16:26:45.308+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But lets rework tanks and divers instead.\n\nLike, I get the tank rework, but why DIVERS over enchanters/wardens?","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-03-03T19:12:54.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, idk.

In dota, supports are more impactful from a damage perspective because of dotas scaling. Most supports in lol are a heal/shield/cc bot. Most supports in league (thresh, janna, blitz, soraka) are like this, with the exception of the mid lane supports (brann, annie, etc). Supporting in league is so boring, in my opinion, because they are focused on supporting entirely, and dont do anything on their own (again, midlane supports dont do this).

It also highlights why items like Knight's Vow are consistently being changed because they are rarely used. It isn't because they are bad items. It is because they can't compete with the sheer tactical power of items like Locket and Redemption.\n\nDon't get me wrong; Locket and Redemption are necessary in their current state for team play (nerfing them would just make them disappear), but support item choices really don't make as much of a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-03-03T16:31:34.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I read they were tackling Locket in the preseason, I THOUGHT they were going to remove Locket and replace it with more \"compartmentalized\" options. Instead they removed the aura and buffed the hell out of the shield while giving it armor, making it more of a generalist item and less specified against mages, on the grounds of \"We think Locket is too 'necessary' in the role and we need to allow for more itemization variety in the support role.\" I just don't understand...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-03-03T13:21:16.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't build Redemption on every support I play, and people actually complain about the lack of it.
