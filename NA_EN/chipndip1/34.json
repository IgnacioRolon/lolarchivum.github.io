Good CC isn't exactly a good option for Sona (and we have one already {{champion:267}})  so that kind of just leaves decent damage.\n\nYou could theoretically load Sona's auras to output damage but then you run into the problem of balancing auras for the lane and teamfight case. Your auras are potentially two and a half times more powerful in teamfights and depending on how worthless Sona becomes as a champ and not an aura it could just be four times more powerful.\n\nPlus there's the fact that by now Sona's poke is part of her identity, perhaps even more so than her sustain.

Making the blue aura last longer doesn't do much of anything if you nerf the damage on it (Let's be honest, you're talking about the AA steroid, which IS the aura, not the bolts that do very little damage. This would be a flat nerf).\n\nYou can't remove the shield from the healed targets because she'd never get a shield herself + she's always in the range of her shield.

I do personally like the idea of sona having a dual heal/shield combo, and I'm okay with them being two halves of a whole. It's a cool little ability that not really anyone else has.
