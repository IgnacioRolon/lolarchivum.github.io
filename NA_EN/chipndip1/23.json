She's not even made to be a \"draintank\" and does more drain tanking than Aatrox once mid game begins.\n\nActually I think Lee Sin just needs a small base MS nerf, 10 more seconds of cooldown added to his ult at all ranks, and then maybe reduce his lifesteal/spellvamp but that would depend of how hard the former are as nerfs. Why delete him? He's a fantastic idea of \"the playmaker\" style character that really makes people want to play the game. He's hard to play, but it feels very rewarding.\n\nIf I'm bias then prove it. Heck, you could also try to disprove my logic. Seriously, just try to. How do you counterbuild Fiora effectively?

She is not a tank. Period. Full stop. Throw her into a teamfight and she will outright not live as long as a tank unless she built tank, but if she built tank then her damage isn't scary anymore. Tanks aren't known for their 1v1 prowess.\n\nOut-heal: She has 1 way to receive mass healing, and that's to trigger her ult. For this the person who has received her ult has to die (preferably with 2-3 vitals popped) or she has to pop all 4 vitals--popping all 4 vitals on a target that isn't a potato and letting you do it is not easy, meaning she has to work for it. Aatrox on the other hand? He just hits you 3 times. Ever. They don't even have to be consecutive hits like Vayne, he just hits 3 times.\n\nYou're biased. You're blatantly biased.
