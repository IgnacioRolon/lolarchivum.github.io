I know that coming across griefers in games feels bad, but to be honest, people who grief in this system are incredibly stupid. The system does a better job at escalating penalties for this kind of behavior, so if reports don't get them then higher LP drops will.\n\nWhile playing in multiple roles does feel like a grind fest at sometimes, I do appreciate how LP can splash into other roles too.

Even if all of this ridiuclous shit is fixed, the damage has been done.\n\nThank GOD you posted something with more evidence and substance than your last post. Now I don't have to be so brutal with my wording, thanks for expanding out. \n\nTo start, let me clarify; this system isn't perfect. It's far from it. But I think a lot of the problems you're seeing now have been around for a while, with the exception of what you call \"basically no penalty for losing,\" which I'll touch upon later.\n\nDuo queues have always been a bit sneaky in terms of gaming the system. I feel like this isn't anything new; duo queues can switch positions whenever they want. It's a problem that I don't see often in ranked, but I know it's in all ranking systems. (frankly, I'm personally wanting a true solo experience without duo queues so I'm a bit biased. Though, no one can stop players from dropping Discord links so a team of solos can communicate.)\n\nIn terms of Diamond point, I believe that according to this article, the ranks merge at MASTER instead of Diamond. Plus, just from personal experience, I rarely get autofilled when I play numerous ADC/Mid/JG games on end, so I don't think Diamond players are going to worry about dropping to Silver... though I might just be missing your point on this, which is totally possible.\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/whats-new-ranked-2019\n\nBasically no penalty for losing. I guess? I do admit that the \"splash LP gains and losses\" are lacking, so people could just not try when they get an off-role and just lose minimum LP in their main role...\n\n...but is that a problem with the SYSTEM, or the PLAYER BASE?\n\nFor one, the purpose of positional ranks is to give you a fair match no matter which role you get placed in for a game. Let's ignore the few potential ways to game the system for now, for the sake of this argument. If you're a mid main, and you get placed support, then instead of going against players of your mid rank (say Gold), you get pitted against players of your support rank (say Silver). You're given a fair game to play, so why do people NOT TRY? Because it's not worth their time? Because it's no penalty to not try? IMO that's no excuse at all. You're given a chance to play the game, and not taking up that chance and wasting the time AND LP of 4 other teammates is selfish, disrespectful, and just plain idiotic. In short, while the system doesn't do much to prevent this, I do feel like this issue is the fault of the PLAYER.\n\nThanks for taking back the statement you made earlier; I did feel like it was a bit extreme. Of course, this system still needs to work out some kinks and problems; there were even some that I felt like could have been foreseen as well. But the amount of work, communication, and acceptance to feedback that Riot showed about this system has been a step up from previous projects in the past, so I do have hope that the system can be refined and fixed some more.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pro Sphynx","date":"2019-02-03T23:47:48.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love that I can que up with platinum players and silver players in the same game #Badrankingsystem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2019-02-03T22:05:18.191+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is there's no construtive criticism to give, I do not want them to *fix\" this role queue, I think they should remove it as a way to \"fix\" it.

Though I do see why you think this.\n\nThere's always a chance that someone would be willing to switch in the case of getting auto-filled, so I'm going to say that there's always a reason to ask. Of course, asking politely is better.\n\nI don't think people should instantly give up if they don't get their main role. It would likely be your secondary role, which you put secondary for a reason. Playing out the game to your fullest potential gives you a higher chance of winning than starting out in a negative mindset. If you get a role that isn't your primary or secondary, then it's likely an unfortunate and rare occurrence and it's a slightly different story. But all the more reason to ask to switch with someone, right?\n\nIf you feel terrible when someone gets a role that isn't their main because you're worried that they will grief, then it's a problem with the player base, not the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Captn Clutch","date":"2019-02-15T03:52:26.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that it's a problem with the player base, but the reality is the system needs to fix it. This is a free to play game, that is easy to run on mediocre hardware. Just about ANYBODY can play it. Due to this low barrier of entry, you have to expect a bit of a mixed player base.

Leaving this system in place and blaming the player base for any bad experiences would be the low effort, hands off approach. The system needs to incentivise people to play well, and punish them for not doing so. For an example, I'm not perfect either. I'm focused on ranking up my mid lane right now. I will play my hardest and fight to the bitter end in every mid game. That being said, if I'm in an off role and my team is getting rekt, it's not worth my effort. I'm more than happy to just surrender, take the - 3LP and get back to mid next game. If I was looking at losing full LP even in an off role, you better believe I would (and did in previous seasons) play my heart out trying to save my LP even when auto filled. In short, I don't believe I would say this system promotes toxic behavior, but it certainly promotes a lazy care free attitude to anyone who isn't playing their main. Why try hard and burn yourself out just to help out the team you got stuck with, when the end result has almost no effect on the rank you care about? To be honorable of course!
