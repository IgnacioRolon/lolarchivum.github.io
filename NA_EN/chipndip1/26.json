Even then, the meta-giant build is crowding into her fan base's ap build.\n \n> she is not a locket + redemption support, locket is a waste on her, check both champion.gg and op.gg for her build, she builds redemption later after she gets her sightstone/gold item and some ap - lichbane, possibly athenes/censer/ludens etc, such stuff\n> \n> to call lichbane a bandaid is silly, especially when you complain about supposedly uniform support itemization\n> \n> there shouldn&#x27;t be many &quot;role only&quot; items, lichbane is a good item when it synergies with low cd spells and already existing aa modifiers, it&#x27;s not a &quot;bandaid&quot; to build it because some mid/top/jungle champions use it too\n> \n> as for being &quot;braindead&quot;, twisted fate is an aa modifiers champ too, so? why don&#x27;t you complain about him? sona has a skillshot btw\n\nAnd addressing the rest of this:\n\n- If the case is that there shouldn't be many role-specific items, why are people afraid of support items being used in other lanes to the point where we stifle what stats we put on them?\n\n- Just because Sona players build Lich because there's a lack of better, more cost efficient support items that suit her play style doesn't mean support itemization is friendly towards more aggressive champs. It isn't.\n\n- TF's play pattern isn't as 1-note as Sona's. Sona is nearly nothing but mashing auto-aimed moves and auras. TF has a semi-global teleport and a skill shot in his basic kit to flesh out his difficulty curve.\n\n- Even if you mention *just* Sona, who isn't even played that often anyway, that doesn't address anyone outside of her who's been turned into a shield bot, which still includes her to a decent degree anyway.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MatthewRT2","date":"2016-12-28T01:23:28.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"but playing her is brain dead, you just mash buttons and empower your basic attacks, the only skill shot you have is hard to miss","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FulleroDendrimer","date":"2016-12-28T02:45:44.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play anvia support, and go wall block ur team. lmfao ggez so fun","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-12-28T03:29:09.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't really address anything I said though...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SGT Dingle Berry","date":"2016-12-28T02:05:55.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support isn't boring and believe it or not there are support mains, unfortunately there's 10x as many Yasuo, I mean aggressive players who'd rather faceroll their keyboard and hope the support kept them alive, assuming they didn't go solo into the enemy jungle that is.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-12-28T02:11:05.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"- Support isn't boring\n\n- Auto-fill enabled in all elos because support is so hard to fill\n\nI'm missing something.","replies":[{"poster":"Stormshadow3503","date":"2016-12-28T02:17:41.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main, I can say that supports aren't able to carry that well (or at all in some cases), which is another downside","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Copy Mirror","date":"2016-12-28T01:27:49.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"everytime someone says a champion is brain I'm always reminded of how the basics  of the game itself is hard and how that in return effects those champions balancing them out.\nI haven't seen Brain dead since that stupid Juggernaut update that made Mundo take no dmg from 5 people.\nTank god that's been patched out.","replies":[]}]}
