Now, in this particular circle of friends, basically everyone&#039;s convinced that my taste in anime is...like...the worst out of all of them. It&#039;s gotten to the point that, after watching some episodes of Princess Principle, when I turned on my show of choice, which was Gungrave, they tuned out and called it quits like 15 minutes into the first episode. Since I can&#039;t exactly get my point across in an echo chamber, I decided to turn to you guys to give an opinion on my taste in anime shows so I could have a sample to fire back on them with the next time I see them. Based on a sample of shows I&#039;ve watched and consider &quot;good&quot; shows that they shot down, is my taste in anime shows aight, or is it absolutely garbage? Honest opinions, and as many as possible.\n\nList of shows:\n\n    Jojo&#039;s Bizarre Adventure (2012+, not the Stardust OVAs)\n\n    Shiki\n\n    Hell Girl\n\n    Witchblade\n\n    Blassreiter\n\n    Death Parade\n\n    Knights of Sidonia\n\n    Red Garden\n\n    Parasyte\n\nAm I crazy or are they too picky/impatient?\n\nEdit: This list isn't just \"Shows I like\". These are \"shows I like that those guys said were garbage\". This thread is asking if those guys were right in shooting down these shows, or if they were wrong. Not a general anime recommendation list. It's missing shows that we agreed on, as well as shows I watched without them. Just to make sure everyone's on the same page during responses.","replies":[]}
