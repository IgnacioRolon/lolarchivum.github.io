Stop asking for it.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":170,"down_votes":41,"body":"With all the complaining going on about supports, I find it hard to ignore some...lopsided logic that recurs in the conversation.\r\n\r\nLike, assassins complain that they can&#039;t assassinate when a support is there, right? But supports are *supposed* to stop assassinations, and are *supposed* to not fight people straight up. If we don&#039;t want supports to fight well,  or wave clear well, so they stick to supporting and saving carries, how can you complain when they do the one thing they&#039;re supposed to do? I&#039;m not saying supports &quot;can&#039;t be op&quot;, but the notion that an assassin should just run in your shit and win what&#039;s essentially a 1v2 is fucking ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIf I&#039;m a support, and I&#039;m doing my job, and you&#039;re an assassin, **it&#039;s my job to watch out for you.** Your team should be helping to make an opening for you to pick someone off. Maybe that someone isn&#039;t the adc specifically? Maybe it&#039;s the enemy mid laner? Maybe it&#039;s a low health jungler? Maybe that someone is **me?** Idk, but the relationship between me and an assassin is literally an inverse relationship: If you&#039;re doing your job well when I&#039;m in interaction range of you, I&#039;m doing my job poorly, and if you&#039;re getting caught in bubbles or running into shields over and over again, you&#039;re doing a shit job of picking targets and openings. That&#039;s how I see it. Sure, some champs need addressing with this in mind, and sure, some champs are inherently better or worse at stopping certain types of threats outright, but generally speaking, I think there&#039;s other issues that create pain points for the assassin vs. support experience, and just mindlessly blaming the whole role when it only has a few outlier offenders (Janna and Kench are prime examples, as well as Redemption and Locket, Redemption being a bit less so, though) isn&#039;t a fair narrative, period.\r\n\r\nJust trying to add a dose of sanity to the discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"REDCOLORED","date":"2018-04-26T23:54:49.949+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":30,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-04-27T00:00:23.754+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":6,"body":"Here's the thing: This isn't a PvE game.

Talon's Ult CD has at max 60 seconds, minus whatever CDR he gets, and does undodgeable damage if you land a single hit on a target. All his other cooldowns are about as low as anyone else's. His item cooldowns are about even as anyone else's. He has access to invisibility, dashes and massive burst damage.\n\nFlipside, supports have access to similarly powerful items with similarly long cooldowns. The shield stacking IS an issue still. Cooldowns from support kits tend to be even to those of assassins, with the exception of ultimates. Taking Sona as the example here; her ult is on a 100 seconds cooldown. 40 more than Talon's with a major chance to miss due to the assassin's mobility/invisibility/untargetability. Janna? 120 seconds. Double Talon's. Nami also 100. That means even if you waste your ult because the enemy support did the same to counter you, you're back online faster and get to have a chance to come back.\n\nYour ignite versus their exhaust. If you're worried the ADC might kill you too fast if you get counteracted, you may want to get exhaust yourself.\n\nThe damage output by ADCs IS an issue. You shouldn't get instantly annihilated by a damage per second class regardless of whether you fucked up your assassination or not. But if a support used their kit to counter yours, the end result should be null. If the support countered your kit and there happens to be someone else with them ready to fuck you over, then yeah, team game fam.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-04-27T00:39:08.003+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":9,"body":"The issue isn't shield stacking.

This leaves an assassin unable to even kill the priority target 100% of the time before factoring in things like exhaust or and other forms of cc/peel. So seriously.

It&#x27;s also not fair to say you need to go in while shields are down, that&#x27;s almost impossible, 45% cdr is extremely accessible and the shield cool-downs are very short.\n\nLets be honest: If a support has 45% cdr, due to how slowly they get gold, the game is either late game, close to it, or they have Transcendence. Also, assassins are mostly an early game class. You're being outscaled in these scenarios, and it's hard to make \"huge, swift burst damage\" feel fair for the ~~victim~~ opposing party, so it's largely an early game feature when it's included. You aren't meant to easily pull that off *all game* unless you popped off.\n\nIt&#x27;s also not fair to say &quot;aim for someone else&quot; when it&#x27;s your job to kill the adc and your items are balanced around that fact. There&#x27;s also the flaw in your logic about holding ultimates. Most of the assassin do not have the kind of burst to force out a janna ult without using theirs themselves. Obviously being 6-0 at 13mins will mean you can do that but then is the only way for assassins to be a class is to get extremely fed early? that&#x27;s not very fair since assassins don&#x27;t provide anything beside damage. Unlike mages who have powerful utility build in which they can use no matter how far behind they get. \n\nYou can kill the enemy mage. You can kill the enemy support. If they've been softened up enough, you can even go for straggling front liners. You're job isn't just \"kill the marksman\". It's \"kill the highest priority target you can reach **without getting killed**\". That isn't always gonna be the marksman.\n\nAnd seeing how you're thinking of this WHOLE scenario as a 1v2 situation, I'm going to stop responding to it here because you clearly don't get that League is a 5v5 game.\n \n> There&#x27;s a big problem right with assassin itemization which causes them to be extremely useless when behind. This is almost certainly in my opinion because of the rework of Last Whisper and the nerfing of BlackCleaver, mainly LastWhisper though. \n\nAssassins are almost always useless when behind. That isn't an itemization issue. That's the nature of early game champs in general.\n\n> Sorry that my points are kind of all over the place, I&#x27;m really tired but I could talk more if you want. I just want you to understand, I don&#x27;t care about being able to 1v2 I care about being able to be a champion If I didn&#x27;t get ahead during lanephase.\n\nYou shouldn't play early game champs, then. Some assassins aren't that bad from behind. Fizz and Katarina, for example, are able to be relevant in mid/late game fights even if they did bad in lane. Kayn can just become Rhaast and be some assassin/fighter hybrid to bypass this weakness more blatantly.\n\nHowever, assuming you didn't feed early, understand that if you insist on jumping into 2 people alone, it's not my fault if you lose a 1v2. It'd be on my head **if you succeeded.**","replies":[{"poster":"Yaśuo Main","date":"2018-04-27T02:03:17.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":">If a support has 45% cdr, due to how slowly they get gold\n\nDid you really just say supports SLOWLY get gold","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-04-27T05:08:00.451+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, slowly, cause I'm not out-cashing anyone.
