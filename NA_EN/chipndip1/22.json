Even without heal/shield stacking, it&#039;s a shit ton of effective health. There&#039;s a difference between wanting supports to feel meaningful and *how you do it*. This isn&#039;t encouraging support players to engage in the match and feel important. This is encouraging pressing 2 number buttons and giving your team like 2 tanks worth of health over the five of them *before considering the champion&#039;s  own possible sustain options*. It makes sense, too, since Riot was trying to find out how they&#039;d make supports not fall off by late game. This, however, is a stupid way to do it, and I&#039;m a support main.\n\nREMOVE these types of actives. Support will always be centralized around Locket as long as it&#039;s an aoe shield, and instead of *learning this*, Riot essentially made TWO LOCKETS. What on this green Earth is the name of the drug they were utilizing when coming up with these decisions, cause I wanna add it to my bucket list.","replies":[{"poster":"Seyfti","date":"2017-01-07T19:40:03.400+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"So I don't get it.

You get to make strategic choices for the team based on what you're facing which seems like a fitting activity for the support position, the items can be balanced around only being strong on supports due to a lack of raw kit-enhancing stats that other champions want to buy to take advantage of their scaling.\n\nI think the problems with this concept now are just:\nA) Locket and Redemption are fairly similar in their optimal scenarios. (Everyone is clustered together? Better press this button and hope its numbers are big enough to make a difference!) Everyone is kinda forgetting about the other options so it feels like we aren't actually hitting the 'strategic choice' goal yet.\nB) Locket and Redemption are the standout options for this class of item at the moment. You generally build both of them and the only question is \"in what order?\" so there's little game-to-game diversity.\nC) Locket, Redemption, and most other items that fall into this category are active items which are simply a pain in the ass to use, which is compounded as you get more and more active items increasing the complexity of your backpack. Say what you want about the un-interactive-ness of the old Aegis aura, but there was something comforting about seeing it in your inventory and knowing \"This means I'm helping the team out right now!\" without having to constantly remember to watch for a moment to use it.\n\nIMO, Banner of Command and Zz'rot portal show the most potential for good \"support\" out-of-combat utility items as actives are way less stressful to use in out-of-combat situations while Zeke's Herald and Ardent Censer show the most potential for good in-combat items as they provide unique, benefical combat effects without adding more buttons for the player to remember during the most stressful part of a game.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-01-08T04:22:12.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ooh ooh I know\n\ngive them gold and exp so their kits are strong enough without needing to hold their own without gold and exp\n\nor we can just continue making entire teams tanky with two button presses, either works.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-01-07T20:05:43.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Basically this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seyfti","date":"2017-01-07T21:52:04.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess, but I don't think removing the active parts of the items is a step in the right direction.

I've said it many times before, but their reworks put a good deal of damage dealing potential in how they're played, rather than what they build. Sure you need some ap, but your damage will be consistently apparent even when building at a slow pace, which is what Riot did intentionally, seeing how support items are increasingly more devoid of ap options, let alone any that aren't catered specifically to enchanters.
