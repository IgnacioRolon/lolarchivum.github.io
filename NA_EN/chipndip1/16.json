He may have been picked in competitive to counter tanks, but outside of those scenarios he's always been average at best. Aside from that, his ability to carry games is quite low, he requires coordination to get the most out of his kit. Why is a champion like that completely gutted, while champions like Graves and Xin have been top shelf picks in the jungle for what feels like years?","replies":[]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-11-09T02:26:32.817+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"at the same time, win rates do not dictate how fun the game is.

We advocate against *unbalanced* role displacement.\n\nFor instance, Viktor top was absolutely dumb. Countered a vast majority of top laners. He needed nerfs to this build, as many said, not removal.\n\nMore examples of just top lane: Tank Ekko top, Lulu top, Tank Kassadin top, Rek'Sai pre-rework top, Ryze pre-rework top. All of these we were fine with being top, but were all grossly over-tuned at some point on top of having kits that beat out a majority of the residents, thus the hate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-11-08T22:50:56.532+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The reason is that by riot taking such hard control over the balance of the game, they created massive disparities between the optimal and inefficient, so now the only \"innovation\" that does occur is sparse and dramatically powerful. \n\nThe disparity between playing a champion in a position, with a rune set, and with a build, that are both tailored around each other, and a champion maybe in the same position, with a different rune page, and a different build, just ends up having exponential power drop off the further you move away from the optimum.\n\nSo the only \"innovation\", which happens now would probably be better described as a balance \"oversight\".\n\nIf they didn't want to be screwed either way, then their best option would be to lower the power gaps by reducing the efficiency of the most optimal builds.
