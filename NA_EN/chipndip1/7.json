It clearly shows you&#039;re hard-stuck and you could use some help. On the other hand, if you&#039;re a few hundred games in a pretty high elo, why do people feel like they gotta shit on other people&#039;s ranked grind? The way I see it, ranked is more about obtaining and retaining the skills it takes to get and keep a rank, not speeding through the ladder.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s also discouraging to people that don&#039;t play ranked. Like, you worry about losing a game or not making a goal, THEN you worry about &quot;having X amount of games&quot; by the time you make that goal? Personally, I chalk it up to a clear disrespect of other players and their achievements.","replies":[]}
