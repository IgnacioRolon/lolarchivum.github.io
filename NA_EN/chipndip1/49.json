WHY? Why is this something you guys continually do? Do you not know how to control minion waves? Do you guys think the enemy team has no jungler? Do you really think you&#039;ll deny them more farm than if you just harassed them away from it and froze it on your side of the river, which can easily deny people *way more* cs than shoving to turret?\r\n\r\nWhat in the actual world of fuck-boy-nomics makes adcs shove all lane? Even when there&#039;s a fucking EVELYNN on the enemy team, my adc shoves. What the hell gives!?","replies":[]}
