It isn&#x27;t like there has been any one archetype which has been underpowered and neglected for the past 8 seasons. Every archetype were held to one standard of balance except marksmen who were allowed to be 100% pick/ban in every meta for 8 seasons. Now, riot has finally bitten the bullet and tried to put marksmen in line with other archetypes and marksmen mains are predictably qqing because they don&#x27;t understand what it is like to play a balanced champion.\n> \n> Also, no one is blaming marksmen mains for riot&#x27;s balancing, they are just calling marksmen mains out for qqing when their champions are finally balanced.\n\nBut assassins killing you in 1 combo at level 6 from full health, totally balanced amirite?  This is why no one takes these boards seriously.  You rage and cry about how it's unfair for a squishy class like a marksmen to do a lot of damage but as soon as your champ can do it now it's balanced. xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-07-05T22:57:29.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whether they are balanced or not is subjective, people are bound to be upset after their role gets nerfed.

You guys had a LONG run being on top or near it.\n\nI'd just like melee champs to actually take skill to get a kill.  Right now when you play a crit marksmen wukong flash Q/Rs you and you lose your entire hp before you even hit the ground from the knockup on cyclone.  Or any assassin with duskblade facerolls you and you can't do anything.  Melee champs need a bit more counterplay imo electocute, sudden impact,  and ignite have made their combos do too much damage and there is a severe lack of counterplay now.  If they want to make crit marksmen useless for 25 minutes  then games actually need to go longer than 25-30 minutes because as it stands you spend 90% of the game being a walking gold bag and maybe 10% actually being a threat that can do damage.  If games went 40 minutes typically then it'd be fine but they don't.  It shouldn't be viable to run 4-5 melee champs commonplace in team comps now and it's perfectly viable.  They got way too much. So much they even had to shelve those two new items they were coming out with because it would have made them even more absurd then they already are now.\n\nAt least marksmen are squishy and can be killed easily even if they were fed. Try killing a fed vladimir or yasuo.  Look it's not acceptable for melee champs to become gods at 3k gold and as a crit marksmen you need 10k to even be a factor.  I mean I don't understand how someone can argue it's not ok for marksmen to kill with 4-5 autos but then it's perfectly acceptable for Wukong to jump in with Q and crushing blow and press R and you die in 2 seconds.  You can't say it makes sense for melee to have more damage, more health, more resistances, more defensive skills/mobility and fora  crit adc to have nothing for 30 min.  It's just not healthy game design.","replies":[]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-07-06T07:21:37.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cringe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gear Jammer","date":"2018-07-06T00:38:13.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem isn't that ADCs don't do enough damage it's everyone else does to much so if ADCs Wich yes do it with AAs can't do as much they aren't viable, solution lower everyone's damage then rebalance the outliers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ApollyonBainer","date":"2018-07-06T00:28:49.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I kind of like the was ADC is right now. They still do dmg but need more items in order to do that damage, which means they just need more gold. In order to max gold intake as an ADC you cant die early. Simple.
