Note that everything I&#039;m talking about here does NOT include Nami...like most people would probably agree.\r\n\r\n**Enchanter game play is extremely uninspired:** What really *makes* an enchanter? Normally, it&#039;s a shield/heal you can put on someone else and a focus on defensive, reactive play. Now this isn&#039;t necessarily my issue. My issue is that the latter part is so *excessively dry* in function. Sona, for example, has NO variance in her kit. It&#039;s all automated in aiming, her passive being tied to AAs. Only her R can POSSIBLY miss, and it&#039;s a pretty big hit-box. She&#039;s basically a shit ton of numbers being blasted all over the screen. Karma&#039;s another example. People have been complaining FOR YEARS about her rework&#039;s execution, and the main pain point is that *it&#039;s just really dang bland.*\r\n\r\n**Their kits are also lazily designed on the balance spectrum:** So lets look at a few of them \r\n\r\n{{champion:40}} \r\n\r\nJust how much did we have to nerf this chick for her to FINALLY...**FINALLY** stop putting the entire support role in a choke hold? She has a knock up, a knock back, a slow, a heal, shield, and a MS speed towards her (usually for retreating). When it comes to peel, she&#039;s literally IMPOSSIBLE to outdo in any way, so Riot just took a massive cleaver to her whole kit and beat the shit out of it until it&#039;s finally possible. This shit&#039;s problematic. She&#039;s just a do-it-all design on the defensive spectrum. You can&#039;t ask for better peel, but enchanters are *defensive champions.* If you can just hard-disengage damn near anything while STILL having heals and shields in case something gets through...**why the hell would you use any other enchanter?** People would use Lulu just to try to *match,* not because she&#039;d do anything of value in comparison (unless she&#039;d go solo lane, which has been nipped).\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \r\n\r\nLike...her WHOLE KIT is just dedicated to power spamming heals. I *get* it, but...there&#039;s NOTHING else she does to any real competence, so GW pretty much takes a cleaver to her overall output in a game. Everything about her balancing&#039;s wrapped around the notion that you just wanna blast W on someone&#039;s head, and there&#039;s no other thing in her kit to balance her around. Reducing her Q range, removing the Q sweet spot, being unable to heal more when hitting more targets with Q, changing how her W heal works so it&#039;s more dependent on landing Q, nipping her W&#039;s early cds...like, Soraka&#039;s balancing is basically entirely focused on her W, otherwise she&#039;ll just spam it in the fog of war...but what else does she ACTUALLY do in the game, especially after laning? There&#039;s hardly much of anything.\r\n\r\n{{champion:37}} \r\n\r\nI bring this champion up so much because the sheer amount of lost potential for her design is astounding. Her game play doesn&#039;t translate to anything that *feels* impactful, so it&#039;s super hard to actually deal with her balancing without getting back lash for it. Riot says &quot;Alright, these guys want to be more impactful. Let&#039;s try to fix her up&quot;. What do they do? Inject her with a bit of URF and set her loose on the rift. Nothing about her core game play was addressed, even though her core game play is *the entire problem...since there&#039;s literally no variance in it save for one button.* You see how Xin Zhao had a massive variance issue and Riot gave him **a new skill shot to open up new opportunities via utilizing a new tool that can miss?** Why on Earth was this not done for Sona? I&#039;m still salty over it to this day.\r\n\r\n**My main issue is that Riot shows 0 real interest in tackling this at all:** There are no plans to create a new enchanter. The last support was an assassin, and the one before a catcher. The support jungler before Rakan? A catcher, Ivern. The last enchanter made? Well...Nami. Riot&#039;s slowing down on champion releases, as well...which is smart, but the point remains that we&#039;re probably never seeing a proper enchanter from these guys for the remainder of this decade, and the last released one was **6 years ago, the better half of a decade.**\r\n\r\nThey ALSO have no plans to do any VGUs on any enchanters at all. Hell, they aren&#039;t doing VGUs on **any supports at all, save one** for the forseeable future, based on all the champs they&#039;ve showed even marginal interest in over the past year or so, and Morgana doesn&#039;t really *need* much work, anyway, since they&#039;re really just doing hers because Kayle and her are like a 2 for 1 deal. They said they want to mini-work Karma, but if anyone&#039;s paying attention, we&#039;d know that Riot&#039;s record on VGUs is pretty good...and their record for the MINI-REWORKS is pretty &quot;meh&quot; overall. Many of them aren&#039;t any more balanced than they were before they got reworked (like all the tank ones), some were just wastes of time that see very little change in quality from before their changes (Annie, Leona, Vel&#039;Koz), and some got reverted (Kog, Malz)...some of THOSE being more questionable than others (Rengar, LB). Hell, in Sona&#039;s case, she became an *even worse* balancing issue than before she was reworked. Regardless, Riot&#039;s now going to give Karma one of these sort of half-baked investments, meanwhile the real creative pushes that create things like Nunu, Warwick, Irelia, and Akali&#039;s new designs aren&#039;t really going to show up for bot lane champions.\r\n\r\nIdk what the issue is, honestly. You COULD say &quot;We&#039;re treating enchanters like artillery mages, where we don&#039;t really need a ton of them in the game&quot;...but what stops you from doing work on the ones that are in the game *right now?* If you rework an enchanter, the number of enchanters doesn&#039;t increase, right? We can&#039;t get new ones for years, but we ALSO can&#039;t get work on these bland, wet-noodle designs we already have, and the little bits of &quot;effort&quot; that we do get are the super half-baked kind that gives us...whatever that Sona mini-rework was. Like, in comparison, Xin Zhao *got a new move and a new property on his ult.* Casseopia *got a new move and a brand new (at the time) status ailment.* Sona...got her numbers heavily...tweaked...?\r\n\r\n**Long story short:** Enchanter designs aren&#039;t necessarily &quot;lazy&quot; because they&#039;re super dated. Time change, and as tech and techniques improve, Riot&#039;s able to do more with new champs that won&#039;t be reflected in their older champs. All of that is fine, but Riot&#039;s being super lazy in addressing all of this, just like they were super lazy in addressing fighters not being balanced in the game, and how they were super lazy with bot lane being marksman land instead of an actual lane in the game and now it&#039;s pretty much stuck that way. We&#039;re gonna have another prolonged issue we can&#039;t fix if Riot keeps getting comfortable sitting on issues instead of fixing them.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2018-08-22T07:39:11.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2018-08-22T08:25:19.461+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion all Enchanters should be reworked into Utility-Mages capable of healthy solo-laning.

I think one of the biggest problems with supports in any multiplayer game, and especially in MOBAs, is that they're often placed _way_ too far into the utility end of the spectrum, and have so much power put on team reliance that they create this dilemma where they're mandatory for a team, while not being all that fun to play. It's not particularly fun being relegated to the team's servant, but _someone_ has to do it, because that servant is so team-synergistic that not picking one in a competitive setting is putting oneself at a serious disadvantage (though not one as serious now with mages becoming popular supports).\n\nPersonally, I think there's a healthy medium to be found, one where supportive champions have _some_ measure of team utility, and quite some powerful utility at that, but aren't made so completely reliant on it that they become unable to engage in the things everyone else takes for granted, i.e. fighting, waveclearing, making plays, carrying, and so on. Nami's definitely a good example there, and I think there are also similar version of the above champions to be had: Soraka used to have a semi-tanky offensive AP playstyle, Janna deals more damage now, Sona is notorious for stinging a fair bit if she gets a Lich Bane, etc. Lulu as well is notable for having an on-hit steroid baked into her kit, along with quite a fair bit of offense, and I think it would help to bring her back to her roots, and make her more of a hybrid between an aggressive mage and an aggressive enchanter, rather than the pure shield/ult bot she's devolved into.\n\nAs far as good models go, I'd say Kayle or Morgana are worthy examples of what enchanters could be like: champions who definitely have a fair measure of ally utility, and who can go into a position where they support their allies in a duo lane (Kayle used to be able to do that anyway), but who can also go solo and succeed (or at least could, in Morgana's case). Many, or even most enchanters could probably benefit from staying on the more utility side of things, and not having quite as much damage as Kayle, but they should still be encouraged to fight and participate in the game, and not just when their allies are around.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-08-22T17:02:09.846+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This originates in mushes I believe, maybe even muds.

There are a number of Sona players who find Sona unsatisfying and feel she needs to be buffed, including some players posting on Boards who&#x27;ve felt that way at least since her rework last year.\n \n> 3. **Sona&#x27;s got a kit design that makes it really hard for her power to be satisfying. Her power&#x27;s split between spell casts that affect multiple targets, auras that can affect multiple allies and power chord effects. That means each individual effect has to be pretty weak and therefore hard to feel, let alone feel good about.**\n\n> 4. Sona&#x27;s got a really high reliability kit. Provided you&#x27;ve got at least a moderate handle on how her kit works you&#x27;re going to see fairly consistent output from her. Because her lows aren&#x27;t very low that also contrains our ability to give her high highs. \n\n> 6. In terms of where that leaves us we could introduce some less reliable abilities and concentrate power (e.g. by removing auras, power chord or multi hit spells and in exchange buffing the remaining elements) to address points 3 and 4 above. That would lead to a drastically different Sona however. There might also be room for some small QoL or buffs, and I expect Sona will be discussed again internally after preseason follow up&#x27;s on a good track (though I&#x27;m personally doubtful we&#x27;ve got much power to work with and simply buffing Sona until she feels good&#x27;s going to set her up for a nerf).\n\nI edited out a few bullets that aren't too relevant to the discussion...but this is from *3 years ago,* and the pain points of that discussion still exist as if nothing was done, even though there was at least an attempt to do something about it.

You can cast spells on allies and enemies to different effects and reactively choose to play aggressively or defensively (for example, saving Wild Growth to protect a frail ally from an enemy engage or using Wild Growth on your own engaging allies to bolster their defense and contribute significant crowd control).\n\nSona is fun because of her simplicity. I agree that her design is problematic, but the auras are a unique aspect of her character that has been phased out of nearly every other aspect of the game.  Positioning to avoid threats while tagging as many allies as possible with your auras is also quite engaging and enjoyable to me. Getting the most out of Power Chord is also an engaging task as you cycle through abilities and prioritize different targets.\n\nSoraka is fun because she's the dedicated healer in League of Legends; she appeals the strongest to that fantasy and, because of that, I think she's excellent. \n\nI won't assert that these Champions are perfect, but they have a lot of appeal in their current kit and I don't think they need radical change (except, possibly, in the case of Sona).","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2018-08-23T23:44:33.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Soraka is fun because she's the dedicated healer in League of Legends; she appeals the strongest to that fantasy and, because of that, I think she's excellent.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdpqWokf3_w&list=LLG3TQeVjfOnfojlqpjOEYKQ&t=0s&index=2\n\n^ This is a good example of a dedicated healer.

No this was definetly more the result of someone just not caring and making the least effort possible on the gameplay side.

This is usually due to resource limitation, or trying to accomplish too much with too little time. A great example of the second one, would be the class reworks, which failed not because that no one cared, or no one cared about accurate champion Fantasy. They failed due to the fact that a lot of champions needed more work than what they got, due to the aspect *of* the Class Rework, crammed into a single PBE timeframe. \n\nThis is an effort, which is ruined by the project itself. I remember the Cass rework, the one with the stacks, and while I agree it was a failure, it's not because of the efforts of the designer alone. It's resources. Cass may have needed more work when she gotten that first rework, but all that was given was simply number and mechanic changes, not ability changes like we see today. \n\nIt's why I don't place the blame of Mordekaiser's state solely on CertainlyT himself, but on the fact that Morde needed more than what he got, but due to resources, CertainlyT had to work with what he had. Both Stashu and CertainlyT had limited resources to fix a problem that both these champions had at the time, which both shows in the results. Had they more time, more ability to fully change abilities, or to redesign, than we'd have better champions to this day, but it all stems back to resources. \n\nI dunno bout the Karma stuff though, that was before my time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-08-22T17:11:16.928+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, I'm not sure you are aware of this but a lot of the time riot designs champs around one concept or do to one thing very well.

Riot could make her W all damage and no utility, but that's about all I can see them doing to her right now.\n\nWith Soraka, I hated her rework since it was announce, I still don't like it, but riot gives no craps about her and I'm tired of beating a dead horse.  It was a mistake to link her Q and W to being with.  They made her worse by removing the poke on her E; it's on too long a CD now and frankly I don't like how it works anymore.  I used to max E first before her rework, now I don't.  However, she was one of those champs riot didn't want to see in pro games, she made pro games, and so they decided to ruin her by keeping her as brain-dead as ever and making her game-warping.  As someone who mains her to this day, I still hate the life-cost on her W.  I kind of wish riot would revert her E, give her a W heal that works independently of her other skills and turn her back into a healer/poke-battlemage.  \n\nAll that said, I can still play her so I do.  \n\nAs for Sona, she is what she is: an aura champ who is about selecting the right song for her passive AA.  That's not something riot can really change.  She's always going to be about positioning.

Just a friendly reminder. :)\n\n--------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n---------------------------------\n\n{{champion:40}} Janna\n\nP: MS bonus changed to 5% +2% per rank of W while it is not on CD.\nMakes using Zephyr more costly.\n\nQ: Size grows with charge time, arrow effect alerting allies of the travel direction. (smaller hit-box when snap-casting, larger when fully charged.) Still breaks dashes.\nThe idea here is too encourage predictive play on Janna's part.\n\nW: Cooldown per level lowered. AA bonus moved from passive to W, can be used on allies to give them her damage and MS bonus. Still castable on enemies to damage and slow. Becomes a linear collision skill shot only hitting champions (with a generous hit-box).\nWhile this will remove some of the encouragement Janna has to interact with enemies, it drastically increases the trade-off when giving allies bonus damage as opposed to the live version on shield. Changing the bonus to on-hit damage also removes crit scaling.\n\nE: Cooldown increased. No longer decays, but also no longer grants bonus AD. Partial cooldown and mana refund if the shield is broken.\nSince decaying shields are the newest enchanter trend and ult heal is being removed, this lets her preserve a core strength. The partial refund is to give opponents a way to play around the shield while also punishing her for spamming.\n\nR: Heal replaced with a slow and grounds enemies in the AoE. \nChannels for god-tier peel (or picks) instead of resetting the fight.\n\nThe idea here is to really double-down on Janna's peel and decision making while reducing her general versatility. The damage bonus on her live passive feels like a trap most of the time and the AD on shield is often accused of double-dipping by the community. Reworking both of them into something donatable seems like a efficient solution to both.\n\n------------------------\n------------------------\n\n{{champion:43}} Skarma\n\nStep 1) Admit I'm biased.\n\nP: Shields and heals on allies gain bonus effectiveness equal to a % of the ally's missing health. 5% for heals and 15% for shields.\nFirst step to giving her a passive while returning her the niche of \"front-liner's support.\"\n\nQ: No change.\n\nQ2: Bullet removed; changed to a ground targeted skill shot. Immediately slows and grounds in an AoE on cast. No damage until eruption.\nChanges from a damage focused ability to a utility focused ability.\n\nW: Increased leash range and damages every half second. Continually heals for a % of damage dealt.\nIncreases consistency and safety making it more usable when not building tank.\n\nW2: Cast on target ally granting them both bonus resists equal to 10/20/30% of who ever's is higher (usable on minions, target detection prioritizes champions). Karma heals for a % of all damage taken by that ally and they heal for a % of all damage dealt by Karma's abilities and basic attacks (No Sunfire loopholes).\nReplacing the CC component with a durability steroid that allows and encourages her to follow her favorite front liner into the fray, while rewarding them for the carry.\nThis also gives tank Skarma a purpose beyond \"hard to kill,\" if people want to pursue it. Braum would still be a better option of you're trying to give squishies some durability, though.\n\nE: Shields Karma and target ally (Target detection prioritizes champions). Shield amount increased on self cast.\nLets her double dip when shielding minions during lane phase or allies in a fight. Self cast buff allows ally shield to be weaker (using passive) without hurting her solo lane.\n\nE2: Deals damage in an area based on target ally's max health (Target detection prioritizes champions), then shields that ally equal to the damage dealt (post-mitigation).\nReturn of the shield bomb! Though not quite as powerful as legend, it still allows her to perform some shenanigans during lane phase and becomes a mini-nuke when used on health stackers (Vlad, Zac, etc.).\n\nR: \"Buy back\" passive moved to ult. Mantras now ~~(again)~~ inverse abilities instead of making them flat better.\nNow that Mantra is replacing abilities instead of buffing them, that should free up enough power budget to give her a \"real\" passive.\n\nWorking with Skarma's enchanter elements, I want to bring *back* pre-rework's synergy with beefy front liners. The goal is to keep her as an early game solo laner while transitioning into a mid/late game tank/fighter support. This, of course, means finding ways to reduce her effectiveness when supporting squishies. Hopefully the overhaul makes her a bit more interesting to play while pissing off her two fan bases *roughly equally.*\n\n------------------------\n-------------------------\n\n{{champion:117}} Lulu\n{{champion:267}} Nami\n{{champion:497}} Rakan\n\nSince you didn't express any complaints about them, I won't bother touching.\n------------------------------\n------------------------------\n\n{{champion:37}} Sona\n\nP: Sona's basic abilities have no individual cooldown. Instead she has 4 \"beats\" (ammo system), one of which is consumed with each spell cast. All of Sona's basic abilities go on a half-second cooldown when a beat is expended. 1 beat is regained every 4 seconds (Not affected by CDR). \n\nOnce every 6 seconds (not affected by CDR), if Sona has no \"beats,\" Her next AA is modified based on the last spell she cast.\n\n - Q: Deals true damage in an area around the target. Instantly kills wards and visible, damageable traps in the AoE.\n  - Reduces the single-target annihilation in return for extra team-fight chip. Doesn't feel as bad losing it to a ward.\n - W: Forces the target enemy to dance for a short amount of time. Only consumed when attacking a champion.\n  - Keeping her stun after replacing the ult.\n - E: Causes enemies in a cone to deal reduced damage.\n  - Upping the power a bit to compensate for the reduced usage.\n\nQ: Deals a small amount of damage in a cone. Enemies affected take a small amount of bonus damage from all sources, including her passive, for 2 seconds (Stacks up to 4 times, new applications also refresh duration).\nBurning 4 beats on Q then hitting with the AA will still chunk enemies, but gives a lot more counter-play. Original damage potential is shunted into \"bonus damage\" giving allies an opportunity to dance along.\n\nW: Grants Sona and nearby allies Bonus base MS for 1 second. Additional casts stack and refresh the duration.\nI'm really at a loss on what to do with this one. :/\n\nE: Drops a <thing> that shields nearby allied champions (including Sona) for a small amount every time she uses an ability in it's radius. Lasts 3 seconds and multiple shields stack.\nSince the shield projectile was never very swift to begin with, I'm not overly concerned with the delay. This lets her create a \"studio\" where she can stack shields on allies. Individual shields are small though, so it's not a life-saving ability. Counter-play is to not let her set up, pull her out of the set-up, or assassinate targets before the shields can stack.\n\nR: Cut Time\nSona temporarily changes tempo from common time to cut time, regenerating 1 beat immediately. For the next 6 seconds, her abilities have a quarter second cooldown and she regenerates 1 beat ever 2 seconds.\n\n<\"Change the beat, set the mood.\">\n\n\nKeeping Sona the \"kitchen sink\" support. Skill-shot counter-play is a bit of a rough one without completely alienating her player-base (this probably pushes it too far already). Instead I opted for situational counter-play. Keeping with her music theme, I tried to build the kit around musical tempo. Specifically, common time (4/4). When all hell breaks lose, she can change the tempo for a short-lived super show.\n\n--------------------------------\n--------------------------------\n\n{{champion:16}} Soraka\n\nP: Soraka uses %current health instead of mana to cast abilities. When ever she damages an enemy, she regenerates 80% of the health cost over the next 4 seconds (doubled against champions). 50% of Soraka's bonus health, health regen, and mana regen is converted into AP at a <number> ratio (Think Pyke, not Vlad). Moves faster towards low health allied champions.\nImplementing the mechanic that her kit will revolve around, while taking inspiration from Pyke/Jhin to mitigate itemized circumvention. Also keeping the ambulance thing so she has a \"real\" passive.\n\nQ: 5% cost. Drops a star on target location. Enemies take damage over time while allies gain bonus health regen. Does not affect Soraka.\nHer primary means of healing and recovering health in a fight. Technically has the ability to heal herself and an ally, which is why the functionality is limited to DoT and health regen.\n\nW: 15%. After a short channel, Soraka heals target ally for a large amount of health or damages target enemy champion.\nThanks to the new healing options in her kit, I can afford to nerf this one. Keeping the Over-sized point-and-click heal players know, but adding the ability for enemies to interrupt it. Can also be used on enemy champions if she needs the health.\n\nE: 5% Still creates a silencing circle. Allies inside the circle receive increased healing and health regen from Soraka's abilities. Enemies inside the circle when it collapses are rooted, allies inside the circle when it collapses are cleansed. \nEncourages allies to stay inside the circle where enemies can layer their AoE. Also serves as my answer to grievous wounds.\n\nR: No change.\nToo Iconic.\n\nWe know Riot Doesn't like Soraka *because* she is the game dedicated healer. Rather than making her revolve entirely around 1 skill, I'm trying to make her revolve around the 1 health conversion mechanic. Hard to say if this is better or worse, but it at least has more play dynamics. Using abilities in rapid succession is an intended method of \"gaming\" her passive recovery. As is enemies bursting her during the recovery window.\n\n--------------------------\n--------------------------\n\nTried to post this earlier but my internet went out. Now the thread is exploding.

She could be similar to Octavia (from Warframe). In case you didn't know what i'm talking about, Octavia is a combo based character, most of her abilities plays a different rhythm (similar to Sona) and all abilities but one brings a unique effect to allies (Attack Speed Buff, Armor Bonus Buff, and etc...). \n\nSona could be so much more, but she's reduced to being just a simple healer/shielder, though her aura gameplay is really cool and one of the reasons why such a change could work amazingly.\n\n>{{champion:40}} Janna\n\nTo be honest, I don't really know what to suggest for Janna. Her current abilities really reflects back to her lore and etc... (being a protector and all). Though some skill and mechanics could be implemented somehow.","replies":[]}]}
