Not sure what will ship, but conversations are being had.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of those conversations, it may still be the right thing to do to make some changes to certain enchanters. Over the course of the last few years, a lot has changed about the standards of fairness that modern spells are held to, and defensive spells frequently haven't been held subject to those same standards. Many offensive spells can miss, or have delays or other sources of unreliability to them that make the outcomes behind using them uncertain, or at least give opponents time to react to them occurring. Most defensive spells, on the other hand, are just point and click defensive steroids or health injections of some sort. Reliability isn't necessarily a bad thing; it contributes heavily to a champion being able to do its job consistently. But when characters of high reliability become dominant, it can feel especially hopeless to try to fight them. We see that regularly on offensive-oriented characters, but the same can be true of defensive ones. As such, if or once Ancient Coin is appropriately balanced, it could still be the right thing to do small updates or modernization/fairness passes on some enchanters (or more specifically, to low gameplay defensive spells) to promote more healthy gameplay overall. The implications on the overall flow and cohesiveness of the kit are usually significant in these cases, though, so doing them can be difficult.\n\nFor what it's worth, there's no scheduled action planned on this front at the moment, but talks around what makes for good enchanter gameplay (both through coin and individual kits) are ones we've been having lately.","replies":[{"poster":"JooshBox","date":"2017-10-03T04:47:02.767+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":24,"body":"It's a bit of a shame you guys aren't doing any more class updates.

That's it, and one of those is more useful for on-hit champs.\n\n> Ap marksmen don't exist.

So a champ that builds ap and deals damage through right clicking on enemies is a Ap marksman. And how, _**HOW**_ did you manage to forget about Teemo, a champ who puts out half his damage through his auto's, and has damage on those auto's scaling off his ap? And he is considered a marksman, while also being considered as AP.\n\n> Enchanters? You mean the mage update when they introduced +% Heal/Shield Power which is why we have shielding problems now.\n\nName one enchanter that had their kit changed in the Mage update.

I doubt that is what Riot wants.\n\nSo the enchanter items can be summed up as \"op, situational, and mandatory\". I actually meant that as each part referring to a separate item, but really all of them applies to each item. And when situational items are mandatory every game, for every enchanter, that's an issue.\n\nAlso the only enchanter item changed in the mage update was {{item:3028}}, which doesn't give +%hsp, and that was 6.9. {{item:3504}} and {{item:3222}} were given +%hsp on patch 6.13, which was after the mid year update, and {{item:3107}} was introduced in 6.22.\n\nSo this:\n> You mean the mage update when they introduced +% Heal/Shield Power which is why we have shielding problems now.\n\nIs false.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-10-05T20:37:33.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is a anti bruiser and builds Frozen Mallet -> Wit's End.

And look at that! **Its a build** _that focuses on doing damage via on hit effects._(otherwise known as an \"on-hit build\") And before you say \"oh anyone can build that and do the same amount of damage\", let me remind you that her passive gives her between 6 and 80 on hit damage, based on her level and her total movement speed.

Like it or not, most are mages who scale to AP, and either SHOULD have some AP, or shouldn't be playing Summoner's Rift. Nami particularly, is one of my pet peeves, because I've played her 4 years. \n\nNami literally needs 190 AP just to break even on Ebb And Flow bounces. With the \"meta\" itemization and relying on a REALLY LONG COOLDOWN Redemption on a Nami, Nami is 1) Slowing her passive and 2) reducing her Bounce core heals/damage in exchange for a long cdr global situational active. It makes a LOT more sense to get a Chalice, get a Censer, and to get a Frost Queen to boost Nami's AP. However, getting the STE will reduce gold totals, slow her down, and often put her at risk. So, She ends up trading an STE for a Coin. The AP balance on my Nami with Censer and Athene's is only about 138 AP, so she's under her goal at that point. If that's the only AP I push, I'm underhealing my potential, doing about half or even 1/3 my potential damage. So, I started adding a Seraph to my build to supplement the loss of a Frost Queen's AP. Works, adds an all purpose shield, and boosts those heals to +15% per bounce, so the last bounce actually heals more than the first, instead of MUCH LESS.\n\nBottom Line: Coin although the safer more gold generating pick, punishes support healers and mages into choosing off meta more expensive builds to compensate for not having STE's AP, and sometimes, just as importantly, damage boost (which is important vs turrets and champs alike). And if those supports choose not to build the more expensive build, their win rates are FAR lower than their champion's overall rates of win.","replies":[{"poster":"GrievousFetus","date":"2017-10-03T18:50:53.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"building AP Nami, Lulu, Sona etc. is a noob trap.

I suggest you try it over arguing the meta. In a difficult game I average 50k heals and 22-23k damage with less than 3 deaths. In a short game I average 27k heals and 16k damage. Low AP Nami W bounces for heal PENALTIES. High AP Nami bounces for heal BONUSES.\n\nA 130 AP nami with a Redemption, and a Censer and an Athene's will only heal about 185 + 40 + 250 = 475 + 20%  = 476 first bounce, and only about 200 heal on Bounce 3.\n\nA 300 AP nami With Censer, Athene's and a Seraph, will heal Bounce 1 185 + 100 + 250 = 642 first bounce, and do about a 632 third bounce, because 1) the amount of damage on bounce 2 is greater, recharging MORE of Athene's, and because the bonus damage will be 15%^2 instead of a penalty.\n\nNet gain on heal just from 170 AP : 598. And, unlike the Redemption, YOU CAN SPAM IT.\n\nFurthermore, Tear is extremely viable for Nami. She's a self and local spammer, and it will help you get to lane FAST without actually burning much mana. It also helps once it's an Archeangel to prevent Tristana bursts or something like a Kayn 1 hit.\n\nWhen I say \"AP\" I do NOT mean the entire build. There's a reason I talk in terms of 300ish.

After that period, the remaining health of the shield changes to gray health which slowly decays into health at a 70/85/100/115/130% exchange rate. If the champion is hit while gray health is visible, it is all removed instantly.\nIf soraka has hit a champion with Starcall within the last 3 seconds, the shield lasts twice as long, and soraka gains a shield worth half value. Cooldown: 18/16/14/12/10 seconds\"\n\nThis sort of concept would be two fold. Ensure Soraka's Out of combat sustain is still among the best in the game, while also allowing FAR more counterplay in the form of poke once to negate all healing. It also makes Soraka have clearer weaknesses in that her sustain in offensive sieging is far more powerful than her sustain in defending against a siege.\n\nAlong with the change to her W, her Q would need to be changed as well, especially if you removed Soraka's health cost on her W.\n\n\"Starcall: Soraka calls a Star down to a target location, slowing all enemies hit, and granting Soraka 1/2/3/4/5% Increased Healing and Shielding for the next 5 seconds. This increases for each champion hit up to a maximum of 25%.\"\n\nThis change encourages Soraka to be offensive, and offers a FAR more engaging late game benefit to Q than what is currently offered. This encourages Soraka to make riskier plays, and make herself far more vulnerable.\n\nConsidering Soraka gets hit incredibly hard by the removal of runes, (You won't find a single Raka player right now who doesn't run Health Regen runes), and that alone will nerf her out of viability, but straight up buffing her is out of the question since she's just too toxic and frustrating to play against.\n\nThe biggest issues for Champions like Sona/Soraka is that you guys just can't seem to figure out how to give them \"Engaging moments\" to take risks.
