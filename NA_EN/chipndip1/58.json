What do I get today?\n\n0/4/9 Gold 5 Vayne\n\n0/6/0 Riven\n\n1/10/1 Rengar\n\nAll in one day.\n\n**Like fucking clockwork**. Whatever Riot put into the match-making to intentionally hold people back is driving me up a wall. If I even get *near* promos, some shit happens, let alone being in them. I seriously have the thought that something&#039;s up with this game&#039;s matchmaking. It&#039;s outright uncanny what comes out of the woodwork these days.\n\nEdit: Made this thread. Got in-game. Mid afks for four levels. Then I realize I forgot the game where my mid, once again, afk'd. So in 5 games I had 3 intense feeders, one being Gold 5 mind you, and two afks. I'm surprised I even managed to win the Vayne one.","replies":[]}
