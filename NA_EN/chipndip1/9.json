Both were supposed to be mid-lane mages, who thanks to ridiculously exploitable kits (let's not forget the videos when malz was able to solo dragons/barons 4mins into games) are now infecting other lanes thanks to their high base damages and ability to reliably poke from quite far away. Oh, and from what I can understand people prefer traditional supports not because they offer more but because the chances of someone \"trolling\" are far less. If I were to lock in something like Zed/LB support (the latter I did quite frequently before the mage reworks), I'd probably be criticized heavily in the pre-game even if I was ridiculously good on it compared to something like alistar/taric.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-05T04:12:55.185+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mye,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ymPNjgLM,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2017-01-05T04:07:39.905+0000)\n>\n>lets not forget the videos when malz was able to solo dragons/barons 4mins into games\n\nMalz must have been hella OP if he managed to kill Baron before it even spawned...","replies":[]},{"poster":"J Eevo","date":"2017-01-05T21:08:28.715+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mye,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ymPNjgLM,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2017-01-05T04:07:39.905+0000)\n>\n> Oh, and from what I can understand people prefer traditional supports not because they offer more but because the chances of someone &quot;trolling&quot; are far less.\n\nI'll just pop in and say - everyone prefers traditional supports except for people who have to play them, fact is, playing most supports is not fun and feels like a chore to the player having to be relegated to a babysitter early, and then fading into obscurity late. Getting mages into botlane might alleviate that, as they're way more fun to play, so if they can do their job sufficiently without being overbearing it shouldn't be a problem. Especially considering how much of a hassle autofill is, and how rare support mains are. It'd be nice if the pool of champions would be higher without having to wait what could be years, before we get a varied choice of new support champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2017-01-05T23:46:42.488+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Malzahar high base damage, don't drink and post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-01-05T03:47:01.803+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd honestly have a *long* talk about Redemption and some other support itemization topics I've been on a mini-warpath about recently, but I doubt anyone has the care to read it all, much less a rioter.\n\nRegardless, mages going bot lane, from what I'm seeing, is highlighting a major issue with the more traditional mages and how we're treating them.","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2017-01-05T05:00:22.613+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really though, Redemption is cancer.","replies":[{"poster":"SpÃ¢rky","date":"2017-01-18T13:37:00.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preach this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-01-05T04:00:47.912+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The traditional support pool is fairly small, and often not people's cup of tea.

Mages are meant to scale with gold. If a mage is functioning at nearly the same level without gold as with then it probably signifies a huge problem with their kit. They probably don't have the right balance of ratios and bases, their bases are extremely out of wack and it's leading to them not wanting to go mid because there's no actual benefit in their scaling.\n\nBoth of these arguments are true, and they're both things that need solutions. These arguments do apply to some champs less than others however. Vel'koz seems to be fine in both roles, Lulu wasn't particularly oppressive when she was played midlane, although she also wasn't a support.\n\nThere are certainly support champs who could be balanced to play in mid without being too strong in a 2v2 situation. I think Sona is a good example of this, while she does have some kit power in buffing allies a surprising amount of her kit also acts as selfish utility. Her passive is the same with or without allies, her Q losses a small amount of unreliable damage, her shield and heal still effect herself, her E is mostly selfish MS the aura is far weaker than what she gains and her R is in thew same boat as her passive.\n\nYou could easily put Sona in a workable place as both an offensive support and a utility oriented midlane. All she'd need is a little bit of AoE so she has at least some wave control and she'd be playable in the midlane, she's already very close to it TBH. I don't think Sona would be particularly oppressive at this, she'd be a strong counter to poke but not an unbeatable counter since you can attack her mana pool and she'd be quite weak to a lot of burst champs. There aren't many midlaners who fall into this category to begin with, mages who counter poke are quite rare, the only mage who I can think of who plays above average into poke without themself being a poke mage is Orianna, so I do think this would actually be an interesting thing to have.\n\nOn the flip side we have Zyra, a mage who is unplayable in her original role. She's had so many changes to force her to play support that she's no longer viable mid. She utterly oppresses other supports though. She is what you are arguing against, just from the other direction.\n\nYou have to judge these things champ by champ, there are some champs who will work in both roles and some who won't. When you misjudge you create Zyra.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-01-05T05:08:10.587+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree that this is a champ by champ notion, and as for Zyra I never found that much trouble against her even though I take {{champion:44}} support. (Wierd huh?)\n\nBut my post was meant to be a generalistic guide to why these mages work the way they do.\n\nFor example, take two of the common mages being played support right now. {{champion:63}} and {{champion:161}} \n\nTheir CC is next to nothing. They bring mostly damage. They like having gold and levels so they are gimped. But they have strong bases so they are viable bot.\n\nLate Game their performance will vary wildly, but they overall provide nothing but damage. That's okay, sometimes team comps don't need as much utility.\n\nBut then we have mages like {{champion:40}} and {{champion:143}} \n\nCan you imagine the chaos that would ensue if they had the base damages of a midlaner (like Brand and Vel) but also had the utility they currently sport now? Why would I take Brand mid if Janna could do comparable damage AND be ungankable?\n\nYou see, you are correct in saying that some support mages can be played mid with tweaks, but if you notice the ones you mentioned have little _utility_, in this case CC.\n\nSona has little to no CC and is squishy as tissue paper, so if she was changed to be a viable midlaner and support this might work out fine.\n\nHowever a Support mage like say, Zyra with her snares and plants and all that, would destroy other midlaners becuase **She has the Excellent Base Damage of a Support but also has the scaling and CC that beats out other midlanerss**\n\nWhat I can see here is that mages fall into a spectrum of having Utility--------------------------Damage.\n\nThe ones more on the damage side can work support IF their bases are good enough, but they won't crowd out other choices because they are mostly meant to cheese kills and get snowballed and in the midlane they are in their natural habitat.\n\nHowever mages more on the ultility side have to be watched to make sure that they aren't too good in a solo lane becuase they will have the damage of a midlaning mage but have the safety and peel of a support mage.\n\nMake sense?","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-01-05T05:14:42.718+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">However a Support mage like say, Zyra with her snares and plants and all that, would destroy other midlaners becuase She has the Excellent Base Damage of a Support but also has the scaling and CC that beats out other midlanerss\n\nThis is so far backwards. \n\nLet me spell this out for you, **ZYRA IS A MID LANE MAGE**. She was initially designed as a mid lane mage and [when Riot was reworking her that is what the community told them to rework her into.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/xVQr7ihf-mid-year-mage-updates-zyra-direction) Her support role is a corruption of this.

This isn't bad, I have a lot of fun playing Sona, but of all of them, Nami and Leona tend to be my more favorite picks because they require a bit more interaction than simply mashing a button and having a massive AoE ability. Bard was the most interesting support that I've seen, only issue is his heal is just hilariously bad in late game and is better suited to a MS buff.\n\nAlso, when I'm support I really want to do more than just heal and shield, hence why I love Nami's E. I want to buff my team, debuff enemy somehow, not just slows and stuns.

Marksmen are taking a longer time in game to be relevant because they require a LOT of gold/expensive items since their main form of damage is the Auto Attack (this is probably the hardest Role for Riot to balance, although cheaper itemization would probably help).\n6. If Traditional supports are only relevant because of an item (Redemption) that's a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkale","date":"2017-01-05T19:43:23.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a stun?\nHe has a silence on Q,  A suppression ult, and a hated passive shield, but where is the stun?","replies":[{"poster":"EyesOfTheFox","date":"2017-01-05T23:29:58.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lump suppression/stun together.
