Let's simmer down the Sona threads, bois (for now).","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Made a thread asking what on Earth is keeping Riot so quiet about Sona. Got a response from Meddler:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EkxbfyvO-so-lemme-get-this-straight?show=flat&comment=0008\n\nAs it stands, Riot believes (or at least Meddler believes) that Sona&#039;s &quot;relatively fine&quot; as a pube-stomper as far as balance goes for the time being. They (or he) *do realize that Sona isn&#039;t in a good spot game play wise, and many people are unsatisfied with her current state*, however. It also looks like they (or he) have no idea what the hell to do about her kit as a whole due to how reliable it is (Consequence of archaic design. Should have done something about it during the rework. No one really gets to have point-n-clicks anymore outside of melee champs and Annie...who everyone loaths).\n\nStill, I&#039;m making this thread because I understand that being given the silent treatment for so long has made a lot of Sona mains pretty...let&#039;s be honest, fking pissed. Despite this, a new preseason is coming around and we at least know that Riot (or at least someone at Riot) knows Sona&#039;s in a bad way atm, which was the entire point of that thread. Basically asking for a call to simmer down the Sona threads until we see how the masteries and the new FQC line (and Sightstone upgrade) effect the champ, especially since Lich will now offer cdr (like...the item will be basically *essential* on Sona now). I know Morde fans had their time to riot, and we should too (and honestly, we did), but let&#039;s reel it back a good bit. The preseason will have a lot of changes, so throwing more changes in will only make balance crazier.\n\nshort version: Sona bois...we got a response of...some kind. Let&#039;s chill a bit for now.","replies":[]}
