Getting rid of old Akali was like trying to lose your own shadow.\n- Counter-play is heavily apparent in just about every part of her kit. Her passive and Q can be out-ranged. Her W can be walked away from. Her E can be side-stepped. If she tower dives with W, you can just hit her with your hard cc (most every mid laner has SOMETHING to hit her with when she&#039;s untargetable).\n- She has less overall mobility than she used to. It&#039;s more free-form now, but her overall ability to fly in, re-fly in, and re-fly in one more time and murder someone, only to re-fly to someone else, is greatly reduced.\n- As long as she isn&#039;t fed too hard, her burst pattern is significantly slower than just about any other assassin in the game, save Pyke.\n- Her difficulty curve makes sure that you have to be *pretty dang good* at this champ before she&#039;s actually a threat. Her low elo win rates are through the floor, while her higher elo win rates aren&#039;t offensive for solo queue (they reach to like 50% or so in Diamond on lolalytics, give or take 1%).\n- She&#039;s actually able to be played in pro games, where most assassins that aren&#039;t 1-shot machines don&#039;t get play.\n\nSo we can say things like &quot;But her shroud&#039;s annoying&quot; or &quot;she beat me last game and I just don&#039;t like that&quot;, but if we&#039;re saying Akali&#039;s some horrible design that should have never been made...\n\n...then what assassin ISN&#039;T?\n\n{{champion:7}}: EXTREMELY little in the way of counter-play. The most time you have to react to her is the time she takes to finish her dash. If she isn&#039;t hard-cc&#039;d she can just poof away.\n\n{{champion:35}}: His whole play pattern is &quot;Be invisible. Get behind them. AA + E + Ignite + Dark Harvest. Bam I&#039;m amazing&quot;. Annoying little shit with invisibility (not camouflage, but invisibility) and a blink on the same ability, so if he isn&#039;t hard cc&#039;d, he&#039;s long gone. Also, activating his ult just lets him avoid damage for free.\n\n{{champion:107}}: This dude&#039;s bullshit, along with LeBLanc, was the poster boy of the assassin rework in the first place. Also, what type of assassin design doesn&#039;t have *a way out* of fights? He&#039;s practically a fighter.\n\n{{champion:55}}: Absolutely useless beyond solo queue stomping because her ult&#039;s so bad. I&#039;m sorry, but it&#039;s the truth. If Riot wants her to spin and throw knives, find another way to do it besides making an assassin *spin in place with an aoe dps ability.* The dagger game play is already pretty easy to play around, but the ult being as easy to stuff as it&#039;s always been makes it so there&#039;s always going to be a point where Katarina&#039;s basically just training wheels when you can pick some other assassin.\n\n{{champion:555}}: Only reason people mildly accept this champion is because he&#039;s a support so he isn&#039;t designed to run you over for as long as other assassins can. I guarantee that people are that shallow.\n\n{{champion:105}}: The dude&#039;s &quot;Chum then bum (rush)&quot; game play, combined with his E just nullifying incoming damage with little effort, has struggled to find a sweet spot to rest on for years. Either he doesn&#039;t even need his whole kit to bum (rush) you, or he&#039;s the one getting bum (rushed) throughout the entire laning phase. Dude&#039;s 1-5 is insanely weak, and the spike at level 6 is extremely polarized in comparison. Honestly, if you ask me, if his level 6 was LESS deadly, you could use it as justification to make his 1-5 less pathetic, because it&#039;s fucking pathetic and is the reason his level 6 has such a a sharp spike.\n\n{{champion:76}}: Either runs the whole jungle by herself or stays by herself while the rest of the roster gets to have fun. Idk what Riot&#039;s gonna do about this champ.\n\n{{champion:238}}: People hate him, but let&#039;s be honest when I say that nearly any mage can just build the counter-play to Zed. Hell, any ap scaling champ *period* can build the counter-play to this champ. His ult takes so long to drop that, along with the teleport lock out, what is this champ supposed to accomplish, again? Like, once you realize &quot;Oh yeah, he&#039;s gonna appear right behind me&quot;, you just walk under turret and cc him. Now HE dies for ulting you since his ult has such a big notice before it goes off.\n\nWe can run down the list all night, but the point is that Akali&#039;s design manages to avoid ALL these pitfalls. She doesn&#039;t operate on polarizing one shots (unless she&#039;s fed since any damage champ will 1-shot when fed so don&#039;t bring it up), she has an appreciable and rewarding skill curve, she doesn&#039;t just give away everything about what she&#039;s doing before doing it, she isn&#039;t a confused fighter, and she isn&#039;t just a &quot;solo queue&quot; design. Like, what more COULD you want from an assassin design? Sure, her numbers are always up for tuning, but the core foundation of the design seems more than sound. It seems like what Riot was aiming for with Evelynn&#039;s design, Zed&#039;s design, and the assassin rework as a whole...but people still complain. I don&#039;t get it.\n\nSo what *do* people want? Is there an assassin design that embodies &quot;proper&quot; assassin mechanics in the game? I&#039;ve resided on these boards for a few years, so given the complaints I&#039;ve seen about assassins, I don&#039;t see how people don&#039;t see the good that came out of Akali&#039;s kit.

I've won and lost games against her, and when she is most annoying to deal with is during tower dives.\n\nHer invisibility breaks all the rules they've put into the game so far about stealth.  There is no great counter to it besides having picked the right champion (preferably somewhat tanky and has some kind of non targeted aoe).  When she dives a person under tower and the smoke shield is up makes it near impossible to tell how much health she is losing or gaining by her Q/gunblade.  \n\nOne of the biggest things you need to know when an enemy jumps on you under tower is whether you need to use summoner spells to escape or attempt a kill.  If you can't see the enemy to discern those things then you either burn your summoners needlessly or don't use them when you should have.  If you're melee with no aoe at all her smoke screen just means no interaction whatsoever.\n\nIn summary, she's fine for the most part.  It's only that the smoke screen is a giant wall of non interaction that you can't do anything about, and it sucks having anything in the game you can't affect.  Other assassins are still frustrating, but at least there is some counter play to whatever they are doing.  Akali's counter play is pick the right champion.  It is particularly strange because Riot has been doing nothing EXCEPT encouraging all devices that enable interaction (less wave clear, scuttle crabs, etc), just not for Akali.\n\nOtherwise totally agree with you.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-10-08T02:23:02.583+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"But if she's tower diving you, and you hit her with your cc (since almost no cc in the game that's left is targeted anyway, so we can safely assume you successfully hit her), and then you use your other non-targeted moves, and she's STILL not dead...\n\n...can't you just not walk back up to the shroud? You can see where she is in the shroud during a dive. Being unable to AA her doesn't mean you can't see her. If she's still alive, obviously you don't just walk up to her again.\n\nIf you're low on hp, wouldn't you just recall, anyway? Any other assassin would blink/dash in and murder you outright, then blink/dash out. In Akali's case...you could just walk backwards (assuming she was recently hard cc'd, because if you don't she's about to ult you).\n\nI just don't follow. Like, I get she can be annoying depending on who you are, but EVERY champ can be annoying.

If she's on half health and dives you under tower with smoke screen, you ignite her and hit her with a spell before she disappears again while she q's you in response, then you can't see what health she is at or how much she has healed for.\n\nDo you flash away?

Generally you have room for 2 mistakes with other champs. It's still a skillshot, it can still be dodged, it can still be cleansed/spellshielded. \n{{champion:122}} He felt unfair because he deals brutally more damage than dedicated damage classes while being almost as beefy as dedicated beef classes. But play a certain way and avoid the Q and you can prevail.\n{{champion:420}} People had no clue how to handle her E. First dodge it, but if not... let a tent spawn, keep it alive and stand next to it. The only spawn space is gone and ur safe.\nYou see all these champs abuse common mechanics which can be avoided in the first place, and if not can then be RELIABLY played around. There're of course more examples just as there're examples of the opposite.\n\n{{champion:36}} Feels unfair because he has access to a stat stick heal that would take a team of supports to match\n{{champion:114}} Feels unfair because she forces you to play the game her way and can't be counterbuilt (vitals)\n{{champion:105}} If unfair because his E is a unique tool for him that has no work around.\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:429}} all suffer from this exact problem.\nMost of them either take a mechanic to the extreme (mundo) or have a mechanic no one else has, like akali. Since these mechanics are made in isolation, they have one cookier cutter way to be dealt with that requires specific champions played in specific ways with specific builds. Because there is no other mechanic like it to match it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-10-08T05:24:41.014+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali's a pain because there's no real \"counterplay\" to akali, its a matter of the akali player outplaying themselves. Its the same syndrome as yasuo, its either  going to give you a really bad day, or an easy time depending on how the person plays. \n\n> - She can actually be peeled. Getting rid of old Akali was like trying to lose your own shadow.\n\nI disagree as you could kill old akali the moment she jumped somebody. She could get backline easily, but her stealth didn't include as large of a radius, you could group around her priority target and kill her. New akali on the other hand, you're discouraged to group up because all of her damage except for E and passive is AoE, she wants you to line up and she also has the microstun. Sure you can peel for your ADC so she doesn't just delete them, but in doing so you risk a lost teamfight as she hurts everybody at once instead. The most you can do is CC her when she gets the jump, but like old akali thats really hard to do since she'll go back in stealth as she's not attacking, with a larger radius to work around.\n\n> - She has less overall mobility than she used to. It's more free-form now, but her overall ability to fly in, re-fly in, and re-fly in one more time and murder someone, only to re-fly to someone else, is greatly reduced.\n\nWell, depends how you look at it. I'd say yea for sure its not as binary as old akali, new one has mobility in her E which is with the backwards dash (either for over walls, to hit somebody with E, or even backwards to get closer for a Q slow) and her R does have free roam dashes but with a high CD. The stealth size does enable her to cover a lot of ground though, as in she can walk around aimlessly more freely then old akali where she had to dash out of her small shroud to go on something and it was predictable how she'd use those dashes. I'd say its less about which had more mobility, and more about which has enough to get the job done, in which case i'd vote they're both even on. \n\n> - As long as she isn&amp;#039;t fed too hard, her burst pattern is significantly slower than just about any other assassin in the game, save Pyke.\n- Her difficulty curve makes sure that you have to be pretty dang good at this champ before she's actually a threat. Her low elo win rates are through the floor, while her higher elo win rates aren't offensive for solo queue (they reach to like 50% or so in Diamond on lolalytics, give or take 1%).\n\nAgreed, this is probably her biggest weakness and its how much effort it takes to get the kill. Granted there's not much you can do about it but that's why akali is extremely hard to play, she works for what she gets.. but that's also where she suffers from yasuo syndrome. A good akali will make her kills impossible to counterplay, but a bad one will somewhere in all that effort mess up and miss out on the kill entirely or result in a turn around. There is significantly more room for error from the player, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's room for the opponent to cause that error. She can fight you but you can't fight back with that shroud. \n\n> - She's actually able to be played in pro games, where most assassins that aren't 1-shot machines don't get play.\n\nActually doesn't akali have like a 42% winrate at LCS this year? I think the main reason she's being played is because of how safe she can be. Like I mentioned her shroud makes telegraphing her extremely difficult and time consuming, and if LCS taught us anything, its safety first, so she could bait a lot of plays if anybody actually tries to act on her or even turn fights around with it. \n\nAssassins that do get played in LCS usually get played for more reasons then just 1-shot machines. Like season 7's {{champion:121}} {{champion:107}} were mainly seen utilizing the utility and amazing clears they offer to teams. Kha'zix's evolved Q made objectives easy to take, and his slow was valued alongside his ability to run around the map fast as a pseudoevelynn to reduce risk of being caught. Rengar had his built in cleanse so he was easier to not die as and sorta countered other CC champs like {{champion:60}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:85}}, etc. Alongside his Q making raptors, wolves, and krugs a breeze. Akali would be a prime example of this, in that she can play safe but still be a threat of her own. Talon was played quite a bit recently too but I haven't watched enough about him to give an opinion, but i'd imagine it'd relate to how much pressure he applies early, how much pressure he applies in his roaming, and how likely he is to get out of bad situations easier.\n\n\n> So what do people want? Is there an assassin design that embodies \"proper\" assassin mechanics in the game?\n\nWell here's the thing. I don't believe the fact akali is an assassin is what is concerning everybody, its how her play pattern is. People hate {{champion:238}} because of how easy it is for him to shit on somebody, people hate {{champion:84}} because of how hard it is to shit on her. It may not be easy for her to shit on you, but it is entirely her advantage to.\n\nAs for \"proper assassin design in the game\" short answer is no. {{champion:555}} comes close but its literally because he's gated as a support, he doesn't do enough on his own and even though he does pack a punch, its not stupidly high, like blitzcrank's ult does 250-500 base damage so damage from supports isn't too alien, even leona can flat out destroy you early on. I think people are sometimes just glad there's a {{champion:555}} support instead of {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}}, because personally I do think after his recent buffs he's a little too past his sweet spot but I'm still not banning him because curtain #2 is just as concerning. Also he's skillshot based, which is a rarity among his class. I can't really say what we'd envision as a proper, perfectly balancable and healthy assassin because the class literally involves \"priority target removal\" so somebody's day is going to be shit, rather then say a fighter or diver focusing more on everybody and meatshielding a little. \n\nThere will always be bias towards assassins just due to their mere role concept. People hate mobility, people hate stealth, people hate duskblade/dark harvest and gunblade, people hate point and click abilities/autos, anything that utilizes any of that which 100% likely would for target access, is likely going to be circlejerked.

Kat can at least do a huge amount of teamfight damage and akali can achieve about the same thing with her shroud even if she does go down. It might not be as instant though.\n\n2) I came to discuss why she's a problem in my opinion, to other people whether that's the popular opinion on her exact problem or not, because you're not looking at the bigger picture. You're looking at specific traits comparative to other assassins regarding why people hate on her or previous iterations. Old akali was by no means a balanced champion, so whether you consider new akali above or under that design doesn't speak a lot. Saying she shouldn't be hated because she doesn't offer the same duskblade auto kill playstyle as other assassins doesn't necessarily mean she isn't hated for other reasons. I agreed with your points because yes they're true, but they're not the issue behind the point of the topic. You compare her to other assassins but again, she's not like other assassins and that doesn't necessarily do her justice.\n\n3) Don't accuse I dislike assassins when i am an assassin main. Well AP diver - > assassin main {{champion:60}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:56}}. I'm just unbiased in that I 100% understand the frustration of all these designs and what makes them good/bad and what makes them infuriating/fair. Just because I play {{champion:121}}, doesn't mean I'd defend him in his current state. As a matter of fact I'd love to see a version of him where his passive was gutted, duskblade didn't exist, and he relied on Q for skill expression, extended duels, and general game health. I don't mind playing against him too, so consider that I don't even hate kha'zix and I can rationalize with people who do. I play {{champion:91}} but I'll be the loudest person in the room to say I fucking hate his design currently and I don't take satisfaction in what I achieve with him. \n\nI called pyke decent off of my own opinion. You stated it as your own and considered it close because of the outcry, well I'm part of the popular opinion believe it or not. I don't enjoy playing against pyke honestly, I don't personally play him currently (but intend to), but I'm not biased enough to call pyke a terrible design as yes, he doesn't do anything uncounterable.. his Q can be side stepped, his E can be side stepped and has a delay, and his ult requires you to get low in the first place and is still a dodgable skill shot. Nothing in his kit screams to me \"wat do\" when I ask how to counter him, if he's broken to me, I think its strictly because of his tuning, which is why I disagreed with his recent buffs and now I strongly believe he's over tuned, anything else I can blame it on myself. Akali I don't see thats fair to blame it on myself if there was never room for me to do something in the first place, despite how long it takes her to kill you, there's some how little room to punish which I think is very unfair. I'm actually starting to learn akali myself recently and it is disgusting the more I play her, but I haven't been playing her as ham (bans and stuff). I have good games and bad games, when I do have good ones, its because I completely prevented my opponent from doing anything. When I have bad ones its because I suck at akali still. \n\n___\n\nAs for your question, I'm personally going to wait a see the future because I'm really uncertain to say either;\n\na) farther, next azir / kalista in that she'll be godlike but significantly held down by pro preformance and average playerbase just can't handle her skill cap. This is a big claim admittingly so please take with a grain of salt if this isn't true. \n\nb) farther because her general design is more frustrating in a counterplay clarity sorta way. There's a saying yasuo has no counter play and his hardest counter is himself, I believe this holds true to akali, and whether or not the current patch's banrate correlates with the actual viability, it is still really hard to push out or shove back into the game without causing balance issues.\n\nc) closer because I do believe if it wasn't for her 1 frame ult and both the size and turret stealth of her W (or just flat out the entire ability as a whole), I think we'd be on to something here as a healthy assassin, if not, at least a nice fighter. New akali is less binary and thats good, it doesn't communicate well with its opponent on how to beat it however and I can only say old akali did it better because she utilized the same shroud but on a much more toned down level, so she was literally going ape shit with point and click single target abilities where everybody can go on her. \n\nI'm not going to flat out say either one because I do try to view this from multiple viewpoints, but I do believe akali as is the current design regardless to be unhealthy and broken and can mostly rationalize with the arguments on why she's hated rather then why she shouldn't be. I'm leaning with farther.\n\nI can't design a healthy assassin as an assassin main. I would only be able to re-make the definition of assassins as a whole, ex. I believe assassins in games like smite are well designed, a lot of them don't one shot but instead have fighter like patterns similar to camille or Elise. Arachne is an assassin, but rather then deleting somebody, she utilizes a 3 hit proc that stuns somebody and does % health damage, this makes her a duelist that kills her isolated target with the same outcome, but with a slower and more punishable rate. She doesn't powerspike with flat damage bonuses but rather attack speed so she can melt her stunned opponent quicker. She gets the job done, but not in a way that the player literally grey screens in .2 seconds just off of raw damage output. Her mobility is a stronger version of Elise's rappel, but you can see her coming and where she's going, and its an ultimate ability.

I'm alright with LB engaging and one shotting me, I'm not okay with LB engaging and one shotting me, then repeating the same for the rest of my team every 4 seconds. I'm alright with akali killing me under tower with her shroud because I lost lane, I'm not okay with akali killing me in teamfights then popping back into and out of her shroud with her full kit again each time killing a teammate. Assassins are too powerful, with the ability to engage and disengage repeatedly, detonating players before they can react, this is un-intuitive and un-enjoyable gameplay. I believe this season will be a rework upon assassins, since we're going full circle and we seem to have gone through all the other classes thus far. I'm hoping Riot will look into this and possibly rework assassins into a better state, but at this rate, I'm almost certain they will create more problems. Maybe make electrocute and ignite into one item, removing the keystone and summoner ability, forcing all assassins to build it till it gets nerfed 10 patches later. Fuck, I can actually see Riot doing this now.","replies":[]}]}
