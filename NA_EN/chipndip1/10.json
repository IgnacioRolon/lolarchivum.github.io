Fine, I&#039;m willing to entertain the notion that maybe people want team comps that don&#039;t have a marksman sometimes.\r\n\r\nBut it&#039;s pretty common sense you need a *carry champion* in some form. However, whenever a melee carry gets strong enough to be noticeable in the meta (Riven, Fiora, Jax, YASUO, Yi), you guys completely lose it. Sometimes they don&#039;t even need to be *strong* more than they just gotta be &quot;decent&quot;...like Yasuo. Fiora&#039;s qq threads are already coming up on the gameplay boards, too. Like, honestly, you guys are probably more upset with the fact that you&#039;re getting styled on by ANY carry, melee or ranged, than you are about champ diversity.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-06-07T13:38:04.330+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"First off, marksmen and light fighters are not the only carries in the game.

The point is that someone's there to help take towers and provide more sustained damage rather than burst damage.

It's sometimes too risky to play a melee carry top if you have an adc bot since you could end up losing a frontline. ADCs also often take priority in peel and protection because most of the community views them as the carry that must be protected. So while someone is babying the adc, the melee carry is getting ganked by three people. \n\nThe most annoying thing imo is that Riot doesn't seem interested in releasing a marksman that doesn't function as a carry in general. The only time marksmen don't act as carries are when the class as a whole is doing poorly. You normally don't pick a utility marksmen for mainly their utility, just their damage in the current meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-06-07T17:41:28.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uo1issWp,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-06-07T15:17:41.174+0000)\n>\n> Remember Morde when he WAS a meta bot laner?

I made a very clear point that _any_ champion should be able to replace marksmen in bot lane, and what needs to be targeted is marksman dominance there, not some imaginary problem with every other class that you're trying to create. I also explained the reasons behind melee carries being unpopular, so you attempting to trot that point out again without addressing them shows you aren't truly interested in having a proper discussion on the subject.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uo1issWp,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-06-07T15:17:41.174+0000)\n> \n> The term for &quot;light fighter&quot; now is &quot;skirmisher&quot;.

I have made this point already in the above post, you can't just pretend it didn't happen and follow up with an unsubstantiated statement. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uo1issWp,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-06-07T15:17:41.174+0000)\n> \n> Thirdly, Yasuo&#x27;s actually a mid-game carry.

GP, Yi, and Fiora make better late-game skirmishers.\n\nIf you look at [top lane Yasuo's win rate](http://champion.gg/champion/Yasuo/Top?league=platinum), it starts out high and dips harshly up to the ~25-minute mark, before rising equally steeply towards the ~30-minute mark and onwards. [Mid lane Yasuo's win rate](http://champion.gg/champion/Yasuo/Middle) just keeps increasing from start to finish, so your point is wrong in addition to being completely irrelevant to the discussion.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uo1issWp,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-06-07T15:17:41.174+0000)\n> \n> Even if you want to bank your shit in the early game, you have *early game carries* like Quinn and Lucian.

The same can be said for Graves and even Kindred pre-rework. As mentioned in the above post, again, marksmen are not the only late-game champions out there, they just happen to be the designated carry class, and so are naturally given a late game that eclipses everyone else's. They are also not the only providers of DPS, as that is also the core function of fighters, yet we can all agree marksmen tend to outdamage pretty much any fighter.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uo1issWp,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2017-06-07T15:17:41.174+0000)\n> \n> If you don&#x27;t want this niche to be filled by a marksman, that&#x27;s fine in my eyes, but as you&#x27;re proving to me, you guys just don&#x27;t want carries in your games AT ALL.\n\nThe only thing you are proving here is that you are desperately afraid at the thought of not having a marksman on your team, and interpret any desire to tone down their current excessive presence in the game as an attempt to ruin marksmen altogether. The thing is, I don't dislike marksmen, and I do want to see them thrive: I am happy to see team comps with 3+ marksmen, as well as marksmen in different roles, including as junglers as supports. What I want to see, however, is some reciprocity in this: I'm okay with teams with multiple marksmen as long as the game environment also allows no-marksman teams, and I want to see more than just marksmen as viable carries in the game. There are 6 classes in the game, yet only 5 positions per team, so ditching at least one class is inevitable, it's just that in the game's current state, making marksmen part of that interchangeable pool of champions is still considered sacrilegious.\n\nIf you look at every other MOBA, which manages to have carries without making them exclusive to a single class among the roster (they also have viable, carry-less team comps), it's obvious that this can also be traced as the cause of significantly more diverse and varied games. Really, League's issues of repetition, lack of diversity, etc. are of its own making, and its rigid, marksman-centric team comp meta is largely responsible for this. What I and other players are pushing for isn't really all that ridiculous: we just want marksmen to be treated along the same rules as the other classes, balanced around more than just their bot lane environment, and allowed to be more flexible when factored into team compositions. For you, apparently, that's too much to ask.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2017-06-07T06:24:55.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main issue with Marksmen is the fact that crit items basically make marksmen able to burst more than assassins can.
