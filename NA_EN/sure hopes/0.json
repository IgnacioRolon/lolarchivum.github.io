Again.. its only for a few seconds, but it's pretty annoying\r\n\r\nI have pretty decent specs as well \r\n\r\nAMD R9 380 series - Graphics Card\r\nAMD FX(tm)-8320 Eight-Core Processor\r\n16 gigs of ram\r\n\r\nAlso running on windows 10 64 bit edition","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T01:36:03.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's only happening when League is on the loading screen, your pc might be having a hard time loading all of the game assets while discord and such is running in the background.
