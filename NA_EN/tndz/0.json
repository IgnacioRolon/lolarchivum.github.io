My reasoning I will say sounds like Im 8 years old but I don&#039;t deserve this much punishment. I got banned like less then 30 sec after the game, understanding that I did something which made people feel bad( I DESERVE IT). And then I see the TWO WHOLE week bad. This was my first ban and this much punishment is just too much. People needs to realize that EVERYONE WHO HASN&#039;T GOT BANNED IN LIKE A YEAR AND INT FOR LIKE THE FIRST TIME, DOESN&#039;T INT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO, PEOPLE AROUND THEM MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO AND GETS BANNED LIKE THAT THEIR WERE NO VERBAL ABUSE HAPPENING IN THE GAME.   It was not my fault for inting. I never int, like never, but for this game its different. Firstly MY lane was taken and I understand that its norm and riot cant pick up who&#039;s in which lane but then people are arguing who&#039;s which lanes. I tried to not talk but they all wanted me to move when no one else call sup ( ended up two adc) I didnt feel great about how they treated me but I tried for couple of min. Teemo beats me in lane for couple of min and now everyone telling me to get reported  for inting. And then I got crazy mad that I Inted. NOT JUST MY SELF EVERYONE trolled hard with a better KDA GAME than me. \n\nPeople cant help it to troll if every trash talks but only get reported. They would not get banned because they only do it couple of games compared to a straight ban.\n\nTHE PROBLEM IS  THAT PEOPLE EXCEPT TLYER1 DONT INT FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE ITS GREAT FUN, THEY FEEL THAT THEY NEED TO COZ THE WHOLE TEAM MAKES YOU FEEL BAD. I was supersized that it only took couple of seconds to get banned because of the KDA. I bet RIOT does not use more time of reading the chat because there is no way you can read it that fast. \n\nI UNDERSTAND THERE IS A REPORTING SYSTEM BUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS NO DIFFERENT IN WHAT IM HAVE DONE. \n\nI don&#039;t care about my ban (I STILL DESERVE IT) tbh but I feel that not just myself, many of the people who gets banned would feel the same as chats being the main reasoning to int. MAYBE TAKE LIKE AT LEAST 10 min of your life to actually read the chat ,\n\nI STILL DESERVE IT BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE STRICT MAYBE ALSO BAN PEOPLE THAT WAS IN THE GAME TRASH TALKING. NOT JUST GETTING REPORTED FOR COUPLE OF GAME AND FINALLY GETTING BANNED. \n   \nTHE POINT I WANT TO STATE IS WHY IS ONLY ONE GET PUNISHED STRAIGHT AWAY AND THE OTHERS JUST GET REPORTED.","replies":[]}
