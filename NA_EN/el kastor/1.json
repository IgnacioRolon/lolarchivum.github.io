I had a blank screen the entire game and when I restarted my computer and entered a bot game to see if it would change and I  still would get a blank screen right after champ select. I have no way of changing this as i can't navigate the in-game menu screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-28T00:08:47.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your resolution may be too high and likely to cause this.  You'll need to reset your config to return to default:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll have to redo any of your bindings as a result.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
