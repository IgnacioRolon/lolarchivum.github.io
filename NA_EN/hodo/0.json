Is it intended that kass q can interrupted the spell casting?\r\nBut at the same time, I noticed that kass q does not interrupt anivia&#039;s ult. Shouldnt it also cancel ani&#039;s ult if it interrupts sol&#039;s w?\r\nIt came to me quite annoying whenever i play those champs against kass.\r\nIs this a bug?","replies":[{"poster":"ProtestantCaesar","date":"2017-07-24T01:21:45.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, there's no bug here.\n\nKassadin's Q interrupts channels, but it's not a silence anymore. It only interrupts channels.\n\nBoth Anivia's R and Aurelian Sol's W are toggled abilities, not channels. Neither of them should be interrupted by Kassadin's Q.\n\nExcept that Aurelian Sol's W makes itself a special case. Aurelian Sol's W self-cancels whenever Aurelian Sol is disabled with a hard crowd control or a silence, anything that prevents Aurelian Sol from using abilities.\n\nKassadin's channel interrupt is evidently an ability-preventing crowd control.","replies":[{"poster":"The Jhintleman","date":"2017-07-28T00:40:51.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia's ult, according to the wiki at least, is supposed to be stopped by any form of interrupting crowd control, which definitely sounds like Kass's Q.
