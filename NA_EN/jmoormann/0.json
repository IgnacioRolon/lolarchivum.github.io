This has nothing to do with this post, but it will probably get me more upvotes from people who only read the first sentence.\n\nLook at the PBE update at surrender@20:\n> \n> Following her reveal, our latest champion CAMILLE, THE STEEL SHADOW is now on the PBE for testing! Camille is an AD oriented fighter / diver.\n\nI absolutely hate how Riot just makes this change without even thinking about her loyal mains. This change will completely gut her identity as an assassin fighter tank with high mobility, sustain, CC and damage. One of her big strengths was how she wasn&#039;t actually in the game, which meant that the enemy never knew what to do. She has already been sitting at a 0% win rate and 0% play rate for 6 years, and now they nerf her even further.\n\nShe really deserves compensation buffs. Some really big ones. Maybe she should even get 5 AD, though that might make her too broken.\n\nIt has also been -15 days since her last and only skin was released, that shows how little Riot cares about her.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2016-11-22T15:58:18.214+0000","up_votes":125,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JMoormann,realm=EUW,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=FVQIPAK0,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-22T14:11:35.944+0000)\n>\n>and 0% play rate for 6 years, \n\nGood, it should stay that way.","replies":[{"poster":"SchÃ denfreude","date":"2016-11-22T23:08:22.650+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, that way those toxic Camille mains won't ruin my games with their feeding skills.
