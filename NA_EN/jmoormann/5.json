I can understand this, with his 90% P&amp;B at MSI. However, I feel like the way he is currently being nerfed is completely the wrong way. So let&#039;s look at the changes.\n\n> Emperor&#039;s Divide (R):\n> Wall duration lowered to 2 seconds from 5/6/7\n> No longer grants 20% movement speed for 1 second when passing through wall for Azir and Allies\n\nAzir basically has 2 ways to use his ult.\n\n1. Defensively or as a disengage. When someone is in your face, you ult in his direction and push him away. Then you can either run away, or you can make use of the wall to kite your opponent. This one is fairly easy to pull off, and is his most important safety net during teamfights.\n\n2. Offensively. This is Azir&#039;s signature play: the Azirsec to catch a carry out of position and push them into your team, or to push someone under your turret. Though rewarding, this one is extremely difficult and risky, and only done by experienced Azir players, as dashing into the enemy team is very dangerous for a squishy mage like Azir, and it costs you your most important defensive tool.\n\nAnd what is currently the problem with Azir? It&#039;s not the beginning, or the average Azir player, who only uses ult 1. It&#039;s the Azir player who has hundreds of games on him, who is capable of making plays that a champion who already has such high damage shouldn&#039;t be able to do. It&#039;s the player who does ult 2. \n\nBut who is hit by the nerfs? Player 2 won&#039;t care: if you knock that squishy ADC in your team he shouldn&#039;t be able to escape anyway, whether the wall lasts 2 or 7 seconds. The movement speed doesn&#039;t matter much either, as your team won&#039;t have to walk through the wall to kill the target.\n\nBut player 1? He is definitely hit by the nerfs. A teamfight will always last longer than 2 seconds, and if your ult disappears after 2 seconds, you are vulnerable for the rest of the fight. W-E has short range, W-E-Q means that you won&#039;t deal damage for the next 5 seconds. You also can no longer use the movement speed to keep distance from melee enemies who have to walk around. It&#039;s this player that will large a large part of his safety net. And this player already has a 44% win rate.\n\nThe nerfs don&#039;t fix the problem (his very experienced players who crush everyone), but they will make him even harder to balance across all ELOs, as the difference between bad, average and good players will be even worse.\n\n**TL;DR: The Azir nerfs will only target the bad and average Azir players, who are already struggling, while leaving the truly good players relatively untouched.**\n\nEDIT: Keep in mind that he is already on a 49.5% win rate, so it's not like he is so insanely broken that he needs heavy nerfs. The only ELO where he is performing too well is pro play, but like I said, they won't be hit quite as hard by this nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"KGBcommunist","date":"2016-05-17T22:18:39.306+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":5,"body":"anytime i see a champ get played or banned consistently at the pro scene i automatically assume that he he/she will be getting nerfs.
