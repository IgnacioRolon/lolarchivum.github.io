Last season, I managed to hit plat after more than 600 ranked games and a 51 or 52% win ratio. This season, I'm stuck in gold 5 (a full tier lower than my end point of the previous season) with a 43% win ratio. These are statistics. There is no opinion here. This is fact. I'm very much aware that meta shifts do mess with win/loss ratio, but never in my 4 and a half years of playing this game I have never had a dip in win rate this dramatic. Even the juggernaut patch last summer didn't affect me this much, and that shit legit scared me out of ranked for a while. And before anyone cites the new mage update as the reason for my dip in win rate, I pretty much stopped playing as soon as it went live. \n\nI'm honestly not sure if I am going to continue playing this game, which is very saddening, as it is the only medium in which I and some of my college friends still interact, and it was by far the best competitive game I have ever really invested in. Now it's complete trash and this both angers and disheartens me.

Either way, kudos.\n\nSo you've seen me around too, I assume.\nYeah, I like complementing people, because I assume other people are like me. To me, the upvotes feel good, but to see that there's an actual person saying \"good job/I agree/thank you\" or something even more detailed, that makes my day. (Not just for League stuff, for anything.) I'm a pretty normal person, so if I like it, other people probably like it too. So that's why I write out complements. (It's also why I try to keep a really positive atmosphere when I play matches - the other people on my team probably like a positive atmosphere, so I'll do my part in making it so.) I like the cosplays, the art, the well-written analyses, etc. and I want to tell the creators that they did a good job instead of merely upvotes, because that's what I'd want.\nI also am hoping that someone sees what I'm doing and starts doing it as well. I'd love to make a player positive because she felt good about my attitude and had the insight to start being positive herself. I'd also love to make a Boards poster more logical, less hateful because he saw what I was doing.\nHowever, sometimes there are people that just really piss me off. These aren't the people that I'm trying to convince, because I doubt they'll change. I don't think that Dominick Destine is going to quit being an obnoxious jerk who insults Riot at every turn and makes the weirdest threads asking about Evelynn's voice actor. I don't think TheLittlestLulu is going to stop being a fountain of pure vitriol. These are people I'd like to just _bash_ on their respective threads and hopefully get at least ONE person to see that they're wrong and mean. However, they have so many _fans_, fans who just latch on to the Riot hate train, and I don't feel like getting buried in vain. Because who knows if I'll convince anyone?\n\nThe only way I'll know is if someone comments.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Ender Cobra","date":"2016-06-01T13:12:51.361+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://cdn.meme.am/instances/52975213.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"HAIL WHYDRA","date":"2016-06-01T14:09:18.311+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"When SoloQ is going away but you like QD\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MyzN6Pl.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-06-01T14:23:16.186+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://treasure.diylol.com/uploads/post/image/506901/resized_traumatised-cat-meme-generator-i-have-seen-things-terrible-things-352ab0.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-06-02T04:39:15.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I wonder why people need to make an entirely new thread that involves one or two sentences and farm upvotes when they can just contribute to an already existing thread that's clearly appropriate and on-topic.\n\nOh wait, I just answered my own question.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2016-06-01T18:02:52.773+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mfw people still bitch about DynaQ\nhttp://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/456/960/d5e.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dataless","date":"2016-06-01T19:20:03.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not going to stop the haters from hating en masse","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2016-06-01T21:30:46.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Especially if the prospect is free upvotes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Refer A Friend 1","date":"2016-06-01T19:26:18.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty much the same thing with \"I'm leaving, guys!
