Currently every team is basically guaranteed to have a marksman in it, and this has some unhealthy consequences\r\n\r\n1. The strongest marksman will always be a VERY strong pick, because every team comp will need a marksman anyway (whereas the strongest mage can still be a risky pick because of the possibility of a counterpick, like an assassin), especially since marksmen are usually less vulnerable to counterpicks than solo lanes.\r\n\r\n2. The meta will always revolve around the question &quot;Who is able to deal with marksmen?&quot;. Whether it&#039;s tanks being tanky enough to survive them, assassins/burst mages being able to delete them, bruisers being able to put out enough splitpush pressure or something else, it&#039;s always just whoever happens to have a way to deal with marksmen.\r\n\r\nIt obviously doesn&#039;t have to be Morde (I personally think Aatrox is a good candidate for a rework into a bot lane carry), but having a viable alternative (and counter) to the marksmen that we see every game would greatly improve overall game health, with the added benefit of finally getting a way to actually see how strong the marksmen class as a whole is (currently there is no good way to find out, because every game has 2 marksmen in it (not counting stuff like Graves or Kindred in the jungle), of which 1 will win, causing the class as a whole to always have around a 50% win rate, even though it might be much stronger/weaker).","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrobolser","date":"2016-11-16T14:23:31.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the problem is the lack of itemisation and gameplay oriented to duo lane.\n\nI think a lot of champions could actually go bot without any problem. Take mages like Ziggs, Xerath, Azir, Cassiopeia, Kayle, or fighters/assassins like Yasuo, Aatrox, Zed, Leblanc. They could go bot with a support and still be successful.\n\nBut they will be underleveled, and any mid game champion really don't want to be underleveled. ADC are late game champions, so after the laning phase they still have a lot of time before they shine. They can catch up in gold and level, and prepare for the time they will be useful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-16T13:45:47.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They've already tried two times, both with disastrous results.
