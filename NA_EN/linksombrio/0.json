I've spent over $400 on this game & have had my account for yearssss. And riot's tribunal bans me unfairly. I was told to kms & a lot of other slurs and nothing happened to them. Here it is. Judge for yourself.\n\nGame 1\nVoday: nami I only ask one thing\nVoday: Don't do what my other supports do which is engaging when imreloading then blame me for doing nothing\nVoday: that shit gives me cancer xD\nVoday: when they do that\nVoday: like i guess they don't understand i have a reload mechanic\nVoday: ye they are engagers\nVoday: wait to stop them\nVoday: dont engage\nVoday: ye i know was agreeing\nVoday: if only i had mana\nVoday: it's ok late game veigar will just 1 hit mid or vayne or prob khazix\nVoday: ok\nVoday: that didnt even hit\nVoday: don't be negative jax.\nVoday: sorry for what?\nVoday: I died once?\nVoday: feeding?\nVoday: kay.\nVoday: me and nami died once bot\nVoday: to a 4 man gank.\nVoday: they have came twice\nVoday: kay\nVoday: ye i know nami lol. i'll be banning blitz every game\nVoday: he doesnt hityou but hits. \nVoday: buggy ass champion lol (well more that skin) \nVoday: we need to force teamfights\nVoday: khazix is weak there\nVoday: not single\nVoday: force teamfights\nVoday: or we lose\nVoday: khazix cant isolate in teamfights\nVoday: kay\nVoday: idk why u guys are mid?\nVoday: that literally makes no sense\nVoday: there is 4 bottom, now they get 2 kills a turret and drag\nVoday: it's not fine if we get nothing out of it : / at least push mid\nVoday: they are rotating\nVoday: and you b.. :/\nVoday: we aren't so they are gonna get zero punishments out of grouping.\nVoday: and i should we should\nVoday: woops I can't spell \nVoday: no.. thats how we beat khazix\nVoday: no\nVoday: u listen lol how am I toxic? You guys tell me I suck bottom and khazix has 20 kills and I&#039;m saying we need to group or lose and you say i'mm toxic? \nVoday: its calls.. not toxic\nVoday: if we are single\nVoday: khaizx kills us\nVoday: we need to teamfight\nVoday: ok then we lose cuz that's what he's strong at.. : /\nVoday: khaizx is hunting jax in jungle\nVoday: we need to group\nVoday: i'm 0-3 but still strong\nVoday: we can teamfight\nVoday: kay\nVoday: i'm an immobile adc that has been 3-4 man ganked 3 times since start\nVoday: thats all my deaths\nVoday: im not talking trash im just asking ppl to group\nVoday: we cant win single\nVoday: sigh\nVoday: see\nVoday: just report jax gg all he has done is flame me entire game telling me ot kms or that i'm a %%%. \nVoday: But I've asked us to group since the start. thats khazix weakness..\nVoday: yet u guys 1v1\nVoday: idk why\nVoday: hes to fed now : /\nVoday: yes really. we have nno teamwork\nVoday: I'm not\nVoday: see hes way to fed now. just surrender and let's\nVoday: gg report jax plx toxic\nVoday: my entire match history is me fed as hell and i have one bad game cuz camped by assassins so i suck?\nVoday: ur hilarious jax\nVoday: enjoy report\nVoday: camped by assassins cuz khazix got fed cuz of u jax\nVoday: i asked us to group as a team\nVoday: so 4 man report for jax? lol\nVoday: wurth\nVoday: how is that bait?\nVoday: it was obvious\nVoday: we lost\nVoday: cuz i wanted a kill\nVoday: not bait\nVoday: it' been over tho.. yet you still find a way to blame me.\nVoday: jax just harasses his entire team since start\nVoday: blames me for dying bot to 4 man ganks with assassins\nVoday: ye cuz i can stop that\nVoday: she cant\nVoday: khazix waits for nami when she wards. don't blame her.\nVoday: 1422 dmg with one q lol\nVoday: and jax thinks we can win\nVoday: enjoy ban jax..\nVoday: ye i wanted to group\nVoday: before khazix got more fed\nVoday: and we didn't\nVoday: how am i banned?\nVoday: i never harassed anyone\nVoday: i asked to group\nVoday: get em vaigr\nVoday: woah i cant spell\nVoday: gj\nVoday: huh?\nVoday: GG plz report jax. \n\nSo how does that justify a ban? Anytime I said to group is when our top lane &amp; Jungler harassed me and this random nami for losing bot &amp; dying to a fed khazix who got fed off mid and our jungler. He was very fed early in so I told everyone we need to group or lose cuz he's just hunting people down at this point. Force teamfights. Then I defended nami getting told she never wards cuz she dies anytime she tries to. And everyone time i said to group or we lose it was toward the snarky top telling me i'm wrong which made no sense. And I never harassed him. Then you see me saying gg report jax or ur banned jax. Everytime I said that it was after a line of him telling me to kill myself, that i'm a %%% or suck dick at the game. I don't see why I was banned? Maybe a chat restriction? But even then I don't see why I would get one just for telling my team to group or saying we lose toward the one harassing me for losing bot. I'm guessing it's because I said cancer &amp; ass even though it was about a champion &amp; toward noone in all chat or an actual player? It was talking about the champions. & I've read riots guidelines after this ban. It says you can cuss/use strong words as long as it's not toward an actual player or homophobic/racist.  So basically you can say oh fuck I suck, or well that's cancer I got blinded. Just stuff like that.

You can defend yourself so long as it's done in a neutral or positive manner. If you're yelling and raging at someone, it's not you defending yourself, it's just you being a jerk. From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**4) That player in my game was far worse than me. Why am I banned???**\na) I'll keep this one simple: retaliation isn't OK. Reacting to a toxic player by being toxic just incites that player to be even worse--it also ruins the game for up to 8 other players. It is far, far worse to watch two people yelling at each other all game than it is to watch 1 player ranting into blank space. Almost everyone in the game can find someone out there that behaves worse than they do--but so what? Finding someone worse doesn't justify your behavior or justify retaliation. We expect more out of our players. What players often don't realize is... those other players in your game that you thought were worse? Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on. If you retaliate, both of you will be banned. It's really that simple.\n\n2) Riot has ways of tracking peoples smurf accounts you know, so using another account to call people idiots and such is a quick way to get all of your accounts in trouble rather than just the account that you used to throw out insults on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-05T08:43:41.771+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"> It says you can cuss/use strong words as long as it's not toward an actual player or homophobic/racist.\n\nYou did use a homophobic slur, though, when repeating what Jax said.\n\nEven then, that is typically not enough alone to result in a permanent ban. However, if you have shown toxic behavior in the past and went up the punishment tiers below a permaban already, then it's more likely that this would result in a harsher punishment.
