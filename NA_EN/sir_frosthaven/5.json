I just wanted to take the time to pose a question here, one I spend a lot of time thinking about. What is community to you? What does it mean? What does it entail?\r\n\r\nTo me, community is a place where people can come together and share the things they love. To me, community is *everything*. Back before companies had their own forums I flourished in private guild communities across several games. It had that same feeling as if I had just pulled into my friend's house with a pack of soda and a Nintendo 64. I've always been at my prime when I was a part of something, and I want you guys to feel like you are part of something too!\r\n\r\nSure, we're not cracking open sodas - and the couch is now a much bigger one - but I want it to be a comfortable one. Every choice I've ever made in this community starts with a question - \"How will this impact players?\". I consider many of you my friends, some even family.\r\n\r\nYou are everything to me, and so I must ask - what is community to you?","replies":[]}
