I restarted League about 3 times now and I still have this problem. I even called my friends to find out what is going on and some of them don't have this problem while the other half is also experiencing this problem. Is there any way I can fix this ASAP or must I wait for Riot Games to become aware of this problem and fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Surro no Dente","date":"2016-08-17T16:48:35.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have same problem too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T16:36:07.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've seen a few reports on this, and currently looking into cases where some players can't access the chat server!
