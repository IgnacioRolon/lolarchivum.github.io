I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s because of the Cosmic skin line being extended with {{champion:497}} {{champion:498}} and {{champion:11}} . I want to thank you guys for that.

Especially for the Cosmic skin! Compared to Cosmic Blade Yi it feels underwhelming. Also, will be Kassadin getting new voicelines, like Lux and Maokai?","replies":[]},{"poster":"iGoogledYourMOM","date":"2017-04-21T23:51:49.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any RIOTER Main {{champion:126}} ?
