Also it only has 10% ap scaling, which is garbage and its still pretty much going to be less than Sona's healing which heals 2 people and shields them while Yuumi's only heals herself or attached.\n\nHer Ulti is the only thing I don't really have problems with outside of her W, but again this is just about you claiming its best not to be attached whole game, which severely neuters her, pun intended.\n\nWanna get better with Yuumi? Play Sona, the better Yuumi, until they fix her outright, or you have a laning partner you can rely on. The only game I played her I went 6/6/18 over 32 minutes, only did 15k damage 3rd to bottom and only because both top laners were feeding hard so they were below me in damage.","replies":[{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2019-05-16T23:43:19.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chunky Coffee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6Ao6OFoG,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2019-05-16T16:35:21.039+0000)\n>\n> Her passive relies on her being not attached to use it (just pop out when its up to regain mana) but she's legit the squishiest champion in game and has no reliable cc even as a 100% support champ.\n> \n> Her Ulti is the only thing I don't really have problems with outside of her W, but again this is just about you claiming its best not to be attached whole game, which severely neuters her, pun intended.\n\nPretty sure these two are the reason why being attached 95% of the game is a bad idea.  For some players its more like 100%.  And also that W isn't doing as much damage to turrets as Yuumi + Spellthief and the adc both attacking.  W mainly helps with crits or big abilities for getting more value than Yuumi's dps, when it comes to shoving Yuumi needs to detach and start autoing whether its creeps or tower.  People aren't taking advantage of that.\n\nBut you're pretty much right that she's undertuned and needs buffs and you might as well play Sona.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sand Ähläm","date":"2019-05-16T10:28:19.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank god someone bothered to actually play her more than one game","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-05-16T07:42:56.878+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gotta bump that number up to 100%","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-05-17T10:50:25.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the real way to get better with Yuumi: Wait 1-2 years for adcs and junglers to learn how to assist her.
