Able to build around it? Able to play around it?\r\n\r\nIn a factual sense, counterplay means that there is an action you can take based on the game features that allows you oppose the move. And since there is no ability that automatically destroys the opposing Nexus, everything in League has some form of counterplay, but players mostly refuse to take any steps that threaten their fantasy.","replies":[{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2018-07-18T23:34:58.555+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"At the moment, the only counterplay is killing the enemy faster than they kill you. \n\nAt least that's what idiots consider to be good counterplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-18T23:50:53.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hypermobile champs imo have no counterplay because unless you too are hypermobile, you have no way of avoiding their engage and no way of catching them if you happen to get a leg up on them.
