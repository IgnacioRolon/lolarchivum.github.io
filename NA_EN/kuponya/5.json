While I don't agree with most of those complaining about RNG issues, matchmaking matches you with players who are as equal to your skill level as possible, which means in any given game, someone who is statistically just as skilled as someone else is going to end up in 8th place while the other person ends up not in 8th place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PolkaDotPimp","date":"2019-08-08T01:14:46.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean.... I'm not bad at TFT, Usually there are things you can do with RNG that prevent you from being 8th.... but eventually you get to a point where everyone knows the same shit you do and no matter what you do, 8th place is a realistic finish. It's frustrating knowing that because you got 0 items from PVE you have no chance against the minimum 4 guys who got good RNG.

And yes I agree that people who complain about luck are easy to beat as they usually do not look at what they could do better but just excuse their failure by bad luck, but the difference in items gets more and more obvious the higher you get on ladder as those people are actually your equals in skill and any advantage will push them above you. Maybe it will not result in ending 8th, but you pretty much know you are going to be happy for top4 finish when people have more items and they allocate them well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PolkaDotPimp","date":"2019-08-08T01:26:18.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool story bruh.
