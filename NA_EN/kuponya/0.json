While he isn't solo carry material, he offers powerful utility as soon as the round starts.\n\nVeigar's power isn't in how much damage he outputs but rather in his execution passive on his ability and being a sorcerer, his mana gain and spam potential. He does require some resources, but he alone can carry through simply being a higher star level","replies":[{"poster":"CurS1VE","date":"2019-07-12T19:54:51.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt really need you to tell me what they do, i already know that and that's why i said i disagreed. \n\nthose 3 i pointed out are too weak on their own despite having limited splashability; i mean if u happen to get a veigar or shen to lv 3 wit items then good for you but on their own when you talk consistency it's not worth it. \n\nI'd pick a Gnar over Shen tbh, or Gnar over Blitz, if you are talking about just straight up on their own.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
