Based on op.gg I knew that the four other players on my team were a quad (unless they had been paired up with each other 7-14 times randomly - I doubt it). The only history I could find for sure on the other team was that there was one duo. I could be wrong and there could have been a trio but no other players on the team had a match history with one another other than the players highlighted in green. I am usually around the high gold/low plat area on my other acount but that is a moot point. The quad, itself, had a much higher collective ranking than the other team. \n\nIn queue I could tell that the players on my team were at least a trio (club tags) and so I politely asked them if I could join their voice chat if they had one. They just trolled around and said things like &quot;We are all ten year olds&quot; and &quot;you don&#039;t want to join trust me.&quot; I asked once more and got just troll responses. So I gave up. The game was pretty one-sided - we stomped. It wasn&#039;t fun. The other team had a huge disadvantage. DQ really needs some balance reworks, and premades don't act very nice, cooperative, or supportive with solos.","replies":[{"poster":"Odd Gnome","date":"2016-06-20T23:38:47.636+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":66,"body":"This is legit the first time I've seen someone bitching about Dynamic after winning.

So when Dynamic Queue runs for 5 minutes without finding another team to play against, it starts looking at solo players or smaller groups who might be a match. The problem is that at the same time, it's also already skipped looking for players who are at a similar level first. Instead, it looks for 5 players with loosened restrictions as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teslium","date":"2016-06-23T12:54:32.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well deserved if you ask me.
