Boo hoo we had a silver 2 and a silver 3. That didn&#039;t matter because the two plats were stomping so hard (okay maybe not stomping but they were doing really well). If &quot;balancing&quot; means you have really good and really bad players on a team, that is horse shit. The Jhin may have ended up with a decent KDA at the end but he started out 1/6/1. It was because we had two players that blew out the competition that we won. Guess what, I won this game and I am still mad at the system. It just creates a jumble of skill that makes for ridiculous games. This was ranked btw.","replies":[]}
