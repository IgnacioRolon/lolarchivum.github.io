As I was reading it I was thinking about how backwards DQ&#039;s current state is. It encourages and incentivizes players who team up as premades, but rewards and penalties are a solo assessment. Winning or losing a game is purely a solo reflection in the League system. This was not something that was directly addressed in the Round Table Video and should have been. \n\nThere needs to be a system that treats premades as an entity. You win and lose as a premade and it reflects your premade score. This can also have the added benefit of reducing premade toxicity which has become a hot topic on the boards. In such a system you have to be trusting of your teammates because they will be a reflection of you. If a player you invite to games constantly harasses other players, gets reported several times, and eventually gets punished (all while in your premade, not in their own solo account), then the whole premade will be punished because it is treated as a team and should be. This could be a negative though because a player could have a lot of power in deciding the fate of a team, but isn&#039;t that what being a team is about: trusting your teammates. \n\nThere is a lot of power given to premades right now which makes solos players (myself included) feel powerless. Graff mentioned something very important in his post: friendly vs. competitive premades. Friendly premades are those that met in various games in their ranked experience and play casually but don&#039;t utilize voice chat and they don&#039;t know each other as well as some other premades. Competitive premades are ones that do utilize voice chat, practice together, have a gameplan, have a close bond, and play extremely competitively. I don&#039;t want to be guilty of the all-or-nothing fallacy and say that these are the only types of premades out there, but this example is just for the sake of the discussion. There can be a mixture of friendly, competitive, and other sorts of premades. \n\nAt least in my own experience I have come across these two types. I have seen the friendly premades get crushed by higher tier players that they were matched against, and I have seen competitive premades smash friendly premades who didn&#039;t have the same synergy. The problem, other than the lopsidedness of these matches, is the effect on solos which Riot says they don&#039;t have an answer for as of yet (at least according to the Round Table Video). I don&#039;t know if the following would be fair, but maybe there could be less of an lp loss when you lose with a premade and a regular lp gain when you win with one (just an idea there may be a way to take advantage of it). \n\nIn the same vein, premades should be rewarded for their success when they win and treated as an entity when they lose. This might help phase out some the mismatching of premades vs.  premades. But this system also requires that they be judged separately and possibly be contained in a different ranking system while still playing with solos in Dynamic Queue. We can have the same queue, but premades should be assessed and treated differently than solo players.\n\nI understand Riot&#039;s move in implementing Dynamic Queue and as a solo player I have definitely seen the negative side of it. There is room for improvement and something needs to be done, otherwise they might lose some solo players. Stay positive guys and continue to urge Riot to move in a direction that doesn&#039;t lump the assessment of solo players and premades all into one chaotic mess.","replies":[{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2016-06-09T07:05:45.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would rather just have Hyrum Graff's version which does not try to fix a system that is broken at its core and instead replaces it with a truly team only 5v5 club system + restores the might and glory of a true solo queue in effect giving both parties what they want without suppressing either into being slave to the other.\n\nThough if i can't have that I'll take a system that lets me ban 4 jerks at one time, the first options more likely though because riot will not ban so many of their money makers in one go for a small minority that they deem to be playing their holy game the wrong way and are offended we have fun playing that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Barty","date":"2016-06-08T20:01:15.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The link you've provided has an extra dot on its end, making it non-functional.

Right now, you only need ~50% win-rate to go up steadily in ranked.  With the changes though, solo players may be able to go up with as little as 40% win-rate.\nAs for toxicity in 4-man premades, the only thing I can come up with is giving any reports made by the 1 player hold greater weight.  To prevent the 1 player from abusing this however, Riot should either request attachments of photos of the toxicity or analyze the game chat of each one.  I'm not sure what their system is right now, but analyzing all the games' chats could likely be too much work.  Thus I think that the picture option would work best.\n\nJust my opinions, and there may be some holes in what I've said.  It's just what I thought while reading your comment and writing my own.","replies":[{"poster":"Gene Freakz","date":"2016-06-08T19:55:20.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I definitely see your point about solo players climbing being affected. I don't think that any change will really discourage premades from playing premade and solos from playing solo unless the changes are drastic. As to climbing though, if there were separate ranking systems within Dynamic Queue it wouldn't matter. Players would be assessed differently in different leagues. As a solo player I would say hey I'm climbing in this league that I am in and the premade I got paired with is climbing in their own league and lets work together to win and hopefully Riot has sorted out MMR so that we are on a similar page when it comes to skill level. There are a lot of elements to the equation of fairness and competitiveness, but many good fixes have been posted. I believe Dynamic Queue can be so much better and premades and solos can play games together in a much better environment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stevev45","date":"2016-06-08T19:15:09.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your link doesn't work","replies":[{"poster":"Gene Freakz","date":"2016-06-08T19:17:08.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K should work now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gene Freakz","date":"2016-06-08T19:15:56.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks I'll try to fix it :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anags","date":"2016-06-08T23:55:38.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Dynamic q may not be perfect but all this complaining is bull crap.  I understand higher elo complaining about wait times. But everyone else needs to shut up.  I have yet to have an issue with DQ. I play solo and some duo mainly because most of my friends quit during season 4. Back then we played mostly norms as a group.\n\nSo anyway I play mostly solo and I can say my ranked experience has been better this season than any other playing as a solo.  Hell I'm on a 13 game win streak.  The last time I was trolled by a 4 man was well before this season and it was in a bot game.\n\nAll this complaining makes no sense whatsoever.  This game is a team game and playing as a group should be encouraged.  \n\nPeople act like a solo player can't influence a game and then bitch and moan when they get a bad pkayer, feeder, troll, etc.  Which completely contradicts their suggestion that the solo player does nothing and is helpless.\n\nHopefully Riot pays little head to the frivolous complaining done on the internet.","replies":[]}]}
