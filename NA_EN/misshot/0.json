I'm beyond frustrated. My computer has crashed so many times in my last 20 games, it's terrible. Riot, fix this. My machine is going to get even more broken because of your client. And I keep getting leaverbustered? IT HAS FROZEN EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I've left a game. Every time! This is ridiculous, and I might just have to stop playing because of it. I'm so angry. \r\nI bought this laptop in March, and had no problem playing almost every day until recently. \r\nI have taken it back to the store I bought it from to get it fixed, they looked at it a few times, and even installed a new hard drive. It's still freezing. When I called back the fourth time, they said other computers have been having problems with League also. What is that???\r\nI've used multiple internets; it crashed on all. \r\nI've repaired client. \r\nI've uninstalled and reinstalled. \r\nI've virus scanned. CCleaned. Updated. \r\nNothing helps. \r\nI even changed the resolution, and tried borderless. \r\nI've tried only running League even! Nothing. Helps. \r\n\r\nRiot, Please fix this client. The servers, Whatever. I'm tired of getting leavers. This is crap. I love this game. I just want to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Phillosiphy","date":"2016-09-11T06:11:11.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its doing the same for me as well, once I start a game for maybe at least three to five minutes my game freezes up and I can't do anything, leaving me with the only option to shut down my computer also I have Windows 10","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-29T21:08:08.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you give me a more in-depth explanation of what's going on? Where is it freezing, and what other behavior do you notice when this happens?\n\nShot in the dark here, but if you're running Windows 10, it's possible you're experiencing the Xbox Game DVR issue, especially if this happened after some recent windows updates. As a quick check, I recommend [disabling the Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to see if it resolves the problem.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
