Let's try manually resetting your config files by going through the following steps:\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
