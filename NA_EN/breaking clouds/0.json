I have an EUNE account currently in Plat 3 but I was thinking of transferring my account to the NA server. Now I know I have to play one ranked game to be placed but I was wondering how much it's going to drop me. Will I be placed in Plat 5 or due to my EU mmr that I'll be placed in Silver? My mmr atm is currently EU Plat mmr and I'm aware that the mmr in NA is much different.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T00:33:20.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranking at the moment won't have a big impact on the 2017 Ranked season. I can't estimate what your ranked tier will look like on NA vs EUNE, but MMR/Ranked is unique to a server, so it definitely will look different on NA. \n\nYou can find out breakdown of the 2017 Ranked Season [here.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/how-rank-2017-season) Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
