This was one of our first efforts to record some custom VO for the launch skin, because we can do it at the same time as the base recording. It's quite tricky because it happens so far ahead of development that we're not sure what will be useful when it comes time to implement them. For this one we were fairly conservative and just used them for finishing off a few choice champions - a small bonus on the skin but hopefully one that will surprise a few players >:D\n\nNext launch skin I work on I'm going to push for a bit more, but it really relies on us deciding on a theme well ahead of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-01-19T12:36:03.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't Jinx have a custom line in her mafia skin or am I crazy?\n\nPlease note: I am probably crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2016-01-19T15:29:11.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has a few walking and attacking ones.\n\n\"Scream along if you know the words!\"\n\"I've got a recital, and everyone's invited!\"\n\"Who wants a solo?\"\n\"What's in my violin case?
