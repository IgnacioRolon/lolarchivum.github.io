Some of the icons work better than others. For example, DJ Sona icons will show her respective form on your summoner profile while that form's icon is used. Meanwhile the Elementalist Lux icons will all show her \"light\" form (unaspected, what you start the match as and what shows on the loading screen).\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering, if I equip \"PROJECT: Ashe Icon\" will it show the unmasked splash art? Similarly, will \"Recon PROJECT: Ashe Icon\" show her masked splash art? Or do both of the icons just show the same splash art (be it masked or not)? Or do they do nothing at all?\r\n\r\nI would request proof of this, if possible. 250 RP might not seem like a lot, but it's quite a substantial amount for an icon.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T22:49:49.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe Project Ashe's icons work the same way as Ultimate Skins like DJ Sona or Elementalist Lux.
