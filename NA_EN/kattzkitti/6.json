Basically, when certain things happen, the game client will momentarily lockup, and then go back to business as usual. Never lasts more than one second, usually lasting only a fraction of a second. It's always highly noticeable though.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelmingly most common situation where it happens is the first death in a given match. It will, on extremely rare occasion, happen during other deaths as well. In every case (no exceptions), the lockup doesn't change a thing as it happens simultaneously with the death, as if the client failed to load something related to the death (character death animation, sound effect, recap screen, etc).\r\n\r\nVery rarely the lockup can happen for other things. Someone spawning into the fountain after me during the initial spawn at match beginning (might be unrelated to this particular issue, though). Final hit kills a nexus. Probably a couple other cases I'm forgetting due to being so trivial.\r\n\r\nAgain, none of this affects gameplay in any way. It would just be one of those things that would be appreciated if fixed, somehow.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T04:30:22.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, it does kinda sound like some kind of missing or damaged game file causing those weird lockups.
