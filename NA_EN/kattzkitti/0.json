Other than timing it yourself, there's not a way to check that outside of the client I don't believe.","replies":[{"poster":"kattzkitti","date":"2017-10-24T07:20:13.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much what I meant. Riot ever considered adding a timer on user profile here on the site? Could have it ping the player's account when they login to the site, get the current status, and then save the countdown into a local cookie that the browser checks from there. Minimizes the server load for you guys, while giving the players that extra little bit of convenience!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T00:26:41.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well hm....somebody's already thought this through xD! This actually makes a good deal of sense to me tbh, but I can't speak on whether it'll be made or not.
