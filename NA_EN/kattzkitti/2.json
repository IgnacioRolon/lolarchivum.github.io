I will say that it's incredibly frustrating that it keeps forcing unlocks, especially when the skins in question are complete garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T01:49:01.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a little confused by your question tbh. When you reroll 3 skin shards, the result will *always* be a permanent skin automatically unlocked for you. Sometimes if it gives you a permanent skin shard, that's simply because you already owned that skin.","replies":[{"poster":"kattzkitti","date":"2017-12-20T01:54:43.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Re-rolling three shards (whether they be shard pieces or permanents) will always give a permanent, and sometimes some essence. However, most of the time the permanent will be given in the form of a shard, while sometimes (and seemingly randomly) the loot system will force me to unlock it (which prevents me from using it to further re-roll, generally for the purpose of getting a skin I actually want).\n\nIt's incredibly frustrating, because 90% of the skins in the game I have zero interest in owning and this effectively wastes the three shards used in the re-roll. I get that it's an RNG system, but it feels bad when the system arbitrarily screws you over.","replies":[]}]}]}
