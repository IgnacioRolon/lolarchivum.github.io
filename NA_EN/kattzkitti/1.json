Really puts a damper on motivation to bother reporting anything.\n\nLike there was this one. Every time, instalocked Ryze. Would feed 10+ deaths spread among the other team. Would snipe the very rare kill if it happened to be nearby, usually just pulled assists (Ryze is incredibly overpowered under AI control, btw). If you ever happened to be near it while in the enemy base, it would use its ult to attempt to teleport you into the enemy's fountain.\n\nReported it on a few matches over the course of a couple days, then it stopped showing up in my matches... only to show up again in another match months later, doing the same old shit. At that point I simply sat back in my chair, and literally said out loud \"Why did I even bother?\"\n\nHaven't seen it since that one match though, wouldn't be surprised if it finally got sold off on Ebay and is now being controlled by an actual player in norms/ranked.","replies":[]}]}]}
