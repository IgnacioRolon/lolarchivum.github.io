Recently my main account was hacked and stolen. I made a ticket 5 days ago to try to recover it and riot still hasn't responded. Im not sure how long typical tickets take when it comes to leagues support since I have never had to make one.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T02:38:26.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no estimated time, as it can vastly vary depending on how many tickets have been submitted recently and how much information you've provided in your ticket.
