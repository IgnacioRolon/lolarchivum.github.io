Each time it has happened, I had been playing the game before it did, with no changes to my drivers in-between happening, obviously.\nMy Nvidia drivers are updated with GeForce Experience, and I am not opening any software that wasn&#039;t open in the previous game.\n\nApparently, [this guy](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/2giF1q2J-an-unknown-directx-error-has-occurred-and-league-of-legends-cannot-start?comment=0003) [linked post, not linked thread] fixes the bug by going into the Device Manager and disabling-and-enabling the graphics card.\nWtf is this, Riot? If the problem is fixed by resetting the graphics card, why can&#039;t your buglogger tell me that? Or do it itself? Take an extra second to check for the error, tell Windows its Graphics Card isn&#039;t doing it&#039;s job right and ask it to reset it?t I mean, I start my game in Admin mode for multiple reasons already [please don&#039;t hack me kthx], but apparently it still can&#039;t fix itself.\n\nI just did a full repair, and hope that solves the issue, if it doesn&#039;t I will try that guy&#039;s recommended fix. But why is this necessary, Riot?\n\nEDIT: Yup. Full Repair did nothing, so I just had to use the Turn-Graphics-Card-Off-And-On-Again solution. Solved it. I feel so fucking trolled.\n\nEDIT 2: [This thread here depicts the same problem, and includes an error log that is identical to mine](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/5uyg1Ieq-game-repeatedly-crashing-on-driver-before-39731-please-either-integrate-the-client-into-the-game)","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2018-05-06T00:39:56.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laetitian,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=o7xeq0YM,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-05-06T00:17:13.685+0000)\n>\n> My Nvidia drivers are updated with GeForce Experience\n\nHave you read the Nivida forums and other threads here talking about the same thing yet?\n\nIf you DISABLE and ENABLE a driver and then it works again, how is that leagues problem exactly?","replies":[{"poster":"GettemClone","date":"2018-05-06T10:29:48.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lakrosin,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=o7xeq0YM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-06T00:39:56.775+0000)\n>\n> Have you read the Nivida forums and other threads here talking about the same thing yet?\n> \n> If you DISABLE and ENABLE a driver and then it works again, how is that leagues problem exactly?\n\nhow do you disable it ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laetitian","date":"2018-05-06T00:52:59.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lakrosin,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=o7xeq0YM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-06T00:39:56.775+0000)\n>\n> Have you read the Nivida forums and other threads here talking about the same thing yet?\n> \n> If you DISABLE and ENABLE a driver and then it works again, how is that leagues problem exactly?\n\nBecause no other software has been having issues using my graphics card while this problem repeatedly happened on League, and all Google results I found led me to League forum posts.\n\nIt's the hardware I am disabling and enabling, by the way, not the driver. A graphics card is in LowPower-state when you disable the device. Which is to say: I doubt it's the driver restart that can really be considered the issue. It's more how League interprets the information it gets fed about the driver.\n\nEdit: Sidenote: If NVIDIA is responsible for the problem, and they fix it, I will be just as happy. Doesn't mean I can't report it here, where the problem happened. If Riot is a responsible publisher, they should be in contact with NVIDIA about their software not being supported anyways, right?","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2018-05-06T00:57:15.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Laetitian,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=o7xeq0YM,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-06T00:52:59.620+0000)\n>\n> all Google results I found led me to League forum posts.\n\nLook again because that isn't the case. The driver update has caused problems for my Nox emulator and Assassin's Creed Syndicate. There are more games and software it causes problems on. Geforce knows about it and admitted to it. Then there is the fact other people are complaining with the same card.\n\nIt's Geforce. Period.\n\nI am not just pulling out of my ass. I research stuff like this because I wanted a fix.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-06T00:55:48.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Take an extra second to check for the error, tell Windows its Graphics Card isn't doing it's job right and ask it to reset it\n\nI dont think software is even allowed to do this, at least not software on the level of the league client.","replies":[{"poster":"Laetitian","date":"2018-05-06T01:13:45.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=o7xeq0YM,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-05-06T00:55:48.742+0000)\n>\n> I dont think software is even allowed to do this, at least not software on the level of the league client.\n\nIf it can't prompt Windows to do something about it (Which I doubt, I mean, this stuff is what all the Windows Update automation is all about), it can still produce a meaningful error log. This half-assed finger-pointing is just annoying.\n\n\"000004.198|  ERROR| Error in Direct3D9_CreateDevice: Not Available\".

I somewhat doubt that Nvidia left the problem lying about that long.","replies":[]}]}]}
