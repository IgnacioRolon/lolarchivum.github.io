More tactical depth, higher risk for higher reward, etc.\r\n\r\nBut is there really a situation where you don&#039;t want to charge the new E? I may be wrong, I haven&#039;t tried it myself, but from what I&#039;ve seen on Youtube, it looks like you would always want to charge the E as much as possible, no?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-04-27T16:59:11.488+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Once you get Rylais sometimes you'll tap it to kite, but other than that you're definitely right that it's usually best to fully charge it.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-04-27T19:46:22.305+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you want to kite, the fully charged version also has a slow, even before Rylai.
