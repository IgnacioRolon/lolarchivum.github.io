But what interests me more is that we can see a few words from the pages **behind** the lyrics. What do y&#039;all make of it?\n\nThere is a mentions of &quot;Three S...&quot;, which should obviously be the Three Sisters Lissandra, Avarossa and what&#039;s-her-name, the old leaders from the three Freljord factions.\n\nThey, or maybe just one of them, apparently made a contract with Ornn, and a Bridge is mentioned. Given that the song also mentions the Howling Abyss, it seems reasonable to think that Ornn created the Bridge above the Howling Abyss, but for what reason? That isn&#039;t clear yet.\n\nThis reminds me of a lot of old Norse myths, I&#039;m super excited.\n\nOther noteworthy tidbits:\n\n* Apparently Ornn leaked some knowledge he shouldn&#039;t have to &quot;they&quot;. Still the three sisters? Or maybe &quot;they&quot; as &quot;the people in one of the factions&quot;?\n* After that, he went East, across the Great Sea? To Ionia?
