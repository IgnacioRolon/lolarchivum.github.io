(R) Range lowered to 3500/4000/4500 from 5000\r\n\r\nSo, Kled&#039;s R range will be reduced in next patch. How does that interact with the ramping up of his shield? \r\n\r\n* Does the shield ramps up faster over a shorter distance, to the same max amount?\r\n* Is the ramp up speed the same, but so the maximum amount of shield possible reduced at the same time as the maximum distance possible ?\r\n * In that case, does that mean the shield ramps up slower as you put more points in R, since the maximum distance increases with ranks? (That wouldn&#039;t be cool...)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-09-19T18:23:41.204+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The shield and damage both ramp up to max at around 2000 units traveled, regardless of the rank of the ult. That's the same value they hit max at in 6.18 too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bellows","date":"2016-09-19T16:27:31.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yah its a huge nerf on a sub-par champ. not the best call since his OPness is in his trading in W and ability to stick you you.

I still don't know how the shield behave respectively to the range change. Not helpful, mate...","replies":[]}]}]}
