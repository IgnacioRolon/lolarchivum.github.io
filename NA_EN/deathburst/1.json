It starts downloading a 1065.9 MB, and after a while display briefly a message I don't have enough time to read then starts the download again from scratch, without me taking any action at any point.\r\n\r\nI'm 99.9% sure it's not an unstable connection issue. What else can it be?\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer:\r\n\r\n* I looked for similar topics on the first page of the Help &amp; Support board, but didn't find anything\r\n* I looked for the dedicated Alpha Client board, but I can't find it in the side-bar, and I can't access it from the client, since it keeps trying to update.\r\n\r\n)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-21T04:07:21.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually had this happen to me before, and I think it's just a quirk with the Alpha Client at the moment. I worked around this by patching with the old Client/Patcher, then hopping back onto the Alpha Client.\n\nLet me know if that works for you, also you can find the Alpha Client Boards [here.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-10-21T22:11:03.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo,\n\nQuick update on the situation + feedback:\n\n* I removed a few files from my hard-drive and now it works. Great!\n* I'm a little surprised that the client doesn't check by itself if there is enough room, and when it encounters an error that it loops infinitely instead of shutting-down and/or displaying an error message.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-10-21T04:30:51.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already updated through the old client, but no luck, the new is still not working.
