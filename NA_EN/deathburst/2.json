Morgana seems logical, she&#039;s already a fallen angel associated with Darkness, so Lunar Wraith was kinda obvious. But why Caitlyn more than Ahri, Cassiopeia, Eve, etc. ? What guided your choice?\r\n\r\nAs a secondary question, why a wolf and a snake? I seem to remember that wolf and moon are associated in Japanese folklore, but I don&#039;t know in Chinese, and it&#039;s usually a benevolent deity. And I have absolutely no idea why a snake?\r\n\r\nThanks for any answer :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-30T02:53:51.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo! \n\nNice to know people remember stuff I toss around about skins. ^-^ \n\nCaitlyn was chosen for a Lunar Revel skin because we felt it was an opportunity to give her another alternative fantasy. As Voidgate mentioned below, she has a good catalog off skins, but this was something that was completely different than what she already had. \n\nCassiopeia has a Lunar Revel skin - Jade Fang, and we felt using a snake thematic on her wasn't the coolest idea (it'd be too obvious). Same with Ahri or Warwick - not as cool as having a champion be more of a spiritual representation of these animals.\n\nThe thematic of this year's Lunar Revel was darkness v. light, so we felt these two animals - snake and wolf - were good representations.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-01-30T03:13:28.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clearly, this skin is a completely different fantasy than what she has already. From this point of view it's a great success. I guess that's what surprised me, actually.\n\nOf course, a skin need to be different from the base champ, or there isn't really a point in making a skin to begin with, but I imagined there had to be some kind of hook, connection, between the base champ and the skin concept. And I couldn't find any hook between \"proud lady upholding laws and big ideals with a rifle\" and \"demonic darkness snake-lady\".\n\nThanks for the clarification, and I guess my assumption was just wrong. Keep up the good work ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2016-01-30T05:05:59.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"And I couldn't find any hook between \"proud lady upholding laws and big ideals with a rifle\" and \"demonic darkness snake-lady\".\"\n\nWolf theme would have fit better than snake... as she can be a lone-wolf hunting her prey.  Morgana comes off much more as a snake.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BA Tetsuo","date":"2016-01-30T04:58:19.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll throw my two cents in and say this is the only skin for Cait that I actually like.
