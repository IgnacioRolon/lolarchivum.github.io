In pre-season, when Essence Reaver was released, lots of mage players complained that ADC had better access to CDR than mages. Reds answered that ADCs were allowed that because they didn&#039;t scale so much with CDR, but Mages who would scale harder should have to make a choice, a trade-off between high utility up-time (with CDR) or high damage burst (with AP).\r\n2. In mid-season, two seemingly contradictory changes were made:\r\n   * 3 new AP-items with CDR were introduced, it&#039;s now much easier to get CDR on mages ==&gt; they shouldn&#039;t have to make a trade-off anymore?\r\n   * Athene&#039;s was changed into a utility item and was allowed to keep its mana regen, &quot;because mages who go for utility instead a damage are allowed to have more up-time&quot; ==&gt; so the trade-off is still in effect?\r\n\r\nSo the question is: \r\n**What does Riot currently think about CDR? When and why full-CDR builds should be available? On what classes of champs? Are they happy with the current CDR itemization?**\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-23T17:49:06.002+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"We believe CDR's something all classes should have good access to. In a lot of cases scaling with CDR, rather than raw offensive stats, can lead to healthier gameplay for other players (less bursty damage patterns). We do still want some degree of trade off for CDR to be made, particularly regarding when in your build you get it though, or exactly how much you get (what's more important, bigger crits from IE or max CDR early from ER? Rylai's slow early or getting to 30% so blue buff will cap you out?).\n\nThe mid-season patch changes were intended to give better access to CDR to mages, particularly those willing to give up some early offensive stats for more CDR/defensive builds. Athene's was changed because of how heavily overlapped with Morello's it was, the two items had always occupied very similar spaces to the extent only one was ever popular. It's not intended to be appealing to most mages at this point, only those with shields/heals who already play somewhat like supports, hence its use of mana regen.","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-05-23T18:21:50.188+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is Morellonomicon the only item with high AP and CDR now, though? \nIt feels more mandatory than ever now.\n\nCompare that to ADC attack speed items, where they can choose between Shiv, RFC, PD and Hurricane, which all give very similar stats (with some even sharing build paths), but have different actives to choose from.\n\nAfter Morellonomicon, you are compelled to either buy defensive items or use CDR runes if you want to max CDR.\nPlus, I must admit that buying defensive items on a champion whose normal build already caps CDR now feels bad, because the extra is wasted.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-23T21:06:31.160+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, there are a couple of missing holes in AP/CDR itemization we still need to fill, another AP+20% CDR item in particular.","replies":[{"poster":"Hex Veiler","date":"2016-05-23T22:31:33.385+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could Netherstride Grimoire help fill that hole? \n\n+100% base mana regeneration\n+100 ability power\n+20% cooldown reduction\n\nUNIQUE â€“ MALICE: Gain 20% movement speed for 2 seconds whenever you deal ability damage.\n\nIt may require a bit of tuning, and the regen should be changed to flat mana, but it seems like a good item to bring back into the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2016-05-23T22:20:35.749+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VoPdto0T,comment-id=000100020001,timestamp=2016-05-23T21:06:31.160+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, there are a couple of missing holes in AP/CDR itemization we still need to fill, another AP+20% CDR item in particular.\n\nThis is somewhat off topic and I apologize for that, but is it possible that Haunting Guise will ever be made to build into another item?

The more you decide to help your team rather than be an individual carry - the closer to 100% uptime you get to be as you basically have very little individual choice about when to recall or how to move around the map.\n\nSupports get mana regen because their nature is that they need to stay in the field to support their team, and often dont get to back on their schedule because of their teams needs. Mages get flat mana because they have more agency over their map movements ie when to back. \n\nok fine, so why then do supports get flat wards that they have to back in order to refresh (sightstone+sweeper) while everyone else gets theirs refreshed while staying out (warding totem). \n\nIf supports are supposed to be able to get closer to 100% uptime then why is sightstone designed to force them to back and why are others wards refresh for them.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-23T19:40:56.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I fully agree with your post, but I often tag Meddler for short questions, and he usually comes in, post a short answer, and never comes back again.

If supports deserve high uptime because their goal is to enable others, so they don't chose when to act, they just react to the others' action, then it doesn't really apply to vision, because vision is precisely the only thing that supports actively control and manage on their own terms.
