No more AS, no more Crit synergy. So what are the goal of this change?\r\n\r\nMore specific points:\r\n\r\n* Who are the intended users? Does removing Crit synergy mean that non-ADC are now supposed to go for this keystone?\r\n* What is the differentiation point between Fervor of Battle and Warlord? Both look good for extended fights, which fits well with the Red tree being the tree for DPS (vs the Purple tree for Burst) and they both apply to basic attack only. But why take one over the other, except just mathematically one is better than the other?\r\n\r\nSide question: I always felt that one of the many reasons Thunderlord was crowding other options was because it was MUCH better in early game, even if it fell off in later stages of the game. So are Keystone intended to have &quot;powerspike&quot;, so to speak? I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s a good idea, because it restricts probably too much who can use what keystone.\r\nMy guess is that no, they are not intended to have powerspike, hence the removal of the Crit synergy, that is not good in early game (before building Crit). Also, most other keystones scale with levels or are % amplifications, in order to stay relatively steady in power provided throughout the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-02-18T03:22:21.642+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"The revised Warlord's is intended to be attractive to champions that repeatedly auto attack who are seeking sustain rather than damage (contrast with Fervor) and in a way that scales with offensive stats like crit, AS and Armor Pen, rather than defense (contrast with Grasp).

If this is supposed to promote build flexibility, where are the options for other classes? Mages can't opt out of mana/CDR or self-peel (their only defensive tool) and instead have to rely on items (2 for CDR, one or more for mana, though its sometimes included via regen, which is offered), and non-tank supports can't really take anything except windspeaker or thunderlord's, mostly because if you aren't a healer or a tank, there's no option other than thunderlords. \n\nAll this would serve to do, as far as your explanation provides, is make ADCs potentially more self-reliant (via itemization) than they already are, since they wouldn't need a lifesteal item. Instead of using alienated keystones, why don't you focus purely on what the intent is? If its self-healing, allow ALL champs to be able to make use of it, not just a certain class. You already have things in place to counter it, so it wouldn't be broken {{item:3165}} {{item:3033}} \n\nIs there a reason you don't try to encourage multi-role use of certain keystones, like the new warlord's providing something like wota/gunblade's sustain as you drop in health as opposed to just lifesteal?\n\nDon't use Vlad as an excuse for this one because he's getting reworked and you KNOW this. You could easily give him compensation nerfs if he became too powerful and it wouldn't matter in the long run because there's an incoming rework.
