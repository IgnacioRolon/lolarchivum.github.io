While in Top lane, a Tentacle can spawn on the north wall behind the bush, and it&#039;s technically in the FoW, so according to Patch notes, her opponent wouldn&#039;t see it, despite this not being the intended use case. This is probably not very important, but it&#039;s still a situational buff and hiding part of her power behind lack of clarity.\r\n\r\n2. More importantly, if the Tentacles &quot;stay revealed&quot; after the first time you see them, there are still a lot of situations where you can track Illaoi&#039;s position **by the state (dormant or active) of already revealed Tentacles**. So the modification doesn&#039;t achieve it&#039;s stated goal.\r\n\r\nDid I misunderstand something? If not, could you explain once again what was your objective with this change, and why you think this specific set of changes fit the bill?\r\n\r\nThanks ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-03T21:52:07.744+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tentacles don't stay revealed, so while they might be changing to dormant or active that will be behind FoW and therefore not visible to the enemy team. If we run into issues with tentacles in brush offering too much power because they're in FoW via the brush we might add a brief delay to them getting hidden.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-05-03T21:57:41.459+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jc5gwYpz,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-03T21:52:07.744+0000)\n>\n> Tentacles don&#x27;t stay revealed\n\nthe patch notes state \"(Tentacles stay revealed once youâ€™ve seen them for the first time)\"","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-04T00:20:59.273+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, then we've either got some wrong patch notes or a difference between what's in the patch and our latest internal build.

We've got some interest in trying a version where you can see them through FoW once revealed, but can't see their state change. That's something we might try at a later date but don't have in at present.

I guess I'll have to test it in-game to see how it works exactly ^^ (but damn, I'm traveling for the next 2 weeks and I don't have my gaming gear with me... :s)\n\nAbout the bushes in lanes, I don't really expect it to be a problem, especially if you can see the particle traveling from Illaoi to the spawn point. But if you put a delay before hiding them, you'll be back to the old problem of tracking Illaoi through FoW, no? It will be harder to do, but still possible just as before.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TsZ IronPhoenix","date":"2016-05-04T13:14:45.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler,\n\nso i have tested the new Illaoi and in my opinion her E got a clear nerf. In patch notes it says you stay for 12 sec a vessel now in game it says only 10 sec in the german version. In the early game it feels balanced you spawn max 2 tentacles and thats ok. But later in the game this wont really change cause in 10 sec the enemy move too less to spawn the max of 3 tentacles. More over 3 tentacles dont feel much compared to the theoretical 6 before the \"change\". In my opinion you should scale the 10 sec to 15 sec with lvl it up to lvl 5. So you can have a theoretical of 5 tentacles when you reached mid game. But at 10 sec its for me a nerf and i hope you change something cause she already was at 45 % win rate i dont want to have even less on her. \n\nregards,\nAngelo","replies":[]}]}
