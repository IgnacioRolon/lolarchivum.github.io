Time out players who receive a verbal abuse warning from playing for 30 minutes, and make them do the I agree thing(but about toxicity of course). That way they can cool down and think about what they've done. I'm told verbal abuse warnings don't come from one game but from multiple games in succession. \r\n\r\nWhy I think this will curb toxicity? Ranked restrictions and chat restrictions don't really do the job like a 30 min timeout would. Why? You can still play with ranked res, and you can still talk with chat res so the ability to be toxic is at the click of a button(match me with other players). Now, with verbal abusive players getting that warning and a timeout, there chances of being toxic have been eliminated for an entire 30 minutes plus the time to takes to say I agree. If someone continues to be toxic after a 30 min timeout then time then out for 6 hours, if they do it again in 6 hours, give them a 24 hour ban.\r\n\r\nYou say the number of toxic players is >1%. However, toxic players make up 10% of every game they play and have the ability to ruin the game for 90% of the players. I believe my method may be the best way to counteract toxicity because it will save and keep the good players when they know that their reports will directly affect the toxic player as well as prevent him/her from ruining someone else's experience. Don't be fooled by the mere 1% of toxic players because as I said, they have the ability to influence 9 players in a game and possibly bring those players to the dark side.\r\n\r\nTake it from someone who knows toxicity. When I'm mad, I want to bring down as many people as possible because I feel that when I get the 0/10 laner, who never got ganked by the enemy, someone has to pay. If I were timed out for 30 minutes I wouldn't be able to ruin another person's game for 30 minutes, and if I did ruin a game in 30 minutes I would suffer a 6 hour ban. Even toxic players want to play league, and I would even bet that most love the game too much. So timing them out, I believe, would get them to better understand and focus on what they did. \r\n\r\nOne last thing, these double jeoparady bans are ridiculous and I don't feel they will do anything to curb toxicity. I get on my main tomorrow, whether or not I'm toxic is left to the future. It's been 2 long weeks. Before I was banned I had only 8 ranked restricted games, and about 40 chat restrictions. If I come back from this 2 week ban with ranked restrictions and cat restrictions, then yes I'm goign to be mad, and your system will have failed Lyte. It will have failed because your ideas on preventing toxicity are not based off experience. Nobody wants to be hit with a triple jeopardy. 2 weeks is too long to stop toxicity. You have to ban people where it hurts, in the present. So, if I'm wanting to play League right now, and I get the verbal warning, I am now unable to play league right now for 30 minutes... This wil cause me to reflect and understand what I've done. I was able to by pass this 2 week ban because I knew it was 2 weeks, I had finals, and I could find different thigns to do. But, If I want to play RIGHT NOW, and I'm toxic, I get timed out for 30 minutes, and lose my ability to play when I wanted too causing me to sriously think about what I did and could have done better.\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: I know the pieces fit, cause I watched them fall away.","replies":[]}
