Something I've done personally that could help is getting a Ethernet to USB cable.  This can help get you on a wired connection!   Unless you're getting any errors at all, it's best to let the patcher do its thing, otherwise it can cause the process to restart as well as scan for corruption, which can take longer.  Once it's done, you can also go over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to see if you might be able to tune things up with your network.
