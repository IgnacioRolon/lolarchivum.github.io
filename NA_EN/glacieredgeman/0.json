I want to mute everyone so I can focus on myself, my own gameplay. Can you not implement this? Please Do not see this as a whining post, if you were in my shoes, and you consistently feed because of your aggressive playstyle, just give me the ability to not be able to hear this stuff always. Just once in a while, of course I can understand taking words when I make mistakes but I do not want to get verbally shitted on every 9 out of 10 games. It makes me angry and not want to play. Might as well quit! Do you want me to quit?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-16T05:37:15.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by \"in default settings mode\"?

You could argue that you could just hit play again or exit quickly but sometimes you want to see stats without feeling the heat of your team or the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2018-12-16T17:57:42.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get some tough skin or leave the lobby.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2018-12-16T13:16:25.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gg {{champion:81}}","replies":[]}]}
