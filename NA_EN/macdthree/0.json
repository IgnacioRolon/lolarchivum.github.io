The last 2 champions are amazing thematically and mechanically, but extremely lacking in power compared to the oppressive slew of champs that are currently around, therefore not fun to play because who likes to be beat up on by stuff your kit is simply not designed to counteract.\n\nEdit: If it was designed by Riot to find out what mechanisms in the game dominate and are in dire need of tuning then they have done a good job of locating the major failing.  High mobility champs are the absolute best in the game generally speaking, and will punish anyone without a mobility skill heavily, there is a reason Lucian, Riven, Lee Sin, Zed, Yasuo, Fiora and the like are the most played and popular champs currently.  The only exceptions to this are when a champion has extreme burst and safety (Gangplank) or unfair amounts of sustain and stickiness with good damage (Mundo), but both of those have been or will be nerfed hard.  So the real culprit really is high mobility wall hopping madness, give it to more champs or increase the CD of the champs who have it when they use it to engage by increasing the CD of mobility skills greatly and give them passives that reduce their CD for each second they spend not attacking or doing damage, then they'll be more balanced, in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2016-02-13T06:10:44.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"unfortunately mundo was around long before he became OP again...he probably wouldn't be mentioned but his recent update to his E literally DOUBLED his early game damage, now allowing him to be relevant at all points in the game (though he was fairly so before, he couldn't mindlessly rush in)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-12T19:49:03.402+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora was reworked once I recall.","replies":[{"poster":"MacDthree","date":"2016-02-12T19:53:02.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"and they are currently reworking her completely again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-12T19:56:18.355+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?
