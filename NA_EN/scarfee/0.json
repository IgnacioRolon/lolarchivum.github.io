Right?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am reading feedback from multiple servers, multiple forums, etc... and people are really disturbed with the splash unification process happening. A lot of people are not satisfied, and think things should be left as they are until Riot could do a quality work on those arts... But I just wanted to genuinely ask about the purpose of the unification in general. I want some Clarity (trademark). \r\n\r\nAs I understand it... it is the same thing that happened in 2014-15 splash art updates? They are placeholders until Riot will start working on splashes champ-by-champ? Or is it a permanent solution unless a complete VU is happening for a certain champ? \r\n\r\nMy own opinion is pretty mixed, but it is more negative than positive. Most arts are really misshaped and are even worse than before (why do you want to kill Groovy Zilean for me?!! What&#039;s going on with shapes and looks on Janna, Kayle, Karma, Amumu, Corki, Evelynn, Caitlyn, SINFUL SUCCULENCE MORGANA OMFG), and a bit of them are awesome (like, new divine Soraka. Bandit Sivir, Hecarim, Vladimir, Lee Sin, Infernal Wu!, Akali, Irelia, Shyvana and Renegade Talon)\r\n\r\nOnce again, I am asking about the purpose of this and not just crying to LET EVERYTHIGN BE AS IT IS OR I AM GONNA UNSUB NEVER BUY RP ADKASOPIDAPODIWDPOAIWDPOAWPDADIO... even though I really don&#039;t like some of those.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-04-06T23:46:18.517+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope!

(Seeing as how the model is completely different XD) So seeing it lose some aspects of him actually making his grand escape out of the asylum made it lose... The fantasy maybe? It's weird seeing as how most people don't really notice the skins other people have to begin with anyway.\nThis feeling more or less came from the fact that popular champions will have more attention than unpopular champions. Champions like Lee sin can avoid a rework by having a dedictated and larger fan base than some of the less popular champions such as (for my standpoint) Shaco. Or how Night Raven Fiora was able to dodge a bullet because of reddit, yet my champion and my favorite skin doesn't have a chance. \nNot that I'm saying that riot doesn't care for his fans. They iceboxed his rework because it didn't feel like him anymore and I'm grateful for that. (As much as I joke about it)\nIt's just that his recent splash changes probably won't be reverted and it hurts me to see those unique splash arts to go away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2016-04-07T00:39:23.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jYqK0JAa,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-04-06T23:46:18.517+0000)\n>\n> Nope!
