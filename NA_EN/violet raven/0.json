I switch around every month or so (I end up changing it back after a week or two) but ive used the black and red one most consistently and currently it has been my icon for at least a month if not more.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-02T20:14:12.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the follow up!

I just re-logged anyway to be sure and it has not changed.\n\nPS: SORRY I lied, I switched to project Ashe icon today but prior to that it was the red one and I think the problem is still relevant, just gave slightly false information.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-02T20:22:18.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be a delay with the summoner icon updated on here.
