Essentially, part of the data going between your network and our servers is getting lost along the way, which causes those huge spikes in ping. \n\nI want to test this first to make sure it is actually packet loss, so grab your recent game logs that had that lag and throw it into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Take a screenshot using something like Gyazo and shoot it my way!","replies":[{"poster":"xXLOLuDEADXx","date":"2017-06-03T03:15:13.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here take a look\nhttp://imgur.com/a/bksOF","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-03T22:50:02.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooo you weren't kidding about those lag spikes. It does look like your network has been having some packet loss, especially in that one spot where it jumped to almost 70%. Basically, that means 70% of the data was lost before it got to the servers. Typically, but not all of the time, packet loss ends up being on the ISP side.\n\nReach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they can look over some of your logs to see if they can help out in any way!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
