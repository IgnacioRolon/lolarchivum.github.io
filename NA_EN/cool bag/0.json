He has changed the settings on his computer to attack move on left click. When I played on his computer (on my account) I am assuming it turned my settings into attack move on left click instead of the default. I went to my regular computer to play and I noticed that his settings were still there. I deleted persisted settings and tried again and now my left click does nothing other than buy things in the shop. I cannot A+left click to attack more or anything. How would I revert to normal since deleting persistent settings did not work for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-11T23:23:54.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It requires some deep file modifications to make that happen, and isn't something we can support just because of issues like this.  Your best bet would be to reset your config, and that may mean deleting your config folder entirely if removing persistedsettings didn't work.  Just in case make sure to go over these steps accurately-\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nIf that doesn't work, delete the Config folder entirely.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"cool bag","date":"2017-03-12T04:17:51.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried both of those, deleting those two files and deleting the entire config and the issue is still there. If it helps at all, its as if it doesn't recognize me left clicking at all, which is also super strange. Anything else I would have to do to fix this issue ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-14T15:34:46.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's strange to hear that the issue persists, and that mouse click isn't being recognized at all.  What happens if you swap you mouse?
