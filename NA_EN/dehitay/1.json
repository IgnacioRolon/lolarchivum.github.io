It would pop up that error box saying you can't connect and offering the option to try to reconnect or cancel. But even if I pressed reconnect, it wouldn't connect. If I restarted the client, it wouldn't connect. If I restarted my computer, it wouldn't connect. It's annoying to get punished for this, but I can get over that with time. The real issue is I can't figure out why the hell I suddenly can't connect to games.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-20T04:23:02.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be issues in your local network settings causing issues with your PC reaching our game servers.
