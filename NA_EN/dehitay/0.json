To the point where I wouldn't actually pay for some of them. Gatekeeper Galio is especially disappointing for me. He looks like some weird off colored cockatoo mecha while the original Gatekeeper skin was utterly badass. And I paid a lot of money for that one. I don't have any desire to use the Gatekeeper skin anymore, but I used the original one all the time because I loved it. These changes have been disappointing for me, and I would at least like to get my RP back since this isn't what I paid for.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2017-03-29T17:50:42.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck, but there's no chance of it happening.  Riot has your money and they don't care about giving it back.\n\nAfter the Yorick rework was announced, I wanted a complete refund of every dollar I spent on this game.  I felt lied to about the rework and of Riot's \"for the players\" policy.\n\nAt first, my request for a refund was closed three times without a response.  This made me more and more upset.  Finally, I received a response that was very sarcastic and implied that I would receive some sort of penalty if I continued demanding the refund.

That said I hope you might reconsider having the gatekeeper at your side!\n\nI purchased Gatekeeper over a year ago I think. There's no way I could get a refund with the 3 free refunds you get cause of time constraints. I also purchased it WAY before the Galio rework was announced. To be honest, I actually hate the gameplay rework as well cause they destroyed the way he used to be played in the game which worked exceptionally well for me, but I never actually paid money for gameplay so I can live with that. What's really a rip off is that I paid actual money for a cosmetic change that I no longer have access to. Instead I've been given a lower aesthetic quality replacement.\n\nI read the reasoning Riot used to validate not giving out replacements. It comes out to be laziness and greed. So what if people are using visual reworks as a reason to get free RP refunds. That should be allowed to since they no longer have access to what they paid for even if they never used it. Because a lot of people are looking for free refunds (that Riot brought on themselves), now I can't get a refund on a skin that's nowhere near as good looking as what I paid for?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-29T22:14:04.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have bought the skin before the VGU announcement, but you bought it after they announced that VGUs wouldn't result in refunds anymore. After that announcement every skin was sold with the agreement that the skin could be changed eventually and that it wouldn't give you the right to refunds. Having the skin changed was a risk you accepted when you bought it. If you agreed with those terms before buying it, you can't claim it's unfair now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Janna m√¨d","date":"2017-03-29T10:31:24.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna refund the 5 skins and the champ itself now","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2017-03-30T14:01:35.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry man.
