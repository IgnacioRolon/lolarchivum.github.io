Where did my other 1.3k hp go? I'm honestly baffled of the current state of the death recap system and was wondering why this is the way it is. \n\nNot the mention the fact that its unhelpful because numbers just seem to be skewed for daamge done like sometimes it shows ive taken 5k dmg in .5secs when i only have 2k hp and died over a few seconds at least.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2019-05-24T18:31:57.419+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot is lazy and/or incompetent.
