Clearly the issue is direct to the game server though as the rest of the interwebs works perfectly fine.","replies":[{"poster":"mikel9444","date":"2016-10-04T05:34:30.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue.. was in game, and now my client wont connect... something wrong on server side.\nTried on a different computer and got the same results... its definitely on the server side.\nSame computers, and both of my daughters can login with their accounts, and play works fine... so there is a bug on the Riot side somewhere.
