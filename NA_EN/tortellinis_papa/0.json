I can run the game perfectly fine up until the game actually starts, then my whole computer completely freezes and I have to do a restart. This has caused me two losses now....(two because I thought the first time was just a weird fluke, but now it's apparent that it is obviously a reoccurring issue) Another thing to add is that I closed all other applications the second time just to be sure....If anyone could help I would love to play ranked again lol... One more thing to note is that the other games I play such as Overwatch and World of Warcraft are completely fine...\r\n\r\nThese are my laptop's specs:\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating System\r\n\tWindows 10 Home 64-bit\r\nCPU\r\n\tIntel Core i5 5200U @ 2.20GHz\t38 °C\r\n\tBroadwell-U 14nm Technology\r\nRAM\r\n\t6.00GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 798MHz (11-11-11-28)\r\nMotherboard\r\n\tLENOVO Lenovo Edge 15 (U3E1)\r\nGraphics\r\n\tGeneric PnP Monitor (1920x1080@60Hz)\r\n\tIntel HD Graphics 5500 (Lenovo)\r\nStorage\r\n\t931GB Western Digital WDC WD10SPCX-24HWST1 (SATA)\t34 °C\r\nOptical Drives\r\n\tNo optical disk drives detected\r\nAudio\r\n\tRealtek High Definition Audio","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T23:40:01.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A recent windows 10 update has caused issues with the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) and how it interacts with League.
