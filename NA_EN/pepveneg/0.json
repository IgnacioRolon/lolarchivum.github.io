Our Los Angeles musicians did a phenomenal job with this - they're world class players and I always look forward to having them play our music. 73 highly-talented people playing your music back at you is something I wish everyone could experience, there's nothing quite like it!","replies":[{"poster":"pepveneg","date":"2016-05-03T23:52:42.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it hard to create this music for so many instruments? did you get any help?

And 73 pros that is insane\n\nThank you for your questions!\n\nWhile they were a bunch of musicians playing the music, they played in sections. For instance, the 26 violins that were on the session probably only played 2 or 3 distinct melodic ideas at a time. The number of orchestra musicians playing the same musical idea is what gives the lush sound typically associated with symphonic music. At most, I probably had something like 10-15 individual lines at any given time. That translates into 3 or 4 different musical ideas playing together. More than that and the music would probably be unlistenable. \n\nI did get help from a great copyist to prepare for the session. The role of copyist is to make parts for the musicians to play. I gave him the score (= the big sheet music used by composers and conductors with all the instruments that are part of the music). A good copyist will make parts that are without mistakes and as legible as possible for the musicians.\n\nOutside of that, I wrote all the music and orchestrated it myself. Is it hard? Yes and no. Sometimes you face certain musical difficulties. They can be technical, or have to do with storytelling. I'm sure everyone faces some level of difficulty in their work at times. But music is my language, and I have enough fluency that overall it is not hard - just a lot of work!\n\nI hope this answers your question!\n\nBest,\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"pepveneg","date":"2016-05-05T02:34:30.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes you answered everything thank you!
