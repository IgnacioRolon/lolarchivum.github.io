I'm not saying I hate a good Gurren Lagann spinoff skin, but this has to be the most annoying thing to lane against.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't seen this skin before (You should have) then you need to know that Rumble talks nearly every time he uses an ability. And it's quite loud and beeps a bit much at times. Even louder than the regular Rumble's laugh and warning noises. Knowing his abilities are spammable....he talks...a LOT.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just me, but it breaks my concentration at times and makes it hard to focus in the lane without getting annoyed or sounded out in my head by him.\r\n\r\nSo please, Riot, can you make a mute button for Super Galaxy Rumble like you made a button to listen to Sona's music? But for both teams?","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-09-27T05:11:39.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Super Galaxy Rumble + Tristana is the most obnoxious troll bot lane ever.
