No, I actually like his new identity as a moving turret and it really puts him apart from other marksman.\r\n\r\nDoes he need attention? Yes, mainly because he doesn&#039;t really spike into late game as well as other late carries like Jinx or Vayne. \r\n\r\nAnd given his sub-par late game, his early game is some of the weakest out of all marksman. His only real power spike is when he gets Rageblade and Runaan&#039;s; allowing him to deal actual damage with his auto attacks and W. \r\n\r\nNow, I&#039;m no expert league player. I&#039;m also still experimenting with his build paths, but so far he&#039;s only reliable if he has enough sustain to heal up while enemies wail on him. \r\n\r\nNot only that, but Rageblade and Runaan&#039;s have become staples, only giving him 3-slot options to itemize into either pure damage in hopes to get a kill, or sustain to stay alive while he wittles them down (boots take up a space, and we all know it&#039;s berserker&#039;s).\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#039;t seem healthy at all, because a full-AD or AP Kog isn&#039;t going to aid his team as well as a sustain-built Kog due to how low his scaling is. 55% AD while W is active is fine because he ends up dealing % HP damage, but it&#039;s scaling is only in AP and it&#039;s pretty low at that. \r\n\r\nI really like where he was taken, but right now, he isn&#039;t looking so hot in both diversity and numbers. I would rather have a low-scaling hybrid ratio Kog Maw or a better scaling, single ratio (AD or AP) Kog Maw than a low scaling semi-hybrid-AP-leniant &quot;needs to build sustain and attack speed&quot; Kog Mawnstrosity.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-14T18:31:14.353+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nice post.

Letting his W scale with AD again in addition to the 2% base would probably put him in a healthy spot for those who like to build him as an adc.

Frankly, I love Kog'maw, and got used to his reworked w. If people want a way to get rid of kog'maw, here is a hint. SONA. {{champion:37}} This champion is a huge problem to kog. She has the poke, heal and level 6 shutdown. She is a great harass, because with her w, she can move faster than Kog. Honestly, Kog doesn't need to be drastically changed or frankly, even touched, but some people are looking too hard at kog'maw, when he has almost no issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Haselnussstrauch","date":"2016-01-22T15:22:52.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rip ap kog :c\ni dont understand why they reworkted him just give us the old kog pls\nhere a link to some ideas for ap kog: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/de/c/gameplay-balance/roE78zga-idea-to-help-ap-kog-maw","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squidblimp","date":"2016-01-14T23:34:02.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if Kog'Maw's range increased on-hit when his W was active, but the range stacks only stayed on him for 1 second?

His ability to crush team fights with YoMama's Ghostblade and Hurricane is crazy.\n\nVayne just needs to wait out Kog's W and then he's free food.  Vayne should have no reason to be near Kog until after a team-fight is rounding up, and by that time his W will be down and she can kill him without difficulty if it comes down to a duel.  Vayne can also whittle Kog down with Rapidfire + Tumble procs and just avoid going All In until she can kill him easily.  If Vayne is stupid and just dives Kog, she'll likely lose.  But if she takes advantage of the fact that she can completely dictate the tempo of the fight, she'll win.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SirPurrr","date":"2016-01-15T16:29:50.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bring back Kog'Maw!

But when you do hit full build.... 5.0 attacks a second will shred ANYONE who stands in your way, without penetration. God help them if you land your q on them first, because they are already dead. If your q can land you can land quite a few hits with your w. Sustain kog is nice, but i feel his power really shines early game right after getting stinger, 50% attack speed, you should have your q almost maxed by this point, giving you around 3 attacks a second in w, and with % health damage it only takes one stun / exhaust to kill in lane, if you prefer kog in a duo lane. I like to take him solo and suprise people who havent seen him in a solo lane before.","replies":[]}]}
