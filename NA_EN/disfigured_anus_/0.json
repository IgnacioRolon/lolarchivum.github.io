I've done loads of research and tried things like PlayOnMac and the WindowsOS (free) but neither of them works for me. Also if you Google \"How to play League on a Mac in Canada\" the first thing that comes up is some Apple article talking about how it's only possible to run League on US ports but I don't think that's true because I can run the client perfectly fine it's just when I get into a match of any kind that the performance goes down immensely.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of any programs I could use to make League run smoother and actually work?\r\n\r\nI've tried doing things to make it better but it just simply doesn't work, if there are any alternatives that would allow me to play without wanting to gouge my eyes out I'd appreciate it if someone would let me know, it'd be a big help.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T02:56:05.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We definitely don't need your Mac overheating while playing League, that could lead to some other problems you don't want for sure! We should first make sure that it's not something with your Mac causing this overheating, [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684#mq7) should be able to help some.
