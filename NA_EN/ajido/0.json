Stop being a complete moron.\n\nThe address that you posted and I quoted was 104.160.132.35. Not 192.64.170.139. 104.160.132.35 is in New York. Period. End of story. It doesn't matter what WHOIS or IP2LOCATION say. They do not know where Riot assigned that address. Hint: It is assigned to a router. Not a server. Not a group of servers. And the ping from a NYC LG is ~1ms. Hence the obvious... the router is in New York. Your inability to understand this concept proves you are the idiot and your reading comprehension is really bad.\n\nRiot does not have game servers in California. They haven't for years. Everything is in Portland and Chicago. They have other servers in California (chat maybe?) but no game servers. You are connected to the same servers as everyone else. And everyone else is playing on servers in Chicago. Your data could be being routed to Cali and back to Chicago. But there is 0 evidence of that in anything you or anyone else has posted. Simply having a ping of 150ms proves nothing.\n\nBy the way, 150ms ping from the East coast to the West coast is complete shit. And your superiority complex while hilarious is extremely sad since you are truly a clueless moron. And the downvotes are cute.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ajido","date":"2015-10-02T01:34:06.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ultra Helpful,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=UAtb6qAL,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-10-02T01:17:53.030+0000)\n>\n> I made my own thread about this.
