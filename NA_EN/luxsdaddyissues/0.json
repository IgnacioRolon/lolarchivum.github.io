I won both, but the problem is that on the first game the game was 35 mins and I was 6/4/12 with 250 farm. In the 2nd game it took us 25 minutes and I was 14/2/11 with 160 farm and I got a quadra kill, but I got an A+ on both. So like the first one i'd understand why I got an A+, but then in 2nd game why didn't I get an S? Like this makes 0 sense, how are these 2 games worth the same grade?!\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} {{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-19T20:29:39.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're doing a fantastic job, don't let not getting an S get you down.
