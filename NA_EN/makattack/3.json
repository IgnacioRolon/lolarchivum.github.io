The root alone on top of the slow on her Q makes her one of the most efficient self-peel champs in the game. You either have to have crazy Zed burst or enough CC to kill her in the duration of the CC before she can shield and run.\n\nAnd since none of her skills besides her root require being in engagement range of the enemy, she can just free poke all game long while shielding her allies and peeling targets that get all-in'd on.\n\nThese are cancer support champs. When you allow supports to give ADC's so much survival, the game devolves into an arms race of giving assassins and melee champs enough damage to burst them in one rotation, which is toxic because then the other laners pay the price of buffed melee champs needing that damage to deal with a duo bot lane's CC/shields/heals on ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2019-06-18T22:28:24.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> And since none of her skills besides her root require being in engagement range of the enemy, she can just free poke all game long while shielding her allies and peeling targets that get all-in'd on.\n\nLol...
