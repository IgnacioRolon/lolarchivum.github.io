You see, Karma was one of the first champions to receive a full rework (gameplay and visual update), and it was done rather sloppily, but that made sense since Riot had only done full reworks on a handful of champions. Despite the sloppy execution, it was a step forward for Karma.\r\n\r\nNow, lets fast-forward to season 5, specifically, [Patch 5.10](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-510-notes#patch-karma)). \r\n\r\nThese changes gave Karma fewer damage options on empowered abilities but granted her more utility on these empowered abilities. This is where they messed up, and ever since they've been pushing her into the support role. Riot needed to learn that _bigger_ is not better. Giving her _bigger_ shields, and a _longer_ root (the longest in the game...yes even longer than Morgana's) didn't solve anything; if anything, it gave Karma even more issues.\r\n\r\nThen, in season 6 (\"ardent meta\"), Riot decided to give Karma disgustingly excessive buffs. This launched her into the pro play scene. She became very popular and received nerfs to make up for the earlier buffs. A lot of Karma mains were afraid that these 9.12 buffs would bring about nerfs, similar to what happened in season 6. \r\n\r\nUp until Patch 9.12, Karma was at best C tier in all roles. For support (since that's the only role Riot seems to care about when it comes to Karma), her early game bully trait became less apparent as favorable match-ups like Alistar, Leona, Braum, Taric, Galio, etc. became less popular while unfavorable match-ups like Nami, Sona, Pyke, Nautilus, Lux, became the popular. \r\n\r\n\r\n#Karma's Scrapped Update from last year\r\n\r\nTowards the end of season 8 and preseason 9, Karma was scheduled for a champion. Riot Neurocat was at the front of this. The changes Riot had came up with would make more of RQ's damage be on impact, and less on eruption (further pushing her into the poke role), and made her RW have an ally function that took parts of Zilean's and (old) Soraka's abilities and combined them. This change was unpopular amongst some Karma mains (mostly mid and top mains, but even some support mains disliked this). However, other Karma mains felt like this was a step in the right direction. Whether it's fortunate or not, these changes were scrapped. \r\n\r\n\r\n#What do I think about these Buffs? \r\n\r\nOn paper, I didn't think they'd have much impact. I think the E haste change is what has the most impact, and if Karma becomes an overbearing S tier support, they should tone the buffs down or even revert them. But I doubt that will happen because Nami, Sona, Pyke, Naut, Lux, etc. are still really great picks. **Also, I don't think I saw anyone asking for Karma number buffs. If anything, I saw people asking for her to get reworked/updated, but apparently, Riot doesn't want to do this. **\r\n\r\n\r\n#Bonus: My thoughts on Top Karma\r\n\r\nI think these buffs impact top Karma the most. Most top laners already think the IBG build is super cancerous to the game, and while I don't play tank Karma often, I can't quite disagree that it's frustrating to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"JaibamonLAN","date":"2019-06-18T00:44:30.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot lets champs like Riven and Yasuo to stay Top Tier, why Karma should be nerfed now?\n\nShe is great now, leave her alone. Let players learn how to play against her. She still has clear weakness. She is a lane bully, and she should be a good lane bully, who falls behind during the late game. Top Karma becomes just a meat stick with slows, Support Karma a shield battery, and Mid Karma can deal damage but doesn't have any nukes.\n\nShe doesn't need nerfs.\n\nOh, and she is a good counter to Mordekaiser now, maybe that's why people are salty.","replies":[{"poster":"Makattack","date":"2019-06-18T00:55:08.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...she's getting nerfed next patch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VoidStaresBack","date":"2019-06-17T12:32:41.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Minor sidenote: Season Six wasn't ardent meta, Karma saw pro play then in part because she could (at the time) mantra-e a minion to speed up pushes and partly as part of the Sivir-Karma blitzkrieg comp that gave their team enough movespeed to force any teamfight they wanted, and she got nerfed because of her pro play dominance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2019-06-17T12:13:52.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this for the most part, although I believe E ms buff was justified.
