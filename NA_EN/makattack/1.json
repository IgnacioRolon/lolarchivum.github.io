I'm a Karma mid OTP, and I am here to propose an idea that's pretty common throughout the community of Karma mains; I am positive that it would fit some of Karma's issues that prevent her from being a stable, viable mid lane pick in solo queue. I, for one, am not a fan of (nor do I enjoy) the shield-bot playstyle that is forced onto Karma, and I'd hope that this change would be able to push Karma away from that uninteractive playstyle to a more mechanically demanding, but satisfying-to-play playstyle. \n\n#The Problem\n\nKarma's Inner Flame (Q) and Soulflare (RQ) both have a direction-targetted casting paradigm with collision effects. This means that if Karma casts Inner Flame into an incoming minion wave (vertical), it will hit and stop at the first minion instead of passing through and hitting the minions behind. It is worth noting that there is a small radius from the impact where enemies are also damaged and slowed.\n\nThis casting paradigm on Karma's primary damaging spell makes it so that not only does she have trouble clearing minion waves in a vertical line, but she also has trouble damaging opponents later on in the game. I think the former completely turns renders RQ's initial purpose (damaging) null; it becomes a way for her to reset Mantra so she can just quickly RE again. I don't think that's how Riot envisioned team fighting on Karma to be, and I feel like if enemies aren't respecting her damage potential as they would with any other mage, they should take damage.\n\nAs for the waveclear issue, someone could claim that the poor wave clear is simply a weakness and that all champions have a weakness. I'd agree with that. Riot changing Soulflare's casting paradigm get rid of this weakness. \n\n#The Solution\n\nThe solution to this issue is very simple. Making Soulflare ground-targetted would ensure that Karma mid can act as a reliable mage for her team while retaining her weakness of poor wave-clear. \n\nI am fully aware that Karma's Soulflare maybe would be unbalanced if it were given a ground-casting paradigm with its _**current numbers**_. I think it would be fair to strip some of the damage away and maybe even decrease the slow if necessary to compensate. There would also obviously have to be a delay (similar to Xerath or Brand W).\n\n#Karma's fine, why touch her? \nI believe Karma's generalist nature is best used in organized/pro-play, and that in solo queue, she just doesn't perform as well as other similar champions that have more focused kits.  Changing the casting paradigm for her main burst tool would make Karma (in all roles, top, mid, and support) more viable in solo queue, and less dependent (but still dependent enough) on teammates. \n\n#TLDR\nRQ being so easily blockable completely gimps mid lane Karma's DPS in the mid to late game. This makes her have to revert to a supportive shield-bot playstyle. I don't find that fun, balanced, or interactive for a mage. I'd like for Riot to change the casting paradigm of RQ.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2019-05-17T15:32:55.687+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there. I think I was the first to propose a Ground Targeted RQ (GTRQ). \nAs such it would be wise to add a few things, because _\"awkward farming\"_ isn't the main issue I have with current **RQ**:\nIt's _Karma's area of threat_. \n\nKarma has two ways of dealing damage, **Q** and **W**.\nHowever, W is most effective at close range (guaranteeing both damage ticks and root),\nwhile **Q** is somewhat neutral, but still slightly easier to hit up close.\n**RQ** turns it into an artillery spell, that is way more effective at longer ranges, due to it exploding at max range; this makes it hit people that would have ordinarily dodged it.\n\nWhat this does to Karma is, that her main damage spell contradicts her usual threat range and muddies her identity; where is she supposed to be compared to where her enemy is supposed to be. At max range? Up close? There is no telling. Sure, currently Karma wants you to be exactly at MAX **RQ** range at all times, but if someone goes at ya, they can't even dodge your **W** damage/root. If **W** was a spell that worked at the same range - similar to how Vel'Koz spells work, hit and dodgeable at all ranges - it would be well and dandy, but currentlly the enemy is effed at max **RQ** range and at **W** range. Or not, if they are strong enough to tank through it, but then Karma has no options. Is that really what we want? That binary BS? No interaction or creativity?\n\n> _I don't think that's how Riot envisioned team fighting on Karma to be, and I feel like if enemies aren't respecting her damage potential as they would with any other mage, they should take damage._\n\nSo here's a hard truth: _They have no vision for Karma_. The person who invented her is long gone, everyone who ever touched her had idas that weren't conherent or compatible with any one before it. Karma is also a bad mage, because **RQ** is 3/4ths of her damage, making her damage paradigm way too spikey to be healthy. On top of that, the current **RQ** is so unreliable in some fights you can't ever get the damage where it's supposed to be, sometimes only due to bad luck (minions randomly re-targetting, for example). On the flip side, you sometimes hit people who had no chance to dodge, which isn't fair either.\n\nThe damage of a mage should never be in 2 spells alone and it should not be that luck dependent. Because for a single projectile **RQ's** damage is incredibly high, but Karma's kit has rather little damage as a whole. This was not an issue before **5.10**, because up to then putting all your damage into **RQ** was a CHOICE you made, since both **W** and **E** could carry that damage as well, giving Karma reliable options, that needed to be respected.\n\nI hold that **5.10** was a mistake, due to a lack of understanding and vision for her kit,\nand now Karma's potential is rotting in the cellar of that idiotic shieldbot maiden they made her.\nEven in the only animation she has ever been in she did nothing but stand there and throw a single shield.\nThe protector of her people, wielder of twin dragons, avatar of balance and LoL's hadouken girl #1 \ncan do nothing but apply blurry turqoise bubble blobs? \nGive me a break.\n\n**KARMA NEEDS RELIABLE DAMAGE OPTIONS; \nBE IT WITH A MORE BALANCED RQ\nOR THE SIGNATURE SPELL SHE HAD\nFOR 5 FUCKING YEARS: SHIELDBOMB.**\n\nIvern can have one, Neeko can have one,\nit was what she was known for\nand her absence made her a one dimensional luck based gimp. \nFight me.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2019-05-17T17:51:24.830+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow its almost as if Karma was originally a close range heavy AoE fighter mage with _team_ support capabilities and the rework only half portrays that to Karma's detriment because she is now a mediocre generalist with a disjointed kit that is doomed to be only relevant or useful when Riot nerfs everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2019-05-18T00:03:20.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth.\n\nShe used to be a battlemage {{champion:50}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:127}}\nwas reworked to a support mage {{champion:61}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:25}} \nand since then treated like a support {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:40}} \n\nDepending on where you would put her here,\nwe know which Karma you liked.","replies":[{"poster":"Waka FIocka","date":"2019-05-18T05:47:45.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean they kinda did the same thing to Zyra.

Do you enjoy simpler and more straight forward designs? What does she have now that's superior to her old self and/or comparable champs?\n\nSee, I liked a lot of things about old Karma and I like a lot about new Karma (and all the in betweens as well), but I think that both missed/are missing a ton of her potential. Unnecessarily.\n\nCould you help me out and tell me exactly what you like, dislike in that regard?\nAnd what is it you like about the current design?","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2019-05-18T03:19:34.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a shieldbomb on a mage is just a confused ability. You're either shielding a low-value target to get the bomb(a tank who likely won't get hurt), or you're wasting the bomb on a ranged character who can take advantage of the shield but not the bomb.\n\nIt creates a situation where making the most of the ability either requires your ally to be an idiot(an adc/mage diving into enemy backlines), or enemies being idiots(focusing the tank). A self-shieldbomb on a diver, a tank, or maybe an assassin... these are all reasonable. But on a mage? It just feels like it makes no sense. Edit: And to be clear, the reason the nuke + shield works for Neeko is that its her ult, so it can have enough range, damage, and shielding to be relevant(additionally she has her disguise and clone to get in range for the nuke). Karma's ult is designed to be used multiple times per fight, so it doesn't make sense.\n\nThe tether is the same thing. Karma shouldn't be behind enemies, so you have to tether someone who will be diving PAST the enemies, which means basically... Vi, Akali, or Zed. Most others dive TO the enemy, not past. Again, it's just an ability that makes no sense on the type of character she is. If it were on a champ designed to dive past themselves, it'd make sense. \n\nAs far as what I like about her now? I like that her abilities embody balance - q is offense, w is offense and defense, e is defense. Her mantra enhances those abilities in ways that makes them further exemplify which part of the kit you use it on. Thematically it fits, you use her mantra to help restore the balance by amplifying one side of it.\n\nShe is a well-rounded support offering both damage, cc, and protection. Her kit isn't built around a single power-spike at 6 like many, which makes her fun to play, and she can used both as an aggressive bully or as a protective buffer during lane.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2019-05-18T06:48:55.123+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> or you're wasting the bomb on a ranged character who can take advantage of the shield but not the bomb.\n\nYou could just use regular E, if you don't want to use the bomb, right?\n\n> It creates a situation where making the most of the ability either requires your ally to be an idiot(an adc/mage diving into enemy backlines), or enemies being idiots(focusing the tank). \n\nOr you shieldbomb your carry that just got jumped by an assassin?\nOr shieldbomb on your diver?\n\n> A self-shieldbomb on a diver, a tank, or maybe an assassin... these are all reasonable. But on a mage?\n\nIt doesn't need to be a self-shieldbomb only.\nBut hey, there's Ivern, right?\nHe is neither diver, tank or assassin. To be honest, Karma used to be far more of a frontline mage/bruiser than he is now.\n\n>  the reason the nuke + shield works for Neeko is that its her ult, so it can have enough range, damage, and shielding to be relevant\n\nAnd it's been on Karma's _semi_ ult in a clearly weaker but still relevant form for years.\n\n> Karma's ult is designed to be used multiple times per fight, so it doesn't make sense.\n\nA design choice I somewhat disagree with, to be honest. It wasn't designed that way, but they pushed so much power into it that it became meaningless. They took away the actualy choice you could make with mantra and made it so that you had to mantra over and over again to be useful.... instead of using the right mantra at the right time. \n\n> Karma shouldn't be behind enemies, so you have to tether someone who will be diving PAST the enemies\n\nYou could easily tether an Irelia back in the days. Or Trynda. But usually you'd rather tether your ADC to trip their divers; which only makes sense if Karma is a battlemage/bruiser and not a squishy backline support. You also used to be able to tether to minions/wards, which gave it a lot more use too.\n\n> I like that her abilities embody balance - q is offense, w is offense and defense, e is defense. Her mantra enhances those abilities in ways that makes them further exemplify which part of the kit you use it on. Thematically it fits, you use her mantra to help restore the balance by amplifying one side of it.\n\nNo offense, that sounds poetic, but once you think about it, the abilities aren't that meaningful. Most support champs have an offensive Q, a W with CC and a defensive E. And just having _more_ of a thing... I mean, I get it, you think it can help tip the balance, but the way she is scaling atm this decision which one of the three to mantra only works in the early game. Once you have items two of the mantras fall off HARD, making them bad options nearly all of the time. \n\nIt's weird, it feels like you could like what I am proposing in my [Quick Fix.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/RHn0ZE62-quick-fix-for-karma) A W that can be offensive and defensive (resistances for allies) and a mantra that can reasonably be used on all 3 of the abilities depending on the situation, not your build.\n\n> She is a well-rounded support offering both damage, cc, and protection.\n\nWhat makes her different to Nami, Lulu and Sona in that regard? It sounds like that could describe any of them.\nAnyhow, I am not even opposed to those ideas though, those are things that I am fighting to retain.\nWell, you could argue that I have some issues with her CC, but that's never been Karma's strength anyways.\n\n> Her kit isn't built around a single power-spike at 6 like many, which makes her fun to play\n\nI don't think I follow that point. \n\n> and she can used both as an aggressive bully or as a protective buffer during lane.\n\nAgain, it sounds like Lulu or Nami and is nothing that anyone wants to take away.\nQuite frankly, I would rather she can have that identity throughout the entire game,\ninstead of JUST the laning phase.\nOr do you prefer her to become a shieldbot later on, instead of that nice mix that can play aggressor or protector depending on the situation?","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2019-05-18T07:07:20.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of opinion there, and for the most part I can only say I simply disagree with almost all of it. But there's one point in particular that I want to address:\n\n> Or you shieldbomb your carry that just got jumped by an assassin?\n\nIn order for them to add a nuke to the shield, they'd have to nerf the shield. This is simple fact. Karma is not significantly underpowered so you can't just give her a massive buff without some form of nerf. If an assassin is jumping on your carry, MORE shielding is ALWAYS going to be better than a small amount of damage. Especially in the current environment where it's hard enough saving your carry from a diving assassin even with the stronger shield.

Do you seriously want _that_ to be her best option, that Lady Karma, mistress of defiance, protector of balance uses her most powerful spell in the most dire of situations to waste most of it's potential for slightly more shield?\nInstead of, I don't know, tether to protect the target with extra resistances, shield em and then retaliate towards the squishy aggressor? Like, you know, what _karma_ represents? Or at least to have this option at all game stages? At least have it compete with the _\"something happens, guess I will shield\"_ approach.\n\nBecause fuck me if someone seriously enjoys her options during laning phase but then fights for her being a shieldbot late. At least fight for a coherent kit that does either all the time, that I would respect. But even a pure shieldbot could be done way better than where Karma is right now.

I don't want to be pushed into one direction, because the game passed the 15min mark.

He's not like insanely OP, he just has no weakness. If only they hadn't overloaded his flay by ALSO adding on-hit damage to it.

Vlad has an entire kit that is built around surviving in close - his one 'ranged' spell is a heal, the rest of his kit is either survivability or damage for when you're close in. Ryze's kit is all synergistic(although many would argue Ryze is a badly designed champ since he's nearly impossible to balance), Lissandra's abilities are all really low range except her claw which is AN ENGAGE TOOL, etc. Their stats also tend to be more built around their role too. Karma wasn't. She was confused. Her kit had half one thing and half the other and the only way to make her work AT ALL was to play her as a battlemage even though literally half of her wasn't really designed for that. Maybe it would've been better for them to, when they redesigned her, go full battlemage and replace her q, up her base stats, and adjust her attack a bit... but they didn't. They focused on her q and shield and said 'this would make a great support champ if we tuned the shield more around that and adjusted her w to be a more backline spell'.\n\nNow that we're here... it sucks and I DO agree that it isn't ideal... but the problem is that we have two groups of people who want ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED THINGS for the same champ. If they revert her, all the people who like it the one way are in the exact same situation as y ou guys are now... are you really that cruel that you want others to suffer how you have? Would it not be better to encourage them to build a champ, from the ground up, to work the way you envision this? Give a new battlemage a shield bomb, a clothesline ability to tether with an ally, and some sort of other battle-mage style nuke spell for q, and some sort of fitting ult. Sure it won't be exactly the same... but it's the best middleground we can find.\n\nBecause finding a middle ground by just going halfway on Karma wouldn't work - if I like apples but hate oranges, and you like oranges but hate apples... giving us each half an orange and half an apple just leaves us both upset.

Its not a real solution.\n\nEdit: Oh sorry I forgot to answer your thresh question. A generalist champ still needs weaknesses. Every champ needs SOME weaknesses. A generalist who is GOOD at everything with no shortfalls Is bad design. You know how the saying goes 'jack of all trades, master of none' - well Thresh is a jack of all trades who is ALSO a master of most of them. A well-designed generalist generally needs to be mediocre at most of the things they do. Threst isn't. He does as much damage early game as a poke champ, he can save his carry better than almost anyone else with lantern, he can engage as well as anyone, he enables picks as well as anyone, he is durable(for a support), he is good both early and late game. If you want to be able to do everything, you need to be mediocre at most of the things you do to be balanced. Thresh is GOOD at everything he does AND he does virtually everything. The only thing he doesn't do is sustain(although he can shield to protect) and that isn't enough.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2019-05-28T15:19:31.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> She was confused.

We don't need an ability to have four use cases each with significantly distinct effects. Two is enough - and Karma, by nature, automatically has two use cases per ability. There's a point after which you're just overloading everything onto one ability and it makes the ability needlessly verbose, complex, and hard to balance. W's Use cases are fine how they are.\n\nIf you still seriously wonder what I like, I explained it before. I like Karma's current style, the way her abilities represent themselves currently with mantra enhancing one how it does. I like being able to choose 'do I get more shields on more people', 'do I need to survive myself', or 'do I want to pump out extra damage' and have the mantra effects for each be clear, defined, and fall within the sense of 'balance' that fits for her. I like that she has the option to invest heavily in defending the team if she wishes, rather than being forced between offense, or offense. I like the fact that her abilities, currently, are all elegant, with defined use cases that make sense. I enjoy the cohesive and coherent design of her kit where it, at least to me, makes perfect sense how it is.\n\nThe fortunate part of this is we can have MORE THAN ONE CHAMPION. We don't need to satisfy everyone with one champion. Which means the path of least resistance would be refining who Karma is now, and designing a new champion to fit the needs of the other people. We don't need to have only one combo on the menu, we can create a new combo on the menu that has the things you want, without destroying the combo that already exists. We could go the route of 'redesign Karma completely again and then introduce a new champion with all of the things Karma is now under a different name' - but that's twice as much work(since its essentially designing two champs), which means Riot is now not able to help someone else - and there are a lot of other champs that need help too, and a lot of potential other new champs that need help too.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2019-05-29T21:20:54.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There's a point after which you're just overloading everything onto one ability and it makes the ability needlessly verbose, complex, and hard to balance.\n\nFun fact: The more parts an ability has, the _easier_ it is to balance. More cranks and nudges, you know?\n\nBesides, I am in favour of keeping everything as simple as possible and let me tell you, reworking W is a nightmare, usually, because of its complex nature. But lets suppose there is a version of W that is slightly more complex but objectively better, would you really still be opposed to it?\n\nPut differently to ask again: Is the length of the description really the most defining factor for you?\nBecause you said repeatedly you are not a game designer... which explains probably why you have those unrealistic expectations that everything needs to be slick first and foremost.

We need Karma to not longer have that decision made by the equipment she has, but by the player and situation instead. If you are for anything at all, at least you should support that cause; make her mantras viable at all stages of the game.\n\n>  I like the fact that her abilities, currently, are all elegant, with defined use cases that make sense.

It already nearly happened a few months ago and the only reason why it wasn't shipped is because it wasn't good enough. Didn't change enough. The best you get a Rioter to say is _\"she is fine, but lacks X\"_, x being either cohesion, flavour, skill expression or uniqueness. Some even say \"a niche\". \n\nThat's not the only reason I am working with the community, but another good one; I want the Karma community to come together before another NeuroCat debacle happens; when the community struggles to give clear instructions what they all like together and want to be retained - so the Rioter just goes off and does their own thing. We need a common vision that pleases as many as possible.\n\nIf you just say, _\"nothing will ever please me\"_, then this Karma will be the last one you will ever like and we don't even need to consider you. There is no point... Thus, I summon you once again to join the conversation instead of excluding yourself. Change will come. The only chance you have at retaining as much as possible is joining forces and making yourself heard. Work with us.\n\n> Which means the path of least resistance would be refining who Karma is now, and designing a new champion to fit the needs of the other people.\n\nGood point. We could create a really coherent shieldmaster champion and make Karma the champion of duality again.

It's late-game team fights with an incoming minion wave (vertical minion waves make Karma have to aim spells from the side) or mega-tanks just tanking it (and not getting chunked). If there's a minion wave or mega-tank in your way, you simply can't do any damage to anything behind them. The only mages that suffer from this issue all have other abilities that allow them to reliably deal damage.

They removed the damage from RE (also well as the extra damage from RW) because they didn't want Karma to just throw out RE's in teamfights (\"Additionally, removing damage on R-E means we can up the ante on Gathering Fire's cooldown reduction without seeing Karma throw out a Mantra'd E every 6 seconds in clumpy team fights\" - from patch notes).
