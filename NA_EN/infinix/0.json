The findings are presented by the newly-released Global Methane Budget published Monday -- part of an effort by 100 international scientists to understand just how much methane is rising, and why.","url":"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/12/world/methane-gas-global-budget/","image":"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161212150856-rice-paddy-super-tease.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":16,"body":"No it&#039;s not coal, and neither is it oil, nor is it natural gas. It&#039;s animal agriculture. For those that care about climate change, it is imperative that we move towards Veganism or at least a vast reduction in meat consumption. Americans consume far beyond what can be passed as &quot;in moderation&quot;(  http://chartsbin.com/view/12730 ) and a &quot;balanced diet&quot; and the health consequences of it are very real (Obesity, Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes, etc.) on top of the eminent threat of climate change. \r\n\r\n&quot;But it&#039;s my personal choice to eat meat, why do you care!?!?!!?&quot;\r\n\r\nIt is also the personal choice of people to use coal/oil/natural gas as fuel which ends up contributing to global warming and pollution. That doesn&#039;t mean it should go unchecked, sometimes personal freedom needs to take a backseat when it comes to the survival of humanity. We already went through this once with the whole CFC fiasco which according to NASA, would have gotten really, really bad and made Earth pretty much uninhabitable for humans by the 2060s if CFCs had never been banned. https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/world_avoided.html And we&#039;re currently stretching this thought process at fossil fuels, there&#039;s no reason why it shouldn&#039;t be used against meat consumption as well.","replies":[]}
