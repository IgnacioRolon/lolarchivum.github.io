The weird noise can be due to the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) bar which automatically enabled in a recent Windows update.

Though, you may also see other issues as well like input delays.  To be sure, I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix this up.
