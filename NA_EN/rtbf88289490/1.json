Currently i am level 20 but the profile says i am level 30 and has history dating back to 2 years ago when i made this account only few days ago. When i click on match history, it says user not found. I would appreciate  if Riot can fix this and let me view my own profile with my own boards activity history instead of someone else who has my summoner name before me. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T20:53:07.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that's awkward right xD? I gave both of those accounts a little nudge, so you should be able to see your own posts and not the person who *used* to have this name.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf88289490","date":"2017-07-25T19:39:04.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks !
