They&#039;re not interchangeable. Atheists do not believe that a transient deity can exist. \r\nDarwinists simply believe in the proposed theory of life known as evolution. \r\n\r\nMost Atheists will believe in Evolution because it is the most logical from a scientific standpoint. That being said, not ALL Evolutionists are Atheist. Some may be Agnostic or fully Theistic. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I don&#039;t understand is why most religious groups have such a problem with evolution. Personally I believe is because it gives a completely alternate and opposing view of the beginning of life, which is backed by science and logic, and contradicts most Genesis stories. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?","replies":[]}
