Always happens, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-11T20:40:32.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We did change how Janna's tornadoes look in the most recent patch. We wanted to address both her base and skins with the release of Star Guardian and how that one was a bit more clear than her other tornadoes. As an example, base Janna now has two white orbs circling the top of the tornado for a bit more clarity. Forecast Janna is the same idea, just added a bit more color since it's a legendary skin! ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Spice POWAH","date":"2016-11-11T21:35:06.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, that makes sense. Thanks for replying! Could it maybe be a light blue though, the yellow just seems odd on that skin... It could just be that I'm used to the brownish tornado for so long though.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-14T18:42:19.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome! We did consider a few options, but felt this one a bit better, and didn't take a way from Frost Queen Janna. :) I'll be honest, it took me a bit to get used to it, too, since I've played her for so long, haha.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
