The second instance gave me a queue ban 20 minute and im not having it. It was a remake because my computer took time to load and the twitch jungle on my team Had no smite to begin with. Can you please look into This and if you reply soon, are you able to remove the queue timer ban?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-14T03:36:28.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't simply lift these LPQ's since they're designed to try and help players fix the underlying issues that caused the crash to begin with.
