At the very least, staying in plat or climbing up higher in the divisions and ranking is a good move at the moment.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2016-09-27T06:44:38.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any specific date on the end of the season?

Once you are in plat, not playing any ranked games for 28 days will result in your account being placed on \"ranked inactivity\" which means that you can lose LP due to decay, and even being demoted back to Gold I as a result.\n\nNow, I don't know how it will be this season, but I'm pretty sure it will be like last season, where you got rewards based on your ranking at the end of the season, not your peak ranking. This means that if you don't play ranked until the end of the season, and you get demoted back to Gold I, you will not get the plat border. So make sure you play at least 1 match every 28 days to make sure you don't decay due to inactivity. It doesn't matter if you lose, as you are much less likely to demote back to gold from losing than due to inactivity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-25T20:14:19.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To get the boarder, you need to finish in plat at the end of the season. Then when Riot distributes the ranked rewards, you will get the boarder along with all the other ranked rewards you qualified for.","replies":[]}]}
