When I turned my computer on the next day and played a couple of games to confirm what I saw, I noticed that my game seemed to sort of lag/frameskip [even though the numbers showed no sign of this], thus making animations show up late, or happen fast, almost like the game speed was at 1.5 instead of 1 (for instance I was ganked and the enemy jungler started moving to me faster than he was supposed to normally). I also noticed that Ekko’s Timewinder would disappear once it expanded in the animation, and the circles that appear to show the passive sometimes weren’t there either. Please someone help, I keep losing games because of this. \n\nEDIT: I tried restarting my computer a couple of times and it fixed the timewinder problem but the speed thing still happens","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-12-24T06:11:24.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible that your internet connection is being compromised? Try resetting your router, or perhaps unplugging it temporarily can fix it. I had this quite a while back, but it turned out it was a problem on Riot's end, and they fixed it pretty fast since everyone was experiencing it. Your internet is the only thing I can think of that could cause that issue.\n\nAre you currently on an ethernet connection, or are you wirelessly connected to the internet? If you are using wireless, I would recommend testing out an ethernet connection, since that will be much more stable, and might fix the issue or possibly even lower your ping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T00:16:08.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're mostly seeing delays in actions and missing actions or items in-game, I'm inclined to agree with FluffCow that this is likely tied to your connection to the League servers. In this case, I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local settings are in line before we take a look at this further.\n\nHit me up if you still see these issues after taking those steps.","replies":[]}]}
