Is when a post is made to THANK them for anything at this point. \r\n\r\nAll i ask is why? These rich monkeys are swimming in your money. Its not like Riot is gonna remember any of you suck ups when your account gets banned. So please quit the ass kissing. Its completely cringe worthy. They own the game, they own the skins and they damn sure wont show mercy to you for being a special little cookie that can make a post saying how wonderful they are. \r\n\r\nit doesn&#039;t do SHIT for YOU. \r\n\r\nLike you ever notice why Rioters go to posts that are not preaching about their &quot;mistakes&quot;? \r\nOh the typical excuse is, &quot;Because they dont like negative topics&quot; \r\nIM SORRY, a NEGATIVE topic is many of the times brought to ACTUALLY BETTER YOUR GAME.\r\n\r\nExample: The sad excuse for that &quot;ULTIMATE&quot; MF skin, and before you say &quot;But GD always CRIES&quot; NO! \r\nThere&#039;s a difference between crying, and proving a fucking point. This skin is no where near the quality of an ULTIMATE and yet\r\nRiot will push it out anyway, why?  because ITS THEIR GAME! They don&#039;t give a flying fuck about you or any of us. \r\n\r\nRIOT has an **AGENDA** against these boards, which is why they favored those ugly Reddit forums from the beginning. Now they probably don&#039;t care about Reddit as much, because they&#039;ll find something else other than these boards at the very least. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m just saying don&#039;t give this company any positive attention, simple because they don&#039;t deserve it, if they cant even bother to reply to majority of the topics on these forums that have LEGIT well constructive thoughts or concerns. \r\n\r\nLook at &quot;concepts &amp; creations&quot;, so many awesome concepts for forgotten champions that could use a skin, yet any riot posts? NOPE \r\n\r\nGD got 1 Riot member to post, guess why? OH, because someone made a post THANKING them for their presence on their own forums?!? WELL THAT&#039;S AN ACHIEVEMENT GJ!! \r\n\r\nThank you for showing up to your own forums!\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t kiss up to this fucking company, they will eventually fuck up your favorite thing about this game, regardless if its your favorite champion, or item, etc.... then come onto these forums when its convenient for them to give a shit here.","replies":[]}
