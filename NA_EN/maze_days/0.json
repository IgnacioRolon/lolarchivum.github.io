We only recently found out that we wouldn't of been able to get me the skin this way and while I'm bummed about not being able to get it I feel worse because they've all wasted their money. If possible, I ask on their behalf for a refund of their gifts and the locking of the skins they gave me if at all possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T15:40:13.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, refunding gifts is not something that's currently a provided feature.  It was really nice of your friends to get together for this amazing cause; though, it's a bummer finding out that Human Ryze isn't available through it.  If it may help for any future campaigns, we have a [Legacy and Limited](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins) skins guide that will provide information on what skins can be found or no longer available.
