This causes people to become stuck in these rankings as the player bases skill level is extremely skewed, and entering a match-making queue seems almost like gambling.\n\nThere is still the point that someone is bad, but can they still be blamed for being put into a division that doesn&#039;t match their skill level?\n\nI see these discretion&#039;s far less in high divisions because player&#039;s had to work their asses off in order to get where they were (or just got pushed through by sheer luck) and the general skill level of player&#039;s is much more balanced than that of lower ranks. \n\nNow I&#039;m not necessarily sure if there is a solution, I just wanted to share my opinion on this with all the other players who are stuck in these divisions and get everyone else&#039;s take on the issue as well.\n\nEdit: Exhibit A: https://imgur.com/a/YwCWI \n\nExplain how I belong with these players. The logic of saying \"If you can't climb out then you belong where you are\" makes no sense whatsoever. So you're saying I should be able to win 1v5's and 1v4 ranked games when I have absolute feeders. I'm stuck in Gold, and the players clearly haven't been filtered out of this division. Note: Malphite's kills are due to me ganking him consistently. But how am I supposed to carry that, look at their KDA ratio's and how low their %'s are.","replies":[]}
