The opposite situation is also true; you can be the challenger smurf and be doing absolutely insane things and yet lose because of your team. At the end of the day, it all comes down to the skill level of your teammates. The sad thing is that this season especially, it seems like the skill level matching is way out of control.

The minimum borderline you need to achieve to \"guarantee\" a win has increased quite a lot in this season, compared to season 5. The same is true for the opposite side as well. You can have a very low threshold as your performance rating, and still win, which again is sad. That's why you see so many players getting in higher elo, without really performing well and some of them have win rates below 50%, which is really weird to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2018-06-26T16:52:17.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> In season 5, for example, since the skill level matching difference wasn't that big, you knew that there was a borderline point that if you played above that, you could win\n\nSorry, but that's straight up false, I've had my shares of games in which I played terribly and won and games in which I really did awesome and lost and this since season 4. \n\n> The argument I see a lot of people say is that \"in order to win, you need to be just good enough to not drag your team down\"\n\nNoone has ever said that. That's what you wanted to understand, not what they said. Noone is ever going to tell you \"you have to do X in order to win 100% of your games\". Because that would be a lie.\n\nWhat you see a lot of people say is that : \"in order to CLIMB (aka win slighly more than 50% of your games), you need to be just good enough to not drag your team down\". \n\nAnd that's true. Just do your best every game and if you consistently outperform both your team and your opponents, you'll climb. \n\n**If you dont consistently outperform both your team and your opponents, then, guess what, it just means that you current skill level is accurately representated by your rank and that you do not deserve to climb until you make some improvements in your way of playing.**\n\nSkill expression is : doing your best in unwinnable games (and sometimes you even get rewarded by turning the tide, even if it's exceptionnal), securing the unlosable games (I've had my shares of games in which we had a 10k gold lead and lost), and winning most of the games in which you actually matters. \n\nSo, no playing great do not entitle you to a win, playing badly do not garantee a lose, but it changes the odds of victory or defeat, think of it as a dice game. You can't control the dices, but If you have a great game, you can pick 1,2,3,4 as winning sides of the dice roll. If you play badly, only 1 and 2 will be winning sides.","replies":[{"poster":"Kalistarc","date":"2018-06-27T13:39:44.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started at season 5 and played a lot in season 6, therefore I can compare my experience between seasons. I remember in season 6 that I was playing a lot of Viktor mid and consistently outperforming my enemy laner in every aspect; laning advantage and team assisting. That's why I had a crushing 68% win rate on my Viktor. I was not overperforming, I was just performing better than my enemy laner, and I was able to translate that advantage into team advantages and, in the end, wins. \n\nGuess how everything has changed this season. I moved away from mid lane, since Viktor is gutted and I'm not really good at any other mid laners. I moved to the jungle, playing Graves for the most part. Guess what. I still crush my enemy jungler. More map presence through counter jungling, more csing and outscaling. The thing is, in most games, my lanes often lose without jungle interaction. That means that, we could take both junglers out of the game, and my team would most likely lose. Put the junglers in, and we have a situation that my team loses the 4v4 and I win the 1v1. And that's how it is, it is a 1v1 in the jungle, because I manage to isolate and over take the enemy jungler to the point they can't really assist their team.\nThe problem is that I can only do so much to assist ALL my losing lanes. I even tried to change up my playstyle by sacrifising some of my jungle pressure to try and affect lanes and even when I would get quite a lot of successful ganks to help my laners, they would still get solo killed a bit later.\n\nDo you see the difference between the two seasons? In season 6, my good play was often rewarded by a victory. Now, my good play doesn't make much of a difference. If matchmaking screws you by giving you the monkey teammates, you pretty much need a miracle performance if you want to win. And that's a problem of matchmaking, for the most part. It's not as much about the snowball or what ever else.\n\n\n\nFor your second point, what is the difference between winning and climbing? Winning is a necessiy to climb, therefore, if you want to climb, you must win, so my point is correct. Also, you don't need to win more than 50% of your games to climb. My friend started at silver 4 this season, and with a 48% win rate is at gold 5 right now. \n\nA viable strategy to win is to do your best at every single game. Duh. That's not enough , though. This season, you are not rewarded for playing well as much as you should. This season, apart from Graves jungle, I started playing a lot of Janna, because I wanted to have a slightly more relaxed role. Out of the almost 160 games I played, I only lost my lane in about 10 games. In almost 150 out of the 160 games, we would always end the laning phase by having a gold and XP lead on my ADC, gold and xp lead on myself, over the enemy bot lane, quite often we would take the first tower as well, and then rotate to try and take mid and top tower. \nDespite all that, I only managed to get a 62% win rate on my Janna over those 160 games, and I don't think I was the reason for getting so many losses. Seeing how I was doing \"well\" for the role I had to play in the game, I was not rewarded the amount I deserved. That's because I would get a lot of incompetent teammates, sometimes even my ADC would not be able to perform, even with all the lead I would provide them.\n\n\nWhat most people want is that they want to be rewarded for their good performance. Your reference to the dice game is exactly proving what I said at the start. In season 5, you would have the regular dice game; whatever you roll, you get. This season, it feels like you have a 50% chance of getting 1, 30% of getting 2, and only 1% chance of getting a 6, and all that because the matchmaking is busted. It delibirately matches bad performing players with good performing players so that the teams get the 50-50 chance of winning. And that's not right. The good player should not get the burden of not only doing well for themselves, but also doing well for his teammates, and the bad player should not be just carrying a carry train to victories.","replies":[{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2018-06-27T14:22:14.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I started at season 5 and played a lot in season 6, therefore I can compare my experience between seasons.

And you didnt adapt, I can't blame you for that, I needed a good 60 games to understand what changed and how to stop losing in the begining of this season, playing veigar only. Now I'm back on the good trail to climb again I can assure you that now is no different than in s5, I keep losing games in which I do great, and so i did in s5, and I keep winning some games in which I was terrible, exactly like in s5. \n\n> Put the junglers in, and we have a situation that my team loses the 4v4 and I win the 1v1.

Winning is a necessiy to climb, therefore, if you want to climb, you must win, so my point is correct.\n\nIntellectual dishonesty. The point is the games you can't win because of your teammates are actually irrevelant and skill expression still dictates if you climb or if you do not. \n\n> A viable strategy to win is to do your best at every single game. Duh. That's not enough\n\nThis has never been enough. Never. \n\n> This season, you are not rewarded for playing well as much as you should. \n\nThis is your own opinion, I'm personnaly happy with the way it is now. I often feel i'm impactful, spoiler : getting a lot of kills doesnt mean you are impactfull. \n\n>  I only lost my lane in about 10 games.\n\nWell, if you think this game should be dictated by laning phase only, no wonder you are unhappy. You should consider switching game.\n\n>  I only managed to get a 62% win rate on my Janna over those 160 games\n\n62% winrate when not smurfing is actually huge.\n\n>  I was not rewarded the amount I deserved\n\nYou should really switch to a 1v1 game :)\n\n> It delibirately matches bad performing players with good performing players so that the teams get the 50-50 chance of winning. And that's not right.\n\nThat's also false, next time do not hesitate to watch the history of your bad performing teammate, you'll see they probably just had a bad game and were performing average on their other games. \n\nRemember that if you perform badly 1 game out of 5 I feels low for you. But if you give everyone a free pass to perform badly 1 game out of 5 it translates to 1 teammate each game who will perform badly.","replies":[{"poster":"Kalistarc","date":"2018-06-27T17:00:38.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not a problem of adaptation, I have hit the maximum rank this season at Plat 3 so far, and I can go higher, if I find time to play. I know I can adapt to situations, in or out of the game. The thing is that the game changed for the worse, in terms of matchmaking and how much you need to depend on your team doing well, alongside you. That's what I'm pointing out. I'm still on a 58% win rate this season, but it should have been more, because I have vastly improved my skill and I've also bought a new pc, mouse and keyboard which are all assisting me way too much when optimizing my game.\n\n\nThe 4v4 point, the thing is that my team loses the 4v4 more than 50% of the time, though. It's closer to something like 70%, which isn't right.\n\n\nTo the point of being impactful. I know kills isn't everything, if anything, at it stands right now, it's not as important. I prefer shoving my enemy out of lane, or stealing a couple of enemy camps, rather than taking a chance of kill an enemy laner, for example. It's all about tempo, map pressure and gold / xp difference and the safest ways you can utilize to gain these is the best way to win. \n\n\nI'm not saying that the game should be dictated by laning phase only, but that's how the game state is right now. One laner stomps the enemy laner, they take the first tower and then it's gg, because they are overfed and there's nothing you can do, really. In my case, though, somehow, we stomp bot lane, but the rest of the map is already hard lost, and there isn't much I can do to stop. I can't really leave my lane to try and assist my team and leave my ADC lane by themselves. Whenever I see opportunities to leave my ADC to lane for themselves (big lead, tower taken, enemies backed), then I take initiative to gank, or scout the enemy jungle, but again, that's not enough, but it should.\n\nWhen laning phase is over, well, like it or not, the game is almost always decided. The team that's ahead will usually win, because they got ahead by being more skilled, which will carry over the mid game as well. Therefore, there's only so much you can do, regardless of your own laning performance, to salvage games where your team is vastyle both outskilled and outpaced. And that's wrong, because I feel like all my good laning phase work just doesn't matter; actually, it's a coinflip, or even more accurately, a 40-60 chance of my good work actually leading us to victory. I know I'm performing well in cases outside laning phase, I know how to generally move correctly in the map to apply pressure, or to take towers in certain situations etc. It's just matchmaking.\n\nI tried to play different roles as well, changing from Janna, to Graves, even tried Shen top, which I played a lot in season 7 to good results (60% win rate over 30 games or something), but it just seems like no matter where I go, there are high chances that it will be my team that has the inferior players. The classic example is the first blood percentage. Whenever I see first blood and I'm not involved in it, it's almost certainly to the enemy team, regardless of the role I'm playing, and that's just wrong. \n\n\nNo, I don't want to switch to a 1v1 game, because I don't think that a 5v5 game should rely so much on team performance, especially when there are solo elements in the game. I mean, most of the early game is played as a solo game for the big part. Even if it is supposed to rely so much on teamwork, then MAKE THE FUCKING MATCHMAKING GOOD. How am I supposed to play Janna with a Caitlyn ADC which is supposed to be aggressive, but they miss 50% of the cs, do not play their champion the way it's supposed to be played etc? That's just wrong. And it's not fucking silver elo where you can justify the lack of skill, it's mid platinum. It's the elo where you at least expect your fellow players to know the basic functions of their champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2018-06-28T08:34:25.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The 4v4 point, the thing is that my team loses the 4v4 more than 50% of the time, though.

If do great every game you can expect a 60% winrate in a 5v5 game. (Let's assume each of you is responsible for 20% of the victory, since you are 5, performing average gives you 10% victory chance per player :\n\nplayer 1 : 10%\nplayer 2 : 10%\nplayer 3 : 10%\nplayer 4 : 10%\nplayer 5 : 10%\n\nSums up to 50%.\n\nIf you do great you have done 20% of you 20% so your winrate goes up to 60% :\n\nplayer 1 : 10%\nplayer 2 : 10%\nplayer 3 : 10%\nplayer 4 : 10%\nplayer 5 : 20%\n\n(that's average, a game would more likely look like that :\n\nplayer 1 : 17%\nplayer 2 : 3%\nplayer 3 : 12%\nplayer 4 : 8%\nplayer 5 : 10%\n\nI'm not talking about the flat skill or level of your teammates, but how they managed to handle this particular game you are playing.\n\nNow the people hard carrying manage to count for 2 to 3 teammates. I saw some true solo carry, I actually solo carried some games when smurfing with up to 97% kill participation in 31 kills. I litterally made every kill but one happen.\n\n> Even if it is supposed to rely so much on teamwork, then MAKE THE FUCKING MATCHMAKING GOOD.\n\nActually matchmaking is the best it could be.\n\nWhenever you see an ally underperforming check his history, there's a 90% chance he did great or average during his lasts games.\n\nThe problem is not matchmaking, it's people.\n\nPeople playing when drunk, high or **tired**, this will drag their performances down. But how an algorithm could ever guess that ? And really, if I avoid playing when tired I can get a raw +15% winrate overall. Actually in s6 when I climbed d3 on my main, I had a smurf on which I would play when tired, and only play on my main while well rested. \nThe smurf never went past plat 4 and was hardstuck there, the main ended d3 and I was still climbing when the season ended (then stopped playing nearly totaly in s7).\n\nPeople playing offrole, not because they are autofilled, but because they just wanted to switch roles.\n\nPeople playing duo, but not knowing how to play duo (actually I think this could be improved by making soloQ TRUE soloQ, so i'll give you this one)\n\nPeople playing a new champion, or a champion they are not familiar with (might be because their mains are banned, but most of the time when I have an underperforming teammate, I watch his history, see they are tryndamere top main otp, but they picked quinn top they have played 2 times in the last 2 seasons for whatever reason).\n\nPeople flamming. Tilt is one of the best weapon against your own team. I've seen people doing badly completely stop playing despite the fact the rest of the team was way ahead because they were flammed by those doing gret.\n\nsmurfs, how is the matchmaking going to guess my real elo until I reach it with my smurf ?

That 3/8 Skarner shouldn’t have been rage-farming Krugs while Baron was up.\n\nIf you play an amazing game and still lose, then forget the match outcome and feel good about it.  You did well.  If you go 20/7/15 every game, you will climb.

You’re implying that once enough players stop queueing bot as a primary role, almost everyone else who wants to climb should stop queueing bot as a secondary to ensure they get their primary.  That snowballs the problem, exposes climbers to the variance of autofilled bottom on their team, and is against the competitive teamplay mentality we should hope to foster.\n\nAnd it’s not just secondary players getting hurt.  QTPie was taken into custody following an intense gun battle with the Diamond 1 Police; Doublelift is hardstuck Masters.\n\nI’ve queued mid-bot or bot-mid since I started playing.  I occasionally got my secondary role and did my best.  Then, suddenly, this happened.  I couldn’t believe it until I was six or seven games in.  Why can’t Riot just make changes to ensure a big enough playerbase bottom?\n\nAs for climbing out of Silver, I appreciate your confidence in my abilities, but I know I’m just average and would need substantial improvement in other areas.  \n\n-Fundamentals: I play too few games, tilt too easily, choke in teamfights, fail to ward on cooldown, often fail to itemize correctly, and occasionally feed.  \n-Mechanics: I often flub important skillshots or flash-combos, regularly miss free minions, lose track of my mouse or the teamfight, and do not move then buy after recalling.\n-Laning: I have not even memorized the process of establishing land control, entering trading stance, establishing vision, tracking my jungler, managing mana, and playing within pockets, much less applied it often.\n-Mid-Game: A mystery.  Push?  Roam?  Invade?  Herald?  Dragon?  Skirmish?  I couldn’t tell you how, when, or why to do any of these things other than maybe quoting Leaguecraft 101.\n-Late-Game: Another mystery.  Rotate?  Splitpush?  Group?  Baron?  Elder?  Teamfight?  Tempo?  Objective timers?\n\nIt doesn’t matter which role or champion I play.

The proof is in the pudding. People wanted this. LCS has more attention than ever and marksmen are still played bot _nearly_ 60% of time (according to Phreak.) Now obviously, you wouldn't be wrong for blaming Riot, but again, it's only this way because that's what the people were asking for. Did you forget when people were saying: \n\n1.) **\"Games are too long.\" ** -->  They're shorter now.\n\n2.) **\"The better player should win instead of the better team.\" **--->  How is that possible if they can't snowball? Are smurfs not better players?\n\n3.) **\"Marksmen are too important,\"** -->  Now they're not even necessary. From 100% to barely 60%.\n\n4.) **\"It was so much better in s1,\"** --->  There were no defined roles in s1 and most adc weren't mainstream until the marksmen update in s5. \n\n5.) **\"shields are taking engage out of the meta.\"**  --->  They're nerfed now.\n\nIn conclusion, it _DOES_ matter what role you play. Climbing actually does require pushing aspects of your game higher and that just wont happen if you don't master things on the same level as a gold. If you're worthy of playing with higher players in ranked, then you have to prove yourself by holding your own vs them in silver. I've already told you how to do that... It's not a smart or dumb thing. If you muddy yourself learning 6 champions and 2 roles, then you're gonna move slower than the guy mastering one champion and 2 roles.

That's why only 4 got buffed and all those buffs will do is make the popular critical picks better while picks like:  \n{{champion:96}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} will continue to be useless due to their lack of wave clear/ trade potential in the lane phase. \n\nHonestly, I am amazed you went this long maining mid and having your way because most people are lucky to get it 6/10 times.

The minority/ majority thing is already established.\n\nAnother fact you might want to know is that stormrazor _IS_ a crit item and Varus is _NOT_ a critical marksman.

For example: \n\nHeimerdinger bot is considered very strong, yet he is a tier beneath Xayah, Jinx, and Vayne. At the same time, Kaisa in a much higher tier than all of them, yet they all have higher win rates than Kaisa. We can take it a step further mixing in Trist and Cait...

It delays full build by thousands of gold and offers little value at three items.  So, its builders, who had to struggle through a weak laning phase and farm through the mid-game, don’t even spoke at three items.  They need four.  The game is likely over or decided by then.\n\nIf you have a point about the tier list, then just state it.","replies":[{"poster":"Caretaker Jack","date":"2018-06-29T07:09:10.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ifneth,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vLtLsAFK,comment-id=000000010000000100000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-06-28T12:15:18.070+0000)\n>\n> It’s not established.

Though I have noticed the comments in phylol's videos leaning with the majority as well.\n\nConclusion: \n\n*  People hate the snowballing, but hardly anyone is worried about the marksmen because they were overpowered. (Also explains not many being buffed. Low demand.)\n*  Stormrazor is VERY popular, so its safe to say it isn't awful.\n*  You originally asked me a question... I chose to answer it. That's it.\n*  People on youtube VERY openly show disapproval of things they disagree with.

You’re implying that once enough players stop queueing bot as a primary role, almost everyone else who wants to climb should stop queueing bot as a secondary to ensure they get their primary.  That snowballs the problem, exposes climbers to the variance of autofilled bottom on their team, and is against the competitive teamplay mentality we should hope to foster.\n> \n> And it’s not just secondary players getting hurt.  QTPie was taken into custody following an intense gun battle with the Diamond 1 Police; Doublelift is hardstuck Masters.\n> \n> I’ve queued mid-bot or bot-mid since I started playing.  I occasionally got my secondary role and did my best.  Then, suddenly, this happened.  I couldn’t believe it until I was six or seven games in.  Why can’t Riot just make changes to ensure a big enough playerbase bottom?\n> \n> As for climbing out of Silver, I appreciate your confidence in my abilities, but I know I’m just average and would need substantial improvement in other areas.  \n> \n> -Fundamentals: I play too few games, tilt too easily, choke in teamfights, fail to ward on cooldown, often fail to itemize correctly, and occasionally feed.  \n> -Mechanics: I often flub important skillshots or flash-combos, regularly miss free minions, lose track of my mouse or the teamfight, and do not move then buy after recalling.\n> -Laning: I have not even memorized the process of establishing land control, entering trading stance, establishing vision, tracking my jungler, managing mana, and playing within pockets, much less applied it often.\n> -Mid-Game: A mystery.  Push?  Roam?  Invade?  Herald?  Dragon?  Skirmish?  I couldn’t tell you how, when, or why to do any of these things other than maybe quoting Leaguecraft 101.\n> -Late-Game: Another mystery.  Rotate?  Splitpush?  Group?  Baron?  Elder?  Teamfight?  Tempo?  Objective timers?\n> \n> It doesn’t matter which role or champion I play.  Competing at a Gold level would require pushing all these aspects of my play higher.  I’ve gotten close once (1 game from Gold promos) but an unlucky losing streak hurt my mentality so badly that I’ve never really recovered.  Any help is much appreciated!\n\nWhat I personally recommend is watching games of high elo players and seeing how they deal with their ranked games.\n\nFor example, me being a Talon main, I watch Yamikaze so I can learn macro, how to tell where the enemy JG is, what to do in certain situations.\n\nI would also highly recommend one-tricking a champion (Others may disagree). Being able to play a champion and know their limits and what the most they can do is an amazing tool.\n\nAnd to deal with tilt, just mute people. It let's you think so much clearer without the constant, \"wtf ur bad\".\n\nAnd to respond to the OP and for many others who have the issue of thinking that they have no control over their games, take a break and come back with a more positive mentality. Trolls are inevitable, yes, but you shouldn't be getting them 9/10 games. All of us have to deal with them, you just have to make sure you win the games that don't have trolls, or hard-carry the ones that do.

Too heavy. My last game (admittedly I didn't do spectacular) my yi was just so immensely heavy that every single time we got a break (aced enemy team, killed key enemies), he just went and died.
