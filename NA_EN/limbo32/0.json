I dont wanna sound greedy or something but I feel like it didnt calculate the BE correctly in the loot tab after I added them. Also I didn't get any mystery skin shards as far as I saw it. I did all the quests, and I think I also bought a couple pages with RP back then.\n\nThanks in advance :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-09T21:37:53.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, but don't see any issues.  You did get a lot of Greater runes in the past, and it successfully converted to BE within your capsules.  Your IP balance was pretty low, so most of your conversion was from the rune refunds.\n\nThe Rune Pages you unlocked were with IP, so they would be converted into your BE capsule instead of skins.  The skins were only for pages unlocked with RP.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"UCANTPAUSEITMOM","date":"2017-11-10T13:15:16.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer :)\n\nAlright, well I'm not 100 % sure whether I bought pages for RP, doesn't really matter now anyways since I couldn't proof it :D\nYes my IP balance was pretty low because I kept buying champion shards and disenchanted them for BE.\n\nWell I guess everything is alright then.\n\nThank you very much!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ermîn","date":"2017-11-08T22:29:12.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=jHVptWeE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-08T22:14:16.572+0000)\n>\n> Hey there, I looked into this for you but was unable to locate a skin mission.
