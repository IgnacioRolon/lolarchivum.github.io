In 2009  they sought to create a company that continuously improves on an already released game, instead of commencing development on a new one.  And they have delivered in champions, Items, (on both sides of enjoyment and WTF riot) however, I am here to talk about something that has been IN the game since 2009, gotten NO love, and is still as buggy and broken as it was nearly a decade ago..** Death Recap **-  I mean I cannot be the only player that when he dies and sees &quot;Death Recap&quot; in a game - checks it to see who is doing what type of damage so if i need to build mitigation against that type -  Be it Armor, Magic Resist, both.. \n\nHowever Either True dmg is being given away in the mail with free samples of Tide by Noxus, or Riot needs to actually sit down and fix this death recap - or remove it completely and when you die just the words  &quot;Guess who killed you, we&#039;re not tellin&quot;  can come up on the screen. \n\nBecause too often , much too often for a 10 year old game, you see things like  - **_(These images were taken from Google - and not my own personal experience, however i have seen much the same in my own death recaps.) _**\nhttp://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1432542711/LeagueWhatKillSelf3.jpg\n\nor Warwick really decides to go to pound town\n\nhttp://apollo-pbe-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1417483423314/Screen02.png\n\nBut its not just the champions as we all know.  the Creeps tend to get upset now and then too, and call out the Hero of the Hour  &quot;Purple Melee Minon&quot; \nhttp://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1438823810/MinionDamage.jpg\n\n\nOk but seriously - no joke -  the death recap is meant to be useful information on how you died, so if you desire to adjust a build accordingly you can -  in its current stand the death recap is good for at best a laugh and at worst and string of curses.  Because if these death recaps are &quot;correct&quot;  someone needs to take a serious look at Warwirk and Rammus  (haha)  \n\nIts time for you to actually give us a death recap - and not just a odd mix of numbers done to you in .09 seconds. \n\nThank you for your time\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Poop Johnson","date":"2018-08-10T21:36:33.230+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is that this game is held together with twine and superglue and the death recap is so deeply embedded that fixing it would cause so many more issues then it's worth.
