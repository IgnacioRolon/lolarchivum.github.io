This Thread is about a few things but they are pretty much the same group of issues.\n\nThe C&amp;C board is really neat. I like it and see really cool things on it all the time, however there is a lot of not cool things I see on it even more frequently. Those things include\n\n~~1.) People Advertising their &quot;MLG Clickbait 1v5 Fiora, Must see giveaway&quot; videos on here. There is a perhaps more lax moderation on the part of the Rioters for this corner of the Boards, or maybe its just not a problem worth solving to them. But it peeves me to no end. Sure, you &quot;created&quot; a video and you&#039;re sharing it with the community but its not what this is here for. This is here for you to share what you think is for the game. This is for people who want to try and add to the game not make money off it. A simple solution, if Riot wants to open the floodgates on all that stuff either allow it in Art, where all the Cosplay, Sculptures, and other &quot;creations&quot; go, or just make a separate place to put it so that C&amp;C is less of a joke~~\n\nEdit: Apparently this is a wrong opinion, but it does still bother me to see stream ads and YouTube videos buying good work.\n\n2.) Quality Control. Here on the Boards, we are a forum. A large open space for anyone to speak their mind and be heard by those who will listen. we in C&amp;C have the fortunate blessing of being the location that good ideas go to Flourish and bloom, free of all the griping, whining, advertising, and Artwork to dilute the waters. Its a bit of a mess here unfortunately and often the good ideas end up buried under a mountain of unplanned, hastily constructed, irrational...trash. SOOOOO many good ideas come here half completed, and because of this, the frustration of constantly having your own ideas shot down, having trouble seeing other peoples visions, and having trouble getting to people who will listen makes the community difficult and unenjoyable. I wish with all my heart I could just see every thread about a new champion Idea, balance suggestion, addition to Queue functionality, stat calculation tweaks after only 30 minutes more thought or commitment to the idea about how it would work, what it would do, why its good for the game. Just making higher quality things that will be more attractive to onlookers and make us a bit more useful. Earlier today I read about a really neat idea for a champion. I could tell the person went &quot;Oh this would be so neat, a champion who did This, This, and this.&quot; but when it came to explaining it and making a thread to get feedback they rushed and it sounded poorly thought and made the original idea seem really unattractive.\n\n3.) Community togetherness. I think Memes &amp; Games is honestly the best example of what each sub-directory. Its fun, their are pseudo leaders of the community, people actually have fun and it lives up to what you would expect to get when you go there. Memes and Games. I would like to see the same kind of continuous feedback and contribution to each other here. When someone makes a post, the community should help them. They shouldn&#039;t slander them or ignore them, they should actually help, Suggest, improve the original idea. Now this goes hand in hand with Quality Control. No one wants to filter through line upon line of garbage that is useless and unenjoyable to read. If you can&#039;t get excited about someone&#039;s concepts, you don&#039;t want to contribute. So, once posts start to get cleaner, smarter, prettier, and funner; we should also strive to be nicer, more helpful, and more involved.\n\n4.) Usefulness. We are C&amp;C, we should be proud to be such a thing, we should want to be the guy who gave the idea for the latest skin line, or the latest champion, suggested the latest design for a minigame. We all want to be that guy.We have no chance to become that guy, or even the guy who has cool ideas that everyone likes if no one respects us enough to come and read our posts. We should strive to create better, more indepth, more accurate content so in the morning everyone gets on the boards and says, I wonder what wonderful ideas C&amp;C had last night, including any stumped rioters.\n\nIf you&#039;ve read this far you obviously care to improve our niche in the community. Here is to you who have ideas and want to share them. Good luck in the future and enjoy better content. feel free to give your opinions and hopefully you&#039;ve got suggestions about making us better as a whole.","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2016-08-18T13:06:59.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully agree with you on everything except point 1.\n\nC&C used to be my goto sub-board back in the day and I used to be super excited to create champion concepts. I was so into it that I was writing long detailed lore for them that was so engaging that another person offered to team up with me on champion design. Together we tossed ideas back and fourth and he helped me tune out two additional champions concepts, and I offered feedback on a bunch of his. He even spent the time and effort to create hand drawn animations to show off the kit for one of my concepts, and the ult for another.\n\nHowever Champion design died for me when I noticed that C&C as a community was no longer focused on quality, but rather quantity in that I was starting to only see quickly thrown together champions ideas with kits that not much thought was put into other than, \"It would be so cool if he could do this!\"\n\nIt took me three months of constant thought, working and reworking the kit, and figuring out where they belonged in League of legends lore, before I published my first concept on the forums. Now you see concepts that people spend barely a couple hours on.\n\nEventually I wasn't able to continue champion design and the partnership I had with another forum member crumbled apart. It really sinks my heart when I think about it.\n\nBut on your first point there, Riot did state this was the place to put any videos you made so that's kinda Riots fault there.","replies":[{"poster":"Azeranth","date":"2016-08-18T18:50:22.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, well thats my fault.

The Concepts and Creations board IS for fan art, cosplay, sculpture, and other, frankly awesome, creations go.  The sidebar makes it quite clear:\n\n>**Culture**\n\n>Think you've got a great new skin or champ idea up your sleeve? Baked a sweet League-theme cake? Drawn a sublime masterpiece you'd like to share with others? Whatever you've cooked up, Concepts & Creations is the place to share and get feedback on your latest League creations and concepts.\n\nAnd for the Story, Art & Sound board, it says:\n\n>**_DO NOT_** post fan art, fan-fiction, concepts, or roleplaying discussions\n\nYour call to action to be a better, more supportive, community, however - I'm a big fan of, no matter the setting :D\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n(Interesting silver lining - I just found a typo in the sidebar text.  Very embarassing.  I'll get that fixed in the morning!  \\*shame\\*)\n[edit] Fixed the typo in the sidebar.

Its simple, its effective, it sounds like she would make both an effective AA based JG and an effective burst top lane duelist that centers mainly on in and out/prolonged fights.\n\nHer Q, Brilliant I love it. At first I didn't quite like it and the Rend passive sounds slightly strong, but again it is only effective in long fights so that is good because that is how she feels to be played. The Q seems very much like a perfectly outlined first ability to get, regardless of position. I like that it has a large amount of utility and its a good gank tool. I don't like that its True Damage, I would suggest Magic damage like on Teemo. The Fury cost and High cool down makes it seemed balance but also an effective tool because of its passive making it still feel useful. I suggest take the AD scaling off her Active, move it to the passive as a Bleed effect (rename from Rend) and make the bonus AD go away while Q is on CD.\n\nHer W, Its a lot like Ahri ult, give it a medium AP scaling and it feels pretty good. A nice dueling tool but also perhaps makes her more slippery in a teamfight or if caught out. This synergies well with her Q, as it helps her to stick to a target once she is on top of them.\n\nI don't like her E, at all. It feels terrible, complicated and out of place in the rest of her kit. I think her E would be better as a toggle as described below:\n\n> Toggle while out of Combat.\n\n> Vex Meditates briefly to calm herself, allowing her to recover from her last fight.\n\n>Vex's Health regeneration is reduced by an effectiveness of 50/55/60/70/75% While toggled off giving her bonus Lifesteal. (Relentless Rage)\nVex's Health regeneration is increased to normal while in combat, and doubled while out of combat. Her Bonus MR and Armor, including that gained from her passive is increased by 30/35/40/45/50% She is also immune to Armor shred while active. (Channeled Rage)\n\n>While **Channeled Rage** is active, Vex loses 2 Fury per second, doubled while not in combat. If she reaches 0 Fury, Her E toggles to **Relentless Rage** and can not be toggled again for 5 seconds.\n\nThe purpose of this different E gives her simpler playstyle, makes her more reliable, and allows her to both adapt to enemies while providing a good crutch that can be a help or a hindrance situationaly. Vex will be more encouraged to remain at low health and juke it out full force or commit to the retreat and increase her chances of escape. It rewards players with greater awareness of their game situation and their enemy while also giving superior sustain and safety between camps or in lane.\n\nHer Ult, feels neglected as far as thought goes and I do not believe i fits her playstyle that her Q,W and my suggestion for E, would promote. I really have no idea for her ult either but i like the Idea of a low cool down fight to fight Ult that is up almost every fight but can probably be used only once. I suggest something that Crushes down stats on enemy champs making them far weaker similar to what Trundle does. It wouldn't be a stat steal but a very effective resistance crusher that would make her able to fight tanks and juggernauts. She would still have all the weaknesses against mobile squishy carries but would be able to easily stomp out large immobile tanky champions. I have no cvlear Idea but off the top of my head I tihnk this would be good:\n\n>Highest Honor; single Targeted ability\n\n>Vex calls back to her days under the Master, and challenges an opponent to single combat.\n\n>Both targets become immune to all damage from sources that are not each other and have their health regeneration reduced to 0. \nVex's E instantly is set to **Relentless Rage**\nThe targets Armor and MR are reduced by 30/45/60/% and Vex's bonus stats from her passive are Doubled. When Vex or the target are slain the victor has their stats returned to normal, however Vex's Passive will remain doubled if victorious for 10/16/24 seconds.\nIf Vex is Victorious, Her maximum Rage is increased by 5, This effect stacks up to 20 times (A potential max Fury of 200)\n\nNaturally, its your Champion, these are simply my opinions. From what I have read of her I get the feel that Vex should be a relatively hard to kill duelist that focuses primarily on picking one target and wearing them down to 0 health over an extended fight. I see her in the Jungle and top lane mostly with the occasional appearance in mid lane against mobile tank midlanes such as Ekko. I think she would be a good addition to the game when properly balanced and could be a good tool for dealing with the \"OP Tank META\" from ever being truly out of hand.","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-08-18T20:13:46.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her ult is basically old poppy ult but makes the other person immune to damage as well and that's overpowered as hell lol\n\nVex could simply ult the support and proceed to attack and kill everyone besides the person Vex targeted until the ult runs out.","replies":[{"poster":"Azeranth","date":"2016-08-20T21:52:41.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, its just another form of invulnerability.
