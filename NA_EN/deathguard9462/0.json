I have been playing for 4 years now and I know the community has always been changing as time goes on but is winning really everything now. Rarely do you get a Normal (Draft or Blind) game that doesn&#039;t have at least 1 or 2 people in it that just get so angry if they or someone else isn&#039;t winning the game on their side, even Aram is filled with people who just get angry that their not going 15/0 and its All Random.\r\n\r\nI know that the majority of people aren&#039;t like this (or maybe they are and im just blind as well as deaf) but where are those people now. Where are the people that can laugh off a serious mistake by a teammate, the people that were willing to go Lulu jungle even though they know that they will probably lose the game. I understand that having someone on your team throw the game for you is frustrating but its Normals, shouldn&#039;t the main goal be having fun not winning the game or are they one and the same?\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know, maybe im just crazy. Maybe I should just stick to playing with bots (but that isn&#039;t any fun anymore seeing how they don&#039;t provide any challenge). Maybe its just me now, maybe I don&#039;t know how to have fun with League anymore. Maybe this whole post was just a waste of time and if it is im sorry but I like League and I want to play but I guess I don&#039;t really know how to anymore.","replies":[]}
