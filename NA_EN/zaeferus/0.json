I have my spells on quick cast and QWER format but they still wont work even after spamming the button 5+ times they wont work. its not my keyboard because if i type in the chat box i can still use the letters QWER  but they don't Function in game, it's happened multiple times and the only way i can fix that is if i exit game, log out, log back in and reconnect to the game I left. i can still AA but my abilities wont work. Please fix, it's really starting to annoy me and I've been getting AFK/leaving game penalties and reports on me, even tho i never leave games on my free will unless this bug pops up. I don't know what else to say, Please fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T17:56:54.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is most likely caused by corrupt input settings. You can reset these with the following steps. First, you'll want to **log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these two files, leave the match, then hop into another custom match with bots and make the changes you want. The settings should be default already, but if not you can hit the 'set to default button' and you should be good to go!","replies":[]}]}
