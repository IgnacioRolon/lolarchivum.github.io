Been playing since Season 2, and I've never had this problem, so I know for a fact that it is not because of anything else. I have V-Sync on and Movement Prediction off, but that didn't fix it at all. I've also turned off V-Sync and it seemed to make it worse. Not really sure what to do here. I've deleted and reinstalled, I've repaired the launcher, and so here I am reaching out to support/forums.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-18T21:20:36.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, I want to pinpoint if this is FPS or something else like packet loss.  Run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for these matches which should give you a score and analysis.  Let me know what you find and we can go from there.","replies":[{"poster":"ShyTTVGirl NoMic","date":"2017-11-19T01:55:45.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I followed the article and found the Network Logs. However, I can't find the program to run it. All of my logs date back to 4-5 months ago, so I'd imagine that that's an issue with recent data. From what I remember, these logs seem to be recorded when I was having this issue, but I don't want to submit them in case they weren't.\n\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nNevermind. I put the most recent log (7/28/17) in there are the test result came out as a 90. ","replies":[]}]}]}
