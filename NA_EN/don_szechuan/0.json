I got a brand new modem because my old one died. Top of the line. Earlier I couldn't connect to a game due to the server issues. This evening I played a few games. One in particular caused my ping to spike from 45 to 1200. I think it is because of the lolking guide I had up. Lolking slows my computer down it seems. Another game I had FPS drops. It happened about 4 times in the one game, where I went down to 12 or 4 fps and froze for 2-10 seconds. Only happened in one game.\n\nNew issue. This last game, I selected Annie. I hit lock in. After a few seconds it unlit the button and I had to hit it again. After three or four times it finally connected but said \"Error locking in champion\". Got into the game and I had lag all the way through. My fps was 60, ping was 45 consistantly. However I would have a 1 or 2 second delay at times on Q making it difficult to last hit. I missed some stuns because of it from my W and ult. I would do a weird orbwalking thing in place at times, as if I had unit collision, even though I was alone. I tried to direct tibbers to attack fizz and he just stood there and my r did nothing to reroute for a good 5 seconds. At times Everyone would run in place for a few seconds before the game caught up. Died once that way. Managed to still get fed and win, but the lag was so constant. \n\nI have played this game since Season 2 and I've never encountered these issues before. I don't know what all you guys need from me but I hope it is somehting on your end and not mine. I need a new computer, but these are server issues, not comp issues. Thank youl.\n\n\nEdit: From a brief researching, I think what I experienced in this last Annie game was \"Packet Loss\".","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T21:09:29.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, it sounds like things have been pretty rough and I'm sorry it's been happening to you.  Based on everything  that you've reported here, I'm under the suspicion that you're experiencing some network issues reaching our servers.  It could be as simple as having a new modem, and need to just configure and tune it up.  My suggestion for your specific issue is to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
