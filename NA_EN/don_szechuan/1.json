I hit the button after the game to save the replay, opened it up, and recorded the highlight of the play. I found the VLC file that was generated. The problem is that when I play it (in VLC and in Windows Media Player), it will play the entire audio track but no actual video track. It's essentially being treated as a song. How do I fix this? VLC gives an error message stating \"VLC does not support the audio or video format \"undf\". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this\".","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T02:32:16.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm VLC is pretty godlike when it comes to being able to play different file types, and I've personally not had a problem using VLC to play League highlights. I'm curious as to if that highlight file was corrupted somehow when it was made, so let's try remaking it really quick. Hit me back up if that new highlight won't play either.","replies":[{"poster":"Don Szechuan","date":"2017-06-23T11:18:44.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, just wanted to follow up. I uninstalled a redownloaded VLC. It works now. It's strange that the program would frazzle off like that, but at least I can upload my videos for sweet karma now. Thanks for the quick reply btw.{{champion:74}} \n\n\nNow if only we can figure out the Heimerdinger Turret Charge Icon Bug (tm)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Don Szechuan","date":"2017-06-23T03:15:01.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hrm...that did not work either. Nor is my previous recording from February loading when I had no issue prior. I'm going to try a fresh install of VLC. Could be an issue there.","replies":[]}]}]}
