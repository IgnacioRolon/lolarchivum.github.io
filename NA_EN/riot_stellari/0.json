These conversations and character building inform everything about a skin, from the VFX, SFX, the recall, and of course the splash.\r\n\r\nSometimes we&rsquo;ve shown you these stories through animations, comics, or short stories, etc&hellip; but a lot of times that background story remains head-canon and never leaves our brains...which is a shame. We want to start showing you more skin related &lsquo;lore&rsquo; and background information, and adding descriptions to skins is one step in doing that.\r\n\r\nWe DO try to surface these background snippets in the splash or in-game elements and sometimes we succeed (Omega Squad skins). A lot of ya&rsquo;ll picked up on the backstory of how Omega Squad Teemo lost his mentors and became the battle hardened Yordle psycho we know.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes we fail, like with the Immortal Journey skins. Did you know that Eternal Sword Master Yi was in love with an ascended being who guarded the Sacred Sword (cough Janna not Shen)? No? Well, if you did it was probably because you followed me on Twitter or saw my responses here. We didn&rsquo;t do a very good job of telling that background story, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nWe hope with this small addition to the Skin Collection tab we&rsquo;re able to give players who love skins a little bit more into the world they live in. In the future, we&rsquo;ll also be adding the ability to sort by Skin Universe (did you know Project and Program share the same universe?)\r\n\r\nAs we have close to 1,000 skins in the game, categorizing and ordering them is going to be an ongoing process. Sometimes we have to go deep into the past: what was the backstory with Dark Candy Fiddlesticks? Did one exist? So this will take some time. But with each patch we&rsquo;ll be adding a few more until we&rsquo;re all caught up. With this initial batch, we focused on our biggest thematic sets, but you&rsquo;ll be seeing a lot more shortly.\r\n\r\nDo you have thoughts or feedback on the Skins Collection Tab?

I would much rather have an area in the tab for ward skins.\n\nI would much rather have an area in that tab so that there is an are in client for viewing the skins that have been left out of inclusion in the Skins Collection tab so far: ward skins.  I would prefer the feature over it because it would be useful and enjoyable addition while a writing that says that while Caitlyn and Vi are law enforcement officers of Piltover, the skins Officer Caitlyn and Vi are law enforcement officers of (made up place name) would not add to the game experience.  I don't see that being different from others like with learning that Arctic Warfare Caitlyn is actually a soldier of (made up place name) or that Safari Caitlyn is a hunter and/or explorer of (made up place name) who hunts/explores the land of (made up place name).  \n\nWhat I am getting at it is that the skins provide alternative art and aesthetic that can be appreciated as such by those enjoy that and anyone of those people can approach however they wish _(Yeah, for the in-universe skins like Pre-void Kassadin it's not as applicable.  You all should really do more of those.)_  Adding story bits restricts that capability, even if they aren't really actual stories.  Exposition is information, information that doesn't mean anything to the audience without the story, which exposition is not.  Progression, character development, stakes, time with a character and watching their actions and reactions is what gives something to people.  Writing \"Takeo fell in love with Rinko at first sight.\" doesn't mean anything because that's just information.  It's the opening narration for a movie that ends at 1:40, a summary off of IMDB.\nSafari Caitlyn, Bad Santa Veigar, and Definitely Not Udyr are fun skins because they were made to be fun skins, a text section to explain them is not going to add to them and make them more fun.\n\nThe reverse, taking away from them, not so much.  Anybody who likes the aesthetic of the skin can appreciate it and enjoy the art of it and approach it from anyway they please.  However, adding this is going to make some people who liked the skin before dislike it.  It's unavoidable.  Like with Zoe, for example. \"Don't meet your heroes\" and all that. There's going to be details that will ruin it for people, for any number of skins for any number of people.\n\nSo that's why I dislike the idea.  It'll take something that worked, that people liked, and cause some people to dislike what they enjoyed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-01-10T00:48:18.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  (cough Janna not Shen)\n\ntoo soon","replies":[]}]}
