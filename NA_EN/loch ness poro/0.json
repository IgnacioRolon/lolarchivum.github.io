I'm wondering cause I've been trying to make some models for the mini-game but they look like absolute garbage. And I dont want the main point for the game to be the models but instead the gameplay. \r\n\r\nI dont mean to take Riot's hard work and claim it as my own, but am I allowed to HD-ify the models and their texture maps? Cause isn't taking someone's work, and even if you give them credit, called plagarism? Just wondering.\r\n\r\nMaybe i'll just stick to my horrible models....","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Privately","date":"2015-01-15T08:12:40.184+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things have been pretty chill when creative players borrow LoL assets to conjure up fun things. Usually this comes down to whether or not it's being used to make money, but there are also some edge cases where it's not okay either way. To be 800% absurdly certain that things are safe for you, you should check with a lawyer that can work with you directly, because I'm not a legal expert and can't grant anyone permission.\n\nIf anyone is confident that they have crazy-cool talent and wants to earn while they create, consider checking out the [Careers Page](http://www.riotgames.com/careers). Otherwise, they can reach out to info@riotgames.com if they feel really strongly about staying indie**+**for profit**+**using LoL assets. About that though; granting outside parties *complete freedom* with LoL stuff just because, happens as often as I reach Challenger. So if that's the route anyone wants to take just make sure to have some reallllly compelling reasoning behind the plan before sending it in for review.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nPS - I'd love to check it out when you have something ready. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-01-15T12:16:56.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep calm guys.
