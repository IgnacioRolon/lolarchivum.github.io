You know the company Jagex right? They own the game called **Runescape**. That game used to have 200.000+ players online at a time, now it barely has 30k-50k. What actually happened to the game that made it go downhills from such a highly popular game to **meh**.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Runescape failed...was...because **JAXED DID NOT LISTEN TO THEIR PLAYERBASE AT ALL!**\r\nPeople may have different opinions of when Runescape died, but the statistics don&#039;t lie. Jagex implemented a whole new combat system called &quot;EOC&quot; despite the fact that **90% of the players did not want these changes to be implemented into the game**! They **forced** it (keep in mind the word forced). Jagex did not listen to their playerbase, now they are paying the price for it.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason to why I brought this up? It&#039;s because of the fact that Riot right now isn&#039;t listening to their players at all. Let me give you some good examples.\r\n\r\n1) Remember when {{champion:5}} was buffed on the PBE? People were begging Riot not to bring him to the live servers, but they ignored the players, and guess what happened? Xin&#039;s winrate skyrocketed to 60%.\r\n\r\n2) Dynamic Queue. Yes, the majority of the players don&#039;t want this, so I will use this as an example. DQ itself isn&#039;t bad, but the thing is that Riot is basically saying &quot;play with friends or transfer over to tetris&quot;. They **force** players to do something they don&#039;t want to. I mean, most of the players would want SoloQ right? The problem here is that if SoloQ would be implemented into the game, it would divide the game (just like it did with Runescape when Jagex decided to go back and implement &quot;Old School Runescape) and DQ might go wasted, which wouln&#039;t be very good for a company that has put a lot of money and effort into making this, so this is debatable.\r\n\r\n3) {{champion:82}}  rework. I do not post on the Boards often, but I know there&#039;s a guy called **Malicious Metal** who is a very passionate Morde player. He could probably tell about this better than me, but I will make a try. When {{champion:82}} was reworked, Riot tried to **force** Mordekaiser from top/mid to ADC. Not only that, but they also changed Morde&#039;s kit A LOT. Now this isn&#039;t always necessarily a bad thing, but this time it was. People were not happy about this rework, and hoped that Riot would revert it and re-rework him later. They still did not listen to their playerbase, and let {{champion:82}} be as he was. Not until they noticed that the new Morde&#039;s playstyle was toxic, did they change him. But in what way? They nerfed him, to the ground. Instead of figuring out a new rework for him, right? Sure it would take some more time, but wouldn&#039;t it have been worth it? I am certain that they had other Mordekaiser rework ideas they had ditched earlier, so why not go back and rethink how they actually want to change this champion?\r\n\r\nI could go on for days about this, but chances are, people would be too lazy to read a novel which is understandable, so I will keep it short.  \r\n\r\n**RIOT, LEARN FROM OTHER COMPANIES MISTAKES SO YOU DON&#039;T HAVE TO REDO THEM!**","replies":[{"poster":"MegaManYYZ","date":"2016-04-08T17:05:10.640+0000","up_votes":171,"down_votes":39,"body":"if Riot listened 100% to the player base, they would be ran into the ground. how many threads are out there that X champ needs nerfs and buffs. they would be a dog chasing their own tale. \n\nbelieve it or not but Riot does listen to the player base but doesn't overreact to the vocal ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2016-04-08T18:30:55.860+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":14,"body":"I don't think anyone wants that.

Riot had zero intention to make morde an adc. PLAYERS did. \n\nLOL ok you either have a short memory or haven't been here for very long. Morde's rework added in a passive that gave him full experience for anyone minions that die near him. Additionally his W became only ally champion targetable, meaning he couldn't self cast it or cast it on minions. Additionally any dragon he helped kill post-6 respawned for him as a controllable pet. The last of those 3 changes heavily encourages him to go bot/mid/jungle and discourages him from going top without tp. The other 2 heavily benefit from Morde being in lane with another champion, kind of like bot lane. Finally Riot talked about bot lane Morde when this rework was released and how he'd be a good option as an adc replacement despite having no cc or gap closer. In case you still don't believe that Riot wanted him to go duo bot here is a direct quote from Riot on one their posts discussing the juggernaut update. \n\n>We’re trying Mordekaiser out as a duo lane juggernaut, intended to step up in lieu of a regular marksmen pick.\n>Yep.\n>Morde’s rework has some pretty unique aspects. For starters, Creeping Death now only deals damage if Morde and his targeted ally stay near each other, a change intended to help entice Morde into duo lanes the way we mentioned. Secondly, even if he’s playing in lane with a support, he’ll earn full experience from any minion he’s able to last hit (support will get their usual half share of xp). This means that Mordekaiser, unless he dies horribly beforehand, will always hit level six way before his lane opponents, and will always have a pretty handy advantage when it comes to bot lane battles and early game dragon contests.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrollyZZ","date":"2016-04-09T13:08:55.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Space Man J,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cyXimTOQ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-04-08T17:09:08.708+0000)\n>\n> No. They didn't. Riot had zero intention to make morde an adc. PLAYERS did. The same type of players who think Aurelion Sol is a support. You can't have a company who literally just listens to player base, because the player base is so vast and opinions differ literally per person. You can't say this person opinion is better, and ignore the other player base. So they take considerations into account from the players, and they do what they can, but overall, the idea that they are the reason this game is how it is, is silly. People make the game generally what it is. Riot didn't make this META, or what champions go where, or who synergizes with who, that is completely player driven and discovered then spread. \n> \n> Stop raging and actually contribute instead of just whining in forums.

A nerf to something that everyone is complaining about winds up being a buff to something else that gets abused. \n\nThe other main issue is that they wind up doing most of the balancing around the pro scene.

They can't make a change to the pro scene without affecting bronze games. So while {{champion:82}} {{champion:122}} was super fun to watch on a pro level, it was hell in SoloQ.

The only worlds that were still heavily populated were major trade worlds like World 1. This drastically shifted the balance of the game's economy within a matter of a week.\n\nThe second was Combat Reconstruction. Runescape players were 60% to 75% melee due to the fact that melee was the best option all around. It was rare to find a decent mage without Ancient spells and anything ranger better than Karils/Darkbow in black Dragonhide. This shift in the combat weakened the melee class and strengthened mage and range classes with the use of cooldown abilities. A high majority of players left because the game was becoming too WoW like. As much as I disagree and as much as the dedicated players hated it it was needed. Warrior types were far too common and were way too powerful without at least 5 mages to drop him or her before they got to you and nuked you with a God Sword, most likely Armadyls or Bandos God Sword.
