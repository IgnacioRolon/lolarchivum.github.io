While playing League with all other applications closed and shutdown I have been monitoring my router traffic through it's web gui as well as running a few constant pings to various places. When I get the attempting to reconnect issue... I literally only drop 1 ping request to say Google or Riot servers. If I end the game process I am able to immediately reconnect. However, by this time I am either already dead or have run back to base automatically. This is a huge issue Riot. I understand internet traffic very well as I myself am a network engineer for a very large corporation. 1 dropped packet should not force me to have to reconnect. The game just sits there at attempting to reconnect. I have let it sit there for upwards of 10 minutes in a normal game just to see if it would ever reconnect and it doesn't.\r\n\r\nNow onto some further testing...... I played some Battlefield 4 recently and I did see the occasional dropped ping and very very brief drop in traffic at my router but it never interfered with a BF4 game. One dropped packet should not permanently disconnect me from a Riot game either. I am dropping this one packet to my ISP and have already raised the issue with them. However, my connection is 99% stable so it is really not a problem in the eyes of my ISP. This one dropped packet completely kills my connection in a LoL game every single time without fail. I know Riot has some sort of fault tolerance in place but it needs a serious review.\r\n\r\nI have played LoL on some really bad connections in the past as I travel for work and have never had the connection to the game fail like this. The connection that I have been on for the duration of 4.17 so far has been one of the best connections I have had on the road. Prior to 4.17 I have dropped some packets as all links will do but I didn't get stuck at reconnecting. The game would always pick back up after about a second of reconnecting. It does not do this anymore since 4.17.\r\n\r\nRiot, I am asking as a very dedicated customer, please look into this issue. At least provide some sort of acknowledgement that you guys are looking into this issue?\r\n\r\nMy system is an 8.1 Windows machine that is fully up to date with windows updates, firmware on routers, tried to hard wire to ISP modem, and all the other sorts.\r\n\r\nP.S. I have also tried putting the DD-WRT firmware on my router (Asus RT-AC66U). The problem still existed. I have reverted back to the RT-AC66U firmware as I like the Asus Gui much better.","replies":[{"poster":"Teh Chosen Juan","date":"2014-10-12T21:09:12.398+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":2,"body":"They aren't going to acknowledge this issue at all, or make even aware to anybody.. they don't want to admit their giant screwup on their North American servers.

Honestly, I thought at first that they should just have released some small little announcement, and then reset the servers, back to Patch 4.16, and then I would have said Riot was a bunch of idiots, and that they should have caught this HUGE issue before making it public, but not anymore. Now I hate Riot, because this issue is actually causing my computer to crash even when LoL isn't open, and they won't even bother to comment on any posts about this issue, they even took down the notification in the patcher, after ONE day, even though they hadn't fixed the bug. Being honest here, I had faith in Riot that they could fix this, but the fact that their only official effort to do so (at the end of Patch 4.18) failed, and that they refuse to acknowledge any fault on their part, I have already uninstalled LoL, and will only be reinstalling it if I can have a guarantee that it has been fixed, so probable never, at this rate. My reasoning, there are plenty of other games that are fun, and that have a tech support that actually addresses issues that come up, and does an even better job of preventing them from becoming issues in the first place.

I updated Java and deleted the older version.\n\nAfter updating Java, Internet Explorer worked fine and could connect to the internet. I connected to League of Legends and have not had the repetitious disconnect problem in the games that I have played.\n\nPlease research this to see if this is a possible solution to the disconnecting issue that has occurred since the recent patches. Please review my original post in the \"Players Disconnecting\" in the Help and Support thread with the history of attempts to fixing the problem before realizing this.\n\nlet me know if this helps.","replies":[]}]}
