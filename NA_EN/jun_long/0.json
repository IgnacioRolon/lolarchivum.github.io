I was the sound designer on Star Guardian Ahri, and although I wasn't the writer, I can speak a bit on her vocal direction. We all know and love base Ahri as a mature seductress, but one of the things that is so fresh and enjoyable about creating alternate universes for our beloved champions is that we can explore the \"what if\"s of reimagining them in a completely new way. That was the case of Star Guardian Ahri. As a Star Guardian, Ahri is supposed to be around 16 or 17. She's high school aged, but she's been around the block a few times as a star guardian and has lost some allies. With that in mind, she's young, but she's a confident leader to knows she's capable. Vocally, we wanted the VA to play her a little younger than base Ahri, which accounts for why she may sound and act a bit different from what we're used to. I do believe there's a lot of depth and complexity to her personality that starts to peek through after multiple games played with her.\n\nIn regard to the laugh, our buddy KuroCaliber was spot on. The ojousama laugh is a long standing anime trope that we wanted to throw in as a fun reference for our players. The slightly over-the-top nature of it is part of the fun :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zyranium","date":"2017-08-13T17:21:18.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Zimberfly,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=bRE0bOPM,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-08-10T18:28:37.808+0000)\n>\n> Hi Jun Long!\n> \n> Thanks for your post!

Well that should have been obvious to me since Star Guardian skin line is based off of Sailor Moon (I assume).
