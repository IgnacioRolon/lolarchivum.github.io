Now, because i have functioning brain cells, i know that fighting Lucian early is suicide, so i told Nautilus to NOT fight him. He did not listen and fed him 4 kills which of course was a lost lane at that point.\n\nDuring the midgame, he kept blaming ME for HIS deaths and then he got extremely racist. Calling people the N word, saying that Greek people are **** and various other shit. Also he said F-you RIOT multiple times and i do have a screenshot of that also.\n\nSo is it possible to actually give the shots to someone so we can get that guy banned? I think such behavior  should not be tolerated in this game.\n\n[REMOVED BY MODERATION-NO NAME AND SHAME]\n\nsome actual Prove of the behavior, with his Name and what he said. These particular shots are only the post-game shots. There are many more where these came from, including the racistic comments against me and other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-07-19T11:08:07.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.

I would just get over it if I were you.  Don't let your identity function as an insult by letting it bother you.  Don't form an inferiority complex or overcompensate with narcissism.  If someone mentions some trait you have, why should you acknowledge it as an insult and give them that power over you unless there is something wrong about having that trait?  \n\nI can joke about my short stature, the size/shape of my nose, and even ethnic stereotypes about my ancestors being greedy or other ancestors being drunks...  It might help that I am ethnically mixed, so it's rare that someone insults all of my heritage.  Unless someone encourages killing or harming me or my relatives, and I judge it as a real threat (not some misguided kid spouting trash on a game), I try not to take insults to heart.\n\nFor your own wellbeing, I would try to get over it if I were you.  Being vindictive isn't a healthy trait.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlsTouchMeGently","date":"2019-07-19T15:22:43.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the other person here said . . . how in the world would the guy know youâ€™re Greek?
