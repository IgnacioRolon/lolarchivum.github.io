For flaming other people who flame or for offending people that need to get over words on a screen (cyber bullying does not exist). However looking into it alot more than I should I realized that having a system that makes players more inclined to report and flame eachother for reporting and flaming eachother is toxic in general and that if you find someone else toxic or if you're legitimately getting offended somehow you're more than likely scapegoating and are toxic yourself.\n\n Players that are legitimately not toxic don't harrass other players for their behavior as you agree with however in that case where they don't judge they also dont report other players for their behavior because they have no reason to (Its only destructive). The banning system actually does not assist the truly neutral player It just puts toxic players against eachother furthering the idea of a toxic community. A toxic player wants other players to get mad so they can report them and get them banned for it making the banning system a weapon for the toxic player. Banning a player doesnt even stop the player from playing league it just takes away their name, level, skins and champions (I WONDER WHY). Which only furthers the use of buying used accounts and therefor bot accounts which only get banned to create more.\n\n A better solution to your \"problem\" would be to take players away from chat or even to take away ranked to enforce \"breaks\" on a player like the ones the person on the ticket form suggested I have. In my personal experience I entered a ranked game on a stressed out day died once, got flamed for it died again got called an inter and was told I'd be reported and then when I say something back to VERBALLY DEFEND MYSELF (Whats that?) I got called toxic and was told I had a mental problem. I didnt report anyone but I was most certainly reported and permabanned with my 2,500 hour account that I also spent $350 on. My fault yes but also Riots for convincing players to hate other players more by making up a fallacy about a toxic community that inclines players to blame eachother and inforcing rules on the grounds of said fallacy.\n\n Keeping shit real shouldn't get you banned. and once again you only witness toxicity to the degree that you are being toxic yourself, banning players for being toxic only makes them come back more toxic because they basically had theyre money and time and lives stolen from them. My theory is that Riots goal is to convince a permabanned player that the ban was justified and that the player was wrong so that said player will spend more money on another account. \n\nBecoming a less \"toxic\" player isnt about getting banned and coming back thinking you were wrong its about just playing the game and witnessing the positivity of the community around you not judge you for being mad at a videogame when its natural. \n\nIve never been permabanned and said wow I should learn my lesson however I have been toxic in a game and treated with positivity in response and said wow I'm being a fucking asshole. I hope you unban every permabanned account. Also you guys really ban T1 call him the most toxic player and then cast him saying he's changed?

Even in professional sports those who take it too far are given penalties such as fines and/or suspensions.\n2) Freedom of speech =/= freedom of speech consequences, only prevents the US government from creating speech limiting laws and it doesn't apply to privately owned establishments such as Riot Games.\n3) Words can and do hurt people, with the reasoning that they don't often use by those who want to upset others or say whatever they want accountability free. Yes the argument can be made that they only have as much power as one lets them and sometimes something needs to be said even if it upsets someone but nevertheless the point still stands.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nYour opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nRiot's punishment system used to hand out stacking chat restrictions, such that consistently toxic players basically had a permanent chat restriction. Unfortunately, it turns out that such players used their few chat opportunities to be toxic, and, when they couldn't be as toxic as they wanted to, they resorted to committing non-chat offenses such as griefing (following someone around and taking their farm, using wall abilities to interfere with their play, etc.) or inting. The purpose of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking, not make it worse. Thus, if a couple chat restrictions don't make any difference in a player's misbehavior, the system ramps up the punishments until the player is permabanned and thus unable to use that account to break any more rules ever again.\n\nRiot used to give toxic players a long series of gradually-increasing suspensions. However, they found that players who got more than a few punishments would never stop misbehaving and receiving punishments. As the goal of the punishment system is to eliminate rule-breaking and Riot has absolutely no interest in coddling toxic players, the system was changed to eliminate this long tail of irredeemable players. Compared to the hundreds or even thousands of typical players who are bothered over dozens or hundreds of matches ruined by a toxic player, that one player's ability to annoy people merits no sympathy or concern. The preferred outcome of punishing a misbehaving player is reform: according to Riot's figures, most players who get one punishment never get another. However, when a player refuses to stop breaking the rules after a few warnings (punishments), they are removed from the game with a permaban because Riot no longer believes them capable of reform.\n\nDid you find something in Riot's store [allowing you to break the ToS](https://i.imgur.com/AvDSnZF.png)? No, because such a service is not offered. Regardless of how much money you spend, you are required to follow the same rules as everyone else. If the IFS determines that you've been validly reported in violation of those rules, you'll be punished according to those rules. If you wanted to avoid a punishment, you should've followed the rules.\n\nThe ability to play on a new account doesn't negate the benefits of permabanning toxic players. If every single one of them did that, then it would at least be a minor punishment, taking away their unlocked skins, icons, champs, and so on. Any who don't do that are removed from the game and the problem is solved in at least those instances. Quite frankly, Riot and 99.994% of the playerbase (people without permabans, according to Riot's figures on this, which I see no reason to doubt) don't give one whit for how permabanned players feel about being ejected from the game for consistently appalling behavior. Most permabanned players stop playing the game. It's extremely rare for a permabanned player to be so oblivious and/or unbalanced that they accumulate multiple permabans on a series of accounts. Riot does not have the wherewithal to prevent that except when a highly-visible player (such as a popular streamer) engages in this behavior, in which case they may issue an ID ban (Riot employees manually ban any account that such a player is seen to use).\n\nThe money Riot gains from duplicate purchases on serial permabanned players' accounts pales in comparison to the many typical players driven away by toxic customers. It is not a conspiracy. Riot just doesn't want those toxic players to play the game anymore.\n\nYou are certainly allowed to defend yourself from toxic chat, which is accomplished by muting. This is a 100% effective method. Flaming back is a 0% effective method that also constitutes unacceptable behavior and thus opens you up to reports and punishments.

Its the judgement of the behavior that gives said behavior the power to be \"negative\" Don't be sorry someone called me a scumfuck degenerate because I should just feel decent when I mute them/called them something back. Talking trash to other people in a videogame isn't supposed to be a personal thing nobody truely gets offended unless its \"youre toxic. No you're toxic\" Where Riot is ontop saying \"Nope youre all toxic\". My opinion of the rules does matter because I'm speaking on factual grounds. The only kind of player \"toxicity\" drives away is videogamedunkey thanks to the banning system. You cant say I'm completely wrong Its not a \"conspiracy\" its facts nice try tho nobodys yelling in librarys","replies":[{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-08-07T10:04:09.827+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Real men don't care about what others say but they'll argue for the sake of it and possibly report each other because theyre told to.\n> don't care about what others say\n> they'll argue for the sake of it\n\nThats not how \"don't care\" work.\n\n> If I want something to do I tell them theyre wrong and report them.\n\nRemove the \"I tell them theyre wrong\" part and you will be ok\n\n> Talking trash to other people in a videogame isn't supposed to be a personal thing nobody truely gets offended\n\nI am not offended by someone trashtalking me. That doesn't mean I would like to play with that person again. So I will quietly report him after the game. And if he keeps flaming other players in other games, he will get banned/chat banned and won't be able to flame, which is just what is supposed to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"açid","date":"2019-08-07T10:12:52.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"reporting a person isn't telling them they are wrong? most players dont quit after being banned which doesnt stop them from being \"toxic\" they just take a break from ranked from grinding and become less \"toxic\" as an effect","replies":[{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-08-07T10:21:16.902+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If a fucking permaban can't stop someone flaming, then whatever you typed to him in chat can't either.","replies":[{"poster":"açid","date":"2019-08-07T10:26:04.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"what if I say something positive?

The easiest way is to mute him. After the match report him and hope that IFS deals with it. Now, since you have responded to the trolls with negativity and insults, IFS has punished you. That is because you have been negative and thrown insults, because you could not keep your cool. That is unfortunate, but that is how things go here. \n\nIn case you start a third account, you would do well to study [IFS FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) and learn this simple rule; if someone annoys you in league, mute him, don't talk to/with/about him, and report him after the match - still not talking to/with/about him. Also, don't be negative in the chat. Following these guilines your account will be safe and the bad person will hopefully be punished some day in future. Oh, and you have to play to win and never troll too, to keep your account safe.\n\nOn the other hand; chat can be safely used to talk about tactics, and it can be used for morale boosting.","replies":[{"poster":"açid","date":"2019-08-07T10:51:38.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Cool but how does reporting a player solve the problem when the player can just come back? Also riot has never tried completely removing chat from a \"toxic\" player only muting said player.

They do lose the skins, icons and such too. Granted, they can get those back, but if they keep on trolling, they will lose them again.
