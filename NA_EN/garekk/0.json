Someone like, I dont know, {{champion:91}} ? Remember him? He used to be a champion too, until Zed and Yasuo stole his role and he was nerfed to oblivion.

I agree with Talon being a ball of stats but if Yas's Q counts as a skillshot then I'm not sure you can call Talon point and click given his rake and ult. Yasuo actually has much more targeted damage than Talon because he's more auto-reliant, which is obviously exclusively targeted damage.\n\nNot to say that it's much easier to avoid Talon's burst because they're skillshots in the loosest sense of the term, but still. Yasuo's counterplay is not in his damage being easily dodged.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-10-17T14:21:06.747+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Calling Yasuo's Q a skillshot is most certainly fair.

An ability that basically removes his mana bar, fucks up his last-hitting, with piss-poor base and a ratio that doesn't get much better until endgame. Compare that to an ability you get _for free_ while farming, with further range, and hard CC attached to it. If you see a Yasuo who can't get their ult off in a fight whatsoever, you've found someone who shouldn't be playing Yasuo. Talon has one jump, Yasuo gets as many dashes as there are enemies in front of him. Yasuo also gets his shield for doing this. I don't think Talon is useless, but arguing that he's better than Yasuo is ridiculous, given that all Yasuo has to do is initiate or wait for initiate, press R, and roll his face on the keyboard. Talon's best case scenario in most teamfights is removing his target and making it a 4v4. Yasuo may or may not even have to fight after the initiate because of just how strong his ult is even without allied setup.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-10-17T06:49:59.427+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Garekk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8sG1Zk1Y,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-10-17T06:43:48.991+0000)\n>\n> Talon has mana, Yasuo doesnt.\n> \n> Yasuo has AoE crowd control, Talon doesnt.\n> \n> Yasuo has two passives, Talon barely has one.\n> \n> Yasuo's mobility is objectively better than Talon's.\n> \n> Yasuo can block projectiles.

Most people preffer to play a damn game to have fun so they pick the more fun champion over the \"mash buttons and sit there until the enemy dies\" champions. Thresh is a good all around support so it makes sense that he is played often. He fits decently in and against almost any team comp so he is a great champion for someone playing with random players that will play random champions every game. Hence why he is played a lot. The best way to judge a champions counterplay is by win rate. There are a lot of bad players, so if a champion has a low winrate, they are most likely either garbage, or has defined weaknesses that inexperienced players can't cover up and end up doing badly. Notice the higher winrate champions almost always take no skill, because simply having no counterplay is better for the person playing the champion. How are you going to cleanse or qss a blitz hook? You can't, so you will die. If you were playing thresh, they could simply qss and walk away, and that is how the game should be. Champions with more counterplay have more powerful kits, so when they are utilized to their full potential, they can shine over the other champions that lack counterplay\n\nBTW \"don't fight this champion\" is not valid counterplay. Buying a qss is more acceptable, but rushing qss simply because they have a certain champion on their team shouldn't have to happen. Cleanse needs some buffs and they need to add more meaningful counterplay to cc.
