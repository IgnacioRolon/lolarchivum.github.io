I&#039;m just starting to get back into it within the past week or two after being gone from the game for god knows how long, though I just stick to ARAM and Co-Op vs. AI out of sheer fear of having to deal with Summoner&#039;s Rift and the possible hell there from other players. The last time I played Summoner&#039;s Rift PvP was so long ago, I don&#039;t event remember when I did it. I am NOT great at Summoner&#039;s Rift or league as a whole. I&#039;m Decent at Yasuo and maybe Xerath, and Xayah, but that&#039;s it. I was thinking about trying again after not doing it for so long (I don&#039;t count ARURF and the one time I tried it), would it be worth getting back into and trying, or should I just stick to ARAM/Co-Op vs. AI? {{champion:157}}","replies":[]}
