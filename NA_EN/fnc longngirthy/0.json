If u are going to attack me in chat im supposed to mute and move on like i didnt get harassed and let riots shitty ban system auto check and miss everything. I guess from now on to enjoy the game i need to make many accounts to troll people and get them really tilted so they get tilted and chew me out cuz thats how it works. I would say out of all the games i play 4 to 3 out of 10 games i get trolled. And MR is bs because i win 5 games in a row, and then get a 1 and 10 leona who doesnt know what her q does in ranked? So i guess riot u want everyone to be like shaco and munch munch munch peoples LP away and enjoy it. I get in trouble for standing up to myself after being bullied, and the bully doesnt get punished. I wasnt even really tripped, but they called my duo names i didnt think would ever be said anywhere. But in league it happens all the time The only moderation that happens is when people say hey can u stfu stop talking to me like that and then mute then. You can actually get banned. So i guess from now on Imma juss troll games. Cuz u can go 1/15 and juss say in sry guys its a bad game when yer clearly inting, and u wont get reported. So thats the new me.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-10-22T01:57:18.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is that okay that people troll you and run it down? Damn. Riot disagrees, along with I'm assuming 99% of players. Thats against the rules. So just use the report system. You dont have to insult the people ruining your games. You can just report them, and Riot will punish them in a much more substantial way than your online insults and complaining or whatever you did to get yourself banned (which was obviously more than a simple \"pls stop trolling\".... youre not foolin anyone with that). But if trolling sounds fun to you, then yes, go ahead and join in. Its your life and your time. Do what you can to enjoy it.

I just don't know why the support saying in chat im going to run it down and int yer game for no reason didn't get banned?????\n\nYeah, I understand. There is a perception that Riot does nothing about trolls, and that's unfortunate for them because if trolls are ruining the experience for many players, its bad for business. I think because of this, they do try. But you gotta be realistic. \n\nObviously they dont want trolls running around pissing off their playerbase. Its not that they do NOTHING... its that the problem is literally impossible to prevent. If people want to troll, nothing is going to stop them.\n\n I've seen a dozen or so threads of inters, griefers, or trolls getting banned. They actually have the nerve to make posts complaining about their bans. Imagine the many more people who never use the boards that have been banned. I mean, only like 1% of the playerbase even uses the boards ever, probably less even. \n\nSo yeah, they do try, but its an unachievable goal to rid the game of trolls entirely. Think of the people who report the \"trolls\" who just have bad games? The 1/7 outmatched players who get stomped on. Those ones arent trolling, but players clog up the system with their reports. So Riot probably has a few thousand reports to comb through before they get to your actual legitimate report against a REAL troll. \n\nThats just the reality man. I think its a bit delusional (no offense) to ignore that part of reality and just say Riot does NOTHING about them. Especially to say that a troll going unpunished means its \"okay\" to do. Like, come on man... Because they arent punished immediately afterwards means Riot must not mind? I hope youre just saying that out of frustration, because you cant actually believe thats how things work.

Ive seen many chat logs where the pre game chat is included, so yeah, they do monitor that. If someone runs it down mid, thats against the rules. Picking garen support is not. Thats part of why its such a hard problem to prevent. You can pick garen suppirt and get owned (ive played against it when I was anivia bot and fucking smoked em. They wanted to report garen for troll, but he wasnt trolling. Meanwhile ive also had people ask for reports against me just for picking anivia bot) and everyone can report you, but garen did nothing against the rules. Or you can pick garen support and run it down mid, and THAT is against the rules. Maybe Riot doesn't do enough, but how do you know what they do? When you stop seeing trolls that will be enough? Are you again ignoring the impossibility of that task???? Stay realistic man. Step back and try to look at it pragmatically.\n\nAs far as the people you mentioned I think T1 must be tyler1? Yeah, the only player in history to have gotten an on sight ID ban? The harshest punishment known to the game? Yeah, he got that. And then he showed some ability to follow the rules again, so they lifted that ID ban, and now hes just a normal player with multiple permanently banned accounts. Idk who the other guys are. They're just players who stream while they play. They dont represent shit. I hate the idea that just because someone streams themselves playing a game, suddenly theyre representing other players? No. Fuck that celebrity worship mentality. Theyre just fucking normal ass people who play a video game, who cares. \n\nNow, when you say \"im tired of this bad system that lets others off that benefits them...\" what do you mean? Who's benefitting from what and whos being let off with the ability to break all the rules consequence free? You brought up tyler1, so if you mean streamers, then how does he have multiple permanently banned accounts? What about that Nubrac guy that got banned for playing teemo mid as support role or whatever he was doing? Seems like they have to follow the rules after all, no? I think you've dug into this lane that Riot is doing all this shit wrong, and its clouding your ability to step back and look at things objectively and realistically. \n\nThere is definitely a perception that Riot doesn't do enough about trolls. Whether the perception is accurate to reality or not, Riot does need to do something about it. They cant have a lot of their playerbase thinking they do nothing about game ruining experiences. So good luck to Riot. Gonna be quite a tough perception to reverse.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FNC LongNGirthy","date":"2019-10-22T03:38:36.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i said stfu in the post and pls for the love of jesus stop shitting me on top of that I just don't know why people get off for trolling me too I do have to have self justice cuz absolutely riot doesn't do shit","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-10-22T00:45:37.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If u are going to attack me in chat im supposed to mute and move on like i didnt get harassed and let riots shitty ban system auto check and miss everything.\n\nYes, you are free to mute and move on.

In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other players’ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game. There is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words which is what we are trying to address with these bans.","replies":[]}]}
