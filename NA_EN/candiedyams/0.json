I felt a little less disgust when I read that it is actually being moved to the domination tree, but the lack of details about that move still has me worried. Ultimate Hat is very useful on primary and secondary sorcery users such as Karma, Lux, Galio, Teemo, Zilean, Karthus, Rakan etc. Moving the rune just seems like an indirect assassin buff/mage nerf. \r\n\r\nUltimate Hat is supposedly being replaced in the sorcery tree by Nimbus Cloak: \r\n&quot;Shortly after casting your Ultimate ability, gain a powerful, decaying movement speed increase for 2s. \r\nIncrease: 100 Movement Speed\r\nCooldown: 25s&quot;\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this rune seems pretty useless on mages. Seeing as though it will be on the same row as Manaflow Band, I doubt Nimbus Cloak would be the better option for most sorcery users. What I would like to know is exactly what champions did Riot expect this rune to go on {DON&#039;T say Karma.... I REFUSE!!!}. Also, is Ultimate Hat being changed at all once it is moved?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]}
