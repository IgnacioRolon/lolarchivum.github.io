It stayed like that for 5 hours even after I restarted the client and the pc but it's now resolved and I can login normally but the game wont show up in my match history and I have not won LP off of it. Am I going to get my LP?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T20:49:00.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you may have experiences a ghost game.  When a match ends, the completion needs to be communicated to our server, otherwise you may be stuck at the reconnect until it's done.  Usually, a relog can force that communication.  If it's taken so long, I can't guarantee that the match will be saved to the server.  Hopefully, it will show up on your history!","replies":[]}]}
