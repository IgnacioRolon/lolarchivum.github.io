Or if you don't opt for a Triforce, then {{item:3124}} {{item:3146}} add up to 5900, with a {{item:3057}} , that's 6950 or a {{item:3044}} its 7100\n\nIf you were jungling, then {{item:1415}} or {{item:3931}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3078}} adds up to 8750 gold, if you want to break apart the triforce pieces, then it'll add up at the cheapest with {{item:3057}} at 6000 gold\n\nOh cool, finally a cheaper build than Nasus' right? Alright cool...but you have way less health and Nasus' HP pool and resistances with his items will allow him to shred apart Jax, 90 extra armor\nNasus gets 70 extra MR and 500 extra HP vs a Jax who is relying entirely on his nerfed to oblivion base stats and a full damage build, at most he'll get 250 more HP with his laning build with a Triforce\n\nWith 40% CDR I can almost PERMA-WITHER a Jax, with a rank 1 wither (with a STUPID nasus), that's a 9 second CD with a 5 second duration meaning 4 seconds Jax can viably fight back. With Rank 5 Wither (a SMART Nasus) this will be 7.6 second CD, 2.6 seconds Jax can viably fight back\n\nBUT WAIT: Frozen heart reduces attack speed by 15% and stacks with Wither! Even without wither, when Jax (A champion who relies almost entirely on autoattacks) jumps on him, he immediately loses 15% of his attack speed. Even worse is he needs to keep attacking to get his own speed stacks\n\nAdditionally: the new jungle nets 34 less gold per clear and than before whereas lane minions net more gold, even worse for Jax: The items all got jacked up in price!. This means that while the jungle Jax build is cheaper, it's harder for him to get the gold for his items. He will NEED to get fed to get his items in time vs a farming Nasus and if he does this, he has less devourer stacks\n\nFor laning: Nasus has sustain, Jax doesn't. A stupid Nasus will let Jax bully and zone him, a competent Nasus will trade back and abuse his sustain advantage. The CS, and gold, should swing towards Nasus' favor\n\nIn other words: Jax vs Nasus...very strongly in Nasus' favor, the Jax must rely almost entirely on being fed and the Nasus being stupid/very behind to stand a chance","replies":[{"poster":"Aestheticist","date":"2015-11-24T14:47:32.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize jax can now dodge nasus's q right?","replies":[{"poster":"WutsKraken","date":"2015-11-25T00:08:19.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if you'll notice I addressed that in response to Ravoria's post\n\nBut it's but a small victory for Jax.

This does a lot more damage than a Nasus Q, and if nasus withers Jax, he can simply leap away having done twice as much damage to Nasus.

You have this matchup completely wrong though.\n\nQ does indeed go through Jax's E, that was Nasus's only saving grace - but that will be changed soon. When it does, this will be 100% in favour of Jax. Even so, until then, Jax can react to wither the same way Nasus can react to Jax's E. If Nasus withers Jax, Jax can then activate E, use his W on Nasus and Q away. If Nasus ults, Jax can also ult. It does depend greatly on skill this matchup, the first to get a thornmail usually wins (thornmail reflects Q damage from Nasus, did you know). But in my experience playing as both champions vs the other one, Jax has a very slight advantage up until Nasus can get around 500 stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"WutsKraken","date":"2015-11-25T18:12:55.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is also assuming a Jax who is much more skilled than the Nasus, as Nasus I will never wither a Jax unless I am going all-in or he is going aggressive, in the situation you described, this sounds like a Nasus who preemptively withers a Jax for no reason and even if so, a WQ combo from Nasus costs less mana than all of the abilities Jax must use to win the trade\n\nFrom my experience, after 200 stacks I can start to destroy Jax in duels no matter his items","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-11-23T18:01:53.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gonna ignore Nasus/Yi/Tryndamere/Udyr/Yasuo huh","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2015-11-24T04:03:25.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fritterz,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=EyIEyKBw,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-11-23T15:10:46.985+0000)\n>\n> You could look at it either way.

The problem with splitting is that usually the most fed guy feels obligated to do the splitting, and this allows the enemy to catch up by feasting on your weaker allies. One must understand where the team's power is allocated. If it's all front-loaded into just one guy or if a very important piece of the team's ability to team fight at all (even on defense) is the one trying to leave, splitting can easily lead to throws.
