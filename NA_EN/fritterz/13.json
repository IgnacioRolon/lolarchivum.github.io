The process of death ends with death. It is when not if. The wisest have accepted they will inevitably die.\n\nAn emptiness that cannot be filled\nWith fingers reaching that are not instilled\nNever gives, always wants,\nHaunting the bravest, it will daunt.\n\nThis paragraph is about fire. - Fire is an abyss that never stops as long as there is food for it. Fingers reaching and not instilled. The rest is easy to see.\n\nOf fingers clenched and foreheads drenched\nWhether children to mothers or players benched\nThose entrenched from comfort wrenched\nYearning and pleading will never be quenched.\n\nThis stanza is about the word grasp. - children and mothers grasping each other. Players benched grasping for greatness. Yearning and pleading suggested grasping.\n\nDarkness thrives within our lives,\nThis riddle lets the darkness survive.\nStruggle you may and put up a fight,\nUntil answered, there is no light.\n\nConcluding paragraph suggesting it is really hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheekynorth","date":"2016-07-08T16:32:25.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it {{champion:82}}?","replies":[{"poster":"Mad King Hades","date":"2016-07-08T16:33:40.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 times guessed already.","replies":[{"poster":"Fritterz","date":"2016-07-08T16:36:25.000+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only need to guess Mordekaiser once you fool!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2016-07-08T17:34:08.424+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"FUDGE DUDE WAIT IS IT SOULSTEALER VAYNE?!

Read it again.\n\n\"At the beginning the process begins,\nEnds at the closing of all that has been.\nIt’s when, not if, not if, but when.\nThe wisest of all have serenity within.\"\n\nClosing I interpreted as either the hands of the staff closing or when you used it's active and blew someone up, the closing would mean active is down/enemy is killed.\n\nIt \"ends\" when the game is over, or when the enemy is killed. Possibly also when you buy it and harness it's power.\n\nFigured I'd should mention before I continue, I used every item death related and looked it up on wiki for the image/passives/actives, and Deathfire Grasp seemed to be the most accurate.\n\n\"An emptiness that cannot be filled\nWith fingers reaching that are not instilled\nNever gives, always wants,\nHaunting the bravest, it will daunt.\"\n\nThe hand on the staff/hand thing has magic on it, but the hands are wilted, as if it needs more but can't get it. Hands are self-explanatory, they're reaching out for the magic that they cannot get, the haunt the bravest (enemy mages/the mage you're playing, as it is an assassin mage burst item)\n\n\"Whether children to mothers or players benched\"\n\nA lot of mages used to use this item, from Ahri to well, a child, Annie, and Orianna, who always wanted to join the Field of Justice as a Champion or \"player.\"\n\nThe rest was just me going \"IT HAS TO BE\" and just guessing it cause if I was wrong I could just re-evaluate.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Fritterz","date":"2016-07-08T17:37:23.486+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe anyone answered Deathfire Grasp before you.
