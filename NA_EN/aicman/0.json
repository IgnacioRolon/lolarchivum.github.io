He was playing ranked and his adc was Croat while support on his team was a Serb. When adc found out that his support is Serb (Croatia and Serbia have long history of wars,unions then again wars) he started inting,game didnt even started properly. Adc said &quot;i am not playing with Serb support&quot; and went to jungle stealing camps and giving free kills to enemy team. While doing that he was throwing insults on Serbs. I just can&#039;t belive that someone is keen to int and trol lthe whole game because his teammate in a virtual game is some different nationality. It is kinda funny and sad.
