The only real difference for Taric is that he now gives invulnerability instead of a little extra damage on his ult, and for Malzahar his damage was just shifted into voidlings somewhat while his other stuff is the same.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-10-18T07:28:55.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that more often than not reworks make champions less \"fun\" for former mains. Malz was my most played mid pre rework and now I do not touch him.\n\nThe problem is that in some cases they are reworking Champs to increase their playerbase, in which case they want them to appeal to people they currently do not; and therefore they must change.\n\nIf you like a champion already, then each change is a chance at losing a trait or behavior or aesthetic or what-have-you which you are attracted to for one to which you are not. Therefore the greater the number and scope of the changes the greater the risk (and I would suggest  likelihood) of alienating previous [karma] fans.\n\nI am confident that they at least make in effort to preserve characteristics they THINK people admire in the old champ. This actually causes a problem when they also add as many new \"toys\" as possible to appeal to as many potential new fans as they can. You wind up with kits as overloaded as fully \"new\" champs, which have so many bells and whistles to distinguish themselves from old Champs yet then the old Champs are reworked (erased) and there is no longer a need to be distinguished from them anyway.\n\nOne other problem is when \"they\" decide that a playstyle is \"unhealthy. In this case the rework is specifically intended to remove the playstyle the old [karma] fan enjoyed. This has been systematically reducing my league enjoyment for years, but I continue to deal with it as best I can. \n\nA prime example is Soraka. While many players hate playing against her current iteration more than the last, and the last more than her first, it was riots decision to make her more \"interactive\" (which is something I hate in the first place (now I main Janna)) during the lane phase. What this accomplished (aside from forever killing any enjoyment I got from playing her) was to make her even better at healing then before, but only if she is also damaging (and coincidentally ccing) her opponents. So if played well she is doing too many things, but the specific playstyle  of safe healbotting which some enjoyed and was easier to balance across skill levels was removed.\n\nAnd now the large reworks are also always lore/visual updates as well, which subjectively ruined Trundle and Karma for their \"fans\". This is aside from the point that both are heavily and competitively played now, but mostly by a different group of players than pre-update.\n\nI don't even want to talk about morde !_!\n\nI will say that the Garren rework, the Darius rework, the most recent Ryze rework and to a lesser extent the Yorick and Caitlin reworks have been pretty good at pleasing old \"fans\" while attracting a few new ones.\n\nPoppy, Taric and Sion are not even recognizable anymore game play wise, but at least poppy and Taric look fabulous. I actually enjoy new sion on aram (and only on aram), but old sion was by far my favorite jungler.\n\nThe only jungle I like now is Warwick, and he will be reworked very very soon (and if they remove bloodscent I will simply not jungle anymore)\n\nSorry for the rant and wall of text.\n\nTLDR: I feel ya, but I do think \"they\" are trying.","replies":[]}]}
