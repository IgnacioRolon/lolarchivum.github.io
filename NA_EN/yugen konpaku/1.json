The best way to recover from this is to resolve what's consistently causing you to freeze.  I recommend trying [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode in case of pc stress, but test it in a custom game.  \n\nOtherwise, your network might be unstable and causing you to lose sync from champion select.
