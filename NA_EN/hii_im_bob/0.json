After the game ended I didn't see what I got from the chest. After looking around the forums it seems it was likely an icon and some Orange essence. \n\nIs there anyway I can see which icon I got via crafting history somewhere? It would be kinda nice to have a \"new\" label on new loot, that disappears when you hover over it.\n\nKind regards,\nBob","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-25T18:33:56.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, it should be available in your client store's purchase history.  Just to confirm it looks like you got 150 Orange Essence and a PROJECT: Ekko Icon.
