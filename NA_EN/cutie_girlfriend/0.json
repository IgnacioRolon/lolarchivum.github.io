Really makes me so excited to play support!\r\nOh wait, actually not.\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUW1/4290077976/2159989767656256?tab=overview\r\nJust had a game when both my ADC and the enemy ADC disconnected. Normally, me {{champion:235}}  and the enemy {{champion:63}}  would just take the farm instead of our ADCs, who disconnected. But not with the absolutely HORSESH1T support items that you just gave us, Rito! After a couple of waves, we get a minion gold debuff that fkes us up really hard. I decided to just sell my support item, leaving my team without vision, and the enemy {{champion:63}}  decided to keep it and leave himself without gold. You can see the result.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I get these kind of games really often. My ADC either disconnects, or AFK at base, or dead/back to base all the time, and in such cases, I absolutely HAVE to farm. It's not like i'm stealing anyone's farm, it's like if I don't take it, nobody will. It's absolutely unacceptable to have these support items that just force us to sell them, that don't give you any gold after the first 1000 anyway, and have sh1t stats on top of that.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Kalienor","date":"2019-11-22T08:49:54.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> both my ADC and the enemy ADC disconnected.\n\n**THAT** is what shouldn't have happened. The item is just fine. You can't balance an item around things happening out of the game boundaries. That requires another approach to target the specific game rules that were broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-22T08:46:53.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The game isn't balanced around disconnections.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cind3rkick","date":"2019-11-22T08:36:58.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one forces you to keep the items.","replies":[{"poster":"Azurereaper","date":"2019-11-22T08:43:21.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except you're down like 300 gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-11-22T17:16:24.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Azurereaper,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HAhL3Iif,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-11-22T08:43:21.672+0000)\n>\n> Except you're down like 300 gold.\n\n300 gold you make back by being able to CS.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"blindasleep","date":"2019-11-22T08:51:14.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cind3rkick,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HAhL3Iif,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-11-22T08:36:58.802+0000)\n>\n> No one forces you to keep the items.\n\nIf you don't you lose vision, but I honestly think people will just start selling them and using trinkets, especially if they get into a situation where them farming is needed or just better.
