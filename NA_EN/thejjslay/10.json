I.e. I played with plat level people for my first season playing, and was placed in gold after just a few weeks of play.","replies":[{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2015-09-18T19:22:57.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"any of you guys know old skool arena shooters?\nwell, these are the best. no retarded matchmaking that holds your hand or anything.\njust pure skills. go, play, get destroyed instantly and keep getting destroyed.\n\ni remember 15-20 years ago when me and my friends joined random servers filled with pros and noobs, everybody was having fun, you know, they were other times. you got destroyed? hey who cares, it's a fucking game. i learnt x and y from this match, i can learn more.\n\nwhat do i learn if i play against people of my same level? nothing.\n\nafter months and probably years me and my friends were the ones mopping the floor with noobs in servers","replies":[]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-09-18T19:12:52.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

If you're playing with diamonds against bronzies, it doesn't matter what you do: you'll win. If you're playing with bronzies vs diamonds, you'll lose no matter your performance. These matches are bad for improving. If you're a solo laner, atleast you'll have your laning phase, but if your lane opponent is Challenger and you are silver, you're going to get crushed really fast. I think watching pro players play vs other pro players (in soloQ. LCS/worlds is a completely different META and playstyle) is more useful than playing this matchup.\n\nThe best way to learn is if they're at your level or slightly higher. It's actually quite similar to how you train your muscles. You don't train with the biggest weights you can lift.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2015-09-18T19:20:25.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SHOULD WE PLAY AGAINST PEOPLE WORST THAN US .","replies":[]}]}
