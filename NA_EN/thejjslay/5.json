I cannot understand how someone can call a lane and not know how to win said lane. I cannot understand how someone can not ward. I don't understand how someone can not farm with their \"main\". I can't understand how someone in silver can blame counters on them losing lane. I can't fathom how someone can jungle and not know how to gank. I simply do not get how someone can play mid and not roam. I can't understand why someone who is trying to climb would afk. I do not want to understand people who feed. I can't understand people that get pissed when the jungler doesn't gank for them when they push all game. I can't understand how someone can not group with the team when they need to. I can't understand why people wouldn't protect their carries if they aren't a carry themselves. I don't understand why people can watch someone die to superior numbers then go in themselves in the same fashion. I don't understand why people want to lose game.\r\n\r\nI just need people who want to win their ranked game. That's all I ask for and I cannot get it. \r\n\r\nI've played this game since season 1 and I am quitting. I have finally snapped. After playing with the worst the world has to offer this was the day that broke the camels back so to speak. \r\n\r\nThis game has actually made me anti-social. Not because I wanted to play this more. But because I started assuming everyone was as dumb as the people I played with in league. \r\n\r\nThis game has actually made me depressed after I spent entire summers climbing, then had everything thrown away because promos are flawed in every way.\r\n\r\nBut most of all I'm tired of being told again and again by the match making system that I am bad. No matter how much I play, no matter how much I learn, no matter how well I do, I am only as good as the worst person on the team. There is no individual growth. There is only the random chance that you  get someone as good as you to help you \"carry\" or that you get someone much worse than you who causes the other team to get an advantage.\r\n\"BUT JJ THE OTHER TEAM HAS THIS TOO\" \r\nSo? That is still a 50% chance of losing. That's still a 50% chance you have no chance. That's still a 50% chance that you can't do anything but waste 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nIf we were ranked by ability rather than luck this game would be more fun for everyone. \r\n\"lol scrub just get good\" \r\nThere is only one thing you can do to get good and that is to exploit the other people at your ranks weaknesses. As you go up these become smaller opportunities, and harder to take advantage of. This only applies solo que of course because team ranked is fine as is. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Everyone is dumb, this game is based on luck, fix the ranked system. Goodbye and fuck you all.","replies":[]}
