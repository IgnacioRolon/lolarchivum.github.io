Since you say they it kinda implies you're the carry and that means you're doing the same thing they are :P\n\nOn an actually serious note instead of joking, I found the most success and easy climb out of bronze in using AOE damage and team fight. If everyone is trying to play carry champs bc the community says \"the easiest way to get out of bronze is to play carry champs\" then there are at least 2-3 other champs people are trying to kill in addition to me. I played Hiemer to get out of bronze and 60-80% of the time I'd die in a team fight only to watch as my turrets had put down enough damage that the adc or mid lane (or top I guess if I went mid w/ heimer.... but top is better) cleaned up the fight and we took dragon or a tower or something off of it. I had a game where I was 4-3-16 or something recently and I think all the deaths were late game team fights. Our ADC had a bunch of kills, but I had about 10-20k more damage to champs than her in a game where I had about 40k damage to champs. Learn to put down AOE damage and don't care about getting kills and you'll watch the climb as your teammates get to be the carries because you put down the most damage to champs and set up them kills and objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Riven","date":"2015-04-25T21:46:20.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or the other way around, they think they're being focused, so nobody engages/follow-up/commit in team fights.\n\nWait, that's the same.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-04-25T21:46:08.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's one major issue, another is they don't build good comps.
