Lost 5/10 placements, the first 3 of which had afks in them and got placed into bronze 3 (yeah wtf ik). Now the bug appeared after i was placed into bronze 3. I wasn't able to play at that level. I was feeding and doing terrible, yet a week earlier I had been winning and carrying in gold. I really don't understand guys please help.\nWas I just carried all the way to gold?\nAm I a r%%%%%?\nDid I somehow revert to less than bronze playing style?(doubtful since my normal mmr is still mid gold) ","replies":[]}
