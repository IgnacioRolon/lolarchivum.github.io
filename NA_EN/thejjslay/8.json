Yea, you can make AP trist win a game. You can make AP zed win a game too. Sorry, but AP trist was gutted, plain and simple.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JayHog1992","date":"2016-04-04T09:01:20.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Used to work many years ago, now it's too damn situational that most of the time it's not worth it.","replies":[]}]}
