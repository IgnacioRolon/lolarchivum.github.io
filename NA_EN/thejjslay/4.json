That&#039;s it\r\n\r\nPositive points (Imo)\r\n1.) You can solo an entire team if you are fed and in a good position\r\n2.) The enemy cannot hit you directly without pinks\r\n3.) Can snowball amazingly well\r\n4.) Large damage output on demand\r\n5.) Requires going in to do damage\r\n6.) Spell vamp fo&#039; days\r\nBad points (Imo) \r\n1.) Feed or famine Akali either is fed as hell or irrelevant  \r\n2.) little counter play in lane (and out to lesser extent)\r\n3.) Little skill required (easy to snowball, much like kat) \r\n4.) Hard to catch if you to gank her\r\n5.) Near impossible to get away from if she&#039;s on you\r\n6.) Spell vamp fo&#039; days\r\n\r\nMeh points (Imo)\r\n1.)

It's about establishing playpatterns, counterplay, strengths, weaknesses, etc. I think Akali could use a touch-up on those. It should be clear what you're supposed to do when playing against Akali, and that shouldn't be \"stay far far away from her\". \n\nImho, remembering to buy a pink ward isn't a very interesting counter to her W.\n\nSpellvamp can be fine, but I've always felt it's problematic on her; it makes her very stat-check-y. It'd be more interesting to focus on her W as her tool for escapes if she's in too deep. \n\n**For example: **Remove Spellvamp. Make W smaller and give it two charges. Make her smokescreen targetable by R. Enemies entering the smoke have lower vision range but Akali is de-stealthed. \n\nThat would gives her W a built-in reveal-mechanic; a tactical one rather than a strategic hard-counter one. Engaging enemies have to following her into her smoke to commit for a kill. It also gives Akali the option to escape if she saves one R-dash. Energy-management would be more important. On the other hand, when she engages she is a bit more vulnerable. That forces her to pick her engagements more carefully.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-05-19T09:47:21.481+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dis I like.\nHer passive is the most problematic part about her.

Her W would be useless in teamfight then.

Who knows.\n\nEither way, some extra notes: \n\nI think, between the two, an invisible ally would be less confusing than an ally fighting an invisible enemy.\n\nIn teamfights W would still create crucial moments of respite for Akali; it could be used to stealth from or momentarily nullify ADC's, as an escape route, to blind an enemy trying to engage or be used on an enemy that jumped you to disorient him while you run or R out. \n\nAn enemy wouldn't want to be in the cloud if he could avoid it, as it'd make him blind and somewhat impotent to what's going on outside; no-one would be able to fight well while standing in it. For example, you could bait a Tank into the pool and then jump their ADC while the Tank is disoriented.\n\nIf your enemy risk dying to Akali he wouldn't want to enter at all, even if Akalis health was low. Just like on live.\n\nTwo pools would give you insane juking tools. In and out one pool, R'ing between two pools, running back and forth between two adjacent pools or bush, etc.\n\nAlso, If you were sitting in the pool you'd be able to see if anyone was on their way to enter, at which point you can run out the other way. The vision loss would give you an extra moment to run while they are in the cloud (which could still have the current slowing component).\n\nAt a second glance, the main problem might be it's way too OP.

It would become her identity, and it probably means much of her burst would be moved, and instead she would turn into a hard to catch assassin.\n\nIt would give her proper fall-back patterns and overall make her less one dimensional, it would give her some utility.\n\nBiggest issue with current Akali is that she almost completely lack utility, which is the main fall-back pattern for any champ. Once they do not have enough power they can still do SOMETHING through their utility abilities.\n\nZed have his strong escapes, that allows him to splitpush, and he have slows to do something, and easier get out.\n\nLeBlanc have her roots to do something even as she falls behind, even if it's not as much, she can also play around her mobility as well.\n\nAkali she have her current cloud, which offers a weak slow, and that's it. She is not a very good splitpusher, as she lack escapes and doesn't take towers overly easy, and near turrets she lose to many champs, without her cloud she is not a very good duelist, and many bruisers beat her up.\n\nFor her to be a healthy champ she need something she is strong at, something unique she brings to the table, except just deleting people. I believe a different working smoke bomb could be that thing.\n\nAnother possibility would be to change her E into some sort of CC ability. It's currently borderline useless. If she lost her current passive, got a stronger more versatile W, was given more counterplay on her Q, and overall had much less burst, her current R wouldn't be horrible.\n\nThe issue with her current R is how extremely bursty she is, and how little space opponent have for counterplay.

But changing Akali's style or how she feels/plays as a whole   would turn off her appeal. Although, making her more ninjustu rather than dash and assasinate does sound intriguing, it doesn't solve how the fan base feels about that play style. I'm not sure what you could do to her kit with out making her laning phase worse or some other aspect really difficult to learn her again.\n\nHowever, you could always do little things before you do finally reach a resolution.

Which is quite problematic because there isn't a direct clarification on the amount of work that would go into a rework unless you specify the kit changes. Hearing your main and words rework  together certainly does sound frightening tbh. There are many levels of rework; Xerath, Nidalee, Heimerdinger, Karma, Trundle, etc. Good thing the topic is up for discussion before Riot does anything because change could be good in hindsight but at the same time it could definitely be looked down upon. It's all up in thin air at this point because if the answer is yes she does need a rework, the bigger question would be how. As a player and not a designer we don't have much power when it comes to reworks. Riot definitely has more resources for in-depth analysis on what makes or breaks a champ as time goes on. I'm sure there are a few unhealthy champs they want to work on but don't know how to go about it because of the amount of time and resources needed to make the change without tampering the champs identity or play style.\n\nSidenote: To clarify I don't main Akali, I'm only speaking out my opinion on the situation. I would never speak out on the fan-base's behalf because I have no right to, but I have definitely seen many  people pissed off at some reworks. Normally people just shrug it off and deal with the change or move on to another champion. Usually overtime people will get over it, but I'm glad Meddler asks how we feel about it.

Nothing.  She's on a lot of players hate list for the following reasons:\n\n**1)  Riot's old assassin design** - Basically an 'i win' ultimate justified by 'pre-6 weakness', when the latter is easily addressed by health potions.  Even if you can stay ahead of her in lane, all it takes is one roam and she's suddenly ahead of you.\n\n**2)  Stealth** - No one likes playing against stealth.  Relying on itemization just to _fight_ Akali (you still might lose) blows.  It's even worse than QSS because at least that item counters the enemy's strength.  Getting vision of Akali does nothing to stop her damage.\n\n**3)  Resets **- Just another way to punish players for their teammates not building defense or not leaving a fight when they get low.  This also leads into the next point:\n\n**4)  She warps the game** - Very few champs (usually reset champs) warp the game as Akali does.  Where most league games are a 5v5, games with these champs in them become a 'focus X and pray we have enough resources left over to deal with their other threats'.  I'm not talking about any old squishies here, as the difference between getting a reset and not is larger than the difference between the ADC getting off an extra few autos and not.  \n\n\nNoticeably absent on my list is her passive.  Yea, Riot should probably change it to be consistent with their move against free gold passives, but honestly it doesn't bother me.  You can nerf her passive all you want, the above points are still going to hold true.","replies":[{"poster":"Godhri","date":"2015-05-19T16:47:30.628+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"She's on many players' hate lists because of the \"Me\" concept people seem to have in a \"team\" game.

Why? It's not hard to zone someone out. Most people tend to want to play safe EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THAT IN DOING SO, THEY WILL LOSE THE ADVANTAGE ONCE THEY HIT 6. Learn to zone out your opponent. Learn to apply lane pressure. Learn LANE MECHANICS.\n\n2) I've never had to buy a pink against a stealth champion. Yea, they can stealth so what? I learned to work around it without having to buy a pink. Perhaps you and others should do some thinking too. It might help you learn how to work around it as well. It's called adaptation. Learn it. Use it. It was programmed as a survival tool in our brains for a reason people.\n\n3) Another way to punish someone for not leaving a fight when they get low? What are you EVEN SAYING!?!?

Of course it's logical that you get ahead when you get a kill - my point was that pre-6 weakness is being leaned on too much when alloting Akali's power budget (specifically the giant power spike she gets with ult).  \n\nThe rest of your post is thinly veiled chest thumping being used as a poor defense of Akali.  \n\nThe post I replied to asked why Akali's so unfun to play against and I answered.  The points I listed are more or less specific to Akali, as opposed to your post which is trying to ignore the things that make Akali more annoying to deal with than most.  \n\nFor example, you ask why players can't just focus the damage dealer.  Well, when that champion has stealth and resets, it's both harder to focus them and more punishing when you fail.\n\nThose resets are precisely the reason that your teammates refusing to leave a fight when they are low is worth bringing up in Akali's case beyond just pointing out that those teammates made a mistake - because you get actively punished for it.  \n\nStupid teammates are also worth noting because even if you are a stealth-countering god who never needs pinks (*cough*bullshit*cough*), your teammates might not be, and that stealth is going to impact their play too.\n\nI already explained my stance on her pre-6 weakness, but just to be clear, her kit has very little room for counterplay and because it also has great ease of target selection, it boils down to a gear check a lot of the time, which makes for very dull lanes.  Don't try to ignore the important parts of this point - she's not every assassin because not every assassin has point-and-click long-range gapclosing, so they can actually be outplayed.  She's not every champion with a good ultimate, as those ultimates can also be outplayed or actually have meaningful cooldowns.  She's not every champion with point-and-click abilities either, as a lot of these champs lack the burst that Akali gets.

A gameplay passive would be recommended, something that allows her to spell weave, give her decision points for trades, chases and teamfights within her rotations. \n> \n> 2. She needs a combo. While E proccing Q was a bad thing, it made her more interesting to play because it gave her inter-spell interaction. Gave her options along the lines of Yasuo Q-E combo. The problem with the E proc is that it was almost always the better option. I'd like to see an interaction return, but with more depth than a proc.\n> \n> 3. Her E is simply bland. I know it's difficult to come up with something different as I've brainstormed on a few options within a set of requirements, but this is truly the greatest point of improvement that Akali can have. Resources are best put here. \n\nHer Q and R used to be broken, but with all the changes to them, they now have better risk/reward distributions and R even has counterplay now. No changes needed here. Similar with W, though the low level MS increase in W really needs to be higher.\n\nCredibility: Akali enthusiast since season 1","replies":[{"poster":"Trumpet","date":"2015-05-19T13:28:24.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Everyone has that one super item though that they cannot afford to omit from their build.\n\nBut Akali's synergy with gunblade is even better than a Zed with BotRK or a Fizz with Lich Bane.

Playing against Akali, means you either need a team to help kill her, you need to stay far away from her, or you win the stat-check battle against her.\n\nFighting Akali is closer to a stat-check than anything else, and she have several things that makes her very uninteresting to fight against.\n\nA. She gains lifesteal/spellvamp. This means when she is attacking a squishy she becomes deceptively tanky, and you need to massively outdamage her, and tanks can't kill her, as they rely on wittling opponent down, and she just heals off of them.\n\nB. She turns invisible in her cloud, and it is quite binary in a fight. If you have sweeper or pink ward, the skill become borderline useless to Akali and she turns much much more vulnerable as she relies on waiting for cooldowns a bit. On the other hand if there is no way to see her, she becomes extremely hard to deal with. It's a very binary interaction.\n\nC. More or less a team is required to fight her, but if there is a team around, she struggles big time unless extremely fed. When enemy have exhaust, shields, CC, see-invis, she can't do much about it. She have no fall-back pattern. In case there is not a team, she just kills the target, without much of any interaction, unless she is too weak to do that, then she just fails and can't do much.\n\nD. Limited moments of weakness. Her Q have so short cooldown, it's pretty much always up. Her R being down is just temporary, and with all the stacks she can have it's very hard to play around it, and it's easy for Akali to conserve her stacks until a fight. Ahri have the working version of Akalis ultimate, with clear moments of weakness, and forcing usage of Ahri's ultimate is a big thing. With Akali, forcing usage of one stack is not a big deal, and making her use all her stacks is extremely hard.\n\nE. Low interaction with her. Akali have her main damage tools being her Q and R, both are point and click targeting. If you are within range, you will be hit, and with 3 stacks of her R, you can't escape her, doesn't matter if you have dashs and flash, there is no getting away, as she match your movement with her dashs. Only way to get away is to get under a tower, and win the fight there, or have her give up. There is extremely limited amount of outplay possible against her.\n\nWhat Akali needs is some combos, more tools, utility and weaknesses. She need to be able to fail, or succeed at a tactical level, and less amount of her power in simple point and clicks. I don't think she can be fixed without a rework, of at least Veigar/Zilean size. Shifting power back and fourth doesn't solve her issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Godhri","date":"2015-05-19T16:21:46.340+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"There's plenty of counterplay for her.

Yes point and click is frustrating but it's not impossible to win against otherwise Annie/Katarina would be invincible in mid lane.\n\nThe problem with balancing champions is that the data collected for knowing whether a champion needs balancing or not is skewed by smurfs. How so? People smurf and beat up on less experienced and less skilled players. Said players being less experienced and less skilled complain and attempt to make valid points about why said champion is OP.\n\nEveryone wants to think they are right but no one considers the variables that affect their arguments and Smurfing is a major one.

Those two things are super super Iconic to Akali. Her Q is honestly just there to gate her damage and control her gameplay. Her E is just an energy sink and a way to farm late game.\n\nHell, if the left Akali's kit the same, but made it so that she can't \"BUY\" spell vamp (IE, no gunblade, no wota, etc.) and forced Akali to build AD for spell vamp, I'd be okay with that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadowhunter4444","date":"2015-05-19T15:50:13.332+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali is the first Champion I bought, and my main up until her recent nerfs (after which I still love her, but have been focusing on improving my top lane play so haven't gotten used to it yet). I feel she's actually in a pretty nice place right now. I enjoy her mechanics, as they go beyond what everyone seems to think about. Sure she's very binary, with few combos and a stat matchup, but the true skill in playing Akali comes in picking your fights, using limited tools to escape rough situations with a bit of luck and positioning, and planning your fights.\n\n----------\nGood points for Akali:\n----------\n\nAnalysis is critical, as you have to decide who to jump on, where you plan to escape, how will you do it, and then evolve that plan as the fight rapidly progresses. I give that the fight itself is very simple, but her planning is more complex than most.\n\nIn the new tank meta, a stat-check isn't so bad. It forces Akali to play as an assassin. She shouldn't be trying to take on tanks, she should be on the prowl for squishies. It help to clearly define her role.\n\nShe might not have a lot of counterplay, but she's not Zed. You can't just escape from a sticky situation, your actions have consequences. Also, CC her, she's dead.\n\nI find her spell-vamp positive, as it allows her to attack the bursty people that should be her targets in the first place.\n-----------\nBad points for Akali:\n-----------\n\nAs mentioned above, she has problems with feed-or-famine and binary fights.\n\nRecent changes to her E have made it incoherent with the rest of her kit. That needs to be changed. maybe give it a long cooldown, a high energy cost, and a vortex effect, drawing enemies in to further prevent escape.\n\nVery little counterplay. If you're a squishy champ, you die. If not, you live.\n\nOn the negative side of spell-vamp, tanks have a harder time against her, but they usually can just build MR and do fine long enough to fall back to tower or get help.\n\n----------------\nI realize that I mentioned some points in both categories, but I'm giving the upsides and downsides to those points.\n----------------\n\nIn summary, Akali has problems, but they feed into her strengths and identity. Her E needs work, but otherwise she's pretty solid. I for one would be sorely disappointed if she were reworked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Godhri","date":"2015-05-19T06:49:41.370+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't main her but I think she is at a good point. The fact that she MUST auto in order to trigger her Q now is a good thing. Before when I used to play akali pre-rework, it was easy for me to win ANY lane match up simply from making plays. I could win against kat, LB, and virtually any other laner aside from Fizz whom I didn't have a chance to face. I haven't really played her enough post-re work so it is hard to say how she is now, but as a well seasoned plat 5 mid main, I can say from general experience and theory crafting that she is in a decent place.\n\nSure she does high damage still but she is an assassin. This is what she is meant to be doing. That's not the issue. The issue was the counter play and it is definitely more there now than it was before. The need to auto to trigger her Q gives more time for reacting to her. Proper judgment will determine whether you can counteract an engage from her or not. That is, if you're a squishy champion like adc, you really shouldn't be engaging her 1v1 or even 2v1 unless one of you has cc.\n\nTo me, she's just like some of the other typical assassins {{champion:55}} {{champion:91}} . They have weak early game but scale well into late game if they are left unchecked. Assassins should scale well into late game, especially with the current meta being a tank meta. Other assassins should follow this example in my opinion; like {{champion:7}} {{champion:238}}, both of whom are well capable of becoming lane dominant after level 2. Of course this could also be said of {{champion:55}} , but she requires a bit more skill to be played as a lane dominating champion at level 2 or 3 (yes this is possible as I've done so on VERY many occasions).\n\nI suppose if you really wanted to make a change on her, you could increase the delay in her ability to recast her ult to give players more breathing room. I mean with her E being at 1 second at max rank, I think it is justifiable to increase her ult delay slightly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2015-05-21T07:59:51.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably gonna farm a lot of downvotes but whatever.\n\nWhat's really annoying is that nobody really seems to understand her.  A lot of common arguments made towards Akali's balance are:\n1) If she has the numbers she kills you.\n\nThat can really be said about any Assassin.  Leblanc a little fed?  You're dead.  Zed has an item or two?  You're dead.  Kat got Luden's with a slight lead?  You're dead.  Talon?  You're dead.  And so on and so forth.  That's how Assassins work.  If they have the numbers and enough items to do a good amount of damage and they miraculously get passed all of the peel the carries get then you should die.  That's just how it is with Assassins whether you like it or not\n\n2) Never ending kill pressure.\n\nThe problem with this is that she has no kill pressure whatsoever until level 6.  She used to have some kill pressure against melees pre 6 but that ended when E Mota proc was removed.  The reality is, although she may have some kill pressure after her ult, other champions have much higher kill pressure throughout the whole game.  Leblanc has kill pressure starting from level 2 and on.  Kat and Zed can poke you down as they please until they are ready to go in.  Fizz has arguably the best level 1 out of all Assassins and once he hits 6 even without his ult up he can still kill you easily.  The point is, when compared to other Assassins, Akali's kill pressure is sub par at best.\n\n3) Muh Spellvamp\n\nAll Assassins have some means of staying alive and since her shroud has been nerfed to hell and is hilariously unreliable she needs the spellvamp to help her not get destroyed in fights.\n\n4) She can pentakill your whole team ezpz xd\n\nNo.  She really can't unless she completely outplays your whole team or you're just bad.  Her teamfight is sub par at best because of how unreliable her shroud is.  Another thing people don't understand is that once she's in, she's in.  Unless she can jump to a minion (highly unlikely) then she is not getting out.  Meanwhile, Leblanc can instantly port back after her job is done, Zed can blink back to his shadow out of a fight when he's done, you can't do jack shit to Kat when she's teleporting all over the place, Fizz has his trollpole, and even Talon has a somewhat reliable escape.  Akali doesn't.  \n\nDon't forget that she is one of the few Assassins that cannot 100-0 her target unless incredibly fed.  She has always been an assassin that takes 2 spell rotations to kill her target meaning you have plenty of time to react in a teamfight.  Other Assassins like Zed, Leblanc, and Talon just dump their load on you instantly and you die with little to no time to react.  Akali takes much longer making her teamfight all that much weaker.\n\n****\n\nTo be honest even when she's strong she is still one of the weakest Assassins at best.  All I really want are for the ult change to be completely reverted (no amount of tinkering with it will ever make it not terrible to play with) and her E to proc Mota again (prep for the downvotes).  I honestly don't even want E to proc Mota again just because it would be a buff.  I want it to proc it again so her E is actually useful and she doesn't feel clunky as fuck to play as.  I used to really love playing Akali but after all these changes she just feels really terrible and I play her less and less because of how clunky she is as well as how unfun she is to play as.  Just give her those two things and then you can go ahead and destroy her when you rework her a few seasons from now.\n\nBring on the downvotes m8s","replies":[{"poster":"Selrick002","date":"2015-05-21T20:05:46.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For some reason I cant up-vote this so I'll post this comment.
