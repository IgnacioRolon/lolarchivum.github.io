Mid roaming is no different then a random jungler, so you only have your self to blame.  \n\nIf you win top invade enemy jungler as much as you can and take his Creeps to keep him behind when you push lane. High Mobile champs would be idea.\n\nif your Mid, pick top roaming champions who have a high success rate for a double kill bot or someone that can instant gib someone undertower.\n\nADC play someone that has high pushing power so you can split push or farm quickly when needed.\n\nSupport, play a carry support like Zyra or karma who can bully a adc and or support out of lane several times putting them behind. \n\nJungler, Someone with CC and Damage. Try and pay attention to bot lane more. Better 3 fed people in game then 2 and having dragon control is crucial. \n\nDont back on every little thing. Example:  I roam bot... I got a double kill... I still have health, mana. I am going back to mid and farm until i back.  Doing so will give you a level advantage as well","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-04-09T04:43:17.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solo Carring =/= 1v5 pentakill.\n\nJust saying.","replies":[{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2015-04-09T07:06:49.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah solo carrying is being able to lead your team into a fight and actually win the fight rather than lose.","replies":[]}]}]}
