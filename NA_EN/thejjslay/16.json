Every game I play now feels like the same thing over and over and over and I'm tired of it. From what I can tell there is no improvement to be gained from playing against people very near the level you are at. Most games boil down to who has the more reliable team (I.e no feeds afkers or people who simply don't understand mechanics) and it gets tiring when you can tell at 15 minutes the game is going to go for another half a hour and you will lose. This isn't really asking questions, its just me voicing my opinions for the night crawlers to look at. G'dnight gd","replies":[]}
