If we can organize well I never surrender no matter how far behind we are. If my teammates are constantly within enemy Blitz pull range, try to back when enemies can easily reach them, keep diving at bad times and _understanding_ what I'm saying when I say they're diving, overextending, (or don't think they are) then I'll usually throw in the towel. If you're behind, you all need to be able to capitalize on weaknesses. In games like that, they never do in my experience. They just keep feeding or overextending and we're in a constant state of 3-4v5 with the enemy 3 levels ahead of us.\n\nThe only other time, and this is highly situational, is if my teammates have given up. If they've given up already, they almost never do well -especially if they throw in the towel early over nothing. No reason to cry over a few deaths. You can still hold lane against that. Self-defeatism is always something I'm aware of. I usually just try to convince them to group and get them in a winning teamfight to give them back the confidence they need to finish. You can't convince some people though. Just no helping some people.\n\n2 afk's is unwinnable imo.\n\n1 afk is workable depending on the game. If we're all trading even and we're 1 down, their 5th is eventually going to be problem. Never played a game where the 5th member hasn't been a game-closing nuisance.

Say, for instance, if all our lanes lose and the enemy mid Ryze gets stupidly fed. That's un-winable to me, since a fed Ryze has no counters except hard CC, and a lot of it. We would basically have to catch Ryze alone, with our whole team, while the remaining 4 enemies go after no objectives. \n\nThe types of champions who can build tanky and still have a tone of damage are the major things I look at when looking to FF. If it's a fed ADC, you can just assassinate them. Same goes for any mage or assassin. Get them right away, and you can probably win a teamfight. Someone like Ryze or Vlad or Mundo (at least the way I build him) or Renekton, the only solution is to focus them down. If your whole team is behind, then that amount of focus just gives the rest of the enemy team the time to wipe the floor with you. \n\nBasically, if the majorly fed enemy is some sort of squishy, they could make a mistake and you could catch a lucky break by killing them quickly. If it's someone who is just naturally tanky while still having a ton of damage (Ryze is the biggest offender here), they just have a straight numbers advantage on you. There's nothing to be done, unless the enemy team just lets you win. If the stars align and you lose every lane and they are running champs that don't get punished harshly by mistakes, then yeah, I consider that unwinnable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"a Friendly Troll","date":"2015-04-27T00:08:05.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Duo queue on your team","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-04-27T02:15:23.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"When you're teammates suck and you aren't playing a splitpusher.","replies":[]}]}
