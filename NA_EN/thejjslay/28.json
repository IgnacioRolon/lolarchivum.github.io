I do agree that 3-4 people should not be placed against a bunch of randoms and perhaps 1 duo queue.\n\nI haven't had the experience of being the random in a 4-man premade yet, but I've heard a lot of stories like yours that it's basically a dogpile if you don't toe their line.","replies":[{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2014-12-04T00:37:28.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had a game where they took a brand new player up to gold level and put him as my support.
