I stopped playing for awhile came back did a few practice games in normals did fine. Went to do placements. Lost all 10. 5 to afks and 3 to teams with less than 20 kills to their 50-60 deaths. The last 2 I was so on tilt I couldn't think and idk what ended up happening there  but the result was 10 lost placement matches. I got placed in bronze 1. Now understandably I was upset. I took a break and got off tilt and went to go start climbing out. I PHYSICALLY CANNOT CLIMB IT IS WIN 1 LOSE 2 WIN 2 LOSE 2. I got to gold in season 3 using the \"your team isn't there to help you they are there to drag you down you have to solo carry every game in order to win\" mindset. \r\nNow my question is,  how? How do i play so that i can climb? How do I deal when the bot lane feeds? what do I do when top or jungle feeds? Because my strategy of being fed enough to overcome their feeding the enemy just doesn't work anymore.","replies":[]}
