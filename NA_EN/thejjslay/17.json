Meaning you must have lost so much in G5 that your MMR was almost Silver 5 which would have demoted you out of Gold anyway. Anyway, if you were actually anywhere near Gold in skill you should have no issue getting to Gold again.","replies":[{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2015-01-25T02:09:51.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know i can get back there it's not the point I'm just saying the 200 games it's going to take is going to make me want to die.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-01-25T02:15:52.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are Gold level it won't take you 200, 100, or even 50 games. At a reset you get huge gains for your first bunch of wins, I don't know how many exactly, and you can skip divisions, you can even skip league promotion sets. Last year my placements were during the Feb-May server crap-out where every game for those months was basically screwed and I got shrekt to Silver because of every single game being a 2v5/3v5/4v5/crash. It took me what? Under 15 games to get to Gold again?","replies":[{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2015-01-25T03:59:48.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I noticed that I won my last 3 games and I'm already in promos","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WÃ®nter Fox","date":"2015-01-25T02:40:48.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So...you're going to level up another account and play against worse-than-Bronze, new players?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2015-01-25T02:08:39.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obligatory can I have it?","replies":[]}]}
