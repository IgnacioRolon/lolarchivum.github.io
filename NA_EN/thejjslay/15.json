You can do this by launching league of legends, and BEFORE you press the play button, click the gear icon in the top right corner of the PvP.net client. Then push \"Repair.\" There may also be something wrong with your firewall settings that are preventing you from connecting to the chat servers, I would recommend checking out the [patcher troubleshooting guide](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/28732434-Patching-Issues) on the Riot Support site. Specifically the steps in the \"***Troubleshooting issues with the patching process***\" section. All those steps there could help resolve the problem.\n\n{{champion:21}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2014-07-19T20:32:18.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd really like this fixed if anyone can offer some insight that'd be great.","replies":[]}]}
