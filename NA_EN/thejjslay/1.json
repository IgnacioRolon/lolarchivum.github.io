This \"rework\" was a complete failure in every way. Veigar has by far the worst laning phase in the game, a useless ability that used to be a stun, and a skillshot q which is arguably better but not by much. If you want to know exactly why he sucks so much now you can browse the forums or go on reddit and look up the newest veigar posts. I sincerely hope you guys dont try to \"buff\" this crap reworked version of him and just revert him back to how he was, or even nerf his stun time or whatever the hell convinced you that the 6% pick rate yordle was OP and had to be gutted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spinothalamic","date":"2015-02-22T09:34:20.152+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Props to meddler, guys.
