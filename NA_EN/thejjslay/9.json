How about I start with the kind I am? Yeah that sounds good. \r\n\r\nHi I'm James I go by TheJJSlay ig and I have been playing this game since season 1 and have put in more than 1500$ into this account. Last season i actually started to hardcore play ranked and I managed to climb as far as Gold 5 but I soon was back into silver 1 after a few lost games in a row. I ended the season on that note, that was 3 or 4 weeks before the end of the season, I of course play every once in a while never as much as I had mid season. \r\n   When the new season rolled around I was excited about getting my new rank, hoping to get placed straight into gold and just climb as far as I could from there, after hearing the tales of how good teammates were up there I was understandably excited. My first 3 promo's I had afks. That was to be expected though and I pushed through losing my next 2 as well but due to poor playing by myself and my team. I won the next 5 in a row and on the last game I was figuring since I had a rough time at the start I'd get something like silver 3 or 4. hahahahahahahahahhahahahaha... nope. I was placed in bronze 3. The entire season long climb completely gone. I was understandably upset and played my first few games on tilt when I really shouldn't have.\r\n  \r\n   Now that it is a few weeks into the season I am still in bronze 3 I am playing bad and I can feel myself getting worse with every passing day.\r\n\r\n   This is why I am toxic, I have played since season 1; I have tried and succeeded getting better, but my rank doesn't reflect any kind of effort on my part. ***It tells me that I am just as good as the people who have only played since the middle of last season. It tells me all the time I have spent on this game were wasted and worthless.*** I look at my teammates who go 0/5 in the first 10 minutes and actually get sad and angry that I have to play with these people after having \"put in my dues\" for the last few years. I get so angry that I actually play worse that most people in ranked at the bronze level, yet I go back to normals and play with mid gold people and dominate. I guess what I'm trying to say is making me play with lower ranked people makes me toxic because I expect them to play at the gold level that I am used to yet they play at the level they actually are.\r\n\r\n   I'm not saying i deserve a higher rank just because I believe I am better than the current one, I am saying I deserve it because I have put in the work for it and shouldn't have to spend an entire season re-climbing and working my ass off ***JUST TO GET BACK TO WHERE I WAS BEFORE PROMOS!***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I am toxic because I feel like all the effort I put into this game is \r\nwasted and worthless and I take it out on teammates","replies":[]}
