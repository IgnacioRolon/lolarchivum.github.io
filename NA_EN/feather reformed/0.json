The entire game was frozen and we waited 3 minutes before we disconnected and tried to reload the client. The game never appeared in our match history, there was no option to reconnect, and the client allowed us to queue up for another game. One of my friends checked the server, and everything seemed to be online.\nI added the random who was supporting me, and saw they'd already queued up for another game, so I'm assuming they must've also experienced the same thing. \nI'm writing this about 5 minutes after, and OP.gg says my teammates and I are [still in game.](http://imgur.com/a/trIon)\nAny explanation for what happened? It all feels pretty surreal, lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-25T21:47:59.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty rare, but you guys just experience a type of 'ghost game'. For some strange reason, the game died and everyone was dropped out. Since that match completely ended from the crash, you won't ever see it pop up in match history, but it's 'ghost' is still hanging around so it looks like you're still in a match. You should all be able to requeue just fine, and won't incur any kind of penalties from that game.","replies":[]}]}
