Everything would be a thousand times better, and way more fun. People being toxic is not an exclusive to league of legends. People are assholes everywhere, the game itself rarely matters. And also, don&#039;t say you could always just type. Typing messages to my team should not be a gameplay mechanic. I just wanna talk. If you have too, allow me to add everyone as a friend before a game starts and make a chat. I just don&#039;t get it. In a game where every second counts as far as I can tell. You&#039;re supposed to type, actively stop moving around to communicate. This could be done and should be.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-03T22:29:07.506+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voicechat is external opt-in. Riot cant police voicechat, anything i it would be unreportable, and it just turns into a place for preteen brats to scream their existential anger into the void.\n\nSee Overwatch.","replies":[{"poster":"ThumbDrives","date":"2018-08-03T23:04:53.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's to stop you from muting everyone? If that's how you see things. your not being forced to do anything. Imagine if it was opt in. You would start a game without voice. You could click a button if you desire.

It is useless and would cause more trouble than it is worth. Pubs never try to communicate anyway.
