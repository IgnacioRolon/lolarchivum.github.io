This time, Microsoft decided that it would be a great idea to change how my PC runs games I guess. I launch a game and then my screen goes black and says \"NOT SUPPORTED FORMAT\" and then I have to manually shut my computer off because I can't get out of the game with any sort of command. \r\n\r\nI've reinstalled League twice and I don't really know what the problem is or why my computer is doing this. I had a bandaid fix before by mucking around in the configuration files, but I would really like to be able to play full screen consistently and without having to change my configuration file every time I decide to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T01:39:42.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That format not supported message usually only happens when there's some kind of random mismatch between the resolution your monitor is running at and what's saved in the config files. Try giving those a hard reset really quickly and let me know if this helps or not.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Weemwomp","date":"2017-12-30T01:26:23.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I deleted the config folder and launched the game, but was met with a black screen. Note that I am not able to access my computer at all if the game black screens me; I can't alt+f4, I can't alt+tab, and I can't ctrl+alt+del. I have to just shut the machine off because nothing works.","replies":[]}]}]}
