I&#039;ve had my fun and made some great friends while kept in touch with others.\r\nBut spending over thousands of hours playing, trying to become a better player, and spending as much as $800 on this game for skins (Both for myself and for others) has ultimately gotten me nowhere, perhaps even further back than where I have started.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to watch such a great company fall piece by piece. \r\nFrom the multiple events and over-hyped sales in order to drain as much money as possible. \r\nTo the completely unbalanced champions, the re-work and the re-classification of champions over &amp; over serves nothing more than the frosting hiding the actual cake. \r\nFrom nerfing champions over and over, to changing items over and over, Riot has not shifted its focus from making as money as possible to making the game as balanced as possible.\r\nFrom the unbreakable tank Ekko who can shred a full-tank Shyvana with 0 AP, to the silence-removed Talon who struggles in laning phase more than ever. \r\nBut all we players can do is to try and ban these champions and not play others, and constantly hearing &quot;We are constantly working to improve the system.&quot; \r\n\r\nJust now, I was in a ranked game as Shaco jungle. In recent games, I was an extremely toxic player who couldn&#039;t cope with other&#039;s incompetence, a few kills behind and I would be angered and start to trash talk. \r\nOf course, the Tribunal magically sees this (Despite not being able to see the 1000 other reports I&#039;ve made about players that are just as toxic as me), and gives me the chat restriction. \r\nI am not complaining since I was at fault to begin with. \r\n\r\nBut seeing a 2-11 Caitlyn, a 1-12 Leona, someone who obviously fails to make the correct tactical decisions and throws the entire game despite me taking 4 towers, dragon, baron steal, a Penta Kill (I am not trying to brag about how good I am, I am only a Gold) , and blaming me at the end of the game. \r\n\r\nFor all these years, I had faith in League of Legends, \r\nBut this company (Not the individuals), they have done nothing, absolutely nothing, to make me feel better.\r\n\r\nI am utterly disappointed in the system, I was an ordinary gamer and now, 4 years later with the League, I have become what I hated the most (Toxic, angry loser who gets mad at a simple video game). I am now part of this cancerous community that Riot seems to not care at all for. Clearly they&#039;re doing at least something for punishing bad language, but they are most definitely not trying to prevent what makes bad language happen in the first place: Bad playing.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the ranking system is not only inaccurate, but flawed in many ways as well. \r\n\r\nYears of having to deal with bad team-mates, whether AFK, verbal abuse, or just simply unskilled. And knowing that others suffer the same things I do, has ultimately lead to to this forum,\r\n\r\nI will retire from this game I initially loved soon. I am done with League of Legends and its cancerous community. I am done wasting my time over and over, trying fight against this black hole that sucks money and time out of me while giving me nothing in return but chat restrictions and 2-11 Caitlyns. \r\n\r\nI am done trying to play this game just to simply spend some time with long-distance friends, and I am most definitely done telling other people to play this game. \r\n\r\nThe community is so cancerous, and the company is so bad, that I am sacrificing one of the most fun game plays, art works, and all my friends I&#039;ve made on the game. \r\n\r\nI can only admit that I am too weak and not big-hearted enough to just &quot;Play a simple game and have fun&quot;. \r\nI apologize in advance to the neckbeards living in their mother&#039;s basements, the middle-schoolers who has an intense obsession with having sexual intercourse with people&#039;s mothers, as well as the girls who only play to get the genitalia of males, if I have offended you in any way shape or form.\r\nPlease do not think about suicide, because you are not worth the dirt you will be buried in.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-04-25T11:34:31.558+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"With your behavior, you definitely won't be missed.\nGood riddance.","replies":[{"poster":"ÐetectiveDøllårs","date":"2016-04-26T06:34:02.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you read the part where I typed\n\"I got banned and I'm not blaming anyone because it was my fault\"\nAnd\n\"I hated what I've become from a good player to a toxic one\"\n\nBecause if you read that, you'd know I'm not supporting toxicity. \nAnd yea, I won't be missed, definitely not by Riot, one player quitting won't make any difference in their revenue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-04-25T10:16:19.828+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have no way to say they've not been punished.
