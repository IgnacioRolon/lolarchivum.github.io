Figured i would appeal to you guys for help. \n\nThis issue began with the preseason update\n\nI'll be in game going fine and then hit 200-330 ms for a few seconds during the game and then back down. It'll happen 2-3 times during the game. I am on Ethernet , On a good computer and on a secure network. Tried everything on my end to solve the issue so if you have ideas of what it could be or a possible fix or even the same issue please... Let me know how to mitigate this.\n\nComp specs\ni7-4790k\ngtx 1070\n16 gb ram\n1tb HD (bulk storage)\nthen another 500 gb SSD (Which the game runs off of)\n\nISP: Cox\n\nEdits: \n\nI kept a resource monitor open during a game and nothing spiked in resources or demanded bandwidth when this occurred each time.\n\nDisabled all non windows services..

Since you're this far into troubleshooting this with those techs I'd definitely stay in touch with them.\n\nFor my own opinion since you're here, I'm curious to know how League would run if it were installed on the *default* HD. Could you reinstall it there if possible and test how it runs there?","replies":[{"poster":"Has No Team","date":"2018-01-16T05:15:59.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was the same issue thus why i used the Hextech repair tool for a clean uninstall/reinstall to the new drive.","replies":[]}]}]}
