It just doesn't go away when you hit \"accept\"?  To be honest, it's the first time I've heard of that particular issue.\n\nFrom the way you've described it, I think the cause could be one of two issues:\n\n1. The patcher is being blocked from completing the patch due to a permissions issue.\n-For help in updating your permissions settings check out our article on [Permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)\n\n2. A connection error is causing the acceptance of Terms of Use to not register.\n-To help address connection issues, follow the steps in our [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) article\n\nReally, I'd go ahead and try changing your permissions settings first as it's a much quicker process.  Let me know if either one of these steps help!","replies":[{"poster":"xkidsmeal","date":"2016-05-24T04:00:55.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no i hit accept and it pops up like 2 to 3 more times then goes away and nothing happens.  i have to go thou this loop like 5-7 times to get it to finally work\n once it goes thou everything is fine","replies":[]}]}]}
