Like, I can pretty much guarantee that they won't.\n\nIf you don't know, the traditional skins (like Trundle and Karma) sometimes get made during the transition of a major champion rework.  Since these champions had a large and vocal following prior to the rework, Riot was kind enough to keep the spirit of their pre-update forms intact for those who hold them near and dear to our hearts.\n\nThat's why these skins aren't available to the public- they want to move forward with their new vision for the champion, but let people who played and loved the old versions hold onto a piece of that nostalgia.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2015-01-09T17:33:25.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"mystery gift. it is a legacy skin so it can be brought back when riot seems fit, but for now none of the traditional skins have been brought back to the store yet!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-01-09T19:01:21.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah, those skins are Legacy and can only be gotten from Mystery Gifts at the moment.
