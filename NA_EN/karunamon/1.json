They&#039;re headed back up the lane, running home, one chasing the other, both champions having already burned flash.  You now have a decision to make: you&#039;re in the jungle closest to where the enemy is running to. if you jump out in front of them you will certainly get the kill. Your ADC is ranged, so if the other guy misclicks, they&#039;re toast.\r\n\r\nYou believe your ADC isn&#039;t going to secure the kill - no flash, no gap close. You jump out and nail the guy. ADC immediately flames you in chat &quot;omg ks!!!!1&quot;.\r\n\r\nBurning questions:\r\n\r\n* Should you have done that?\r\n* Is kill stealing a big deal? (What&#039;s more important: That the enemy dies, or who kills him?)\r\n* How can you deal with a player who&#039;s upset that you &quot;stole&quot; or _stole_ their kill?","replies":[{"poster":"Revali","date":"2016-09-04T01:17:17.660+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my eyes\n\nks just spreads more gold around the team. \n\nmoneys money.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-09-04T01:30:12.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"KS Does **not** matter, people are just greedy and want to carry all the time.

You coming in and disrupting that is gonna get people pissed off and rightfully so. \n\nAlso if you're taking kills from your ADC and sticking them on your low damage Jungler, you're also hurting your team and preventing your ADC from scaling harder and potentially snowballing their lane. It's very common in LCS games to see teams intentionally try to get their ADCs or Mid Laner fed because they need gold the most.","replies":[{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2016-09-04T02:16:12.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Whole idea of the 1v1 is to see who's the more skilled of the two players.\n\nThis is a big thing for me. i'll have a random jungler want to gank my top lane and i tell them to leave me alone until i request it. its because i'm judging their timing, skill and looking for patterns i can abuse during a fight.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-09-04T02:04:44.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, taking the kill in that situation (or at least getting an assist) would be better for your team.\n\nOtherwise, the assist gold is just lost entirely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-09-04T01:57:40.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right up until they are dueling and the \"losing side\" manages two consecutive crits that net him a kill I could have prevented.\n\nSometimes you just gotta be safe and then use the faster kill time for more uptime doing an objective.

If you're looking to go around KSing people and not have people get pissed off, it won't happen. Especially if they were even with the guy and could have been ahead and now you've taken away their advantage. The \"Oops didn't think you were gonna get it\" might defuse them or it might not.
