Making intentionally Flawed MM?\n\nIt isn't exactly a conspiracy theory to state that Riot will.. maybe rig is too strong of a word, but *control* matchmaking in such a way as to prioritize many different things over game quality - likely engagement.\n\nA priority towards game quality would, off the top of my head:\n\n* **Absolutely never** give players matches outside of a sane MMR bracket.. challengers in plat games, diamonds in silver games - that last one happened to me [and I have the screenshot to prove it](https://i.imgur.com/Hi30qL0.png).\n* Visibly handle odd game conditions with an aim to recognizing the skill disparities those conditions cause (autofilled players in impactful roles, modified MMR/rank calculation on players leaving - your rank should reflect *reality* at the end of the day)\n* Allow people to see their own current skill level *as matched* by the system\n* Make it a priority to remove smurfs, trolls, and chronic disconnectors from the ladder in a way that otherwise honest players don't have to put up with their demonstrably negative impact on their ratings.\n* Nuke the concept of \"promotion/demotion\" games from orbit and salt the earth\n\nThere are many things Riot could be doing to make matchmaking better for every player. Those things aren't being done. In fact, as best as I can tell, there are no meaningful changes to matchmaking being made, period. The last thing we were told about is the positional matchmaking from last seasons.\n\nThat leads naturally into the question of \"Why?\" and the easy answer is \"engagement == money\". That goes double when they go out of their way to hide that information ***and take the extra step of preventing anyone else from trying to estimate that information*** (see API terms of service).\n\nIf everything is above board, why hide?\n\n> We got folks with 1,000 + games going on they are better then their ranks. I climbed thru the same bracket that season in exactly 50 matches. Playing supports. Because people insisted it was impossible and I don't know what the \"Lower\" Elo experience was like. Disagreed. Proved what I said by fucking doing it.\n\nIf you have 1000 games in a season, we're beyond the point of the things I'm complaining about. That's 500ish hours of League and more than enough time for the matchmaker to stop jerking you around and have your MMR and your rank close to each other. My gripe is about the system's ~~inability~~ programmed unwillingness  to do this for more casual players who can't put in literal months worth of game time in every single season.\n\n> But much more then that, I don't want them on my team or in my games giving up and wasting my time because boo fucking hoo 1 lane lost better soft int and whine about Rito keeping them down. It. I blame that player for their fucking shitty behavior. Same way I blame people who flame for flaming or Feed for feeding. Accountability is a thing.  Tie in to earlier statement. Player behavior and choices impact gameplay.\n\nWhile we're passing blame around, how much does a game design that disincentivizes good sportsmanship and incentivizes quick surrenders get? While it might feel good to shit on people for easy surrendering, by the numbers, it's better for your rank to get out of games that are wildly uneven quickly and get into another one than it is to spend the extra time trying for an unlikely comeback.\n \n> I don't like the hypocrisy. DONT TALK ABOUT RIOTS SYSTEM YOU KNOW NOTHING ON WHAT THEY DO!  From some one who is making thread after thread after thread after thread on the topic. What a shitty double standard. \n\nJudging by the tweet that spawned the response that spawned this thread, not even *Riot* knows what their own system does.

If I ran the MM for Riot I would provide the required # of games for 99.9% confidence in rating accuracy and tell people if they dislike it they can improve and change it any time they want. Then I would realistically be fired for the massive population drop because I hurt peoples feelings and they hop to games that use Progression systems to trick them into engagement.\nLike some Devs use Numeric values that don't represent their MM values to trick players. That's pretty misleading and I got a bit upset when I learned that.\n\nMy beef is with Rigged MM theory.

The supermarket is not making money based on how much time you spend in the store (MMR).\n\nI think the idea here is that people believe the MMR system is about keeping one around a 50% win rate by purposely teaming up with good players with other players who have a lower MMR.  This means if you are trying to climb and the MMR system is purposely keeping you at a 50% win rate that makes it a lot harder to climb. I know that is how HotS worked.  It was proven out by 3rd party sites where you could upload your games and they extrapolated the data proving that people were being grouped with people with a low MMR far below their own which made it very hard for them to climb.

MMR gain and loss is based on the difference between one's MMR and the average MMR of the enemy team.\n- What does that mean?\n- I'd like to know as well, but does it matter beyond just having the knowledge (which I agree is important)?\n\nThere is no rubberbanding. Being above the middle doesn't lessen one's gains and increase one's losses and being below the middle doesn't increase one's gains and lessen one's losses. What does exist is MMR will move more slowly than LP. That's why if one goes on a win streak, one's LP gains will decrease and losses will increase while if one goes on a loss streak, one's LP gains will increase and losses will decrease. Unless one maintains the streak, the rank and MMR equivalents will approach each other and the gains and losses will approach the baseline. \n\nOne could argue that Riot does it to simultaneously slow down progress and help ensure people don't fall too low too quickly because doing so might discourage them. I think it's partially that but mostly to lessen the impact of streaks.

Then there are two things that created an \"adjusted\" value, if you will, of people's MMRs. Being on the blue team will be treated as though one's MMR is slightly higher than it is. As an example with fake numbers to demonstrate what I mean, if everyone on purple has 1500, the system will find people with 1495 to put on the blue team. The same thing happens with premades. If all of the non-premades have 1500, the system will use premades who have 1475 (again, the numbers are fake and just used as a demonstration).","replies":[{"poster":"GFREEMEN","date":"2020-02-20T20:35:04.795+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You took the blue pill.\n\nWe dont know Riots system.

I think I gave up on ranked last season after getting AFKs in my promos a couple of times. What's the point of an individual skill ranking if it doesn't actually measure individual skill and can be so far off of what the skill actually is because of this long list of provisos and exceptions?\n\nThe questions I want to answer are \"how good am I at league of legends and how much am I improving over time?\"\n\nRiot doesn't have a system that can answer that for me, aside from grinding such a high quantity of games over a season that all of the exceptions and provisos and silly reasons why MMR and rank can be worlds away from each other eventually cancel out.\n\nCan I rely on my position after placements? No, because that will place you anywhere from 1-2 leagues under where you were last season, automatically, even if you 10-0 those matches. My skill didn't magically decrease two entire leagues in the space of a week, guys.\n\nCan I rely on my rank at any given time? No, because rank doesn't mean shit, MMR does, and those two things can be in completely different universes.\n\nCan I rely my own MMR? No, because you don't get to see it, fuck you, that's why. (Or at least that's what it feels like from the answer Riot is giving me)\n\nCan I rely on the average rank of the players I'm getting matched against? No, because we already established rank is meaningless, and the matchmaker does idiotic things like put challengers in plat games.\n\nCan I rely on my LP gains after a win? No, because this is another opaque formula that might wind up with you jumping divs/leagues even if your gains are modest.","replies":[{"poster":"whiteLight3r","date":"2020-02-20T21:34:44.524+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"THE FACTS.
