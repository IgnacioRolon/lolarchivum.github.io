Even if you are correct that Riot does not have the needed capacity _today_ to police a very specific subset of toxicity, that is not a valid argument for not rolling out a system that reduces overall toxicity as a whole.

Korea is toxic by NA standards, but players over there are tolerant of higher levels of toxicity.  They simply don't report for the same things.\n\nThat being said, if soft-inting is an issue, then it would need to be solved, sure.  We can speculate on different ways to do that - maybe a Tribunal-esque system that's gated by rank which filters the list so that only Riot employees only have to manually review the subset of reports actually deemed guilty, or maybe an algorithm that compares patterns in play by the same player to see when they're intentionally playing poorly.\n\nHowever, regardless of how the soft-inting is tackled \"I need to smurf because sometimes I leave games when people are trolling\" is not a valid reason to allow smurfing.","replies":[{"poster":"Emelie Cauchemar","date":"2019-09-20T03:50:44.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Subdue,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=k1fETiew,comment-id=000a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-20T02:54:31.402+0000)\n>\n> As far as toxicity goes, it's based on the local context.

Nor did it with rewards. So, that's a wasted thought to be honest.\n\nKorea players do in fact actually report. You'd know that if you watched Cowsep at all. Riot Korea just literally does not care. In fact, the extreme majority of NA toxicity was adopted from korea toxicity and deemed appropriate by the populace, regretfully. As for by \"na standards\" virtually any player from any server widely agrees that korea is hilariously toxic.  They will out right open mid on you and go afk over slight miss haps with 0 care. \n\nAlso, again, algorithms cannot detect passive inting.  The only reason players in game can even detect passive inting is because they knew the entire circumstance associated with it,and even then, it's virtually unproveable and can be criticized either way. Passive inting can be very easily associated with \"miss play.\" Or \"bad game.\" Which neither are punisheable offenses. And. Sense you cannot prove without a reasonable doubt that it was in fact a grief play due to the subtle nature it cannot be punished. \n\nAlso, the reason players are allowed to smurf is because it's a free to play game that lets you have alternate accounts.  Smurfing in itself is not bad in any way shape or form o.O so. I fail to understand where you assume that smurfing shouldn't be allowed. When, you know, almost every multiplayer game ever lets you do literally that. \n\nDo you feel Call of Duty should ban smurfing?
