Got roflstomped in both of them, though given I am not good at this game, not surprising. What is surprising is how horrible the people are.\n\n**Game 1:**\nQueue for support/bot, get support. Absolutely nobody chats. Say hi? Ask who they want me to ban? Nothing. Okay, guess I&#039;ll play Nami. Not a single word until we spawn in rift, when Yasuo opens with &quot;shit&quot;. And that&#039;s about all that&#039;s said. \n.\n.\n20 minutes later, we&#039;re down 17 kills, 3 turrets, and a whopping 10K gold. Random pings everywhere that make no sense (?&#039;s and !&#039;s on warded lanes with no possibility of something being there). 2 or 3 FF votes fail because of one guy. Finally they roll up on our doorstep and the FF goes through. End the game 3/6/11 with at least some of those deaths the result of people not communicating.\n\n**Game 2:**\nQueue for support/bot, get support. Say hi. Oh boy.. here we go again. Ask who they want me to ban? Yup, still silent. Make a comment to this effect &quot;Oh boy is nobody chatting again?&quot; and finally two of them pipe up. Get a bit of banter going, everything sounds good. Again, nami.\n\nWe spawn in rift. Enemy Draven opens by telling us about how big of a shit he took. (That is a verbatim quote.)\nGreat.. muted that mess, but then my Garen starts up on it too. Fantastic. Our MF tells (not asks) me not to farm, and I say fine, ADC should get the farm anyways. So we&#039;re in bot lane, getting absolutely wrecked by a Draven/Diana combo. MF isn&#039;t farming, and since she&#039;s so far back, my E&amp;F bounces go nowhere. Meanwhile, she starts tearing into me about how bad I am at Nami.\n\nHoo boy..\n.\n.\n.\n20 minutes later, we&#039;re down 10k gold, 14 kills, 5 turrets, and two dragons. At least 3 FF votes have failed thanks to one guy. Guess who? Yup, our toxic MF who claims we can recover from that hole, despite the rest of the team (and one guy who won&#039;t vote) wanting to get it over with. We&#039;re pushed into our nexus. Garen starts yelling at me to heal - _he just saw me launch E&amp;F, heal with what exactly, happy thoughts?_ \n\nMF is running all over the place trying to keep the super minions away from the few remaining turrets, I start bubbling them because it&#039;s the only offensive weapon I have and our turrets are taking damage. Guess what? Yup, I shouldn&#039;t do that either. My CS of 25 in a 33 minute game apparently means I was stealing her farm. She dies after Draven pops up and drags her out of the nexus to be pounced on by the entire enemy team, who quickly demolishes our last bot lane tower and inhibitor. Yup, my fault too, I should have bubbled the three of them which would have let her, who just burned Flash, escape. Again, my fault.\n\nEventually the nexus falls, and I end at 3/6/11. We get into postgame, and the first thing out of MF&#039;s mouth is &quot;GG Nami, don&#039;t play ranked. Apparently you were too busy stealing my farm!&quot;\n\nAfter this last pearl of wisdom, she disconnected. Reported for unsportsmanlike.\n\nNot that it matters. I&#039;m never touching ranked again until something, _anything_ is done about these jerk players.\n\nFor Riot&#039;s consideration: I** would pay serious, real life money for some kind of vetting program that matches non-jerks with other confirmed non-jerks across all skills levels.**","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-09-05T17:08:05.533+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking teleport on a support?

That leaves what else?\n\nOkay, it might be a good thing you lost these games because it will put you in a lower Elo giving you time to learn.\nWhat you typed shows a rather blatant misunderstanding of the mechanics of the game.\nFirst Nami has 3 cc abilities so that's important.\nSecond, the exhaust isn't for you its for your dunce of an ADC who will most likely go in while you have abilities on CD. It's also insurance for the moment when you miss your bubble (or get flashed by an enemy). \nThird, while I honestly use to find tele on sup acceptable, the recent change to make teleport take 50 hours to finish casting it really isn't worth not having exhaust bot lane anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2016-09-05T19:55:02.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"What's the third one? Q and R obviously, W is a heal/poke, E is a buff.\n\nA quick look at OP.GG shows the most common build on her is {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:3}} - I guess my question is why. Exhaust is a slow+debuff, but not a silence. If my ADC (or me) gets jumped on, even if I land the exhaust, Nami moves slow enough even with boots that she's easy to catch, doubly so if I'm against a ranged champion (which I usually am in bot).\n\nI mean the stats don't lie, I just wonder the reasoning behind them.","replies":[{"poster":"StarTorched","date":"2016-09-06T15:29:59.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the e auto attacks have a slow effect. So in total Nami has 2 hard cc and one soft. (if that's how you classify such things)\n\nBut let's take a look at exhaust:\n\"Exhaust is a targeted Summoner spell that affects enemy champions. It reduces their movement speed and attack speed by 30%, their armor and magic resistance by 10, and their damage dealt by 40% for 2.5 seconds. \"\n\nSo let's start with your scenario, shall we? Even disregarding the movement speed, they can't attack you as much anymore due to attack speed slow down. Their slow should make it easier for you to land a bubble. Also your entire kit can speed you up, and help up the gap. Now, armor and magic resistance doesn't help you in that instance unless teammates come in. And they do 40% less damage, which gives you a good relief to just run or do whatever the hell you need to to go away or peel your teammate.\n\nBut  **40%** damage reduction is a lot. Like damn, that is some amazing shit. If you don't think that's a lot, then think again. Most of the time you are sticking this on the enemy adc, whose power comes from not only ad but also by building attack speed. Now let's say the Draven is coming in to fight. You are taking away a chunk of his damage, but also lessening his output by reducing the speed of his auto attacks, and the slow may prevent him from catching an axe or something. Meanwhile, the armor and mr reduction makes it easier for your team to kill them, and the movement speed reduction makes sure they can't run away. \n\nIt's an ideal tool for support because there's never a point where it becomes not useful. In lane it could stomp the enemy adc and preventing him from killing you or your adc and possibly secure a kill. It could take a burst assassin or fed anything and stop them from having a successful gank. It could straight up take out the enemy _____ (fill in the blank w/ whatever you like) from being a threat in a teamfight and turn them into an easily eliminated target.\n\nDo NOT lessen the worth of exhaust so easily. It's easily one of the best things in your pocket if you are a support. Besides, both of nami's hard cc requires you actually landing them (not landing r is kind of hard, mind you), but exhaust is something you could fall back on, or even use to make sure your cc lands. You'll find that people have a harder time dodging things with a 30% slow.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2016-09-06T15:56:06.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh..
