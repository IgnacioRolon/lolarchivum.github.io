When I stay pushed out and trying to fight an opponent despite being warned by teammates that the enemy jg or laner is coming to gank me and I COULD back off, dying to said gank could be considered inting. I personally would let a single event slide - because we all mess up and maybe the person truly thought they could outplay the gank or that a nearby teammate was going to counter-gank and win a 2v2 or 3v3 off them baiting the enemy gank into happening.\n\nWhile I would give people a pass, many others would not - unless they themselves were the one dying. If they die, it's unlucky or someone else's fault... if it's someone else dying, then that teammate is \"inting\". You say that most people accusing others of inting in a scenario like that are silver elo, but you are entirely wrong. Go watch some streamers or YouTubers and listen to them. They would accuse themselves of inting in said scenario. Granted, they handle it differently when they or a teammate \"int\" (die 1 or more times when they didn't have to be in the position or do what caused them to needlessly die). But they also react and coordinate better (usually) as a team, work to prevent a teammate being camped, and better punish opponent's plays. They don't repeat said bad decisions over and over and over and....\n\nFor me, inting is mostly an issue of adaptation, teamwork, logic, and macro. Losing your lane is fine. Having a bad kda might even be excused... if you were making smart, safe plays to the best extent possible. If you are 2v2, ganked maybe 1 time all game, get tons of friendly help from jg and mid, and you are constantly pushing out lane, forcing fights, and dying... that's NOT acceptable deaths; it IS inting. Let's look at the facts to prove this.\n\n1. I - your teammate - am being 2v1'd in another lane with the enemy jg camping me. I've been flash ganked 3x in 15 min, and ganked plenty more times. I've had mid roam on me w/o any mia. I can't ward because if I leave my tower at the wrong time, their 2v1 will chunk me out and then I have to base while they hard shove and bounce the wave. Plus, they constantly place control wards to clear and negate any wards I push - so unless I can 1v2 in the open from level 3 on, I have to play as though 1v2 literally the entire laning phase and my team refuses to give me counter-ganks so I cannot properly punish my opponents even if I see openings because 9x out of 10, it's a bait and the enemy jg is there which means even if I'd grab a kill 1v1, I'll probably be diving in 1v2 and getting killed or put significantly further behind. Despite this, 95% of the time, I am even with or ahead of my lane opponent, have map pressure, and can 1v1 them whenever I get a 10 sec window to do so. So if I am winning or going even in 95% of games while 1v2 with 0 help and unable to even ward the river for safety to spot enemy ganks coming in, then there is zero excuse to feed your ass off 2v2 or 1v1 - especially when you ARE getting help from our team.\n\n2. You lost 2v2 twice in a row. One time, I'll give you it may have been a fluke or a minor mistake by you or your lane partner. Twice, well now we know it's not that AND you are too behind to be forcing 2v2 fights anymore until you catch up in levels and itemization. Forcing a play when you have jg or mid or top coming into your lane THAT VERY SECOND to help you and give you a 3v2 or 4v2 is another story. That is ok. But further forcing of fights 2v2 is both intentional (you are choosing to fight) and feeding (you are guaranteed to lose). Thus, you are intentionally putting yourself and your lane partner in a scenario where you KNOW you will die and at best - through sheer luck - trade even... but 99x out of 100, you will just straight up lose. Forcing bad and unnecessary plays when behind is setting yourself and your teammates up to fail. You expect an 0/3/0 toplaner not to keep trying to 1v1 a 10/1/12 darius that's a level up on them... so neither should you be forcing a fight mid or bot or vs enemy jg when you don't have SERIOUS help from your team and you KNOW for a FACT that they DON'T also have backup. Doing otherwise is INTENTIONAL FEEDING.\n\n3. Bot lane is super important right now, and it can feel really bad to lose lane (regardless of what lane). However, continuing to force bad plays or force your teammates to come bail you out when they could be getting MORE done elsewhere if you just chilled and lost lane gracefully puts you further behind and loses teammates any advantages they had to merely MAYBE catch you back up. And in the mean time, your teammates' opponents will catch back up to THEM. This is almost NEVER worth it. Adc's are more item reliant than other roles, so even if you are behind in levels, as long as you exploit the fact that you have RANGE and can farm pretty safely 2v2 under your tower, you should be able to slowly mitigate an opponent's lead. When the wave isn't by your tower, you just try to stay in xp range and not get engaged on and deleted. Don't lose half your health bar just to get 4 more cs. Don't get yourself killed trying to get one more wave of cs... I assure you, you will  miss more doing that than if you had just waited patiently by your tower for the wave to push. Same holds for other lanes.\n\nDying needlessly over and over - especially in the SAME WAY again and again when you don't have to is not ok. Not only is this putting you more and more behind and your opponent more and more ahead, but also, you are screwing over your teammates because... they had to work HARD for their lane advantages, their advantages will be much smaller than the one you are giving your opponent by not playing smart, and they will have to eventually deal with said fed opponent. If you just give up a little now to avoid continuing to die, your teammates' advantages can be put into play after laning phase and you will eventually catch up in farm. You will have a better chance of winning a teamfight where you just might get a ton of kills or assists and a few good fights will leave you far ahead of your lane opponent despite them having the early kill advantage. But if you keep dying to them in lane, if you keep costing your team more resources, vision, and time spent trying to stop the bleeding, then your teammates won't be able to salvage your lost lane regardless of how ahead they are and how well they play. It sucks, but you don't always get an immediate fix for \"I'm losing lane, pls gank\". Sometimes you have to wait 15 min. Sometimes it NEVER happens. But regardless, you OWE it to your team (unless they're all being feeding toxic assholes) to give them the BEST CHANCE possible to carry and catch you up.\n\nI don't enjoy being 1v2 or 1v3 for 15+ min in most games, but if it means my bot, mid, jg or a combo of those roles snowball ahead, I'll gladly sit 1v2 wasting my opponents' time while my teammates destroy their team elsewhere. If I'm fed and my team is not, I'll teamfight if that's our best option. Or, more often, it is better for me to split up our opponents so my team can 4v3 or 4v4 just waveclear by tower and stay safe (provided they actually ward our jg and the river) and split 1v1 or 1v2 and get my team objectives. And if they send multiple people to deal with the pressure I'm applying, my team can force plays elsewhere with number advantage and catch back up or snowball ahead. This buys them easy objectives. Even though I'm not getting much, I'm doing more for my teammates than most will ever realize. Like sure I could group and bring my advantage to the 5v5, but it also comes with 2 fed opponents coming to the fight... which is not at all going to help our team out in most cases. Thus, I split despite teammates too often calling me selfish, noob, or retarded for doing so. What I do depends not so much on what's personally best for ME, but rather... what's giving my TEAM the BEST CHANCE POSSIBLE to win.\n\nSo to recap, we all make mistakes. Repeating those mistakes over and over again makes them no longer \"mistakes\" but intentional feeding because you KNOW the result of said actions - having proved it by \"testing\" them several times. Give your teammates the BEST possible chance to help you; sometimes it takes many minutes to actually get the help you need and you must play smart and safe to minimize how much further behind you fall during that time. Refusing to adjust your play to minimize losses until help can arrive will almost certainly cost you more in the long run and make it much harder if not impossible for your teammates to help you. Play for your team, not just yourself. It might not always LOOK like you are playing for the team, but do what's best overall for your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nipsahoy","date":"2018-05-13T23:35:35.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's always hilarious when someone tells me I'm inting and they have like 4 more deaths than me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2018-05-13T01:25:33.344+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Actually \"soft inting\" is a thing. Way rarer than people claim but it exist. You can try your best (or worst) to loose the game without straight running down mid, to avoid getting banned. I remember for example a guy playing jungle who was getting flamed by toplaner. After a few lines of argue he simply wrote \"ok. But you will loose 😊 you don't deserve to be carried anyway\" top was feeding his ass off and flaming the jungler for it, bot was slightly loosing, I was neutral, said jungler was REALLY ahead (like 2 levels 5 kills and 20 Cs on enemy jgl) so the game was pretty much on his shoulder at the time. He never straight up troll in the sense of purposely dying but he proceeded to perform the worst possible decision in every scenario, and informing enemies about it. Drake up? He would counterjungle topside writing \"I'm stealing your blue\". Baron up? He steals red botside. We try to sneak a baron after a good vision setup? \"/all: My team is at baron. I go push bot\" . \n\nI would call that\"soft\" because IF we were ahead of the enemies we could have still won the game by winning fights or keeping them at bay while after clearing the jgl on the opposite side of the map he would hopefully push the lane. But, all our gold was onto him so we were completely unable to stand on our own without sneaky tactics (which he would reveal)","replies":[{"poster":"RISE Shlack123","date":"2018-05-13T19:27:19.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But he isn't even dying.

Telling the enemy team what your own team is doing is not \"not trying to win\" it's actively trying to loose.

Yes you do, so you see, it doesn't matter. In fact, inting teammates only save you time by making you commit less and thus waste less time.
