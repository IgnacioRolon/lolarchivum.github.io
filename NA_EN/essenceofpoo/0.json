Double check that under your collections, and double check that the emote page is selected when you're in champion select really quick. If that doesn't seem to be the problem, check your keybindings as well, as those might have been reset somehow.","replies":[{"poster":"EssenceOfPoo","date":"2017-11-02T01:29:08.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm able to display it from the emote menu but not through the mastery emote key. it used to work through the mastery emote key (regardless of whether I'm level 4 or more for a given champion)\n\nThe difference between displaying it through the emote menu and via the mastery emote key is one doesn't get the cheer sound (there's cheer sound with mastery emote key)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T02:00:29.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhaaaa so yea, AFAIK those worlds emotes are now considered normal emotes and do not work through the mastery emote any longer. You'll need to use the emote wheel to use those emotes from here on out.\n\nIt does also seem like the emotes are having some minor sound issues right now. I've mainly heard they aren't working on doombots and that they've been mostly working on SR. Have those sounds been working at all for you?","replies":[{"poster":"EssenceOfPoo","date":"2017-11-02T02:11:22.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see. Other emotes like thumbs-up and jinx are working fine (their sounds work too). \n\nDo Worlds Team emotes work through mastery emote key and if so, do they have sound?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T02:16:14.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure they *only* work through the emote system now. I've heard that the icon will still activate the mastery version of the emote *in custom games*, which is heckin' weird tbh. \n\nFrom here on out emote's are designed to only work with the emote wheel.","replies":[{"poster":"EssenceOfPoo","date":"2017-11-02T04:26:25.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gotcha. ya i've experienced what you described in training mode too but haven't been able to pull it off anymore recently. \n\nwell, emote wheel is alright. I know this is probably a trivial or over-looked issue for most players but thanks for being a bro anyway by getting back to me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
