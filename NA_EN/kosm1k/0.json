Everyone could see my chat, but it was stuck on our Sona's pick and I couldn't click to get my pick and it just stood frozen there the entire time. I wouldn't say my computer is high end, but it definitely isn't a damn chomebook. Also my network supports speeds of 20MB/sec down, yes I mean Megabytes, not megabits, i know the difference. There's no one else on the network (except my duo partner) and with this kind of internet, one extra person doesn't matter, we can play other online games with no issue, but league, and ONLY LEAGUE, ALWAYS LEAGUE, results in this. Every support ticket I send says \"oh you're probably getting some packet loss, we can't refund you your LP and that's about it\". If that were the case I would lag in other games, but no, only league, even if 3 people stream netflix on the network, only league will lag me out like that. Also ever since patch ~6.15-present, league has created fps drops on my duo's laptop, despite it being on bare minimum graphical settings, running integrated graphics from an i5 and on 6GBs of ram, with only ~.5 GBs used on background stuff. What's the deal Riot? What did you do to our spaghetti code this time? \r\n\r\nSeriously, I love more content, like skins and events and The RGM but I think that more manpower should be diverted into fixing the old code or speed up the production of the Alpha Client because I'm sure that it's going to be great, I've seen parts of it already and it looks cool. Please just fix it, I can handle having a few trolls or \"first time lee sin lol\" in ranked, but when the game itself puts me behind on my climb, it does not feel alright, not one bit. \r\n\r\nAlso since so many people have issues with the game, ranked in particular, why not hand out the amount of LP that they lost, in RP to them? I know it wouldn't be much, but it would definitely feel better than \"lol it's your internet, sux 4 u\" that support tickets usually end up with. (even though I'm sure for most people it definitely could be the internet itself)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T01:34:18.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each server you access, this site, Google, Amazon, etc, are all in different locations, and therefore your network routing to each server will be different. This means it's certainly possible to encounter packet loss or routing issues to one server, but not another. I encourage you to check out our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for a list of common solutions that cause you to get hung up in champ select or staying connected to the matchmaking service.\n\nLet me know if those steps changed anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Kosm1K","date":"2016-10-19T17:42:10.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is probably just Comcast not having a proper connection to your servers in particular, that sucks. I'll have to really to them then. This is also the first time I'm linked to that troubleshooting page, is that new?
