Been playing since season 1/2, and I wanted to kinda poke people&rsquo;s brains/make a selfish request. So, I *think* I understand this correctly: I recently saw a thread with a Rioter who played a friendly 1v1 with a player who I *think* was playing his 1000th game. I&rsquo;ll admit that I find that pretty dope, and had I realized that this was a thing earlier, I probably would&rsquo;ve taken advantage of it.\n\nSo, I know it&rsquo;s selfish, but I gotta ask: any possibility I could test my mettle against one of Riot&rsquo;s own? I&rsquo;m waaaaay past 1000 games, I know, and I totally get if the answer&rsquo;s no, but I figured there&rsquo;s no harm in at least asking...\n\n...Right?","replies":[]}
