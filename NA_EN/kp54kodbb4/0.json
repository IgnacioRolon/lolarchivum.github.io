I was once high d1 before masters came out, and yes, I&#039;ve become a toxic monster because of the way the community is. But I feel as if my experience in the game with probably over 20,000 games of league played in my life gives me some legitimate grounds to say something about the development of the player behavior system. I am not saying that I should be unbanned because of a player behavior system flaw, Most of my 42 permanent bans are well deserved. \n\nToxicity is 9 times out of 10 an outlet for angry or upset players, whether they are upset at real life or a game. Lately, as of the end of 2014, toxicity is at an all time high. Not only is toxicity at an all time high, but the entire internet at this point has grown to be too sensitive and honestly at this point I can&#039;t stand being part of any community.\n\nLets review in my opinion which is one of the most unwarranted PERMANENT bans I&#039;ve gotten in my life.\nhttp://pastebin.com/3pQPAkCN [pastebin isnt visible apparently]\nNow this excerpt is probably the most toxic thing I said after the whole game rolled out and I was more or less infuriated and had enough of the match\n&gt; C H: ur bad\nC H: and when I say bad\nC H: I mean bad as shit\nC H: beyond bad\nC H: atrocious\nC H: you need to uninstall\n\nNow not saying this is an okay thing to say to your teammates but this was the only thing that I said which warrants a chat restriction at most. I was permanently suspended for this game, and many others as I&#039;ve had over 40 accounts banned. Back in season 3 you could literally say anything you wanted with little to no punishment, but note that SO MUCH LESS toxicity was actually present back in season 3. In CS:GO you can get away with saying the most racist, sexist, hate speech you could possibly think of, but honestly I see more toxicity in league. \n\nI&#039;m sorry but people get angry when their team is thick-headed and uncooperative, you wanna know what they do in a working environment to someone who&#039;s thick headed and uncooperative? They fire them, because being thick-headed and uncooperative is just as bad as being an asshole. In a team game where nobody listens to each other anymore, and the fact that riot is so uptight about how people act in the game (Ever since Riot Lyte had a say in the behavior team) that they feel trapped. When you feel trapped, you get angry. The uncooperative players continue to see the light of day when they can get away with whatever they want and the problem never gets solved. The more cause for someone to get angry, the more toxicity surfaces in game. Back when everyone was cooperative (season 1-4) there was a huge decline in toxicity. Personally I&#039;ve grown to be a VERY angry player, and I tend to lose my patients with people quick, but I give them a chance and try to ask politely, and when that doesn&#039;t work I don&#039;t want to play the game anymore.\n\nThe problem at this point will never be solved and everyone&#039;s telling me to go find a new game to enjoy. But I stick around for the amazing champions I do like (Ahri, Irelia, Renekton, Lulu, Graves, Jinx, Lucian, Syndra, Vayne, Gnar, etc.). I stick around because I played this game throughout my entire teenage years (since release in 2009). So I just continue to get new accounts and end up banned because my team wants to not cooperate. League saved my life in a way, and it helped me connect with some of the coolest people on the internet, including the girl who lives with me now and I plan to marry one day. So when I run around and say stuff like &quot;I don&#039;t care about the game, I have the WORLD RECORD for permanent bans on league&quot;. It&#039;s a bunch of bullshit that I don&#039;t care, because I do. I miss the game for what it used to be, and I keep giving the game a chance, and riot a chance to fix the game. I may be a toxic monster spun out of control at this point but I really do care about the game. \n\nSincerely,\n\nCheddix / Justin","replies":[{"poster":"CooL Ice Tea","date":"2016-08-09T08:37:05.997+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we upvote this for a Riot member so he can watch over this 42 accounts bans and get this guy banned tyler1 style?

So it's not so much about how worse your level of toxicity is, but how frequent it is. Once you get hit with your 2 chat restrictions you are going to move up when it comes to punishment. That is just how it works.\nYou also don't need to vent in the game chat. You have better (more mature ways of) handling your anger when it comes to playing this game, or anything for that matter. Most people probably just yell at the screen or punch a pillow out of anger. They don't call their teammates worthless or that they need to kill themselves and think that is suppose to be good sportsmanlike.","replies":[{"poster":"kP54koDbB4","date":"2016-08-09T09:18:28.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"So if players are frequently being thick headed I'm just supposed to sit through it with a smile on my face?

If this game (or anything in life) is giving you that amount of stress I would suggest to probably leave the game, or at the very least take a break. I've been playing this game for possibly over 5-6 years. I've seen every amount of toxic behavior and I don't let it get to me. If/when the game stresses me out I take a break. Heck because of my work schedule I rarely play during the weekday and mainly play on the weekends!\n\nAll I'm saying is no one deserves to be treated like shit. I don't care how badly you are playing everyone has bad days. Plus people get matched up poorly with how matchmaking is so it's understandable at times.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-09T11:22:51.309+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"When you look at minor toxicity like this by itself, you're right, it *appears* to not warrant a permaban.\n\nHowever, that is not what resulted in your permanent ban. This was just the last straw in a long history of toxic behavior, consistently being a problem in the community.\n\nIf someone slaps you lightly once, should you get a restraining order? No, that would obviously be a gross overreaction. What if they spent every waking hour slapping everyone within arm's reach? Yes, something drastic needs to be done eventually when minor punishments have proven to have little to no effect in preventing it. This is how it works here; a punishment isn't just the result of one game usually, but is one on a path of escalation with everything on the road considered.\n\nSome players like to say \"Well, there is more toxicity in X season than Y season had\". You're going to need to show something more than anecdotal evidence; you personally becoming more toxic over time doesn't reflect on the community, just you. Riot has taken great strides in improving reform of players with the Instant Feedback System and (somewhat) behavior rewards; A player will receive punishment within only 5 minutes of the triggering report, along with a reform card to help them understand where they went wrong.\n\nIf a dog shits on the floor and you hit him two hours later, all you're doing is abusing the dog. He will not learn to go outside first, he'll just learn that you enjoy hurting him. I doubt Riot would use this comparison with players, but the concept is essentially the same; people learn from their mistakes more easily if they are corrected immediately rather than when they've already forgotten what they did wrong. The Tribunal voting system was notoriously slow, and no more accurate than the IFS today.\n\nAny player can place blame on Riot, the game, or the community, but in the end they alone are responsible for their behavior. There are tools available to them to improve their situation (such as muting), but if they refuse to use them and are a problem then Riot doesn't have any choice but to push them up that escalating path of punishment until the player decides he wants to change, or gets permabanned. Someone who gets all the way to the most severe punishment yet still does not take responsibility for their own actions has no right to say it wasn't their fault.","replies":[{"poster":"kP54koDbB4","date":"2016-08-10T02:45:20.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I already explained the whole \"personal experience study\" to someone else in the above comments, however regarding your last paragraph: Muting an uncooperative player or a troll isn't going to change their behavior.

I've been playing since S3, and have never received so much as a chat ban.  I am a rather mellow person though.  While I do try to tilt my opponent every now and then, I never outright insult them, and am generally nice to them after the game (sometimes offering some advice to deal with the situation).\n\nI think it all comes down to our individual perceptions on what should and should not be allowed in the chat.  I find it reasonable for Riot to punish players for outright insulting the other players.  There's a difference between telling someone they made a mistake and telling them that they're terrible and should uninstall.  Other people consider that to be part of the fun of a sport.\n\nRiot had to draw the line somewhere, and I think that being more conservative with it was the right call.  If incidents were to occur (suicides possibly?) even just partly as a result from the toxicity of the community and Riot wasn't doing anything about it, it could ruin them.  While this may make the game a bit less fun for those who feel the need to \"vent frustration\" through the chat, it is the far safer business strategy, and remains just as fun (or more fun) for those who are not so expressive.  Even still, there are plenty of people who do vent some of their frustration without being banned, so it isn't as though you can't say anything negative at all, you just have to keep yourself from taking it too far.","replies":[{"poster":"kP54koDbB4","date":"2016-08-09T09:50:15.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Like I said, it wasn't right of me to tell my teammate they were atrocious and to uninstall, I wouldve given myself a chat restriction for that.

While regularly hearing insults of \"autism\", \"kill yourself\", etc, I didn't think \"bad\" could even be considered punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"kP54koDbB4","date":"2016-08-09T09:34:53.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Some people need to hear it the harsh way before they can realize \"Hey, maybe I'm the one making the mistake and it's not my team's fault why I got solokilled in lane\".","replies":[]}]}]}
