When moving without boots she will glide instead and when tier 2 boots are purchased she will either move as she does in her atlantean skin or it will look like she is running (which would normally happen at +430 movespeed). Her recall animation looks like it &#039;broken&#039; as when the recall begins she hesitates and then proceeds to recall. He death animation her left arm dislocates. Videos of these are below and they happen in every game. \r\n\r\nGlide movement bug - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu8hWc8Dy80\r\nTier 2 boots movement bug - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf11RtK84U0\r\nRecall bug - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oleFaJ_gVhA","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-10T17:35:57.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I am Syndra (why am I not surprised you're the one reporting this? :P)\n\nThanks for the great bug report!

There is still the issue of every 1-in-10 games getting 'stuck' to terrain, but that is purely a visual bug. Re-issuing a movement command 'snaps' her into place where she actually exists on the server.\n\nNotably, some people are reporting me they are experiencing walk jitter/ult desync, but they haven't submitted video evidence for me to verify. I'll keep prodding other Syndra players on the matter to see what they see.\n\nWhat jitter I did see is sufficiently difficult to distinguish from normal movement wackyness, usually around minions or near terrain walls (where most everyone can freak out for a split second in pathing logic). If Syndra's original jitter/desync is still there, it's rare enough now I've trouble spotting it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-24T23:50:29.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've been working more closely with our patch notes bros to update stuff we're fixing, especially on skins. ^-^ You've probably noticed a lot more skins fixes lately! \n\n> If Syndra's original jitter/desync is still there, it's rare enough now I've trouble spotting it.\n\nIf you do spot it, feel free to hit me up!
