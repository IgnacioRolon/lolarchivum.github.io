( {{champion:60}} ) While not the easiest jungler, she has good sustain in the jungle, she doesnt take very much damage in first clear(Can use spiderlings to tank, and it isnt a hard thing to do.) She can gank pre 6, and her ganks when done right usually results in a kill. She has many build paths, ranging from Full AP, to Full tank, to a mix of both! And her damage is always revelant because her Q in human form does Max Percent health damage and her Q in Spider form is an execute. I can go on and on! The only problems I have with her is her mana sustain in the jungle at early levels. Its a bit of a pain.
