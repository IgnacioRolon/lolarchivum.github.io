Later, I realized with the New Horizon bundle that you get special borders with all the skins as well. My question is, if I refund the skin I bought for Ahri, will I still have the skin because I technically also bought it with the New Horizon bundle?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-11T17:56:09.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That bundle expired a bit ago, but bundles in general are flexible.  If you refund a skin, the bundle would update to a higher price to reflect no longer owning it.  It was also specifically the icon in that bundle that would offer the border, not the skin itself.  Hope that helps clear things up, even though the bundle isn't available anymore.  :(","replies":[{"poster":"InfernoClaw","date":"2017-10-11T18:00:17.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you for answering Porocles!","replies":[]}]}]}
