To do this, we plan to objectively grade each player based on their best &quot;Fantasy League&quot; score during their games. For anyone unaware, here is the grading scale: \r\n2 points per kill\r\n-0.5 points per death\r\n1.5 points per assist\r\n0.01 points per creep kill\r\n2 points for a triple kill\r\n5 points for a quadra kill (doesn&#039;t also count as a triple kill)\r\n10 points for a penta kill (doesn&#039;t also count as a quadra kill)\r\n2 points if a player attains 10 or more assists or kills in a game (this bonus only applies once)\r\n\r\nI could write up a spreadsheet to generate the scores on a player-by-player basis; all of the data is available client-side as soon as a match is over. But that still requires me to manually enter data for everyone involved; does anyone know if any scripts already exist to do this?","replies":[]}
