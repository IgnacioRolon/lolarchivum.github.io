It would say Authenticating for a very long time and just not open. I tried re-installing and running in administrator but nothing works. After re-installing my client won't even open. It would just show the League of Legends logo for a split second and close. Everything was fine before. Does anyone know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-21T17:41:08.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you tried some steps to troubleshoot this, but running as admin is good for game file permissions but not so much your network.  This error is usually caused by a network block or instability that is struggling to reach the authentication server.  For your specific issue, the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help resolve things.","replies":[{"poster":"gg remake","date":"2017-10-21T18:00:48.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much <3.
