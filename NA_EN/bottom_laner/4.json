Even the name of the CC above their head doesn&#039;t help since the majority of the time it either doesn&#039;t help new players know what to do or they&#039;re dead. \n\nPast MOBA experience or research may solve this, but no beginner to LoL or MOBAs in general sits down and goes through all 130+ champions to see their abilities and the CC that they may or may not provide. At most the tutorial will &quot;teach&quot; them 3 right off the bat, {{champion:22}}, {{champion:86}}, and {{champion:13}}, and then they&#039;ll go through the list of champions and only click the ones they deem as cool or cute such as {{champion:157}} or {{champion:17}}.   \n\nOne option instead of a tutorial is a tab next to the summoner spells that shows a small video with each form of CC in its own clip with a different champion per CC ({{champion:25}} for snare, {{champion:33}} for taunt, etc) and a small description of each type.\n\ntl;dr new players shouldn&#039;t be assumed to have to immediately know what various CC types do when there&#039;s tutorials for that and I suck at structuring posts x.x\n\nedit: The fact that the majority of the discussion was about {{champion:32}} R helps prove my point. It's not even clear to *experienced* players.
