If you walk up to an enemy champion or monster and auto attack then press Q and W at the same time it will waste the W. It will still apply the auto attack damage and the Q damage.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E1mW72lB4A","image":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2E1mW72lB4A/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had been noticing some weird things after the 5.2 update. But only now after the 5.3 update have i figured out what it was. When you auto attack ANY enemy champion OR monster then quickly cancel the auto attack animation with Q and W at the SAME time it will result in the auto attack hitting the Q hitting but the W will do no damage will not apply the stun and will go on cool down (You are also stuck in a standing animation for about one second). \n\nYou will see in the video that this happens frequently enough to be a problem.. Another thing that you might see in the video is that the final test works perfectly the auto attack hits the Q hits and the W is still waiting its duration to be used. I believe this is because i started walking away. It seems that if you stand still it increases the odds of this bug happening. Thanks for helping guys hopefully this bug will be fixed soon!\n\nAlso just a side note you can see in the video that there is no stun indicator above the monsters head.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-02-13T22:29:12.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the report!","replies":[{"poster":"MJÃ–LNlR","date":"2015-10-03T05:35:57.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=24AmUU4K,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-13T22:29:12.385+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for the report!\n\nThis bug is still in the game to this day, it never got fixed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-02-14T00:08:39.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh. I actually noticed this very recently when I used Renekton last night in a custom before going to bed. I was like \"Wait, what, Shen didn't get stunned o.o hmmm, maybe i just didn't notice it\".\n\nAnother W bug though. I wonder if it has something do with his W bug on his Pool skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Storm00551","date":"2015-02-14T00:11:11.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm not sure. But that's how i noticed it.. I was playing a ranked game last night and like 3 of my stuns did nothing lol. So i decided to test a few things.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-02-14T00:52:15.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah. lol. I got the idea that the two bugs might connected from someone saying that if they changed Annie particles on new skins, then they'd have to do testing on the other skins to make sure it doesn't interfere with them. Something with about how they're configured or something. So I thought maybe the Pool Renekton skin bug might be affecting his other skins or something. =P Could be a different W bug on each one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
