In league there are 3 lanes and one jungle, for 4 sources of income across 5 players. Whoever ends up the odd one out always ends up feeling like they&#039;re giving up something so that the rest of their team can take a shot at being the star.   ...because they ARE.\r\n\r\n2. Playing support is hard. You have less resources to work with and your champion pool is much smaller, and the champions you do play with don&#039;t get to do the awesome things for you that they do for other players. (Unless you &quot;become the carry now&quot;) Your whole existence in the game revolves around other people.  \r\n\r\n3. Playing support is thankless, with very few exceptions. When a Bard ult nails three players and catches them out, it&#039;s a big damn moment to shine. When Thresh lands The Full Combo&trade;, it&#039;s his big damn moment, but in both of those moments, it&#039;s the other players who clean up. Outside of moments like these, the game doesn&#039;t do much to make supports feel welcome.\r\n\r\n4. Which is probably the heart of the problem. The game is explicitly designed such that you want gold to be a more awesome teammate and one teammate always gets the shaft, so the game explicitly tries to hold back supports.\r\n\r\nNow let&#039;s look at the more minor issues.\r\n\r\na) Every time that a champion ends up being a very strong support pick, they get nerfed to hell, to prevent that support pick from being strong, which nerfs them in lane as well. (Goodbye Miss Fortune, we hardly knew you) It&#039;s either a retooling to force them back into their lane where they belong, or a retooling to force them into support and away from lane. Neither one makes anyone happy.\r\n\r\nb) Expectations are low for supports in general. &quot;What are you complaining about? You get free ELO every game from just queuing up as support, everyone else is doing all the work&quot;\r\n\r\nc) When you did special streams for lane specific views during LCS and worlds, you had &quot;Jungler Stream&quot; and &quot;Top Lane Matchup&quot; and then you had &quot;Bot Lane Matchup.&quot; ADC&#039;s felt like they were being forced to share their time with supports, and supports felt like they got nothing. It&#039;s a little too meta.\r\n\r\nd) It&#039;s depressing just to TALK about this treatment. (take a break if you need to) \r\n\r\nSo let&#039;s brainstorm some things we can do to improve the play experience of supports.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"LoomberFoot","date":"2016-10-28T16:42:42.802+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":3,"body":"i main support and I see playing it as being a part of the secret service, whenever you do something great and save lots of people no one noticed you but if you fail and people die then everyone notices you.","replies":[{"poster":"Eevee In A Jar","date":"2016-10-28T18:40:58.712+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then there are times when supports do this\n\nhttps://youtu.be/waYn8hw8nfI","replies":[{"poster":"Rivuo","date":"2016-10-28T22:28:55.721+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eevee In A Jar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qvIGm43j,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2016-10-28T18:40:58.712+0000)\n>\n> Then there are times when supports do this\n> \n> https://youtu.be/waYn8hw8nfI\n\nWatching Shens Q damage........

Imagine a rift where it was only 4v4, or that the jungle was large enough to benefit two champions. That would quickly put an end to this problem once and for all, but that would require huge changes and monumental retooling.\n\nThe next best (and much easier) thing you can do is have items be the fifth gold source. We already have that, but the gold gen is gimped because if it was a roughly equal gold source other roles would buy them and benefit from two sources at once (frost queen was stolen by midlane for a while). So you have to find some way of restricting gold gen items to just the support role, which is very difficult. You could do the jungler way and make a summoner spell requirement like jungle items require smite, or you could have CSing temporarily disable the gold gen; but those are imperfect solutions. What if a laner takes the summoner spell anyway (remember top lane smite in season 5), or what if the support needs to CS to hold the lane or clear a wave from tower or accidentally takes CS from AoE abilities?\n\nOnce you solve the problem of not having a fifth gold source, most of the support issues should vanish since they can actually afford to buy big ticket carry items and start directly carrying games instead of indirectly carrying games. Support Brand is popular right now because he's a support that can carry, much the same with support MF.\n\nAdditional gold income would also open up the support role to more diversity, since champions who may not have great base damage or built in utility could then become more viable there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheStevenWu","date":"2016-10-28T20:53:23.433+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idk what elo OP is, but everything he types screams \"I'm silver/bronze and do not have a full understanding of the game.\" Not to be mean... but\n\n1. Play support is not hard because you have less resources. Supports are hard because it's the role that requires the most brain power; and most people are stupid. In fact, champions suited for the support don't really need gold to accomplish their objective. What is their objective? To get their ADC fed. How? By setting up the offensive and defensive plan of the lane, whether your are positioning yourself to engage or zone to CC locking the opponent or outplaying them.\n\n2. Playing support is thankless 50% of the time. That's because people are self-centered. The enemy team knows why the lost. They lost because the enemy support engaged at the right moment that lead the team to an ACE. In higher elos, supports get a lot more credit as they understand better why they win or lose.\n\n3. There's a reason why supports are always being re-balanced. Because every good player knows the true carries of the team: The jungler and the support. The jungler and support leads the team to victory; everyone else are just follow up. Companies are successful because of their officers, not because of their employees.\n\n4. Expectations are low for support only in low elo, because low elo players do not understand how to play the game effectively.

Right now, I think one of the biggest issues with supports is that there's this all-around \"be seen and not heard\" mentality, where supports are expected to stop themselves from interacting with many of the game's most basic systems (e.g. gold and experience, and by extension many items that would otherwise interest them, especially AP items), just so that they can play servant to others, namely by going out to ward for the entire team, which is a burden everyone should be sharing equally among themselves. Supports basically have no presence in the in-game world until they jump in to help a teammate, which isn't a good feeling.\n\nAs for #2, and #3, though, while I agree that playing support is difficult, especially in non-premades where there's less player synergy overall, I don't think support plays are entirely ignored. If a support makes a critical play, it tends to have an impact everyone else can feel and appreciate, and people will recognize the difficulty in setting up kills and saving allies. There are probably some players who don't acknowledge support plays, but I don't think it's all that different from the players saying that X role takes no skill, something that often gets directed at top laners and marksmen, too.\n\nWhile I think the new support items will make supporting feel more fun, I think supports will eventually need to be placed on the same gold and experience bar as everyone else, even if they still don't take CS, and their items should follow suit. At no point should an AP-scaling caster support consider swapping out their support build for a mage build, simply because the latter provides more raw power. Balancing a champion around two different positions is difficult enough without also having to consider two completely different levels of gold income, and leveling that difference would likely make Riot's job easier, and make support and mage players happier. \n\nAdding to this, I think support items need to genuinely enhance their power: not only are supports isolated from a lot of non-support itemization due to their lesser gold income, the items they have often give them a heap of stats that don't feel all that desirable individually, rarely synergize with the item's core effect and often feel completely secondary to the item's niche or purpose. There still isn't really a dedicated support stat (mana regen doesn't really count), despite the fact that supports have this unique strength above all other classes: utility. If supports had a dedicated utility-empowering stat, they'd finally get to have strong, desirable stats on items without making them too generically good on other classes, which is a current problem with AP, and they'd finally get to feel like their itemization truly enhances the power of their own kit, instead of just giving them more actives to play with (which is cool, but has its limitations). We already sort of have this in the form of Forbidden Idol's bonus to healing and shields, but support utility goes beyond that, and takes many more forms (usually boosts to various stats). \n\nIn the longer term, I'd also like supports to have more freedom of movement, and it'd be nice to see more supports in the jungle and in other lanes, and not just bot lane. There's often confusion with the support _class_ and the support _role_, and one of the reasons behind that is that the support class is almost completely restricted to bot lane, alongside a marksman. Meanwhile, every other class has at least two different positions to choose from, and it's not rare to see more than one member of any other class on the same team. If supports were given that same freedom, more players would be able to enjoy supports, and it would also allow bot lane to be a little less restrictive: if more supports were popular enough in the jungle, for example, it would be okay for more mages or tanks to go into bot lane, since they wouldn't crowd the support class out of the game. If supports were allowed to duo with top and mid laners, diversity would increase exponentially on so many levels: supports would get to interact with classes besides marksmen in lane, non-marksmen would get to enjoy the full duo lane experience, and both the compositional and positional metas would be significantly less rigid.","replies":[{"poster":"dark100dark100","date":"2016-10-29T10:25:19.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"True.

My only issues  are that it is really fun when your team is doing well, but really frustrating when your team is struggling.

As bard support I would much rather rush medallion and then start building a zzrot portal as this offers better stats earlier on. It's rough when sightstone only offers health and vision, when supports really need some stat boosts early to help be more impactful. I would be more apt to build sight stone if the sight stone itself offered Magic Resist, Armor, and Health.

Keeping the one gold for minions slain by allies, but the second part could be something like double gold income when alone*only active if you have a Sightstone item. On the items side, it could have the unique passive of \"passive xp gain, but lower kill xp. *Bandit mastery required\"\n\nThen we could micro buff ADCs to have better survivability and Supports could be dedicated roamers. RIOT could actually let Supports be supportive of the team for the whole game, not just after 20 minutes. At this point the issue of this kind of thing being abuse will come up, just tie Sightstone into the Exhaust summoner spell. That would mean anyone who wants to use this must give up the option of Dangerous Game, whatever comes in as the third option in that mastery tier, an item slot, and a summoner spell to get passive xp and greater gold.\n\nOnce everything is in place, balance as needed and you will have Supports who are accually level with the team which equates to better survivability when caught in duals and fights. ADCs who get full xp, have thier own lane, have a better time against dives and 1v2s, could also teach them to ward more. Finally Supports can help on the opposite side of the map while the JG is contesting objectives and there is a wider range of vision for the whole team.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hryna","date":"2016-10-28T17:44:26.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is really hard to play.
