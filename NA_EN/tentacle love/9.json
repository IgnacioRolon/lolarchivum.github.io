It could also work as Vi or Rek'Sai, though at that point you'd be focusing more on getting the kill on the enemy jungler and smiting the creep to finish it off, then maybe getting another camp done before one of the enemy team's champs starts moving in on you.\r\n\r\nBut I haven't seen a single champion advertised as a counterjungler in any of their guides. I haven't heard any discussion about the poaching knife being a good investment. I haven't heard anyone talking about it at all. Has anyone attempted it, or is everyone just too scared to give it a shot because the Jungle's so hard already?","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-01-06T16:39:12.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think that trailblazer is better for counter jungling than poachers, it actually helps you do the job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-01-06T16:20:42.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Kowe stated, Poacher ironically makes it more difficult to counter jungle, since its telegraphs your intents to counter jungle to the opposing team, as thus, enemy jungles will usually be littered with wards to pick you off in an easy collapse upon you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2015-01-06T16:00:41.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On Nunu.\nBut after the first 8 minutes into the game the enemy jungle had wards like they were christmas tree decorations since my item gave me away.\nIf I even tried to approach I had 3 champions running towards me...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lstrike","date":"2015-01-06T07:19:06.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More than it being not worth, the other choices (especially chilling smite) are better..","replies":[]},{"poster":"yukumari","date":"2015-01-06T06:57:28.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyvana, yea.
