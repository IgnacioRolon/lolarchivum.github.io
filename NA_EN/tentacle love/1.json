That's a nothing.\r\n\r\nWhy are you even looking at her W? \r\n\r\nIf you really want to make an impactful decision when it comes to Evelynn why not ask yourself what an assassin really wants.\r\nVirtually any character in this game (except Evelynn) can sneak up on targets by simply using brush and wards intelligently. [Evelynn's passive only gives her player a false sense of security because she gets spotted way too easily]\r\n\r\nEvelynn doesn't need an engage. Evelynn needs a disengage that can help her get over walls. You know, like every single viable character.\r\n\r\nIt also wouldn't hurt if her ultimate was capable of killing targets.","replies":[{"poster":"FancyKiwi","date":"2015-03-14T01:30:37.290+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just don't know what to do with her.
