Just for those times when your team is silly and picks AD jungle, AD top, AD, mid, seems like it would be a good option to have an APC marksmen as an option. Just have their passive be all damage deals magic damage instead of physical or something.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2017-03-18T00:59:37.532+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:42}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2017-03-18T00:59:35.067+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:268}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-18T00:58:43.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:115}}{{champion:96}} {{champion:42}} \n{{champion:268}} is _technically_ called a marksman","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-03-18T02:33:18.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it's far more cancerous?","replies":[{"poster":"thecowley","date":"2017-03-18T02:42:35.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MissingKayo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rXvEBjgZ,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2017-03-18T02:33:18.756+0000)\n>\n> Because it&#x27;s far more cancerous?\n\nHow? There are two mr and ad items that you can build first or second to help in lane. I actually really dislike the idea that marksmen have to own botlane. You don't have to have a mage mid and a fighter top. The super strick meta is my less favorite thing about this game at times.","replies":[{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-03-18T03:00:55.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because there are far less MR options, and MR is generally meant to be anti-burst, not anti-DPS.\nNor are there any attack speed reduction MR items.\nThat's part of the reason why just about every single AP DPS champion is cancer if they are even slightly good.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShriekMauler","date":"2017-03-18T01:01:03.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:16}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-03-18T03:48:26.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:10}}  {{champion:96}} {{champion:42}}  {{champion:17}} .\nfuk even {{champion:150}}  but it just isnt capitalized on","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2017-03-18T02:49:47.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:30}}  lul","replies":[]},{"poster":"JamesTheMage17","date":"2017-03-18T02:48:09.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:268}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-03-18T02:27:36.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:110}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-03-18T02:21:04.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additional one people seem to be forgetting: {{champion:4}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2017-03-18T02:11:06.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:96}} 's W?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-18T01:59:22.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you even try looking...?\n\n\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:96}} \n\n\nOr just follow what everyone else does and go {{champion:115}} (not a marksman, but hell... build morellos and you'll be spamming enough like you're autoing.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Viktor Von Lazer","date":"2017-03-18T01:17:44.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best example of that to me is Azir.
