I dont see how her identity is that different from lulu. Although they play very different, I love playing Karma and hate playing lulu. \r\n\r\nI feel like most champions that share a identity (Bruiser, enchanter, burst mage, assassin, adc....) all play similar and their non-lore identity are similar. So I dont really understand what people mean she lacks identity. \r\n\r\nDo they mean she wants to be both a poke champ and a shield champ? Well I think she maybe her being both is her identity?  Right now Id say she does a Great job of being a shield champ mid to late game and is only really good poke early unless you get fed. I realize some of the new changes will help her poke a bit but not really enough to keep that identity through the end game. I feel like if you want that then buff her R ap ratio of the RQ combo. That way people building mage will feel that impact and it will be a buff to her poke while people who build her Shield/heal bonus wont be poke monsters while still having big shields. \r\n\r\nI feel like she is a very unique champ now, with her Mantra choices I use all of them in almost every game I play. And using the right ones in situations feels very rewarding I think. \r\n\r\nSo what identity is she missing?","replies":[]}
