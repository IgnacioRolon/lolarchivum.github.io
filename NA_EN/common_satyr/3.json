The constant profile glitches being fixed. This months model is go to leagues, cant click on more stats, thus have to click on something else then back to leagues to then finally get into more stats. (anyone remember when champion stats was just one button not a quiz?)\r\n\r\n2. Give Veigar ans Sion the Nasus treatment. You let everyone see his stacks, why not do the same for Veigar and Sion?\r\n\r\n3. **i really want this one** Give executioners the hexdrinker/haunting guise treatment. It falls into the category of \"i really like the passive but the stats are so bad i don't want to build it\". Here is what i propose: Have executioners build into something else, something that gives around 50-60 AD and 25-30% crit, with the current passive and maybe throw on the old school bleed. This item should counter teams that have lots of heal, just like morellos, except morellos is useable.\r\n\r\n4. Fix ohmwreaker. This item has a interesting passive, but like the post above just doesn't give good enough stats. I suggest scraping the item and throwing its active onto morellos. Keep morellos stats the same, but just have the passive ability with ohmwreakers active. Then i think it would see some play.\r\n\r\n5. More options for Void and LW.Id like to see some items that share the same passive as LW and Void staff. LW is a must item for AD champs, only because of the passive. It would be cool to see some items that have the 35% armor pen but paired with attack speed or crit rather then damage. And Void staff is just as needed for all ap casters, have other items with same passive that have lower ap and have cd or movespeed or mana regen. (note these passives will have the same name as void or LW so you cannot have both. Its like how you cant have lich bane and triforce.)\r\n\r\n6. A new anti invisible ward, this ward is also invisible like the green wards.. Here is what i suggest. A ward that costs 75 that doesn't reveal fog of war, but instead will show and allow you to target invisible CHAMPS and TRAPS (not wards)in the area. So think about how rengars ult looks and feels but just in a small area around the ward. Right now warding vs eve is so painful and feel so terrible. Its almost not even worth buying wards vs her right now.\r\n\r\n7. **this one is long overdue** Under champions tab in the profile, Each champions abilities and how much damage each one does at each with along with the ap/ad scaling should be shown. Its really annoying that i have to go to a 3rd party site to look up a ap ratio or base damage of say Annie Q. That information should be built into the client. And on that note, throw some in game screen shots of each skin for each champions as well.\r\n\r\n8. Change the animation of anti heal (say mf autos or trist E) so it doesn't look so close to ignite. Its really annoying thinking of ignite will finish and then realize it was not ignite.\r\n\r\n9. End game stats should show # of wards placed and killed by each player. Im really enjoying this statistic which is shown on lolking match history.\r\n\r\n10. On the client match history: remove Damage taken and dealt (no one cares about those misleading stats) Add the good stats of Damage deal to champions and damage taken from champions. Also add in the ward stats from #9\r\n\r\n11. A feature to hid your presence from being online. Sometimes you want to play but you don't want to be bombarded with invites or people talking to you.\r\n\r\n12. For riot to keep us up to date on changes more often. To what I'm referring is things like the viktor rework that solcrushed was working on. We were told it was happening. Then........ Nothing. Its okay if you scrapped it, but please voice that to us and why. Its the same story as the original Magma chamber, it went for so long before people realized it just was not happening. You did a good job the 2nd time you scrapped it, you made a formal post about it saying we are not doing it, here is why. On this note, is Dragon master swain still a thing? We are still waiting on that.\r\n\r\nThat is all i got for now, feel free to have a civil discussion, and add things that you would like to see happen. If you agree with some and not all of what i said, up vote and then talk about the numbers you disagree with. Sorry for my terrible grammar and such, I am not the best of writers.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaFifer","date":"2014-06-10T19:10:49.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some good ideas.
