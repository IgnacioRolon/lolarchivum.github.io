I feel he in my opinion on eof the ones who needs it most (maybe sion needs it more). Taric is rather popular, maybe the most popular of the block feet champions. I would love to see him get a sweet new model. \r\n\r\nAlso i would pay lots of RP for a skin after the VU where he has a bad ass knight helmet (one that covers his whole face) and where he has a weapon of normal proportions. I know people like their flamboyant taric, but skins are all about creating a new history or theme around the champion. A bad ass knight seems like a good skin theme to me. \r\n\r\nI understand if you cant go into much detail at the moment, but i just want to know where taric stands on the list of VU's. \r\n\r\n\r\n@IronSylus\r\n@Parrot\r\n@VU team","replies":[{"poster":"Solanar","date":"2014-03-13T14:37:03.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Dudebro mentioned that Taric is on the list but that they want to be careful because he does have such a large following.
