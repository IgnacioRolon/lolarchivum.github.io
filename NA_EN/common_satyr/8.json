Almost every adc seems to be real angry all the time about anything that moves. I&#039;m seeing straight troll picks like draven and amumu top. I don&#039;t understand what is going on?\r\n\r\nLast game the enemy aatrox was running it down mid, when I ask him why he is inting he simply replied &quot;we cant win&quot;. Like he admitted it in all chat. How do these players not lose their accounts instantly?\r\n\r\nEvery other preseason has felt like just every other ranked day. But this year it feels like people actively just don&#039;t care cuz &quot;preseason&quot;. idk man, makes me sad.\r\n\r\nGames seem more toxic to you guys as well? Or am I the lucky one?","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-11-18T02:54:38.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those trolls that are ACTUALLY trolling, and those that are not just 0/8 in a 20 minute game (that isnt inting. Going 0/15 in 20 minutes is pretty much assured they are inting however. Or if they are doing as you said and literally running it down after a certain time).\n\nThen you can send in a support ticket and have a better chance of having someone review the case, due to it being something not as easily caught by the IFS.\n\nMore details can be found in my post here for an example of how to word it to the support team, and some details of what they would more likely accept. \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/q7oXMgI0-seems-to-be-a-little-known-fact\n\nMy advice though is to limit it to like one or two really bad trolling games that you KNOW without a doubt is just trying to grief their team per day if that. Dont flood them with every single game you have done since the beginning of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempist","date":"2018-11-18T10:26:37.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried that before. I remember recording the games in question, gave them time stamps so they don't have to watch the entire thing - just the parts where a player ran it down mid super obviously. Checked the accounts later (yes, I did it more than once). Nothing happened.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, unless you get lucky or they happen troll on a popular stream, trolling is not punished.\n\nAnd if the troll has half a brain and chooses to soft int instead of making it blatantly obvious, you're as likely to win the lottery as you are to see them punished.\n\nOne can't even call Riot's policing of trolls/inters hopelessly inadequate, as that would require some semblance of a system to exist in the first place. It would be funny, if it wasn't so sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-11-18T10:41:22.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not a for sure thing right away.\n\nIt has to go through many processes and then get to someone who has the ability to do something about it, have them have the time to watch it, and then get the punishment done for it to happen. Expecting it within a week is pushing it, but it is more likely to be caught and punished.\n\n\"Smart\" and \"trolls\" do not go hand in hand in the sense that you are wanting it to. If they are trolling, they want it obvious so that they can see the reactions. Trolls LIVE for that attention. Dont give it to them and they die off.\n\nThis \"soft int\" thing is really starting to be more of a meme to me. People use it for if someone gets outplayed in lane vs a Leblanc and then are forced to be nowhere near the leblanc or they die... which means their only way of survival is to stay away from CS, which then people flame going \"this person has no cs and \"fed\" this leblanc\" when the leblanc starts roaming and killing people.... you see where theres a heavy flaw in logic here? Do you want them to survive and not feed or to get cs and have a greater chance of ending up dieing to them?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HavokDash","date":"2018-11-18T05:41:35.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why I dont follow the \"cult of meta\" and I play whatever tf I feel like. I really do not care anymore. I play what I am gonna try and win with. Not what is dictated to me. \nI was severely turned off playing \"meta\" because I got sick of the players using it as a cudgel, some blunt object to beat thier team over the head with. Got something that only YOU can play, Something that works with YOU and wouldnt nececarrily work for others? \nTOO BAD! The meta says ur not allowed to play that and have to choose from these \"pre-approved\" champs/builds instead. \n\nTrying to play something that works for YOU, helps YOU to succeed and win your matches? NOT ALLOWED. You are obviously trolling/griefing and need to be reported, Enjoy ur permaban.\n\nThis attitude is so thick, especially in low elo that people are not ALLOWED to think for themselves anymore. Teams are more concerned about micromanaging thier teammates champs/builds that matches are lost.\nI always take smite, for example. \nWhy?\nBecause 9/10 matches my jungler is too busy browbeating the rest of the team \"you chant play that champ, ur X\" \"ur not allowed to use those summoner spells\" \"I have never seen a X champ work, CHANGE IT NAO\"\nThen we get into the match, and the first thing I hear from jungler is \"gg RiP.....I forgot {{summoner:11}}\"\n\nPlayers are more concerned with controlling who and what thier team plays, Rather than ACTUALLY PLAYING THE DAMN GAME. And they treat the meta like the cult and they are the Spanish inquisition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeracadaVenom","date":"2018-11-18T04:05:41.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been doing some weird off meta stuff in normals to see if it works, but i would never int.
