However, you do have a much better chance [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with Riot Games Player Support! \n\nHere are some things to keep in mind as you submit your ticket:\n\n1. Player Support has no obligation to fulfill the request. \n2. You'll have a much better chance of getting the RP you need if you submit a drawing you made of a champion (or so I've heard).\n3. If you do get an RP grant, you won't be able to request it in the future. These grants are given at maximum, once per account per lifetime. \n\nWith that being said, good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-22T00:01:09.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there :) You may want to Tweet @riotsupport to help you with this predicament!
