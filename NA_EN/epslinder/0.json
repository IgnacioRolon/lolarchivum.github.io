Due to that I was flagged for leaving and given wait times before my matches. While I didn't feel I deserved that it's understandable so I just waited. However, after waiting I would be kicked from matchmaking and when I tried to rejoin it would reset my time. This has happened consistently after multiple uninstalls/reinstalls.
