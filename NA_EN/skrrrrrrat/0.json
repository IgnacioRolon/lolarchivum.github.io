Seriously, who the fuck would do this in a LOW LVL normal?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T22:32:07.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't quite sound like any kind of drop hack, but rather a game that crashed on the server. These happen pretty rarely, but when they do they happen just like this. Big lag spikes followed by everyone disconnecting, and then nobody is able to reconnect and the game just doesn't exist anywhere you look. \n\nNo worries, you won't get any punishments and everyone should be able to requeue just fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leyin","date":"2017-11-20T12:53:24.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is Riot's tool. It happens sometimes that there is a error in your game and so Riot's tool is looking for a solution and if there is no chance to fix it, they shut down the game and it ends in a draw that if you play ranked, you don't get a loose because there was a bug or an error in the data files of Riot's Server","replies":[]}]}
