It was switching between 20 frames where i would jump around, then jumping up to 100 for a second just to re-drop back down. I couldn't even do anything as i would walk towards a minion to cs, then it would take a second to even see me shoot a auto or a spell. by that time the enemy just poked me for free while i couldn't do anything. \r\n\r\nIt isn't my computer or graphics card or anything, i can play any other game (Arma 3, EFT, rocket league) with no frame issues, it's only on league. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-19T22:15:27.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey what OS and video card are you using?  Have you updated your drivers yet? This is especially important if you recently updated your OS.    Are you running the game in Full Screen or Borderless?  You could also have some bad game files, a repair could help.
