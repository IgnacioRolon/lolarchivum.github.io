I don&#039;t frequent the forums at all, but I am sure many of these type posts have been made. Some good , some bad. Currently, I am suspended for 14 games. I previously have had 2 accounts perma banned that I spent a decent amount of money on. Below I have quoted the exact text that got me suspended with comments. I may be an ass sometimes, but never have I ever said hate speech(racist, homophobic, ect). Never have I said someone should walk into traffic or kill themselves, which many have said to me. I curse and I get frustrated, but I always pertain it to the game. \n\nI find it sickening at what is considered &quot;toxic&quot; in this game. Never-mind the person that will not speak in champ select and troll picks, or goes 0-7 in the first 10 min. The person that goes afk 3 times in a match but always comes back just in time to avoid penalty. Let&#039;s not even bring up how bad it was before people got to choose their role. Never-mind the people the ACTUALLY ruin games. They can do that all they want, with 0 penalty. But, don&#039;t you dare say a word about it. And don&#039;t you dare tell someone they suck because they are ruining a game or feeding. What&#039;s worse is that I was suspended less that 5 min after a game. Who is reviewing this? A pre-made of 4 could troll and just report people and get accounts people spent money on banned? That isn&#039;t right.\n\nWhen  I started this game, Shen was the new champ. Not sure how close to beta that was. Not once have I ever seen Riot make a point to separate Ranked from Normal. Ranked is supposed to be competitive, Look at any competitive sport in the world, and tell me emotions don&#039;t run high. I&#039;m sorry, but if can&#039;t handle few curse words then GTFO and play normal. It&#039;s horrible that Riot still caters to this passive aggressive bullshit and in effect steals, yes STEALS, money from people over it. Riot, haven&#039;t you make your Gazillions already? Can&#039;t you actually make ranked a skill based competition? Stop catering to these children so you can make an extra buck and rob the real players out there. \n\nAnd no, going through support isn&#039;t the best route. I tried that multiple times and all you get is a copy and paste bullshit suit and tie answer. NOTHING I said deserves a suspension. Anyways, as I said, here is the game chat logs that got me suspended this time. Judge for yourself if should be able to play for 2 weeks:\n\nGame 1\nBlindPizzaGuy: if u guys lose this u should feel really bad\nBlindPizzaGuy: we have 3adcs and an ekko support\nBlindPizzaGuy: they are morons                                                          --This speaks for itself\nBlindPizzaGuy: im silver                                                                        -- The other team said &quot; Welcome to Bronze&quot;\nBlindPizzaGuy: no need for a corki mid honestly\nBlindPizzaGuy: in b5 maybe\nBlindPizzaGuy: free kill top                                                                 - Top lane was pushed and I was telling jungle to come get a kill\nBlindPizzaGuy: guess u didnt want it                                                -- I killed him without a gank\nBlindPizzaGuy: o u bastard lol                                                           - I got ganked and died\nBlindPizzaGuy: naw i almost kille d them both kayle s lt                - Jungle asked if I needed help top-\nBlindPizzaGuy: shit\nBlindPizzaGuy: why\nBlindPizzaGuy: wow man really                                                          - Clearly blatent KS  \nBlindPizzaGuy: terrible idea\nBlindPizzaGuy: always get tower 1st                                                 -JG pinged me off tower for Rift Herald.

Summoners who exhibit this behavior **and have a trend of leaving/idling in games** will be placed in a low priority queue\n\nEmphasis mine.\n \n> 2- Wrong. IF a premade of decided they would report any 5th they play with, then that completely eliminates your arguement(Trolls happen)\n\nYes trolls happen, but the system is designed so that a pre-made group can't report you and instantly get you punished on the spot. From [Riot Tantram](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/unobngtr-how-player-behavior-penalties-affect-hextech-crafting?show=rundown): \n\n>Actually, Erdrik is correct here.\n\n>A report flags a game for review. They do not establish guilt. The game is then reviewed for harassment, feeding, etc. This is why 'troll reporting' or 'gang reporting' do not work. False or inaccurate reports are thrown out.\n\n>You cannot ever be punished for saying nothing .. unless of course it's for something gameplay related like feeding, afking or cheating. But, you can never be punished for offensive language, hate speech or verbal abuse if you said nothing.\n\nSimply put if you know that you've done nothing wrong then you don't have to worry about being punished for something that you didn't do in that game. On the flip-side though if you know that you've been acting up in that game and a pre-made decides to report you for it then you will be punished solely because of your actions alone in that game rather than because of the pre-made reporting you.\n \n> 3- I&#x27;ve been called a&quot;kid&quot; already 3 or 4 times in this thread, yet I&#x27;m the problem.\n\nIf someone else has a harassment filled post then report it. Don't add onto the negativity by becoming negative yourself. Just like in-game retaliation is not okay on the forums, and if you retaliate then you both get punished period.\n \n> 4- That is horseshit, a legal technicality.\n\nThis is Riot's house and Riot's rules. If you refuse to follow their rules then they reserve the right to kick you out of their house. It's the same with any other gaming company where if you don't or won't follow their rules then they can just kick you out of their game because of it. Be thankful that Riot even gives people the chance to try to Reform first rather than just immediately booting them from the game outright like most other companies do.\n\nP.S.

It isn't your job and it is really annoying and tilting. If you said everything you said in a more positive and constructive way, like giving a solution instead of just the problem, then you would probably never even be reported.\n\nGood luck in the future if you continue to play, and keep in mind that your next punishment will be a permanent ban on this account unless you go a considerable length of time showing signs of reforming.

You also agreed that you could be banned if, according to section 2.1.2 subsection (c), &quot;doing so would be in the best interests of our community, the Riot Services, or the rights of a third party.&quot; I am not speaking for Riot games 100%, but if I had to guess in court they would go with that one.\n> \n> ---\n> &quot;Stop catering to these children so you can make an extra buck and rob the real players out there.&quot;\n> \n> The only reason they are making any extra money off of you is because you come back and give it to them.

If you said everything you said in a more positive and constructive way, like giving a solution instead of just the problem, then you would probably never even be reported.\n> \n> Good luck in the future if you continue to play, and keep in mind that your next punishment will be a permanent ban on this account unless you go a considerable length of time showing signs of reforming. That will lower your tier of punishment.\n\nThis is the 1st decent response in the entire thread. Someone made his point without being a dick, or giving an answer that makes no sense.

Before your 2 week ban you should have gotten a 10 game chat restriction, and then a 25 game chat restriction. It isn't usually based on severity unless it is very severe, which will skip you tiers. Basically you are being punished for consistency, you type too much and too harshly on too many things.\n\nRiot has been pretty transparent about the loot rewards being a reward for good gameplay AND good behavior since the start, not Lyte levels of transparent but the info has been out there.\n\nI didn't literally mean nobody wants to play with you, I played the comment up a bit to try to show the dramatic difference between what you think Riot thinks is wrong with your behavior and what they actually think is wrong. Of course there are people out there who will play with you, you don't seem like a bad person to people who you know and can have extended discussions with. Your issue is interacting with the various people you haven't been able to establish a connection with. You don't know them so you fill in the gaps with assumptions that they are bad. Then every time something bad happens you tell them without offering a solution. This makes the other person feel trapped and nervous, which makes them lose concentration and play worse, which further decreases your opinion of them. This cycles out of control until you lose the game and assume that because their score is bad that they were intentionally feeding or just not listening to you.\n\nThe reason why league is considered so toxic is because of a few reasons. It was the first really really massive game that required good communication and large time investments to play, along with being slow paced enough to make chat a big deal. So you have investment, random people put together, stress, and publicity.\n\nOn top of that Riot has made large, transparent steps toward reducing the toxicity. A lot of what they have done has worked from a statistical standpoint, but the fact that they have done it for so long so openly makes people think the issue is bigger than it is.","replies":[{"poster":"BlindPizzaGuy","date":"2016-09-24T18:52:29.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lUzecPNz,comment-id=000700000000,timestamp=2016-09-24T17:59:03.150+0000)\n>\n> The punishment system works in tiers.

Massive in a MMO refers to the size of the game world, and how many players can be in the same game world at the same time. You wouldn't consider Call of Duty a MMO would you? So, no, actual data does not reflect that. The GAME itself isn't massive. At most it has 10 people at once.\n\n2nd Blizzard does not monitor Guilds at all, the players that run the guild do, and players can be kicked for any reason because of this.\n\nI'm hoping to deter trolls and feeders from being trolls and feeders. And, something that you probably didn't consider, is that you can not see the text from the other players in my chat logs.

That is what the \"massive\" in \"massive multiplayer\" means, that it connects a massive amount of people. It is one of the top games right now. None of the games you listed really introduce a high stress environment for long periods of time besides DoTA in my opinion (I don't recognize SWG or DAoC and don't feel like looking them up). Most of them are easy grind fests. They have raids, but there is subjective evidence out there that rage in raids is harsher than in League.\n\nAnd to your second point, I would like to restate something I said earlier and expand upon it a bit maybe. Nobody is really offended by what you are saying. Nobody is crying about it, very few people are going to think about you in particular three days later. The issue is that people are harassing others consistently. Nobody wants to queue up 5 times in one day and have to deal with people criticizing everything they do for 20-40 minutes each time and not having a fair way out of it. You are creating an environment that other people do not want to be in, and Riot has decided they do not want people doing that.\n\nTypically by the time the mute button needs to be used the negative person in question has already tilted the game and made everyone's experience worse. There is a mute button to relieve a bit of that pressure, there is also a report button to help prevent it from happening to people in the future.\n\nYou maybe have been bumped up an extra tier due to the frequency of your negativity or it may have been a manual review if you have only been punished once prior.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2016-09-24T18:34:07.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its games not days","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-09-24T18:36:13.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=scazzman,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lUzecPNz,comment-id=0007000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-24T18:34:07.053+0000)\n>\n> its games not days\n\nYou are right, I was editing that sentence from something else and forgot to fix it XD\n\nThank you for pointing that out for me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2016-09-24T16:47:44.434+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game 1:\nNonstop playing the blame-game, needlessly complaining about \"killsteals\",  report calling (which in your own words is considered \"passive aggressive bullshit\")\n\nGame 2:\nSame thing minus the killsteals.\n\nAt the end a few more direct remarks:\n>BlindPizzaGuy: go play tetris\n>BlindPizzaGuy: my attitude is that u suck\n\nAnd somewhere in the middle this, which could even be considered homophobic:\n>BlindPizzaGuy: must be hard to type with each others cocks in your mouths - Yeah well, they deserved it\n\n\nSorry if you disagree with what Riot considers toxic, but I'm very very sure the majority of the community actually agrees with this.

But do any of the companies EVER cut you off from service. HELL no. Because it is wrong to steal from people. It's as simple as that.\n\nI would love to know what world you live in where this actually happens.  Because I don't think this has ever happened to me, where my medical insurance just gave up because I was being annoying and they had the \"customer is always right\" mentality.  People like to think that the \"customer is always right\" is the way things work, but that only is correct in the retail buisness.  With reoccurring payments (cellphone, internet, insurance) that isn't the case at all.\n\n> Yet, this game has been for years and still is widely considered to have the worst gaming community of all time.

I paid for it, if I can't use it anymore, I should be refunded at least part of it. Otherwise it's bad business ethics. \n\nI live in a world where companies don't ban you from using their service for being angry. Customer always right? That is not what I was saying at all. I never even hinted at the customer being right. What are you talking about?\n\nIts not a stereotype. It's a consensuses. Open you browser, type in \"Worst gaming community\". It's not even close.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2016-09-24T16:51:25.316+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The title of this post is \"player penalties are completely immoral and unfair\" and yet not once in your post do you give a decent argument how player penalties are completely immoral and unfair.\n\nPeople who feed or troll in ranked get punished all the time so I have no idea what you're talking about that those actions have zero penalty.

And what do you mean they get punished all the time? Show me some data confirming such nonsense. The # of people that are suspended I would bet is SIGNIFICANTLY higher for those who \"say mean words\" compared to those who actually troll.  And no, I don't read them and neither do most people.  I shouldn't need to be a lawyer to play the game.\n\nI know you want to sound smart but no, none of what you say is a decent argument.","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2016-09-24T17:38:23.985+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said decent arguments.

However, if you are going to make a claim like that then I'm going to hold you to the same standard as you hold me and ask for some data showing that the number of people who are banned for toxicity is significantly higher than for other reasons.
