On top of the instability of disconnections, you're also risking match losses, [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ), and also hurting those in-game who have to be down a player.  \n\nI'm glad to hear that this is being worked on, but it might be a good day to take a break from matchmaking until it's resolved.  Hopefully your ISP will be able to offer swift assistance in whatever is causing this, but just in case I also recommend the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.
