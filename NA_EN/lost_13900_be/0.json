Fiora gets an extensive re-tuning and change, while Miss Fortune got GW removed, and an extremely situational laning phase buff on Q, which requires your opponent to have bad positioning in order to use.  Why the discrepancy and favoritism towards certain champs over others?  \n\nIt's pretty universal across the boards that the MF update is vastly underwhelming, and damaging to her identity as the Marksmen that she used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-07-21T19:54:18.713+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's because Fiora's gameplay was very binary and non-interactive as the enemy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-07-21T21:11:28.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"...and damaging to her identity as the Marksmen that she used to be.\"\n\nYeah, because GW was the core piece that made her a marksman.\n\nI think they added some functionality between her w and ult.

And also, MF still did have a pretty interactive gameplay and wasn't all that of a liability if she fell behind cause she, at best, did damage from range and had a slow. Fiora however was a click-to-kill champion, nothing interactive about her, and was utterly worthless if she fell behind, cause she had to be in melee range to be able to do anything, hence she got an extensive rework, ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-07-21T21:17:57.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Fiora and Ms Fortune are different champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wizarcanum","date":"2015-07-21T23:08:22.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plz don't change fiora art ='(\n='(\n='(\n='(\n{{champion:114}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-07-21T22:14:47.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The kit and game design look good.

That doesn't really make any sense to me.

She's _extremely_ fast. New lunge looks like it's a dash and then a strike, rather than a dash and a strike in one motion as it should be. From the looks of it, I could probably lunge auto lunge on live Fiora in the time it takes to complete lunge on the new one. \n\nThen, I can't really tell on movement speed, but attack speed and dashing around is clearly diminished. And while countering CC is neat, I just hope it doesn't root her and keep her from attacking. On live, Fiora can dodge CC most of the time anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Xypher","date":"2015-07-21T22:28:15.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riposte is a targeted slow or stun depending on what you use it on, and she doesn't immobilise or CC her in anyway, so it's basically a nice way to chase down someone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lost 13900 BE","date":"2015-07-21T20:08:33.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also the heal is AOE for all the allies inside the area?","replies":[{"poster":"Xypher","date":"2015-07-21T22:24:30.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the skill video that they posted on her rework page, the Jarvan was healing too in her ult rage, so yeah it seems it's an AoE heal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xypher","date":"2015-07-21T22:22:34.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nicely done!

What i mean is that her dashes and ult were quick and made it hard to keep track of her. \n\nWhy would you NOT go tanky/full tank now? Her kit has nowhere near the damage and scaling (other than the passive) that it used to. Her E makes getting crit items terrible. She'll have huge problems out dueling people now without tank stats.

You say it takes no skill to play her. This is not true at all. Yes her abilities are straightforward and simplistic, but SHE takes skill to play. The big problem was that she was typically useless in team fights because she would be focused and any form of crowd control would shut her down. It took skill to learn how to strategically decide when to go in and who to go in on. \"OOHHH, but you're forgetting about her ult!\" Yeah well her ult may deal a ton of damage, but it's pretty much useless except for the on hit lifesteal and untargetable part. In a team fight all you would do is deal some damage and die after your ult stopped. Fiora was never meant to be a team fighting champion. While she can built to be a  bruiser, she loses some of her assassinating potential. When I play Fiora I'm either helping out as best I can in a team fight, or I'm split pushing. Heck by the time I had a near full build I could solo turrets with her. No minions or anything just tanking the dang thing. I've already complained enough on my other posts and I have now come to accept the new update...except for the bull crap splash art and skin. Please redo those. I'm sorry but those are worse than Nidalee splash arts....","replies":[]}]}
