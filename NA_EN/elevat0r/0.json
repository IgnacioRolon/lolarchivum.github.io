I lost LP because of this and was wondering if there's a way to get it back or i just have to live with it? I don't really mind, its just that the season ends soon and every last point of LP matters. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T04:25:21.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, what a terrible time for something to happen with the Alpha client! :C\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot modify or refund LP for any reason. The system was created this way to prevent any sort of abuse of the system. To ensure the smoothest experience for the last handful of games you'll play during Season 6, I'd recommend **not** using the Alpha client while grinding away in ranked to ensure any bugs or issues don't cause further loss.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"9II TowerDive","date":"2017-01-16T02:54:26.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing happened to me today, the alpha client crashed and I lost 3 lp in a ranked champ select.
