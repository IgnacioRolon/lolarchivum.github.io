My main is currently d1 6lp and my smurf is plat 5 do to decay. So next season when I do placements can I get into diamond from placements or do I go to plat 1. Currently new and this is my first season I decided to play ranked. Or will it be like last season where d5 players are getting placed in silver or is it finally fixed. Or will it be broken again cause if that's the case I really don't want to play ranked if I'm a d1 player getting into silver like a bunch of friends did","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-31T17:08:13.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on the details for the next season, whenever that is ready to be announced.  I don't think anyone get's placed automatically in Diamond though, but some seasons we've had soft ranked resets as well as complete resets.  It will really depend on any changes, if made, to the new season and the progress during your placements.  No guarantees on placement.","replies":[]}]}
