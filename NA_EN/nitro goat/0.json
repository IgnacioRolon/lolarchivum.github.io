Since each service, website, and game server is located in different geolocations, it's entirely possible to have great latency to one server while having high latency to another. Sometimes local configurations can affect your latency as well, so I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings are optimized for League.\n\nLet me know if you notice any changes after working through that guide.","replies":[]}]}
