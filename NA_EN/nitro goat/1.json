I feel like that was the best thing I could have possibly done for my team, however because I wasn't moving in base for an extended period despite not disconnecting, I still received a \"leavebuster\" notice. Now I have 20 minute queues for what I believe will be 5 games- I don't really have that kind of time extra to burn in my weekday schedule. Could this by any chance be lifted as its obviously unjust?\r\n\r\ntyty\r\n\r\nNitrogoat OCE","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T04:07:41.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of the reason you were inactive in the match, your absence from participating negatively impacts *everyone* in the match.
