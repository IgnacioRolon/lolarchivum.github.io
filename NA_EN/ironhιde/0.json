I used them alot in my games, but now they are apparently removed. The fun thing is, that I can still use my old item sets. Unfortunetly, I do not want them anymore and I can't change or delete them. Hope somebody changes something in the new client ^^\r\nMaybe that is just my opinion, but I really enjoyed making custom item sets for my main champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T20:38:55.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was brought up in a[ recent update](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/client-beta-update-2-replacing-legacy-client-1), and will be worked on for the updated client.  \n\n> ITEM SET CREATOR TOOL will return. Early in the client alpha we announced that we weren't planning to rebuild the legacy client's item set creator tool (although the updated client still supports custom item sets). Players passionately asked us to reconsider, so we did. We now intend to rebuild the item set creator tool, but haven't yet started development work on it, so it could take quite some time even after we replace the legacy client. But it is finally back on our to-do list. Of course, replacing the legacy client still comes first.\n\nThere's no eta I can offer for when that would be and I'm not part of that team, but it's on the radar.  I hope that helps offer some relief!","replies":[]}]}
