I was thinking about tanks and really I am thinking that they are not really that defined in terms of gameplay and mechanics as many times, tank  gears as been abused on non-tanks and I was wondering when tanks are getting a rework as they seem to be a rather aged role to play as in league. I understand that some tanks are up-to-date like Shen and rework taric(if you can call him a tank) but the fact of the matter is that many tanks are of an old school design of dealing magic damage and having high radio&#039;s when they are meant to tank, leading to the likes of AP Rammus, Maokai and Malphite. Don&#039;t get me wrong. I do think that tanks are ok at the moment, but i still think that they need some kind of rework in the future to prevent the game being all about the damage dealers.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-06-18T13:45:42.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, the last one was tahm, and poppy is considered a tank i guess, so her rework basically gave us another one.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-06-18T13:50:23.371+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do they count reworked champions in their release cycle?

Leona has an Armor/MR boost, Malphite has a health shield, Tahm Kench has a health shield, Braum blocks projectiles, Maokai heals on auto attacks after spell casts, etc... \n\nCombine this with CC, and even without tank items these tanks can survive a lot longer than your typical squishy. They may not be AS well defined, but they're still there.\n\nThat isn't to say that there aren't issues with tanks that need to be addressed - short of putting a taunt in every tanks kit there isn't a reliable way to let them really do their job of, well, tanking damage. CC is a good answer to that (just stop the damage outright and have the tankiness to be able to go in and do it) but there's probably still room for some innovative thinking to make it better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"doubleguac","date":"2016-06-19T00:00:43.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins tend to have certain skill sets. They are mobile and bursty, and often have some clutch mitigation tool.\n\nTanks tend to have certain skill sets. They are disruptive (usually with CC), they usually have some skill that helps them soak additional damage, and they usually have a skill or two that encourages enemies to focus them.\n\nMalphite, Sejuani, and Amumu all have some kind of initiation, multiple CC skills, and a big AoE lockdown on their ultimates. That's no a coincidence. They all features those because they are all traditional tanks. \n\n>A Vayne can go full ap or full tank but she still remains an adc (just a much much weaker one)\n\nAn sejuani who builds straight AD is still a tank.

I could see them after assassins (so if assassins are the preseason, tanks would be mid season 7) but diving fighters might get that slot (as a tank player, I hope not). \n\nI'm not sure what they'd try to do for a tank update though. Items will be a tough job since pretty much any item good on a tank is great on a juggernaut (which are usually the first type of champions to bring frustration with these items) which they may want to avoid. \n\nThey might cut the early game strengths of tanks down (I think a lot of older tanks are pretty durable early game) to follow the example of Shen and Sion: two tanks with rather low base stats for their jobs. This is balanced by their self defensive abilities (shields mainly) and also encourages them to build tanky in order to become tanky. \n\n%health damage might become more common on tanks (it's not exactly uncommon though) because it helps keep their damage relevant without building damage (or they will have damage scaling with health like Sion, Shen, Tahm, or Braum). I get that people hate getting killed by tanks and want tanks to do no damage, but that wouldn't promote tanks to be played. Tanks need farm and if they can't farm decently then they can't buy items, this is more important to tank junglers, who would need some decent clear times. \n\nTanks should never do damage on the level of carries. And I haven't seen them do that anyway. For a tank to be as damaging as a carry, they'd be able to destroy other tanks 1v1 relatively quickly because that's what high damage is. It doesn't take much to actually kill a squishy carry that has no sustain (which isn't uncommon early game because they will rush a crit item first most of the time) and isn't kiting (which is difficult depending on the champion and/or level of the champion. Late game Lucian and Vayne are going to kite like made due to their mobility, but immobile adc (like Twitch or Fortune) require good positioning knowledge to be able to kite at all stages of the game). \n\nThere's also making the tanks unique. Again, there are people who hate the design philosophy of specialization since it feels like it shoehorns a champion into a role (like supports being stuck in bot). But that needs to happen on some level because it encourages champion diversity. \n\nTake MSI. Top lane was Tank Ekko, Poppy, and Maokai. Their were no other tanks that were better picks because those tanks were pretty much masters of all. Generalists are fine, except when they do the job of the specialist better on top of doing other things. \n\nEx:Why tank Sion if Malphite provides better engage?   \n\nThese are just my thoughts on tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2016-06-18T13:50:18.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that balance is seriously needed. many of the tanks up top like the ones you mentioned have insane base damage and thus can get away with building tanky. And as for tanks with low HP and high shields, their design is justified as they can be killed easier than other tanks but can outlast them when played right.\n\nAnd going on about tanks with high damage and getting a little personal. I am thinking about my main rammus as I build him tanky and with damage and he can deal a good bit of it because of the scaling of his passive, titanic hydra and grasp of the undying. that is scaling from both armor and damage and that is scary when you think about it as well as his sticking power which is augmented by using Protobelt which is viable on him because of his AP scaling and the Hp it gives. So I was thinking that tanks should either be mobile and less poor damage or immobile and be able to deal damage but not to the extend of juggs unless you want to lost tankiness.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-06-18T13:53:02.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Balancing their damage around their mobility instead of their tankiness could work.

A good argument I saw here was about the Vanguards and the Wardens, with the former being the ones that jump into the enemy team and fucks shit up or the wardens that peel and zone up their enemies and pick them off if they break formation.\n\nNow, you may wonder what is the difference between a tank and a juggernaut? Well correct me if i am wrong, but juggs have more damage in their kit and some defensive abilities but little proper tank utility, Darius's E has a long CD, Garen's Silence is short and single target etc. \n\nTanks on the other hand have something affect a team fight which makes them a threat, Rammus being a Vanguard based tank, has good damage, a defensive steroid, a taunt and an ult that deals serious damage. but what is his trade off?, Too focus on Armor= damage and his CC is not as good as other tanks. Malphite a lot of ways to annoy the enemy team, Q steals speed, W deals AoE damage and his E slows while his ult crashes the party.\nBraum has poor damage but he is a beast in keeping anyone that tries to jump his team. \n\nSo in essence what makes tank a threat is; Durability and threat, which include CC, utility and damage. the difference between Vanguards and wardens is that the former favor damage and the latter utility but that is not really something absolute.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-06-18T17:04:44.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't want tanks to do damage, would you like tanks CCing you every five seconds?

That's the whole point of the difference between a juggernaut and a tank.  Hard engage, for example, is not useless even if you rely on teammates to finish off the target.  Same for peel.  Tanks should have non-damage value, which often comes as CC but could be in other ways (e.g. Shen ult).\n\nBasically as I see it there are four main dimensions of a champion's power: damage, durability, mobility and utility.  Nobody can be good at too many, but different champions and classes are good at different ones.  Durability is sometimes called \"tankiness\" but tanks actually aren't the only class that has high durability, juggernauts do too.  Tanks have high durability and utility, usually low damage, and may or may not have some mobility but not Yasuo/Kalista/Kassadin level.  Juggernauts have high damage and durability, bad mobility and usually very little utility.\n\nSo you can't have *just* durability, but there are multiple other things you can have that can make you useful while you're not dying.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-06-19T01:20:58.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but like I said: all the durability in the world is useless if you have no reason to kill them in a teamfight. If that reason isn't their damage, then it needs to be something like CC. Do you think it's annoying now when Maokai just keeps rooting you? If they lower his damage, he's gonna do that a whole lot more.\n\nSo it's going to be a choice of having tanks do some sort of damage, or having tanks be ridiculous CC monsters, or having tanks give massive buffs to their teammates. I think the first is the least frustrating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2016-06-18T17:59:35.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm but then you have to consider that being a glass cannon with a lot of threat behind you will get you killed, fast. I am not saying that that durability should be overshadowing threat but that it(contradictory to my previous post), but it should be like this Threat ~= Durability. Because some people have argued that threat is a priority and I have been in favor of Durability. but both is was is needed for a tank to function, some are more offensive, other should be more defensive but we are not talking about one champion nor is their only one tank champ in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-06-18T18:00:23.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DragonShea,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EnguWm9m,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2016-06-18T17:28:51.485+0000)\n>\n> That is not the issue.
