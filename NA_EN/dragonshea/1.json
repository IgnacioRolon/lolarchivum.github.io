Brand/Kegan Rodhe&#039;s Backstory is really sad and deals with a lot of adult themes. I feel sorry for both of them and the allusion of being the Son of a Healer and a Raider is just a thin veil for what really happened. Rape! Not just rape, but victim blaming as well on top of the superstition of women with magical power. Just seeing someone like her crying a lot and not being mentally able to raise her son properly alongside the ostracization of the villager is just sad, man. \r\n\r\nWIthout a doubt, From the Ashes is the most hardcore, realistic and grim story ever.\r\n\r\nAnd as for Kegan, I don&#039;t blame him for doing what he did, hell on some level he is justified in burning his village to the ground. Instead of pity, his family got scorned, instead of sympathy, they got antipathy, instead of mercy, cruelty.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s amazing that Krezia didn&#039;t go insane after what happened and still raised her son after what happened. To still do your duty and have kindness after all of **THAT** is strength of character. And I hope in the future that She becomes a champion, a spirit of healing of some sorts.","replies":[{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2018-07-26T08:00:00.774+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt will ever see her as a champion.
