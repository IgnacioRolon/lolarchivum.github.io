As you all know A lot of people say they will report someone because they are losing a game for legitimate reasons. And to be honest. I wish those people get a sledgehammer to their balls for it, because it&#039;s the height of arrogance coming from them. I know that League can be toxic but when you are going bad for legit reasons, connection getting bad all of a sudden, losing your lane, players refusing to corporate etc. and then have them threaten to report for it is infuriating. '\n\n\nTo summon those people up: they are people that will look for any excuse to abuse the banhammer and report and punish other for hurting their fragile feeling and they are the ones that should be reported for verbal abuse, in short they want to punish or even ban others for making mistakes and that is not ban worthy.\n\nSo what Happened was that I was playing against a Heimer that I would likely have stomped if not for my bad connection that happened out of the blue, My mid was being an ass to me, saying I was AFK'ing when it was my connection that was bad. I explained it to him, he still said I was AFK'ing and used it as an excuse to harass me for it. So we lost the game, and I told him; \"Do you have any Idea how much it pisses me off to have bad connection right now\" He said I should never play the game again I told him he was being selfish before he left the chat after the match.\n\n\nPersonally I&#039;ve never seen anyone being punished wrongfully for being hate over non-trolling or unintentional bad play because some scumbag decided to report him for having a bad game. But if so, I hope this calm rant/constructive criticism post of those people gotta know that I&#039;ll back you up if anyone got hate from those jackasses.\n\nPeace out (and sometimes you are too annoyed to press the mute button)","replies":[{"poster":"Fargo79","date":"2017-08-26T00:59:09.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Love it when the enemy team cries for us to report one of their teammates for being toxic.. my response is \"I cant report something i cant see.. so pls keep your problems in your own chat and not use it for all chat.\"  if they continue to cry for reports then i just report the cry babies under \"Verbal abuse and negative attitude\".. whether the reports actually do anything i dont know.. but when they do eventually get around to it its good to have them there for the banning process...","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2017-08-26T20:13:05.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fargo79,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jPEneKgr,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-08-26T00:59:09.890+0000)\n>\n> I cant report something i cant see.. so pls keep your problems in your own chat and not use it for all chat.\n\n\nMan that made me laugh.

One player feeds their lane, endgame starts and we ask them several times to stay with group and not chase down opponents or go in alone, but they ignore everyone and continue to feed. That I believe is reportable. Now, if I have a teammate who feeds, and I tell him how to stop dying, and he follows my advice, but still feeds, I would not report him or even say anything wrong to him, because he's at least making an effort, but when someone is completely ignoring everyone and feeding, that's even more selfish than someone reporting for no reason, because whether or not you're being toxic, you're fucking up a great game for everyone else, and I have zero problem reporting for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"majorashash","date":"2017-08-25T00:27:51.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of me wants to mute all every time I play.
