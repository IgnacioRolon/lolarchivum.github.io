Even if you return to the match, that's still a period of time teammates are left without a player.  The system will also treat all leaves equally because all leaves cause negative experiences.  Best thing you can do to resolve this is to play consistently without issues.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angrez","date":"2016-09-05T22:44:58.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cant see my thread anywhere and my count time started from 20 again.
