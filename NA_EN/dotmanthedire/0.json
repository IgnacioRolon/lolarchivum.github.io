It takes me ages to start the game, and when I get in I always get lag spikes which freeze my screen and the next thing you know I'll be dead. My internet connection isn't the problem as my friends have no issue. My laptop must be the problem, however I have an AMD radeon graphics card and intel core i5, which should be more than enough to run league. I've updated all my drivers, turned the quality to very low and tried just about every 'fix' method but I'm having no joy :( Someone please help me!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T04:40:28.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you say *lag spikes* do you mean changes in latency (ms) or FPS? This will help me figure out what's going on and how to deal with this.","replies":[{"poster":"McDou√üle","date":"2016-10-19T06:10:09.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm having a similar issue so I'll spin my tale of woe in an attempt to not only resolve my own issue but aid in his/hers/xis/xer/its. My first problem started this weekend during a ranked match that ended in a remake because 3 players other side we DC and 2 of ours were lagging out. \n\nIntermittent lag spikes ranging from 100ms (30ish is my norm) to 9999ms. Sometims it will sit on attempting to reconnect for a minute then go right back to smooth play, other times I will bounce around every few seconds, and still others I can see everyone else moving in real time but I cannot move. I have 3 times come across a complete freeze, ie my computer froze. All 3 times it was as the game ended and I clicked the Continue button at the Victory/Defeat screen, ultimately never making it to the post-game lobby. The only solution was a hard pc reset, Alt TAB, Alt F4, and Ctrl Alt Del would not even respond. I've speed tested my network during these lag spikes and my normal 50mb/20mb connection seems completely intact. I've tested the issue on my desktop, laptop, and a friend's laptop who came over. Similar issues in all cases.\n\n\nEDIT: Also, potentially relevant, I had issues logging in to the website to make this post (page failed to load mid authentication) and I had to copy paste and reload the page 2 times to submit.\n","replies":[{"poster":"NeckRomancer015","date":"2016-10-19T07:19:21.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"last night i had that issue with the continue button not coming up, so i had to leave game.
