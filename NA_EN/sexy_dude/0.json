A week ago, I had a stable ping of 23, now my stable ping is in the 30-40s and it spikes very frequently in the 100s, which makes ranked games impossible.\n\nIt's extremely frustrating because I've spent days waiting for a response from Riot (because of Christmas/holidays) and I've rang my ISP several times too. Can someone finally take the blame and help me out? I've looked online everywhere to help fix my ping issues, to no avail.\n\nI found this thread from 9 months ago, it was a very similar problem and it eventually got fixed because Riot contacted VM and their sub-companies to get the ping/latency issue sorted:\nhttps://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/EnG4O1Jg-constant-80-100ms-virgin-media-players\n\nCould you kindly do the same. I have not been able to play league at all in my holidays and the few times that I have, my experience has been awful due to the constant ping spikes.\n\nMy tracing route:\nhttps://puu.sh/yTBFR.png\n\nMy lag report:\nhttps://puu.sh/ySdKQ.png\n\nKind regards,\nSpacing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-03T23:31:47.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't force an ISP to make adjustments, and this does sound like a really crappy situation.
