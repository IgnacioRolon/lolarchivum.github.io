I've already had been moved to a lower game because I've been forced to leave games considering my computer was frozen. The first game I played I was a little laggy near the end till the point where I actually froze and had to restart my computer. The second game was worse, I was able to leave the spawn area, I was able to walk but the screen wouldn't move about 10-15 minutes through the game it started working till at the very end when it said Victory it wouldn't let me press it, making me restart my computer again. At this point it made it 5 games instead of my 3 and added it to 10 minutes. Wondering if you would be able to get rid of the punishment considering I didn't leave the game on purpose or to lower the chances of my team but because I had no choice other than to restart my computer because it froze. Thank you for taking the time and reading my response and I hope it isn't to much trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-15T02:55:04.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, PC freezes are probably top of the list for most annoying things to happen in a match. While I'm feeling ya, I, unfortunately, cannot remove the leaverbuster penalties on your account, as we're locked out of making these changes to prevent any abuse. Since your PC is just straight-up freezing, this issue is likely caused by a hardware problem or driver issue. These issues are often resolved after working through the steps in our [**Bugsplat & Crash Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes), so I'd recommend you give those steps a try.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
