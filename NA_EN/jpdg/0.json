You can&#039;t deny that your game prosper really bad. Do you know why? You make champions, which are unable to outplay like Zoe. Playing against her is so \r\nfrustrating and another thing is that she can be even behind, but still enable to one shot someone.\r\nNext thing: There is no joy of playing assasin. For example Zed. You guys have added so much form of cc that kills assasins. I can&#039;t go in with Zed to just kill adc- I will get Camille R on my face, 234342 CC from Rakan and i won&#039;t be able to cast my R to go back to my shadow.\r\nAnother thing: Lee Sin was a symbol of your game and You removed warding item. I know that you can buff him enough to increase his win rate, but many mechanical players won&#039;t have occasion to try in-sec and other \r\nspectacular plays.\r\n\r\nAnd, in my opinion, it&#039;s impossible to carry game alone, when you get 3213 CC, 2000 dmg combo from 0-5 Zoe. In past I played League, because i knew that if i was enough good, I would reach high division. When i was losing i knew that i should have played better. Actually I feel like I play faultlessly, but despite that everything depends on my team.\r\nI realize that It&#039;s a team game, but helplessness is too perceptible. Do you know, why HotS isn&#039;t popular? Because your impact on game is really small. It&#039;s starting to look the same in League. \r\n\r\nWhat can you do? Increase snowball effect, &quot;nerf cc&quot;, stop releasing champions which are difficult to understand (Le&#039;Blanc rework[Her new R XDD]).\r\nStop killing this game.\r\nJPDG","replies":[{"poster":"Ixoziel","date":"2018-03-29T21:08:42.266+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most of the reworked tanks have disgusting amounts of CC too.
