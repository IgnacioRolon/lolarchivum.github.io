When you block them they can't talk to you or message you, but you can still get that person in random queues all the time. I just blocked someone from a game and got them immediately in my next queue. That's not blocking them, that's just muting them and I can already do that in the game if I want to, so why bother even having another button if you're going to make it useless?","replies":[{"poster":"pcfmYiJC8R","date":"2015-01-31T06:58:23.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because I don't care how many people you ask no one has an answer as to why there is a mute function yet people refuse to use it and report. Riot rewards laziness with stupidity. Hey you have a mute button you can use BUT!... you don't have to use it, you can listen to what everyone has to say, talk shit and then just troll the shit out of them by reporting even though there is a mute button right there in front of you!..\n\nGet ride of the report verbal abuse or get ride of the mute function.. makes no damn sense to have both.","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-01-31T02:13:40.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Block is also really useful for spammers in champ select.

It is a nice way to stop spam.  Also, as the two mentioned below me.. if it blocked you from getting in a game, this mechanic would be broken and abused.\n\nBlade","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-31T01:50:21.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The tl;dr is that if blocking removed them from games with you people in challenger etc (where there aren't many players) would just block anyone better then themselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-31T01:33:25.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't let it work that way because they're afraid people will just block every good player they come across.  Those people are why we can't have nice things :(","replies":[]}]}
