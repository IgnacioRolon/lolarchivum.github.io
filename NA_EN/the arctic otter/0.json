If I try to use a semi-locked camera then I am unable to use Center Camera on Champion (default spacebar or any other key binding)  It highlights my champion with the circle and arrow like normal, but doesn't center the camera.  It works fine in unlocked camera mode.  This is not something that once worked and has now stopped.  It has just never worked since the semi-locked camera mode was introduced a couple years ago.  I have seen other post about this problem on Macs.  I have also logged into my account on a PC and it worked just fine.  I this a known bug?  Let me know if more information is needed to identify the problem if not.  Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T01:51:48.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That.....is a very interesting issue. It's pretty strange that the camera center function doesn't work specifically on semi-locked. I know it sounds weird, but let's double check that the camera setting is semi-locked and not fully locked. While fully locked, camera center (obviously) won't work. \n\nOnce we've double checked that, we might actually need to check for issues with your config files. If nothing else seems to help, let's go ahead and reset those config files to see if that does the trick. Navigate to where you installed League, and delete the config folder. Go into a practice game, and test that camera to see if it work!","replies":[{"poster":"JustinTruble","date":"2017-12-16T19:04:49.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue still exists, is Riot going to at least address this properly?

In the \"Camera Setting\" (button by minimap) I have a Locked Camera (slash through the icon).\n\nWith these settings, Semi-Locked works as I expect: I can push the camera in any direction, but only so far as my champ gets close to the edge of the screen.\n\nWhen I press the \"Center Camera on Champion\" key, I expect the camera to shift so that my champ is in the very middle of my screen.  Instead, nothing happens except my champion is highlighted with a circle and arrow.\n\nI did delete the config folder and restart the client, but same exact results.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tchaymz","date":"2017-07-03T18:44:25.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that helps - and I know this topic is a bit old - I'm having the exact same issue.
