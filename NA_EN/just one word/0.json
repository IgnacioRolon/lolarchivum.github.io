Hard. Totally ruining the game hard.\n\nWhy has the \"attempting to reconnect\" thing not been fixed?\nI just cannot understand why this isnt considered an important bug that must be fixed ASAP!?\n\nI mean, even if it was NOT that important, a 100% reproduction rate bug is the best candidate for a quick fix anyway!\n1. Play game 2. Reset internet connection 3. Watch the \"attempting to reconnect\" forever","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T04:39:04.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not a bug. This is a technical issue that occurs as a result of local network settings or issues along your route to the server. I encourage you to work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings are 100% good.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change in your ability to connect to matches. Be sure to test any changes in a custom match to prevent any potential leaverbuster penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"Just One Word","date":"2016-10-26T08:22:06.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did a custom game and manuelly reset my connection while ingame.\nI checked that my connection was OK while occasionally alt-tabbing into the game, which is still not reconnected.\nThe \"Attempting to Reconnect\" progress bar remained active and i could not do anything in game (so apparently stayed disconnected).\n\nThis is the exact same thing that happened to many of my friends before. They just said \"it wont ever reconnect that way\" and recommend closing the game through task manager, and relaunch it to using the orange reconnect button in the launcher which appears a while after closing the game. This did work in my custom game aswell, obviously taking a lot more time (paused, in custom game).\n\nSo when the game says \"attempting to reconnect\"\nAnd my connection is working well.\nI would expect it to actually attempt to reconnect.\nIf such attempt is not made.. i think i am experiencing a bug.\nWhere did i go wrong, why isnt this a Bug, despite it being reproducable and very likely related to the inner workings of the game client.\n\n> Steps i checked to see that my connection is okay\n> * ran analyzr, both after seeing the post and directly after dsl reset, only complaint is high latency (as expected for NA servers)\n> * windows firewall is on default (automatically active when other firewall are uninstalled)\n> * packet loss is low\n> * dns is setup correctly (dnssec not working)\n> * ipv4 working (and ipv6 fully disabled)\n> * no proxies or VPNs configured\n> * background apps closed during test\n\nNote: My ISP gives me uplink via DSL. In my country this type of connection is commonly reset atleast once per 24h. I am fairly sure that was the cause of the initial disconnects. Since the reset is - while associated with an IPv4 address change - very brief and barely noticeable on voice comms, i could not find any reason why the reconecting feature would not work in that case.\n\nUnrelated note: When i create a custom game lobby there instantly joins a spambot, post some chat message and leaves again.\nSometimes 2 spambots join but when they see each other only one of them posts, the other leaves.\n\nUpdate: I have just checked what happens when i break my connection by pulling the LAN plug - in that case, it does reconnect just fine. Which does explain why there are people for which the \"reconnecting\" thing does work - e.g. when they play on WLAN and only that connection is unstable.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T20:42:52.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that there may be additional issues along your network routing to the servers that may be causing this to occur.
