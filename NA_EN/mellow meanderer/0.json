I've tried reinstalling the game, repairing the client from the launcher, and deleting files to force the launcher to reupdate the game, but I get the same result everytime.\n\nFurther information on my build in case it's relevant,\nWindows 10\ni5-4670k, Hyper 212 EVO\nAsus z87m-Plus\nCrucial Ballistix Sport 2x8 gb ram\n500 gb 850 evo\nSapphire Tri-X R9 280x\n\nAnyone else getting this problem, and anyone have any suggestions or solutions?\n\nEDIT:\nI have solved my problem. RivaTunerStatisticsServer was conflicting with the launcher for some reason. Closing RTSS before launching the game solves the issue.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-01T23:40:42.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is both having a hard time finding a stable connection to the servers and then disconnecting from the platform entirely, causing the crash you experience.
