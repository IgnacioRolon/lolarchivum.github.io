Then players on both sides were randomly dc'ing. Happened for the rest of the game. Began for me when I teleported to the bottom turret, initially it showed that the TP didn't work, then suddenly I was there at the turret but couldn't move Garen at all. Then for the next 20 mins or so, I had control of my champ for maybe a few mins. One of our team member was never able to reconnect. \r\n\r\nI talked to support as I felt neither team should have gained or lost LP because the severe issues were at Riot's end but was told there is nothing that can be done in regards to LP. If it were just me experiencing it, that's fine and I can accept the loss. Everyone on both teams was talking about it in All Chat and it wasn't a momentary problem, it lasted for around 20 minutes.  \r\n\r\nThe rep said they don't show any issues at Riot but there certainly was and that should be looked into.","replies":[{"poster":"Aiko Umesawa","date":"2018-02-26T00:47:19.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had it too earlier if you check out my post....

He verified the issue wasn't on my end but said they don't really know what it is at this point. He recommended not playing any more ranked games tonight until they figure this out. He had me start a custom game to see if any issues occurred and they did once the game had been going for a few mins. The same problem I had experienced before. Seems like it is across all modes. \n\nIf you don't want to lose LP, be careful entering any new ranked games right now.","replies":[]}]}
