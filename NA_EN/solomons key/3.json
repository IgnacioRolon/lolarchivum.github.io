I play ranked almost 100% of the time because I want to work my way up the system. The summoners code is in place to provide us with rule and regulations to govern our conduct. Yet many players break those rules constantly and without any retribution. I even had one last week who when confronted with being reported claimed that he's been raging and trolling for the last year, the only punishment he ever received was a 5 days ban from chat. The League of Legends is an amazing concept and a wonderful game. It has transitioned from a hobbyist situation online to a full blown gaming empire where people can actually make a living from their skills. I like many others spend time and money investing in this concept and belief that it can be better. The Tribunal was a place to bring about actual change and punish those who drag down this community. For that reason, I miss having the peace of mind that we each have a hand in positively shaping the future of this game. And before the board trolls chime in with 'get a life and job', I am a successful business man in his mid 30's. I operate in the upper echelon of my industry, have an amazing/beautiful partner (who sometimes plays with me) and use LoL as my escape from the norm. This is my basketball or book club. It is where I choose to spend a few of my extra hours per week enjoying myself. \r\n\r\nAll I ask is that Riot protect those of us playing with the rules they created. \r\n\r\nLet's spit ball here, what other ways can Riot improve this area that's been lacking for so long?","replies":[]}
