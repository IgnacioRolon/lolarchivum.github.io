Snare stop going further when enemy champion hit so you&#039;ll able to see and use other skills right away even you have no sight there. (you don&#039;t see a champion, but clearly you can tell rather if you have hit ur Q or not) \r\n\r\nBut with Guardian Star Lux. you can&#039;t really tell if you Q was hit or not when enemy champion is in the place in where you have no sight. Snare(Q) does not stop at where champion was hit as original skin of lux. there is no way if you Q was hit or not when there in the bush or place where you have no sight. \r\n\r\nthis is a big problem because I have Guardian Star skin but I can&#039;t really use at the moment for this reason.\r\nmy performance will be much better with original skin or other skins. \r\n\r\nPlease look into it and make Guardian star lux&#039;s Q to able to see when you hit Champion with the Q in the bush or where you have no sight as original skin of lux.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-18T19:32:23.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey apolloJS,\n\nThanks for the report! \n\nI'll look into it! {{champion:99}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2015-07-19T00:50:53.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't it still make a sound when you hit something?
