The first thing i thought was, &quot;this dude is awesome&quot; and i asked if i could join him in a match with his cousin or whatever, also invite a friend and his brother and we start the match. Everything thing was going well, i was the adc that i wanted to be{{champion:21}}  and he was the champ he wanted to play{{champion:99}} , game was great, Until the match ended. Me being the guy who likes to play with others asked him to see if he wanted to play again together and he answered &quot;no&quot;, i asked why not and he just cussed me out and said i was a really bad player then unfriended me, now i am agree that im bad at league of legends, but it shouldn&#039;t be a surprise as i&#039;ve only started league about 2 weeks ago. How more toxic can a player be?.\r\n*PS* i could send links of the images if i could but i dont know how macs work.","replies":[{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2016-11-01T16:06:52.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people, for whatever reason get a kick out of other peoples misery. \n\nYou'll find nice, and neutral and just plain Jerks in this game as in life.
