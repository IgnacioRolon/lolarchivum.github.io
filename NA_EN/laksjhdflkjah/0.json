These changes in their current state make grabbing Warmogs and parking in the backline the only viable choice - highly ironical considering how these changes were probably aimed at making her more interactive; tho it certainly isn't the first time Riot completely fucks up and end us with the opposite of what they are trying to accomplish (remember first round of Lucian \"nerfs\" which brought him to perma pick/ban and earned him the nickname \"Black Kassadin\"?). Soraka needs a way to constantly recover her HP or she is useless - and if her self heal isn't fit for the job Warmog is the only solution.\n\nAgain, they might buff it around, but considering the point number one, I highly doubt that.

She's going to be much, much worse in teamfights than live Soraka even if she gets a stack for every enemy she hits. There are a few reasons for this. First, and most importantly, she can't self-heal with it in teamfights. It has a duration of 5 seconds, and W with max CDR has a cooldown of 1.2 seconds. Given that each stack of alignment is significantly weaker than an individual proc of W, you're completely prevented from keeping the buff up on yourself. You barely get 1/5 of the duration from alignment on yourself.\n\nThat's the huge problem with Alignment. The long duration of alignment compared to the short cooldown of her W makes it impossible for her to use it to self-heal in teamfights without completely stopping, which actually massively dememphasizes the Q. I'm not going to self-heal whether I land the Q or not, and it heals slowly enough and for little enough that it can't save an ally, so I'm not punished for missing it. That's all I've been from people who have played her on the PBE. Q barely matters past the laning phase anymore, and alignment is the reason.\n\nA 5 second duration alignment can't coexist with a 2 - 1.2 second CD W. They just conflict with each other way too much.\n\n>and would have even more reason to stay in combat in order to throw that delicious mana and health-over-time\n\nAgain, that's just wrong. The thing that incentivizes me to stay around in combat is self-heals, and alignment guts those. If I can't heal enough to cast my W, then I can't stick around in a fight. Additionally, even with alignment you actually heal an ally for less than you would heal them on live. At best, you can get alignment on every second W in a teamfight (assuming you never miss Q), and it heals for 90(+0.1). W was nerfed to heal for 50 less at all levels, so you lose 100 upfront for 90(+nothing) over 5 seconds. Even in the absolutely ideal situation, it's not better.","replies":[{"poster":"Llanite","date":"2016-01-31T06:49:15.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more about spreading Alignment to all members of the team, as oppose to focus only on the adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-01-31T10:23:02.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Numerically not worth it, and unrealistic in terms of gameplay. Alignment heals for very little and actively spreading it around does not significantly increase your team's survival, particularly when compared with the base healing she lost. \n\nIn addition, people do not take damage equally in a teamfight, and you always end up having to focus heals on the player most at risk of dying. A fight where you can afford to waste time spread alignment to everyone is a fight you were guarenteed to win without it if you focused your heals better.\n\nActively trying to spread it around sucks. It will make you lose fights you could have won.\n\nYou know what really wins fights for Soraka? Self-healing so she can throw out more total heals. You know what happens when she keeps having to give up alignment to ber teammates? She heals much less in total, and dies much easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Llanite","date":"2016-01-31T19:49:09.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said it wasn't a nerf, it sure is, but spreading the alignment will still yield significant healing.\n\nIf this change goes through, the playstyle will be more about managing the HP of the entire team, rather than a hotfix when someone messes up.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-02-01T01:21:48.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">the playstyle will be more about managing the HP of the entire team\n\nNope. No chance. Trying to manage the hp of an entire team isn't something that she'll be able to do. It's still waaaaay worse than burst healing a single person. There are multiple reasons for this.\n\nFirst, your ability to manage the health of multiple people is determined primarily by your self healing, because you need that to keep casting W across multiple people. Your self-healing has been majorly, absolutely nerfed, not only because the numbers on alignment are just weaker than the current one even in alignment's ideal situation, but also because you can't keep alignment on yourself while healing (and because the numbers are just way worse). Your ability to provide health to multiple people to a dergree that actually keeps them safe has been massively nerfed by this. Burst-healing someone doesn't rely on this statistic as much because it takes fewer raw heals to save one person than it takes to try and keep an entire team healthy. So, the most-nerfed aspect of her kit is also the aspect she would have needed to successfully keep multiple people healed.\n\nSecond, the dynamics of the game don't allow you to try to manage a team's health successfully in any equal fight. If you're in a situation where you and your team are hitting someone, you can't afford to try to spread healing around because you expose your allies to being bursted down. Healing the person most at risk of dying is much more effective. \n\nYou just have to remember one thing when thinking about the Soraka rework. Remember that alignment sucks. If you remember that, you'll be able to figure out everything you need to know about her new playstyle. Does a playstyle rely on alignment not sucking? If so, it's going to be a bad playstyle. Does the playstyle work regardless of whether or not alignment is good? That's probably the playstyle we'll all adopt.\n\nSeriously though, I know it looks not-terrible on paper, but when you actually get the chance to play it and you realize just how much the health-managing playstyle relied on the strength of the self-heal and how much it doesn't work if you have to wait 5 full seconds to regen before you can pass more health around, then you see just how much that playstyle won't work. It's just plain worse than the alternatives.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Birefringence","date":"2016-01-31T07:30:49.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"spending 20 seconds and 300 mana to put a lackluster HoT on 5 people?

Right now, Soraka gets more health back if she lands a Starcall on multiple champions. With the changes, hitting all five members of the enemy team or hitting one will have the exact same effect, her getting the \"Alignment\" buff.\n\nUnless I'm missing something, there's absolutely no reason to try and hit two people with the new Starcall, meaning Soraka will just stay safer than on live.","replies":[{"poster":"Krinu","date":"2016-01-31T20:48:06.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because she'll be able to offer more to her team if she lands it.\n\nYou're right in that the alignment buff needs some fixes - having it stack with the number of targets hit would do wonderfully - but being able to pass that buff off to an ally grants a lot of secondary effects depending on how it's implemented.\n\nIf they implement it as healing over time instead of regeneration (which is what it looks like on the video) then it'll trigger Windspeaker's and Ardent Censer.

Also if they are chugging potions more frequently they will have to back more frequently as well. Less time in lane is a benefit to the opposing team.

Because of the \"window of opportunity\" the five second heal provides, engage comps will counter raka mid and late game, but that's at the cost of making poke comps with raka stronger and her laning even more obnoxious than people currently perceive it. Nobodies asking for no change, this one just forces raka players into a more passive, boring game. The right answer would have been to force raka to come closer to the enemy for her sustain, which is what riot initially tried to do with the shorter Q range.

I don't actually think this is a nerf to raka overall, i think it is a massive nerf to raka's active playstyle (heal spamming at close quarters in teamfights and duels), and a relatively large buff to her passive playstyle (backline all day, wait to heal whoever comes back once with alignment, restore mana, occasionally sit out the fight for five seconds after hitting her now easier to hit q that doesn't ask you to hit multiple enemies to get its full benefit), and arguably her laning (since it takes less skill to hit q and gain it's full benefit, as well the mana buff). I value the active playstyle more though, and think it's healthier for the game.\n\nI think this will make raka too strong in poke comps, and useless against engage comps. I think that the people who loved raka are going to miss out on some of the funnest moments offered by her old Q, while raka haters are going to be confused that raka has somehow become more annoying.\n\nAnyhow, new kit means rushing cdr and zhonyas (since it works well with the delayed self heal in sticky situations) every game, then finishing off with a warmogs as the second to last item.

It was always super annoying that people didn't seem to get that you have to last hit the stupid tentacles to get rid of them, so they would \"help\". If it decreases confusion i'm for it, but i think she should be buffed as compensation, which i guess she was though i don't know if it's enough.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I Eat Thyroids","date":"2016-01-30T23:50:09.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This only buffs soraka's ability to sit in the backline while occasionally coming for air to hit a q.

But if Soraka is going to be called cancer and anti-fun regardless, why can't we have her previous kit restored?\n\nBy the way, calling something cancer and anti-fun does not make a real statement about any champion, but reveals something about the player who can't figure out that champion's weaknesses, or just stubbornly picks a champion into something that counters it, gets outplayed, then begs for the winning champion to be crippled rather than adapting or acknowledging the outplay. Because, at its core, losing is anti-fun, this is only half the story, as the winner had fun, so fun and anti-fun cancel each other out, thus fun is not a valuable tool to gauge a champion's need for a nerf/rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"morris1","date":"2016-01-31T12:13:48.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What hurts me the most is she can no longer heal minions.
