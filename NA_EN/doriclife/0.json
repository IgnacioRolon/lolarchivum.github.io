I still don&#039;t have a champ to call my own nor do I feel anywhere near comfortable enough to really play pvp.  I&#039;ve got the better part of a hundred and fifty bot matches in but in the grand scheme of things it doesn&#039;t mean much.  Support is the role I feel most comfortable in but should it feel like I&#039;m just a &quot;hanger-on&quot; of my adc?  Like I&#039;m only getting credit for an assist because the adc was GOING to kill them anyways, I just happened to poke or buff before it happened.  In the hot and heavy moments in the game I have caught myself just resorting to button mashing some portion or combination of q-w-e-r and hoping for the best.  Maybe it&#039;s just me or the nature of bot matches but should it feel like it is hard to really grow without having a dedicated set of people to regularly play with?  I mean we are supposed to trust the people we get matched with for play but do we?  With as poorly as I think I do sometimes, they probably shouldn&#039;t trust my abilities although I do try. lol\r\n\r\nHow to I resolve those issues?  Also how can I grow beyond them and become a better player that people will enjoy queuing up with and be able to make everyone&#039;s experience in game a more enjoyable one?\r\n\r\nHappy New Years everyone.","replies":[]}
