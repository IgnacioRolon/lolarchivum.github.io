Everyone basically forced into Ardent Censor supports, which I suppose is okay.They tend to be easier to play overall anyways, but holy cow why do they get SO MUCH FREE GOLD for doing... Well... Nothing. \r\n\r\nNow, looking at Spellthief&#039;s and Nomad&#039;s... We can all agree you usually get 1 gold coin per wave, or 25g on Coin first upgrade per wave. That&#039;s about 25g/30s because a wave spawns every 30s. There&#039;s unlucky times where you only get 1 ever other wave, but sometimes you get 2 in 1 wave. It&#039;ll average 1 every wave though. Spellthief&#039;s on the other hand is 8g per hit, max of 3 hits per 30s or 1 stack every 10s. Basically 8g/10s, BUT you have to make sure to hit every single 10s or else. Plus there&#039;s an ICD that was added in with the support item rework so you can only proc it once every 1.25s, no more Sona Q+AA for all 3 stacks done or a Zyra E+Q with a plant for a quick 3 or even dropping a Morg W on two people at once for 2 stacks at once. For high-CD or high-cost mana users like Sona and Morg, the item has really been losing its touch (Though I&#039;ve had enough people walk back into the Morg W). Even Lulu who used to get all 3 in a single AA can only average 2 if she&#039;s lucky with the timing of the last hit from Pix, but that&#039;s if she&#039;s able to AA. Overall though, even if you maximize it 100% that&#039;s 24g/30s. 1 less gold than Nomad&#039;s. \r\n\r\nUpgrading them both turns into 40g for Nomad, 45g/30s for Spellthief&#039;s. You become less punished for not keeping the stacks 100% used when upgrading, but at the same time, the other is still putting forth no effort and getting gold simply for existing. At this point, the item stats also don&#039;t mean very much. Both give mana regen, 10% CDR, and 2g/10. Frostfang would have a slight advantage of 20 AP, nearly negligible. So, overall, Nomad&#039;s is still providing far more consistent gold for not doing anything other than standing in lane. \r\n\r\nSo... Maybe I&#039;m just missing something, but when did an extra 24-45 damage during a trade equal to loss of gold? Outside of Brand, I&#039;ve actually been thinking maybe Nomad&#039;s is going to be a go-to when I use Zyra every now and then. Even when I spice it up a little with Lux Nomad&#039;s might end up still being the go-to simply because having to risk pushing the lane and opening yourself up to a gank just to match the gold your enemy is getting just for existing and doing absolutely nothing more is crap. Spellthief&#039;s used to be a Risk/Reward, gaining damage and having to poke to sustain your gold needs, overall just amplifying what a champ like Brand, Annie, or Zyra already did, but with the ICD added in and Nomad&#039;s being so much more reliant without any of the downsides like actually having to interact and possibly pushing a wave or stealing a CS from your ally, Spellthief&#039;s seems too unreliable. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? I might have to try out Nomad&#039;s Zyra since I always feel like I have so much more gold when using a Nomad&#039;s support in comparison to a Spellthief&#039;s, even when maximizing the Spellthief&#039;s when ever I&#039;m in lane. Plus all the gold off of Kills and Assists you can get after you finish the mini-quest would amplify your gold gain.","replies":[{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2017-09-22T22:34:34.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/UmU1KYH.jpg\nHow every support should feel about Coin right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bothkinds","date":"2017-09-22T13:21:04.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to me they just need to buff the gold income of these items. Increase the amount of gold you get for a hit with spellthiefs and add an additional gold to the support alone for CS with relic. \n\nTo explain what I mean about the cs with relic because that might be hard to understand. Support and nearby champion get 100% menion gold. PLUS support gets extra 12 gold.\n\nThe problem being that coin is consistant easy gold you do nothing for. It should give the least payout. As the other two require risk to gain income. They really need to balance it to where spell thiefs gives MOST gold. Relic gives about 5-7% less and coin 2-4 % less than relic.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2017-09-22T22:04:05.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They removed the extra gold you get for using it, actually. Maybe 1 minion ever wave, which is 20ish gold every 30s despite having a 40s CD because you can manage the stacks properly to do so. After you upgrade it from shield, you can get 3 stacks at 1 per 30, which allows for better use of the item. It doesn't compete with Nomad's currently in gold gain, but the passive it gives alone, but being able to use it on Cannons, getting that incredibly useful shield passive, and providing sustain for your lane partner is all really impactful to the lane itself. It by itself has a trade-off for the less gold it gives. It's a huge ball of stats for tanky supports where-as the other two are severely lacking in stats to make up for them getting more gold. Well, not so much on Spellthief's right now, but definitely in comparison to Nomad's.\n\nWouldn't say relic needs anything more than what it has. Tank items are cheap, the item itself provide a nice amount of shield that'll be amplified by the usually naturally high resistances of the user like Leo with her W up and Ali with his R. Also makes first item Gargoyle Stoneplate pretty damn strong since you'll have health from Sightstone and Relic together already.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-09-22T11:18:16.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the real use of spellthief line is to be built by mid laners\n\naccept your destiny hehe\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/6a6345ef28a135b206ee2c03e095dee5.png\n\nNot sure if you want coin on Zyra cuz no damage but in diamond+ it has higher win rate on her than spellthiefs lul","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2017-09-22T12:31:20.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, logically, Spellthief's early doesn't provide much damage. 8 every 1.25s, which turns into 15 every 1.25s, max of 3. 24 and 45 damage isn't much. The 5 AP initially isn't all too great and the 20 AP from Frostfang also isn't amazing. Nomad's Medallion into your usual Rylai's and Liandry's would be fine. I'd say you lose out on a cheaper spike, but it's still about 1350 to go from Frostfang to Queen's, which is only 40 AP. For 2200, 60 AP is pretty crap. You can cut that down to only 850, use the other 1350 on actual AP items, plus you'll make more gold using Nomad's Medallion too. Can also choose Eye of the Oasis instead of Frostqueen's to open up a whole slot so your gold maker will be attached to your SS. You can get Eye of the Watch when getting Spellthief's, but 35 AP isn't really worth the loss of gold Oasis would give.","replies":[]}]}]}
