About Shyvanna","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven&#039;t seen, like, any threads lately about Shyv, at least none that have become any form of popular, yet she&#039;s sitting at 52% ban rate on Champion.gg and most I&#039;ve played with have considered Shyvanna to be a bit overly powerful. We all saw her take the nerf to her W and sooooo many people screamed and cried about it, claiming devourer wouldn&#039;t be overly strong on her, yet... Here we are with her being at 52% ban rate and making many of us cry because her AA+Q+AA combo after landing her E and having her W going doing 12.5% of HP, 125% of one tick of her W, 4 basic attacks, 300 magic damage from devourer, plus 40% of current health from BotRK. How did I get these numbers? 1 AA, then a Q, which is 3 ticks of it all plus one proc of Phantom, so 4 On-hits proc&#039;d, then an AA just for S&amp;G&#039;s (Shits and Giggles). \r\n\r\nI dunno if Riot plans on doing anything about this. I mean, they did change Phantom to not proc off Yi&#039;s passive or to give it stacks, but it gives Shyv rage, it procs her E and W as well as making her Q go on a shorter CD. She&#039;s simply scary right now, yet I haven&#039;t seen anyone make a mention of her! Am I going crazy or she becoming insanely good? I know her win rate is only at 50%, but her ban rate right now is... like... harsher than her win rate. Ever since Devourer, she also shot up from 5% to 14% pick rate, now down to 11%ish since her ban rate has skyrocketed. Champion.GG even rates here as the top jungler right now, which is even scarier.\r\n\r\nWhat are your guys&#039;s opinions on her? o.o I think she&#039;s either going to be smacked with nerfs to completely kill off her laning or Devourer is going to be gutted. Again.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-25T11:07:07.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather see the item being gutted.\n\nIt's like they thought Feral Flare or on-release Devourer wasn't broken enough so they went YOLO and added this \"every other auto\" passive to it.\n\nWell, this or reverting that buff with AAs applying W damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-25T11:35:43.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vistha Kai,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FmKMadcT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-25T11:07:07.412+0000)\n>\n> I'd rather see the item being gutted.\n> \n> It's like they thought Feral Flare or on-release Devourer wasn't broken enough so they went YOLO and added this \"every other auto\" passive to it.\n> \n> Well, this or reverting that buff with AAs applying W damage.\n\nYeah. They just... completely ignored what a bunch of champs can do with this item. They at least changed Yi so his passive didn't interact with the Devourer since he was beyond machine gun. All you saw was the black flash of the Phantom Hit and a 5k Malphite pressing W with 300 armor including a Thornmail was melted quicker than a Devourer Vayne could dream of doing. lol. That's without a LW or a Cleaver since you were attacking so quick and doing SOOOOO much True Damage with the E. \n\nYet Shyvanna only gets a tiny nerf to her W, but that really doesn't do much and nerfing her kit MURDERS her laning, but we known Riot. They're willing to murder laning phases of champs to turn them into Junglers. Just look at Evelynn, Gragas, and Rengar! Evelynn got her burst removed, Gragas became a lot shorter range, and Rengar's E became a skill shot when it was his only form of harass or farming tool against lane bullies.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-25T11:39:26.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot about the biggest offender, Elise.\n\nI've heard she got buffed recently but I have yet to find anybody playing her.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-25T12:00:50.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Elise isn't all that powerful, still. She has this issue where building damage doesn't really give her damage since most of her damage is in % of current and missing health. lol. They buffed her enough to make her strong again for Elise mains, but the usual YOLOQ'ers won't be able to do much with her since it was only really a buff to her E's stun duration, making her ganks 'possibly' more potent. Devourer straight up buffed the crap out of Shyv and a few others. She's always been a jungler though. Her laning has always been kinda meh at best, though DFG Elise mid was pretty hilarious.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-25T12:15:21.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She was the tank buster top laner, before Riot nerfed the hell out of that play style and forced her to jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-26T03:22:23.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but she was made to be a jungler.

However that being said, her clear time is insanely fast in the jungle. And when you stack that with the bonus gold that is received by junglers her GPM ( Gold per minute ) is extremely high, so the reason she seems broken is because she just generally has more gold than the average person in the game. I am not entirely sure how they would fix this issue, maybe adding a max damage limit to monsters on her w? What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-26T10:41:10.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, a few junglers are able to clear fast and Udyr can compare to her own speeds quite well. Even Diana after her first clear can speed through the jungle, but that's not really the issue. The issue is more or less how strong the new Devourer has made her. She's ALWAYS cleared fast, it's the perk she brings to the jungle, being able to get a huge lead on the enemy jungler so when team fights start, even if her team is behind, she's far ahead. Sated does a bit more than that though. It makes her damage go from awesome to HOLY COW. It makes Tiger Udyr look weak in comparison.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-07-25T13:24:57.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't recall anyone saying devourer wouldn't be overly strong on her...\nPeople complained about the W nerf cause it obviously was targeted at jungle shy+devourer, but it did kill toplane shyvana, while she still has 20% increased damage to monsters on her W....takeing that away would have been a nerf to jungle shy without gutting her toplane.\n\naccording to champion.gg, her winrate sits on a fine 50.6%, going up to 53.4% on experienced players...doesn't seem op for me.\nThere are lots of junglers with a higher winrate, especially for experienced players, i really don't understand why people do ban her.\nshe still has poor ganks and is easy to kite...","replies":[]}]}
