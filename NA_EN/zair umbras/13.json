Corki and Ez are already in an awkward place with Essence not really giving much, but having to get it to keep some sort of mana, though Ez usually has to build a Manamune still to be able to keep his mana up and I know as Corki, if you use anything more than his R for damage, you&#039;ll burn through mana much faster than the Essence gives. The whole point of Trinity getting 20% crit as far as we all seen was for the Trinity+Essence Reaver combo, but the two it was meant for can&#039;t even use it properly and have been suffering this entire patch. I&#039;ve played them both and had way more success without Trinity, even on Ezreal. :(\r\n\r\nSo... I mean... Why are we even nerfing Essence&#039;s CDR? Because we&#039;re going to balance it based on the 30% crit items, is Trinity supposed to be buffed to 30% crit, or what? I&#039;m just a bit confused here. I can understand not wanting to get Lucian 30% CDR by finishing his Essence then buying a Zeal or MF with an IE+Essence chunking people, etc., but this is going to hurt the whole Trinity Force+Essence Reaver combo without any sort of compensation. Just feels wrong when that combo already feels horrible wrong compared to getting a RFC instead of a Trinity.\r\n\r\nAny context on what&#039;s with this nerf? Am I right about the whole Essence+Zeal being too powerful or..?","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-11-28T03:34:15.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is not even a nerf. you still get 30% cdr with just essence reaver and shiv. this will literally make 0 difference.\n\nthis item shouldnt even exist. it compeltely removes the choice for carries to go down a caster route {{champion:110}} , or to go down a classic auto attack focused build. they just get to have both with 1 item.\n\nliterally the only thing people asked for for the old essence reaver was a better build path.\n\ni can still see all those threads just asking to build the item out of {{item:3114}} in the build path.\n\nthey shouldnt have made it\n\na) into a  marksman specific item, as there are other mana dependent ad casters in this game who should have been considered.\n\nb) not make it completely broken by allowing marksmen to have 30% cdr with this and 1 crit item. especially when theyre going nuts and throw crit around lik candy on halloween.\n\n\nreaching 100% crit chance on a marksman isnt even a feat anymore. it just happens by building the same items as they used to anyways.\n\n\nmarksmen are a class that have been deliberately cut out of cdr as a stat due to how strong they already scale with crit and as as multipliers. right now they have better cdr itemization than mages and ad casters.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-28T03:48:15.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trust me, I know. I play Ez a ton and the change to essence made me cringe to begin with, but trying to make due with it... and now it's being nerfed against the ones it was meant for while catering to Lucian and Graves. Guess the mana starved AD casters won't ever get a break.\n\nHell, when I made a post about it before the PreSeason changes hit about Essence Reaver's change, people said it was going to be OP on AD casters because blah blah blah and here we are cringing still at it.","replies":[]}]}]}
