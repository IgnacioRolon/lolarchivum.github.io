Again.\r\n\r\nWhen we were all staring at patch 5.22, I&#039;m sure most were thinking &#039;OH GOD, EZ GETS 40% CDR IN 2 ITEMS&#039;, which was great on paper, but turned out the nerfs to Trinity (Loss of AD, complete loss of AP, loss of AS, and loss of MS) made it an item not even worth picking up and most have had to resort back to blue build just to be -viable-. Some have gone as far as trying to make use of Rageblade and had little success in real play. So we saw his winrate drop a couple % in 5.22, slowly went up in 5.23 as people adapted, but...\r\n\r\nMooooooooore nerfs. Wheeeeeeeee. Trinity+Essence now only gives 30% CDR, not 40% because Riot figured 1.5 items giving 30% CDR was a bit much, which it really was! It would seem they completely ignored the fact that Essence and Trinity&#039;s 40% CDR combo is now removed without much compensation. To make matters worse, Fervor is being changed to stack only on champions. Normally, that&#039;d be fine, but you essentially got 2 stacks every Q (One for cast, one for hit) and used the damage you got from Fervor to get an edge and be able to snowball. You had a better early game, equal mid game, and worse late game than other ADC&#039;s, but that was the trade-off. You had a better early. Now, that early is gone and we&#039;re still not seeing much for poor Ezreal.\r\n\r\nI know most still dislike Ez and his safety, but... that safety isn&#039;t even working too well nowadays. Before, you gave up your late game DPS potential that a normal ADC had for a more poke-based champ, but the poke has been reduced with the major loss of AD (Even Sivir got a tiny ratio buff to compensate for the large loss of AD while the other ADC&#039;s had great QoL changes or full on reworks) on top of Trinity being nerfed without any cost reduction just plain sucks. \r\n\r\nI feel like Ezreal is getting the cold shoulder here. :(","replies":[{"poster":"The FarK","date":"2015-12-09T09:33:04.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"lol - ezreal is the highest skill bar/cap champ in game and has the highest potential damage output of any champion\n\nstop being dumb\n\nbuild him hybrid\n\nget a guinsoo","replies":[{"poster":"The FarK","date":"2015-12-09T09:33:48.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The FarK,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ysx1QAmu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-09T09:33:04.520+0000)\n>\n> lol - ezreal is the highest skill bar/cap champ in game and has the highest potential damage output of any champion\n> \n> stop being dumb\n> \n> build him hybrid\n> \n> get a guinsoo\n\nalso recognize that with ez less skill = less spell contact","replies":[{"poster":"The FarK","date":"2015-12-09T09:35:45.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The FarK,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ysx1QAmu,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-09T09:33:48.524+0000)\n>\n> also recognize that with ez less skill = less spell contact\n\nwow okay fine his recipe is\n\nstart dorans blade\n\nrush tear - manamune with first 1400g you put together\n\nget a vamp (just the vamp)\n\nget a sheen (just the sheen)\n\nbuild guinsoo/nashor's\n\nfinish vamp into gunblade\n\nfinish triforce\n\n#HeroOfTime\n\np.s.\n\nif your team phalanxes well - it's not uncommon to go deathless, even without boots\n\nez is the quintessential zone tank.. i mean he's only an adc in the respect that his right click has range","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2015-12-09T19:31:52.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The FarK,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ysx1QAmu,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-09T09:35:45.881+0000)\n>\n> wow okay fine his recipe is\n> \n> start dorans blade\n> \n> rush tear - manamune with first 1400g you put together\n> \n> get a vamp (just the vamp)\n> \n> get a sheen (just the sheen)\n> \n> build guinsoo/nashor's\n> \n> finish vamp into gunblade\n> \n> finish triforce\n> \n> #HeroOfTime\n> \n> p.s.\n> \n> if your team phalanxes well - it's not uncommon to go deathless, even without boots\n> \n> ez is the quintessential zone tank.. i mean he's only an adc in the respect that his right click has range\n\nYes you should rush doran\nYes you should build tear but no you shouldnt upograde it until it is fully stacked or almost stacked\nYes you should get a wamp\nSheen to\n\nUnless you are Cardboard 123123 you wont get guinso /gunblade /nashor\nIf you think guinso is good for ezreal then .. you should rather play ap ez which is trash btw\nGunblade is just . trash .
