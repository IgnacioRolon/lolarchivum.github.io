For us who owned him prior to his update, to remember what he once was similarly to Traditional Karma who has also kept its original splash art.\r\n\r\n I&#039;m not going to say the new splash art is bad because it does look nice, but it doesn&#039;t capture the grotesque troll that is the Traditional Trundle skin. He has his own muscles and such showing after all, yet the traditional splash looks... Well, it looks like he has a rash.\r\n\r\nWhile many likely don&#039;t want a nasty looking splash for a skin, it does feel a bit off putting that Traditional Trundle splash isn&#039;t getting any love when it comes to staying true to how disgusting the original Trundle is.","replies":[{"poster":"Lovely Pants","date":"2016-04-29T04:20:20.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like a little more prominence given to the wasting-away flesh on it, personally.\n\nDo like the skin splash otherwise though.

He has a lot more red blotches and all of those blotches shows actual muscle. New splash just shows like.. a rash on his leg and arm.\n\nTraditional Trundle also never just had a rash. He was a grotesque creature that was cursed to rot, but his regenerative properties kept that from killing him. Was a disgusting horror story of a bio and his old splash displayed how nasty it was, but the new splash barely touches on it with a rash on the leg, arm, and a tiny spot on the chest.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-04-29T15:35:49.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well imagine they never gave Trundle a VU(or that his traditional skin would have been his new classic skin),then his traditional splash art would have been eventually replaced by a new one as well.\n\nIn the end the traditional skins are based on the old appearances,but thats about it,they do not have to be exactly the same in every aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2016-04-29T16:05:14.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be nice if it at least touched on how grotesque the skin is though, even the in game model shows actual muscles rather than just a simple rash.","replies":[{"poster":"Waffletimewarp","date":"2016-04-29T21:32:05.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=PbFvPlWE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-04-29T16:05:14.481+0000)\n>\n> It would be nice if it at least touched on how grotesque the skin is though, even the in game model shows actual muscles rather than just a simple rash.\n\nHe'll you have to look close to see a rash. It's all conveniently hidden in the shadows. \n\nHey Riot, when can we expect you to lose the traditional voice due to a \"bug\"?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
