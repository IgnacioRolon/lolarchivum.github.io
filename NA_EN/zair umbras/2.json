Overall, I'm good at nearly every role with more luck in the jungle, mid and ADC roles. Caster types and Tanky types are typically my best with more a preference on the burstier types, so for example, Graves, Ez, and Twitch are my better ADC's and  Veigar, Fizz, and Lux are my better mids, and for jungle typically depends since I've played just about everything with a plethora of different builds from simple things like the typical Runeglaive Diana to oddballs like Cinder+Titanic Rengar. \r\n\r\nMy champion pool is a lot bigger than that, but those are some ideas. I do have TS3, Skype, and Vent as well as a mic to go with it all and I'm free at most parts of the day with a specific few exceptions.","replies":[{"poster":"JessExpress69","date":"2015-10-19T14:38:15.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello i have a current 5s team, that needs an adc,mid and jg role.
