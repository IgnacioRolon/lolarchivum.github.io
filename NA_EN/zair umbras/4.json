Well, IE just had it's crit reduced to 20% from 25% in an attempt to curve ADC item choices, but that's also a direct hit at Yasuo who used to get a Shiv and IE for 100%. Now he'd be at 90%. While that's still high, a lot of players know how dreaded the RNGesus can be at times and that 10% can screw one over really, really hard. Anyone who uses an ADC knows how this feels too. Your opponent's ADC is critting non-stop with just an IE and you have an IE and a PD or Shiv and you're not having the same luck and it's really annoying. Well, Yasuo's entire kit is about critting, so when he doesn't crit, that's a huge chunk of missing damage. Personally, I don't know if this was intentional to be a hit to Yasuo to force him away from using a Shiv, but I'd kinda like to know if there will be any fixes to this or if we'll just have to adapt to using a Phantom Dancer instead of a Shiv and lose out on the potential 190-240 damage or pray to RNGesus before every initiation.","replies":[{"poster":"Hex the FenFen","date":"2015-01-16T07:56:36.794+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of champions do well without 100% crit chance...and all of Yasuo's scalings are really good to where he still does a TON of damage...I'm so sorry you can no longer entirely cheese with 100% crit chance anymore, it looks like you will have to be with the rest of the \"normal\" AD champions now","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-16T08:37:27.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, that would be true if it wasn't for the fact that you're also kinda wrong at the same time. A lot of RANGED champions do well without 100% crit chance. The melee champs who use crit haven't really been in a good place. Talons have been known to have an IE with a Ghostblade, but that's not required at all for him. Yi has his ups and downs, but overall suffers from what we know as 'Assassin Jungle Syndrome'. This syndrome is usually defined by worthlessness when not ten kills above everyone else on your team and provides almost no help to lanes without CC and usually excels at feeding the enemy team. Then there's Tryn. Tryndamere is Tryndamere. Where he sits no one knows. He's considering broken by some and worthless by others, but his true placement is completely unknown. He also have five seconds of his care cup being empty. \n\nYaaaassssuuuuooooo on the other hand is a mobile champion who's entire identity is based on combo'ing with another partner's knock ups and having very high item scaling. I'm not saying we can't live without that 5% on IE, but it is a rather odd nerf to a champion who was recently buffed because he wasn't doing so hot after the previous nerfs. Namely the 10% damage reduction on his crits. Normally with nerfs like these, they usually provide a buff for affected champions, which was the 5% gain on Phantom Dancer, but Yasuo is known for having a Shiv, not a Phantom Dancer. It's the entire point he has such a good mid-game, after all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talamare","date":"2015-01-16T07:49:40.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so get 10% from runes","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-01-16T07:51:43.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Repeating what I said earlier, that costs more than a full section of T3 runes.

While most would say 6 AD loss isn't crap, but early on, that 6 AD is really noticeable and makes his already poor early even worse. That would be like nerfing BotRK's attack speed. Overall, it would be a nerf to all champions who get it, but it would nerf Vayne and force her to stack attack speed in her runes to make up for it. Or if you nerfed Spell Vamp items because of Akali, making Morde and Vlad rage quit. Could also nerf Spirit Visage's healing because tanks don't need to gain that much health regen, amirite? Well, that'd slap Vlad and Aatrox. Let's also go with what Riot's planning to do with removing DFG and forgetting about buffing Ahri. Oh, she's now nerfed and oversighted, but that's okay 'cause she can just remove the magic resist glyphs and defensive seals to make up for that damage, right? Wrong. This would be horrible. Oversighting champions when you nerf an item is horrible and Riot has been pretty good about buffing the champions affected if it's needed, like they're buffing Ahri with the removal of DFG and buffed TF and Fizz when Lich Bane was nerfed. Yasuo didn't even get a mentioning with the nerf to Infinity Edge. They nerfed IE so it wouldn't be stupidly stronger than a BT for actual Marksmen and didn't even say they'd look at Yasuo to see if it would affect him or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-01-18T08:07:07.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually not bad depending on what you're doing though.  Like his page clearly has no extra early damage being that it had Movement Speed Quints.  So I was suggesting something that rounds it out better and gives you the 10% crit that fits back with the change in the item.\n\nAs for an ADC, most should already be using Attack Speed runes (quints) because they were buffed when the rune changes were made and give you better value.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-18T11:39:49.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've yet to see any ADC that wasn't Vayne use attack speed quints. Even when buffed, you get 14% from only Quints and that'd be at the cost of 7 AD. Most barely notice the difference from Zerker's and it's a 25% boost. It's not until you get the 40% from Shiv or 50% from PD as well as the bonuses from leveling that you actually notice your attack speed go up. 14% is also pretty useless on any champ that has an AS boost since AD scales much better, these champions being Varus, Kog, Graves, Quinn, Draven, Trist, and Sivir. Lucian can put it to use, but AD scales way better with his kit. Cait scales much better with AD than a 14% boost in AS. I could see it working well with Vayne and Kalista, both being more AS hungry champions, but most champions get more benefits from AD since their abilities scale from AD. And of course there's Ez and Corki who don't even get Zerker's and get a Trinity because they're more pokey-bursty champions and don't get the same benefit from AS as the others. Overall, it's usually best to have the extra 7 AD from quints. \n\nBack on topic though... While his own rune page might scream horrible, most Yasuos prior to the nerf ran 3 AD Quints, 5/6 Crit marks, 3/4 AD marks, HP per level Seals, and Flat MR or Scaling MR glyphs. Yasuo is a mid champion and thus, health and MR are necessary to sustain their poke and bursts, the crit was for the 5%, and the AD was so that he could properly farm with the tip of his Q as well as poke with his tornadoes. Now you gotta remove every AD mark and replace it with Crit marks and then toss in a Crit quint. It's pretty painful to sit at a bonus of 4.5 AD instead of 11. It's really, really painful early on when 7 AD can make or break you. This does make crits happen a little more often early on, but the only champion I know of that can live off of RNG crit of 35% and lower is Tryndamere. Tryndamere's hidden passive is to have double crit chance, I swear. Even when I play him I feel like I crit way too often. lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-01-18T15:06:47.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well then must not play that often, as I've seen tons of people go that way, and stay that way since they changed the runes.  \n\nShiv.

Yasuo is an AA-based Melee Carry which has always had issues in the past, usually with them being Pubstomp in low ELO and not as common in higher ELO. This has become different because of Yasuo who is able to communicate with his team and work with them rather than split pushing and farming 24/7 and then winning the game by 1v5'ing because he's 5 levels above the enemy team and full build. It's very apparent you haven't actually used Yasuo too competitively, which continues to make your argument rather silly. My own Yasuo record is a bit spotty in ranked, especially since he does require teamwork and I'm not the best Yasuo, but anyone who plays Yasuo knows his real weaknesses and one of the biggest one is his need for items. Expensive items. His only 'cheap' item is his Shiv, which also gives him a big bonus to his damage with it's proc. All of his other items are incredibly expensive as anyone who plays ADC's often can tell you.

Morde or Taric. Morde because he has no CC, gap closer, speed boost, or any method to avoid being kited or to help him from being kited and Taric because he's just not in a very good spot right now.

Yi having a huge damage reduc plus his Q making him temporarily untargetable and Tryn having 5 seconds of his care cup being empty. Yasuo makes up for this by having huge damage with his 100% crit chance, plus having the ability to chain up with a knock up.

This ability also has been known to be a hit or a miss since the enemy can just... not waste abilities when they see it go up and then go ham as soon as it's done. If the enemies walk away from the wall, or in some cases, walk through it. Then there's of course the abilities that ignore the wall completely. It's not like Tryn who simply gives no f's for the entire duration. Well timed walls can be used to block important abilities, but I wouldn't consider it '4 seconds of haha nope projectiles'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-01-16T20:24:01.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That he either has to walk past in order to reach his targets, or stand behind and hope to every god he can name that the enemy blows even one important projectile on it.\n\nBecause any intelligent player against Yasuo is going to be wary of Wind Wall.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zamiake","date":"2015-01-18T17:18:02.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wasnt nerfed the 5% was jsut moved to phanton dancers to make people who want crit builds to actually build phantoms instead of shiv","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-18T18:50:35.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a nerf to IE to open up BT as a rush item again, as they explained in the post.

Zz'Rot was caused not because of short sighting, it was caused by PBE players averaging bronze level play at best. The players are the same ones who begged Riot for nerfs on Rengar and Syndra, two champions who were considered unviable upon release and had to get rather large buffs before they became the incredible champions they are now. Riot has issues because GOOD players don't play on the PBE. It's not worth it since there's no pluses or bonuses for playing on there other than to see if the new champion's kit is any good, which even then it's not possible to test because there's too many people who are bad that play on the PBE and you can't compare a champion's kit when you're Diamond or Challenger and your enemy is Bronze at best. You'll stomp them with AP Urgot and make them cry that it's OP. lol. I've had a PBE account since S2. It's gotten better, but not enough to matter. Plus the 5-10 minute long que times just to get people who call lanes and end up never connecting due to not being from NA and not comprehending PBE is based in California. 300 ping 'cause being European OP and all and most just use the PBE to test out champions they don't currently own because you get every champion and nearly every possible rune for free as well as some free skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Zamiake","date":"2015-01-19T21:37:53.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool.....On a side not use line breaks more i stopped reading half way through because i would get lost in your wall of text","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Direwolfiez","date":"2015-01-18T05:42:46.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it was unintentional, he'll be getting buffs soon.  If it was intentional, like most indirect nerfs, Riot won't name him but it will still be in place.\n\nPersonally, I think his x2 crit chance is BS, and that a good part of his kit needs a rework to be less bull-shitty.  My personal opinions aside, are you *really* complaining about only having 90% crit chance with Shiv?  It's passive is too useful to pass up, even if he loses a measly 5% (or 10%, because of his passive) crit chance.  I'm sorry, but you really seem like you're whining because your champ isn't as facerolly as before.  Yasuo is strong, and he'll always be strong as long as his kit stays the way it is.  I know that all mADCs have bullshit kits, but pointing that out and asking for buffs on a strong champion that used to be nightmarish to play against...just no.  Please, for the love of God, no.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-01-16T08:46:14.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have faith in RNGeezus.. that 90% is on your side","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-01-16T20:21:54.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"80%\n\n(20 + 20) \\* 2 = 80","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PapotiK","date":"2015-01-16T15:27:39.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aleluia","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-01-17T08:47:20.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"dunno ho we hiill live \nbut there is a light at the end of the tunnel\npd yasuo using pd as only crit item \nthis way he has more space to build other stuff \nso it can also be vieble","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2015-01-16T22:08:45.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"gives him the standard 100%\"\n\n{{item:3070}}{{champion:32}}{{item:3073}}","replies":[]}]}
