Everyone has had issues with her, but I'm just throwing out a small idea. I'd enjoy if you left your own thoughts and reasons and please don't talk about 'Bronze' level play where Nidalee can build anything and stomp because of people walking in a straight line and not dodging stuff.\r\n\r\nSo! One of the main issues in real competitive play when it comes to Nidalee is her lack of reliability. Her main damage is in Cat Form which relies a lot on landing a spear or her opponent stepping on a trap. Traps are relatively easy to not step on and serve their own purpose, but her spears... Her spears is what I'm thinking could use a slight change. Back in the day, her spears were HELL because she could throw them non-stop with just an Athene's Unholy Grail, but then they changed her kit around and made her spears easy to dodge, which balanced it out quite well because now you needed one of those spears to land to initiate your combo and they were hard to land, but you were throwing out a barrage of them. Well, she can't do that now because of how mana regen works. Even with a Lich Bane, Seraph's, and an Athene's Unholy Grail, she can still go oom rather quickly, which is perfectly fine in most cases because the spears HURT, but are very unreliable... however... While most would be happy with a mana change, I'm looking for reliability with her Q!\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by reliability in her Q is that a little less damage on her spears wouldn't be too bad, especially if we could trade some of that damage for a slightly wider radius or a faster speed, even if it's simply just a speed boost on it when it's initially thrown, decaying as it gets to the end. What I mean by that is it'll get to the end point at the same rate as the old spear, but you can land a closer range spear so you can initiate your combo in tiger form. Personally, I'd simply prefer just a wider radius on her spear. Not by much, but just a tiny bit bigger so it's not so stupid proof to dodge after you get T1 boots. \r\n\r\nNow, why am I suggesting a change on this! Well, to put it simple(As mentioned before), she lacks reliability. Her entire combo relies on landing that spear to proc her passive so she can switch to Cougar form and pounce on her enemies. The current counter play to it is just so huge that it's really hard to play Nidalee the way she was meant to be, which is AP. Of course AD has less issues since it usually has a Trinity Force and a BotRK to help stick to targets without relying too heavily on her passive to let her pounce to them. AP on the other hand has to land that spear or she risks being kited around. It's one thing to be stunned or knocked back mid-jump. That's awesome counterplay and a well timed CC, but the fact she can only reach her target safely is by proc'ing her passive, she needs some reliability on proc'ing it. \r\n\r\nI hope I didn't 'wall of text' it too much and I do want to hear what you guys have to help make her passive slightly more reliable, even if it means costing some damage. We can always fix a nerf to damage, but reliability is something that items simply can't fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-03T19:02:25.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumpz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shy Chibi","date":"2015-02-03T04:44:54.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is she a cat, tiger, or cougar? Hehe just kidding. However the changes that you're suggesting are not QOL, but are balance changes. That being said I do agree that proc'ing her Hunt is unreliable and her power is much weaker if you miss the spear. I would suggest changing her Bushwack so it has more presence in fights. Maybe make it like a small aoe skillshot that she throws and will proc hunt if it lands on a champ, but if it misses it becomes a trap, like a huntress' net or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-02-03T04:58:00.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nid's spear is definitely broken, but not for the reason you stated. It can do more damage than 75% of the ults in the game. The damage needs reduced by 50% and be harder to dodge. That would fix a lot of her play IMHO.","replies":[]}]}
