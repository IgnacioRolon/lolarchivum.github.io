Can I just, give back these gifts for free? Like, it's negatively impacting my ARAM experience every once and awhile. I get that getting something in return for things I got for free goes against Riot's return policy.\n\nBut, for example, Recently i opened a special box, got some free stuff in it, like Medieval Twitch, well, I don't own Twitch, so it gave me him for free too. I don't want Twitch. Somewhere along the way I was given Aurelian Sol and Zac, also champions I've never wanted to own.\nThe Alistar, was just something that I derped on, did the steps to get Alistar and Unchained Alistar, that's my bad, and I'll live with it just fine. but when Riot gives me things I don't want, and I get stuck playing as champions I have never wanted to play, that's just a bad experience.\nIt's not quite as bad as Apple giving people a U2 album they can't get rid of, but you see the issue.\n\nI'll happily give up all three of my refunds on my account to get rid of Aurelion Sol, Zac, and Twitch. Except they're nonrefundable.{{champion:32}} \n\nTo be clear, I am not opposed to Riot giving us free stuff to show their appreciation for us enjoying their game. but, let us decline the gifts, or pick from several options, or something. Don't just load people up with champions they don't own, they don't necessarily want them.\n\n\nMy friend suggested allowing us the ability to delete champions without a refund.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T01:49:29.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That shouldn't be too much of a problem! Keep in mind though, if we make this happen there won't be any refunds for them or reversing this in the future! Hit up our agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) letting them know that you need these champs removed and that you're okay with not being refunded and they should be able to help out.","replies":[{"poster":"W15H","date":"2017-11-12T06:37:42.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long do I have to wait?
