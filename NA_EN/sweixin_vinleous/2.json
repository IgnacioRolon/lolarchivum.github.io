I&#039;d hate to remove Brutalizer from another recipe, but realistically, no jungler really builds it. (unless for Youmuu&#039;s)\n\nEver since 5.2, the combine cost of Warrior has been 63 gold.\nThat 63g is going to give you 20 AD. Doesn&#039;t make much sense, does it? No one is going to go back to shop for a Brutalizer being 63g short of an extra 20 AD.\n\nA pretty simple change I recommend would be to take an approach similar to the buildpath of Lizard Elder in early S3, which built out of Spirit Stone and Pickaxe.\n\n{{item:3713}} (450g) + {{item:1037}}  (875g) + {{item:1036}}  (360g) + 165g = {{item:3723}}  (2250g)\n\nAllowing Pickaxe to build into Warrior allows for a more efficient purchase early game, makes more sense as a build path regarding the amounts of AD you get before and after completing Warrior, accentuates Warrior&#039;s early-game threat more, but still allows you to buy some early AD even if you don&#039;t have 875g.\n\nWarrior's purpose, to provide early game threat but scale poorly, doesn't currently equal the benefits to safely scaling with Cinderhulk (even though it has a considerable power spike upon completion). I don't just want to just compare it to a more viable option, though. The build path generally just doesn't feel right in my opinion.\n\nIt feels a bit lazy for Warrior to build out of an item you&#039;ll never even purchase, while needlessly cutting the efficiency of your early game itemization.\n\ntl;dr: Change Warrior's power to be more accessible in build path if you can afford it, instead of exclusively on completion.

You could make the item build from two long swords and smite and it would be virtually the same build path.\n\nTo be honest, it's not really that big an issue right now, as junglers who build Warrior pretty much all build brutalizer anyways (think Lee Sin, Kha'Zix, Rengar, Etc.) and tend to get enough gold to buy the full item by the time they get to their 3rd or 4th back, but adding a pickaxe to the mix gets rid of options to the jungler at their 2nd back by forcing them to hold their gold because a pickaxe is too expensive. It's a small numbers sort of thing, but with getting around 1 successful gank off, that's enough often to get both long swords, but hardly anything else (assuming they bought their smite upgrade already). Adding pickaxe would just leave the jungler with an extra 300-400 gold that they couldn't invest in their jungle item besides just leaving it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-05-02T00:47:22.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's 15 AD difference from Brutalizer to Warriow upgrade.

If they had 515 or 190 more gold, they could afford a pickaxe instead of that longsword, or a pickaxe in place of a longsword/boots with the build path alternative respectively.\n\nThere's almost no situation that would justify actually purchasing Brutalizer. Any situation that would warrant it is way too unimportant/unlikely for it to justify the build path.\n\n\"It's 15 AD difference from Brutalizer to Warriow upgrade.

If you do your buffs and then gank bot and get a double kill you are just a couple of camps short of Brutalizer.","replies":[{"poster":"sWeixin VinLeous","date":"2015-05-02T02:17:09.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"He was talking about the AD difference between recipe and item which is 15 and not 20.\"\n\nI know exactly what \"he\" meant.
