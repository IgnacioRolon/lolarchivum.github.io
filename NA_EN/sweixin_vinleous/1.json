(zac&#039;s e range buff is quite popular with the silver playerbase)\n\nas a triple challenger jungler i am forced to pick what is tier 1 to win (reksai, elise). riot never compensates unviable champions when they nerf their core items that got them by (frozen heart with jungle hecarim). they don&#039;t stay on top of individual champions like they should, instead they &quot;look&quot; at champions every once in awhile and give them either useless buffs or update their visuals, and now openly admitting to practicing \"slow and steady\" buff cycles instead of just using the fucking pbe and fixing champions where they need it.\n\nriot&#039;s failure of a concept, cinderhulk, has basically fucked up the entire jungle meta for tanks. this item is the most useless piece of garbage ever on actual tanks. the passive is exclusively for monsters, considering it does basically no damage to champions. you&#039;re getting no cdr, no resistances, and no tenacity. it&#039;s horrendous on true tanks meant to take damage and dish out cc, but a fine option for certain champions who literally just want a little bit of hp so they can be beefier while killing everyone with their high innate champion damage. (the champions that build rylai's, black cleaver, and titanic hydra afterward, such tank L0L)\n\nthat branches into a similar topic, jungle item exclusivity and forcing other item choices into your required jungle item. as a tank, i&#039;m forced to build a severely weaker version of sunfire, ending the possibility of building that item later on. with runeglaive, the problem more lies in the fact that you&#039;re not nidalee or elise, so having to autoattack to use the item efficiently is really stupid. on top of which, the item is basically exclusive to champions with mana.
