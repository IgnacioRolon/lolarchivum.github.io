Her actual kit remained similar, but the rework shifted most of her power towards her E, and her new passive changed things dramatically. Originally, she was a strong laner, maybe even a lane bully, that poked with Q and went in with E when the opponent was low. Now she's a really weak laner who does everything with her E.\n\nThat, plus the disastrous nerfs, means I don't play her anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2015-09-15T19:17:19.184+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good, fun poison mage with damage over time (you know, it's poison)\nturned into a\nMP5","replies":[]},{"poster":"lllusive Man","date":"2015-09-15T19:14:26.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes the other pointed that out correctly she was that annoying poison mage we all loved(or hated) she was fine not the best champ ever bec of her mobility but they shiftet like the other already said just to her e. the old cass was easy matchup max e for a quick kill difficult matchup max q poison for safety now its impossible to kill someone with your poison alone. rlly if you have like 1200 ap you are doing 500-600 dmg and that over 3 sec the old did 800-900 dmg with half of the ap but she needet it bec of her non existent escape and close range fighting power you just cant go in a enemy team bec you want dat adc in the backline. but you have to with the new cassiopeia. like i said your poke power is non existend if you are under 1k ap. her w does 20 dmg +10 % of your ap per second the old cassio had the 20+15% ap per sec on the fisrt lvl they heavily gutted that too i tryed it with my brother you need like 700 ap to kill a squishy with your w and he needs to stay the whole duration in it.. the e was overbuffed then nerfed and now it cost 90 mana per cast 180 mana in the second 540 in the 3 sec where you can poison someone. her ulti is gladly unchanged but it has a rlly low dmg and can be avoidet so easy.\n\nanother thing that riot havent thought about the old cass had an 3 sec cd on her q and poisons her enemy for 3 sec this allowed you to spam rapidly. her new q has the dot duration unchanged but a 4 sec cd. i think they wanted to give the enemy counterplay but its already difficult enough to get your q frequently on the enemy..\n\ncassiopeia was fun is fun and always be my main but changes are highly needet","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smefanye","date":"2015-09-15T17:20:58.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like it's a similar issue some people have with Mordekaiser atm in that they shifted what the champions original identity was; a lot of people I've seen don't necessarily HATE her kit, they just wish it was on a different champion and Cass kept her old identity","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-09-15T17:23:51.903+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"She used to be the games designated Poison Mage.

Shes fine for what she is...basically an adc with ap rather than ad dmg.\napparently they decreased a bit the damage on q and w and increase damaged on e, also giving it some heal\nher q and w never did so much damage, especially nto late game when ppl regen 100 health/sec or lifesteal etc.\nso i guess before 90% of her damage was with e and after the 'rework' its more like 94% of her damage.\ni dont see how shes changed at all really...shes jsut a bit stronger now.\nbesides q allowing her to refresh e faster on same target, it also gives her a speed boost (always did). and w slows the enemy (always did) making her pretty good at chasing people down for the last e to kill. Thats how this stuff worked before the 'remake' and its exactly the same after.  with having a heal on her e, its also a bit safer for her to chase people a bit, since she never had really great range.\n\nbefore the rework she was a strong laner. after the rework she apparently was an even stronger laner...too strong. her passive used to give her extra mana, now it giver her extra ap. She was too strong and they had to tone it down a bit. now shes about as strong a laner as she was before...but the same champs that she struggled with before are still kinda difficult for her...especially champs with good range that can poke at her outside of her range to retaliate much....things like brand/lux always gave her a hard time.\n\nby the way...just a tip. It seems like most ppl open with her 'q' then do eeee and only use w if the q misses or something. I tihnk its more accurate to open with w, because its about the same range as the e , the hitbox is wider, and its persistent...so the slowed person will try to walk out of your w, while you get a couple es off, and then since their path is obvious and they are slowed you are sure to hit a q as they are nearly out, giving you the speed boost, and being able to chase the person down. So her 'combo' really should look like w e e q e e (dead)","replies":[{"poster":"lllusive Man","date":"2015-09-16T15:24:21.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"her old passives reduced mana cost dont giving her mana and the new didnt even getting her mana its her e that gives mana do you even played cass before ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2015-09-16T15:29:37.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The player base had the fantasy of her being the premier poison mage.
