Obviously it's your effective health that matters most, and at any given amount of health or armor/MR one of the two will grant more effective health than the other (and thus in many cases you do actually want armor/MR). \n\nAll I'm saying is, you're not going to be very tanky if you're building items like Frozen Heart and Thornmail. You'll be a LOT tankier with Randuins Omen and Sunfire cape for example. Or Spirit Visage and Banshee's Veil for MR. \n\nOf course the counter to stacking health is BotRK or Liandry's (percent health damage). At least in that case though, you're forcing the enemy to build a whole item just to counter you (and only that person will do much damage).

I've won so many games as Mundo just by being so tanky and so fast that I can just plunge into their entire team and keep them from ever teamfighting properly. \n\nYes, {{item:3035}} does make this more difficult, but so long as you don't dive so far that the entire enemy team can focus you for free, you should be fine. In my experience, tanks seem to have the hardest time when they think their job is to just dive enemy carries, but then just get kited back and killed while your back line is too far to help. Personally, I find it much better to help your team by duking it out with the enemy front line while zoning the enemy back line, and going on them if they get too brave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-02-08T21:31:10.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> However, it seems that whenever an AD carry gets {{item:3035}} , I am of no use anymore no matter how much armor I have stacked.  It's a little better with AP carries and {{item:3135}} , but it's still an issue.  I'm just wondering if this was intended?  \n\nThis is intended.  Offense has to outscale defense or games don't end on time and we only can play late game champs.\n\n> Are tanks supposed to be almost useless mid/late game?\n\nTanks are supposed to be amazing in midgame teamfights and necessary but not exactly inspiring for late game teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2015-02-08T18:57:47.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tanks are OK if they can set up a wombo with an AOE stun of some sort.
