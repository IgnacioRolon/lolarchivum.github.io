It was solo-queue and everyone called 'Fill' which surprised all of us, so we started joking around, trying to figure out who was going where.  Eventually we settled on the most reasonable plan:  All mid.  \n\nI was Viktor (this was before his rework), and the rest of my team was an Akali, Mundo, Caitlyn, and Sona (pre-rework).  The Akali was the only one that didn't play along at the start, so she went top, but the rest of us went mid.  We shoved lane hard and got the first tower at about 4 minutes.  The enemy team gave a lot of 'WTF's in All Chat at the start, but when we killed the enemy Fizz and took his first tower, the other lanes came to save it.  Apart from the Fizz, I don't remember who was on their team, but despite our lower levels, we managed to push them out and get the second tower at about 10 minutes.  We hit level 6, and tower dove with the help of the now level nine Akali.  This resulted in an ACE and we took the next tower and the inhib.  The game went back to 'normal' after that, but even though we were slightly behind in levels, we had gotten kind of fed, so we held off the enemy's attempts to counter-push us.  They surrendered at 20, and post-game chat was full of my team essentially just repeating \"Holy crap, that actually worked!\"  It was one of the funniest and most fun games I've ever played.  Everyone on my team was really relaxed and goofing off, making bad jokes throughout the entire game.  I really wish all my games were like that, but they're rare, so I try to hold on to memories like that.  \n\n*Back to the main subject...*  \nI hate hearing \"Don't ban <insert flavor-of-the-month assassin here>.\"  It's worse when the person saying it is fourth or fifth pick.  Either the champion gets banned and the player is mad about that, or the enemy team gets it and you need to fight the annoying/broken champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WolfBV","date":"2015-08-14T05:25:57.537+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I'm gonna teach you guys how to play.\" *proceeds to link YouTube and Twitch stream*","replies":[]},{"poster":"OmManiPadmeHum","date":"2015-08-13T19:08:06.961+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"<summoner name here> and I are duo bot\"\n\nIn lower elo, that NEVER pans out well.
