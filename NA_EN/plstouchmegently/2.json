You have to think; where are my enemies going to move? Are they going to chase me? Do I have the damage to backtrack with my ult and still get out alive? He does massive damage, yes. That's something people are always going to complain about with any burst-type mage assassin. LeBlanc is a prime example; she does ridiculous amounts of damage without her ult, and being able to double up on that can one-shot any squishy. The thing about burst mages like Ekko is that they tend to take a bit more planning and skill than other champions, and because they take more skill, it's much, much more rewarding when you do the right thing and do it well.\n\nWhile he will have a huge nerf coming because of the people who whine and complain because they went 0/15 against a champion that actually takes skill, I think Ekko is fine how he is. Wanna know what kills Ekko? CC. I was just playing Hexa earlier, and in a 48 minute match, and I died I think 17 times (I had more kills, however), because they could land their CC before I had a chance to R, E, or flash. The moment they locked me down, whoever was around converged and killed. Ranged champions with CC, like Cait or KogMaw are a problem. Slow him down and keep him from getting close, and there's nothing to worry about.  If he can't touch you, he can't kill you. A huge portion of his damage comes from his E and his passive; both basic attacks. He has to hit you to do the damage, you know? While his dash is just that, a dash, it can only take him so far.\n\nBut to round this off without furthering a huge wall of text, I think if you do well as a champion like Ekko, you deserve it. It's not easy. It requires far more thought than your average champion. Not to say that it doesn't take a certain degree of skill to play other champions, but just that there's a huge learning curve for Ekko, and that he's by far one of the more difficult champions to play well, right up there with Azir (having to control multiple soldiers at once and pay attention to where they are, you are, and your enemies are) and... uh, Urgot. Because he's just a mess to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Biff Manly","date":"2015-05-30T23:04:29.467+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"So you're saying Anivia is op if she figures out what to do with her 3 foot-wide wall?

Some champions can be so counter-fun that they also are confused with me overpowered. Like Leblanc, is she really overpowered or just very toxic and unfun to fight against.\n\nStill even with hilariously overpowered champions continuing with minimum to no nerfs, I think Riot's biggest mistakes are always with newly released champions.\n\n{{champion:143}} for example had at least a 60% win rate and was so crazy overpowered they had to nerf her I believe three consecutive times, the first one only being 48 hours after her release.\n\n{{champion:432}} currently has one of the lowest win rates this season with Azir, Veigar, Kassadin, and a few others and even after multiple buffs he still remains almost completely irrelevant from the game out of high elo matches, and even then the champion itself is decent once you master him.

No. If you don't have 3k health and over 100 MR while he has no void staff, don't chase him.\n\nHis kit is so damn easy to combo without even using his W. If you have to chase Ekko at all, your carries have to make sure there's at least two or three beef cakes between themself and Ekko because if he tosses his Q behind him while you guys are chasing him,  he can then press R, get a second proc of his passive, have done 1.5x his AP and huge bases, then AA with a Lichbane, which would've also proc'd his passive, doing 2.7x his AP. Even without a Lichbane, he can do 2.2x his AP without even landing the 2nd part of his Q. If just the first .2x AP ratio part of it hits to slow the carry and his ghost is within about a 500ish radius, he'll pretty much go Annie on some one's ass and do her entire combo and all he has to do is land the first part of the Q on anyone who's chasing him. Any carry that even gets tapped by the first bit is dead. Instantly. \n\nWhen we compare this combo to LEBLANC'S own combo... Well.. I'll start with Ekko's numbers with just this tiny combo that only utilizes one and a half abilities and a single AA.\n\nQ's first damage. 160+.2x AP. We'll say he has 500 AP. That's 260 base. Then there's his R which does 500+1.3x AP, which is 1150 base. His Passive then gives him 15+(12xLevel) plus .7x AP, which at level 18 to make it easy is 231+350, 581. Add it all together, that's 1991. That's with 500 AP at level 18, which is a decent amount. Not too many items in. \n\nNow, let's look at LB. Q does 310 plus .8x AP in total, which is 710 damage. R is 600 plus 1.2x AP, which is 1200, then her W which is 245 plus .6x AP, totaling 545. That combo would do 2455. \n\nShe does 500 damage, but has to use 3 abilities and has to be within the range. Ekko on the other hand is a little scarier where he does. It's a bit scary.\n\nNow, I know most of you prolly are thinking 'LB does 500 more, that's a lot!', well... You can always E before pressing R on Ekko to help add in that as well, which does 170 base plus .2x AP, so an extra 270. \n\nThis champion is meant to be an in and out champion who zones his enemies, which is true because of how ungodly quickly he can destroy a carry. His ghost and his W pretty much describe pure death and are one of the scariest things in the world, but his kit is a little overloaded. Unlike LB, he has sustained damage on his W to execute. It does do 5% base with about 2%ish per 100 AP of Missing Health on anyone who's got 30% or less health. His kit is overtuned, it really is. It needs some nerfs, but not as extreme as some are saying. Like his W could lose a little bit of the ratio and be closer to 1.5% per 100 AP instead and a 1.2x or 1.1x ratio on his ulti, which could be compensated for slightly by making his Q do .3 on the first hit and .5 on the second rather than .2 and then .6 respectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drackolus","date":"2015-05-31T03:48:06.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Welcome to Gameplay & Balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2015-05-30T20:10:08.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He ain't hard to lane against.

The main difference is usually how much damage they do; Bard's in a good spot, but his damage is incredibly low, especially with his ult eating up his power budget. He also has a super-high skill cap, which in most people's minds renders him useless. By contrast, Ekko has an actual damage output (he's an assassin, what do you expect?), and while he does take a lot of skill to play well, people who can pick him up quickly will inevitably make him slaughter people while everyone figures out how to counter him.\n\nHonestly, a lot of the time these complaints stem from the fact that people need time to adjust to the new thing. Azir was considered really weak on release. A couple comprehensive bugfixes and a learning curve later, and they had to nerf his range just to bring him in line. In the long run, it's very possible that Ekko will need some number adjustments, but at this point he's only been out for two days. It's a little too early to say for sure how badly he needs those nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-31T14:03:56.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kits should be designed with counterplays in mind, and by that I mean pre-defined weakness, and not just relying solely on the enemy players' mechanical faults, that's capitalising, not counterplaying.\n\nKits that lack actual counterplay is just trouble in the long run, doesn't matter what's the champ's current position.","replies":[]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-05-30T18:33:03.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"okay, consider how large of a radius his ult has...it's huge.  he then regains at least 40% of his hp while dealing say 3 to 4 hundred damage with only 100 ap that he would have at level 6, and if luden's is his first epic item, that suddenly becomes 4-500.  He now has the power to take out more than 50% of a champion's health in one ability while being free to move as he pleases.  If he dashes you, suddenly you take another 40% of your hp in damage\n\nbasically, this champ only has to hit 1 Q and then his ult and kit kill you instantly if you are in position.  The most unhealthy champs are the champs that literally mean you have to back off or die.  I like jayce because of this, but even he can't do that amount of ridiculous damage unless he gets a full combo off, which in and off itself is much harder to do\n\neven Zed/leblanc can't do what this assassin can for free","replies":[{"poster":"Yosuke Apperu","date":"2015-05-31T17:43:45.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"leblanc tho... q/w/..w away XD so much damage...
