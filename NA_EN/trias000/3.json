Consider that in some games, there might be a 2v1 top or mid and a 1v2 bot. You might have one player per lane and two junglers. You might have a support who continuously roams. \n\nYou might have the whole team walk up mid to begin with (maybe to invade jg) and then what, are they all configured mid? If not, how long would this system take to determine lanes and would it be constantly updating? That wouldn't be helpful after laning phase.\n\nMy point is that with the way different strategies are set up and the fact that riot doesn't technically enforce the meta, you're not guaranteed a top-mid-jg-supp-adc every game. \n\nThe configuration on any system like this would be severely flawed because anyone could be in any lane at any given time. If it doesn't decide roles immediately (which would be flawed due to jg invades), then it could have a delay. However, then say it configures when the jg is ganking? Is he then a \"top laner\" to the system because he was too when it decided?\n\nI just see so many things that would make the system wonky, unorganized, and just not worth the time it would take to implement (even if it's a small time).
