There is good critique and bad critique, but what it really comes down to is if you are polite or rude. Criticizing just to bash, insult, or in a condescending manner is bad. Criticizing for the sake of winning as a team and to help that player is good, as long as the delivery comes across well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BitterFeetFungus","date":"2019-09-28T20:17:59.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"tbh if a int feeder disconnects they're helping their team more than if they keep feeding","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zeppelins circus","date":"2019-09-28T15:07:09.422+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most hilarious part is, if the afk player did not particularly said anything chances are he will take less punishment than the flamer","replies":[{"poster":"BitterFeetFungus","date":"2019-09-28T15:20:24.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"what chances? the afk might get a lpq while the flamer gets either banned or chat restricted which decrease honor level unlike lpq","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2019-09-28T14:34:47.872+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"TrUsT mE iT mAkEs ThEm PlAy BeTtEr","replies":[{"poster":"ShyImagoghnar","date":"2019-09-28T18:06:21.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ﬂoo,realm=EUW,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=rE2yUZE2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-09-28T14:34:47.872+0000)\n>\n> TrUsT mE iT mAkEs ThEm PlAy BeTtEr\n\nnobody has ever unironically said that","replies":[{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2019-09-28T23:18:40.955+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShyImagoghnar,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=rE2yUZE2,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-09-28T18:06:21.710+0000)\n>\n> nobody has ever unironically said that\n\nThere have been multiple threads about this exact argument as to why people are flaming others.

Most people learn to control their emotions IF THEY ARE TAUGHT TO rather than spoiled like brats by bad parenting. Now that's a fun fact. Parenting these days is almost non-existent. Sure, there are always some bad apples, but the fact is good parenting helps, bad parenting or a lack of parenting and accountability hurts developing youth.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-09-30T23:11:19.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, even by teaching, most methods only lead to repression.

You're not willfully trying to make other people's lives worse by degrading them. Feeding due to a bad game or going against a simply better player is due to mistakes or imperfection, but not due to their will or due to malice. Being toxic is infinitely worse than someone having a bad game. Don't even compare them. \n\nOf course, ACTUAL inting is just as bad as being toxic really. But you seem to be mixing the terms up, as so many toxic players do. The toxic players who call every feeder an inter are just as bad as inters.","replies":[{"poster":"LightswornLance","date":"2019-09-30T18:15:43.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Feeding and Inting is the same thing, they both have the same outcome, the feeders/inters team loses.
