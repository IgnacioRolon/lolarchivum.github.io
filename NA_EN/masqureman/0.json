It was never yours. None of them were.&quot; &quot;I do not walk alone. I am with my god. It is here.&quot; Now whether her god actually gave souls, I don&#039;t know, but it&#039;s clear Nagakaborous is a deity that either gives people their life energy or at least directs its flow. \n\n&quot;You are the tiniest sliver of energy held briefly in shape. Where this energy flows is your destiny.&quot; \nThis quote supports the providing energy theory, since it is up to people to decide how they use their energy. Nagakaborous doesn&#039;t care how your energy is used as long as its used. Most of Illaoi&#039;s quotes are about motion, flow, and how stagnation and inaction is a bad thing that offends her god. \n\nAlso, remember, &quot;Nagakaborous surrounds us. All is Nagakaborous.&quot; &quot;It is the storm that is life!&quot; I&#039;m sure there are more quotes to support this, but I feel that Nagakaborous is also this energy that moves through people. Though it obviously has a will, it&#039;s a will that is mostly benign until something offends it with either stagnation or an abomination of its intention (undead, the shadow isles). \n\nSo, to the test! If Nagakaborous has some part in providing or directing the energy within people, that means when Illaoi pulls the soul out of people and they become vessels, the tentacles that they&#039;re fighting are part of the same energy that they&#039;re made of. Essentially, they are fighting themselves. Beyond that, the actual literal thing that&#039;s happening is that Illaoi is pulling their soul back into the vortex, the tempest, Nagakaborous, that it came out of. \n&quot;Change, or you will be pulled down.&quot; &quot;Your soul drowns. Fight.&quot; &quot;Each of your lives has served the vortex.&quot; &quot;Give up, and your life is nothing.&quot;\n\nThis test is intense. It&#039;s literally tentacles of spirit energy (possibly your own spirit&#039;s energy) lashing out at you and you desperately struggle to survive. Illaoi doesn&#039;t insult those who just run away. After all, a coward is in motion. Fear is natural, though she does say life is too short for fear. That fear might lead to your death, but at least you died in motion. \n\nBut Illaoi and Nagakaborous don&#039;t want you to die! They want you to struggle. They want you to earn your place in the chaos of it all and drive yourself toward the purpose you make for yourself. &quot;I don&#039;t want you to fail, I want you to learn.&quot; &quot;To challenge, to fight...this pleases Nagakaborous.&quot; &quot;Keep going, keep striving. This is our way.&quot; And, if you succeed: &quot;You swim well.&quot; &quot;You are in motion.&quot; &quot;Nagakaborous accepts your tithe.&quot;\n\nYour tithe, your payment, the deal that&#039;s inherently made for you to live your life in the League world? You have to be willing to fight for it, or else Nagakaborous doesn&#039;t feel like you deserve the life you&#039;ve been given.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-11-20T22:52:40.756+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are your own worst enemy.

Nagakabouros, the all-soul, whatever you want to call her, has a will.  It takes offense at stagnant souls because they're not in motion, and Nagakabouros believes that souls should be in motion or they're not being used properly. Shadow Isles undead consist of more powerful beings who are actively enslaving, torturing, or imprisoning people's souls and leaving them in a state where they cannot move on and rejoin the flow. If we view \"motion\" that Illaoi refers to as living life with a clear purpose, then the Shadow Isles champions would probably fit that. \n\nBut what is that purpose? Mordekaiser wants to reign forever and doesn't care about using people's souls to get there. Thresh delights in torture of imprisoned souls. Kalista feels compelled to seek out those who want vengeance and make them a part of her legion-like identity. Karthus wants everyone to want undeath and enjoy something he considers better than life. Hecarim enjoys his undeath more than his life as well. \n\nThese are all goals directly at odds with Nagakabouros. These entities want to actively disrupt her intentions and pervert them. That's the issue at the end of the day. You can say it's hypocritcal, but it's not absurd to understand that if I set up a system and you come in and disrupt it or take things out of it, that I would be upset. \n\nAscended aren't as bad in my opinion, but they would still be seen as a insult because they have removed themselves the flow of souls and considered stagnant since they've tried to \"stop time when all things must move\". \n\nIf I was Nagakabouros I would be thinking: \"I don't ask for much, but souls are supposed to be a part of the flow, and these guys aren't. In fact, these Shadow Isles guys are keeping other souls from rejoining the flow! That's unacceptable and they have to be stopped.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FakeGravity","date":"2015-11-21T23:51:24.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her praise for movement and flow is a clear representation of how location influence believe\nThe sea is both merciless and a provider of life that much keep moving flowing and changing you either change or stand still letting the waves hit you into dust \nShe and karma would definitely have quite a long conversation","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-11-21T22:36:23.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that vein the trial is symbolic of getting control of your life; Nagakbouros supplants you be taking back the part of you she gave you, and you have to fight to take it back.\n\nI really like Nagakabouros as a concept because she reminds me of the the concepts of Brahman and Atman in Hinduism; there's variants of the thinking of course but in some Brahman is the universal constant that binds all things together, in some interpretations he's also a god above all others.

If there was a point where Nagakabouros wasn't around and people existed as soulless beings, devoid of life and living in an endless eternity of nothingness.\n\nExactly! The idea of the cycle of reincarnation is an important one actually. Illaoi doesn't have many quotes representing it, but it's clear by her outrage at the Ascended (Nasus, Renekton, Azir, Xerath, possibly Cassiopeia) and the undead Shadow Isles champions that there is a cycle.\n\n \"Your soul is a stagnant, fetid pool, untouched by the tide!\"\n \"Your powers are stolen from the flow. You have damned your homeland.\" \n\"You are not free from death! You are dead.\" \n\n\"I am your enemy because you offend my god: because you cannot change.\" \n\"You are a cycle without purpose. I will end you!\" \n\nNagakabouros wants motion in life, but also the motion of that life energy, of spirits/souls. Illaoi has one very important quote in this regard.\n\n\"Many die. Worthy souls find new forms.\" \n\nSo there is definitely the passing of souls in some fashion. The quote implies that maybe not all souls find a new form, and I don't really know what to make of that part. Regardless, Nagakabouros dislikes the undead and the immortal alike because they have attempted (and succeeded in some regard) in removing themselves from the cycle. The undead that we saw in Shadow and Fortune may be regarded with some pity as they are probably the more popular ghost type that has not been able to move on to their next life because of some unfinished business in the physical world (as such, they'd probably want to put Kalista to rest with less hatred than others). The Shadow Isles champs however, generally chose their paths: Karthus wanted to die, Morde wants to reign forever, Hecarim desires his current form over his human one, Elise praises a \"false\" god and is likely also immortal as long as she does so, Thresh would probably be one of the worst offenders as he is capturing souls and enjoys tormenting them, which is a double whammy as he is keeping them and himself from the cycle and enjoying it. \n\nThe Ascended's souls will not be rejoining the cycle. In your words, they've removed themselves from the flow, and in Illaoi's \"Foul creature! You would stop time, when all things must move!\"\n\nI'm very interested in Buhru, too. I am curious as to where the Bearded Lady title comes from. Your theory of a soulless time is very likely since most religions have a period before things were created or life generally started. Yours would be an interesting one since it would imply something else created these soulless beings, or that they always existed. This puts the void into new perspective. If that was the case, where did the thing that made those beings go? Was there a fight? Is there another universe like the void that they went off to? There's a lot of room for the theology of League to expand.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-11-22T01:03:49.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The quote implies that maybe not all souls find a new form, and I don't really know what to make of that part.\n\nPotentially souls aren't distinct from other energy in the flow, and what collective of energy makes a soul can be lost as part of the flow or keep itself together so it can return to the world. Souls without the strength to maintain themselves potentially break down in the flow, with the essence itself then being remade as new souls or new energy. As we see in Illaoi's trial the essence of your own soul is essentially what you're fighting, being manipulated in to a tentacle like form, indicating that souls aren't some special, unique thing given to living beings, but as much a part of the flow as anything else.\n\n> Snipped for length but it's your Shadow Isles and Ascendants part\n\nNot only did they try to remove themselves from the flow but they tried to take from the flow at the same time by keeping their souls. Removing yourself from the cycle would essentially be just dying I suppose, as your soul goes back to Nagakabouros and is remade or finds its way back to the world of the living. These guys not only wanted to remove themselves from the cycle but retain their ability to remain in the world as beings with minds of their own. In some situations, like the Black Mist, those souls were trapped and so it's more the mist being a corruption of that natural energy from the flow, but for Mordekaiser and the Ascended they were totally about defying death and becoming immortal, which is counter to the cycle itself. If I was Nagakabouros I'd be ticked off considering how big of a middle finger they gave her.\n\nWith that in mind though the Ascended and Undead can probably all be reclaimed by the cycle. For all intents and purposes both of them still have their souls, and so if they are brought low Nagakabouros can reclaim them just the same, or so I'd assume. We see it in Shadow and Fortune where Nagakabouros's light tears through the corruption of the Black Mist and rescues some of the lost souls within.\n\nOn that note though I wanna know more about the connection between the Soul and a person's identity. Illaoi talks about souls finding new forms, and we see the undead retaining their mentality from life but in many cases its mired in a haze and they can't remember it, but then we have Sion, who regains more of his old self by fueling the inferno that keeps his going, implying that the connection between mind and body is dependant on how strong the connection is with the soul, meaning the soul will revitalize everything about a dead person, including their personality. Perhaps since souls can find new forms if they're strong enough and that we've seen souls without bodies in the way of Senna retain their personality then the strength of one's soul can carry that mentality on its own, allowing for a true reincarnation as it were if they find there way back home.\n\n> Your theory of a soulless time is very likely since most religions have a period before things were created or life generally started.

There's a lot of room for the theology of League to expand.\n\nI'm drawn back to something WAAARGHbobo talked about, that Demons (and maybe Darkin) existed differently before humans became a thing they relied on to sustain themselves. Perhaps Nagakabouros favored the men, yordles and other worthy species and gave them a piece of her essence that would give them a heightened existence as long as they were willing to fight for it. Considering that Aatrox and Tahm Kench are both immortal (seemingly) beings there's the potential they existed before the flow and now outside of the flow. Perhaps Nagakabouros's power was also felt in the world itself, giving life to the very elements themselves in forms like Anivia. Hell if we wanna go crazy maybe Nagakabouros looked upon a barren, empty world filled only with Demons and Darkin, without purpose or reason behind it. She gave life to the world and allowed creatures to be born, finding purpose in existence that the creatures born from the dirt and darkness of creation couldn't understand. \n\nI'm going way in to speculation land but hey, it's a ton of fun to do so!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mister Sunglow","date":"2015-11-21T14:29:59.431+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"She could be in a band with {{champion:412}}.

They're there to serve a purpose to the overall body. Nagakabouros would not see undead and immortals like toe-nails. I think she'd see undead as a sickness, as they don't help the cycle or motion of life in any way. In fact, most of them are actively harming it. Karthus wants more people to be undead like him, which she would see as stealing them from the cycle. Thresh captures and tortures souls, which is worse. Morde enslaves souls as well. Kalista does the same with people seeking vengeance, although she(they) might be seen as more of a pitiful case. Hecarim is just kind of an asshole, but I'm sure he has no problem with manipulating people's souls either. I think he did something like that in the Harrowing story.\n\nImmortals like the Ascended would be seen as an insult and still a perversion, but at least they don't bring anyone else out of the cycle with them, so they're not as bad as the Shadow Isles champions. \n\n If there's a cycle, then souls are meant to keep moving through it. Undead and immortal people are removing themselves from that cycle, possibly even declaring themselves above it. She'd see it as a perversion and something that needs to be stopped. They're in motion, they're doing things, but they do it outside of the flow that's supposed to be linking all living things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Actually xPeke","date":"2015-11-22T15:29:43.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The sky, the sea.
