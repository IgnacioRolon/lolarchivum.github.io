I wanted to make an aggressive jungler that has global presence. \n\nThe lore could be based of around Rek’Sai and her having a brother. I am not into the lore so I don’t really care about it lol\n\nNote -  the numbers are random to give a rough idea and so is the names\n\nIntroducing Lar’Zan, \n\nPassive - Killing a large monster (Blue/Red Buff, Dragon, Rift Herald or Baron) gives 8 bonus AD and capped out at 12 stacks. When reaching max stacks Lar’Zan deals more damage to those monsters and is granted a small shield protecting from ability power, everytime he enters his own base.  \n\nQ - Point and click, Lar’Zan slashes enemy targets dealing AD damage and slows the target. If Lar’Zan successfully Q’s a target he is rewarded another Q, which he dashes and slashes doing AoE damage, leaving a bleeding effect to those hit. Cooldown - 6 seconds\n\nW - Passive - In a large radius Lar’Zan is given bonus movement speed when approaching enemy champions.\nW - Active - Lar’Zan screams and makes enemy and friendly champions map turn black for 1.2 seconds. (Like a nocturne ult) After it is done enemy champions are now revealed for 4 seconds on the map.  Cooldown - 103 seconds\n\nE  - Skillshot, Lar’Zan stands still reaching behind him with his sharp claws up to 3 seconds. When the 3 seconds are over he launches his claws forward and dealing AD AoE damage to targets. Holding for the full duration the E can stun target, and it’s AoE.   Cooldown - 7 seconds\n\nR - Point and click, When clicking on a champion Lar’Zan dashed through units damaging until he is at the targeted champion dealing True Damage. Cooldown 72 seconds","replies":[]}
