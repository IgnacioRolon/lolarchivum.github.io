Here are the passive and abilities..\r\n\r\nPassive - Area of effect damage deals more when more is being hit (champions/minions)\r\n\r\nQ - A Ranged AoE punch with one hand. Every 3rd use it punches with both hands and stuns for a second. (You have to hit all skillshots to get the 3rd punch)\r\n\r\nW - When being out of combat  you can activate and itll slowly heal you and coasting mana  longer you have it on. If enemies attack you it stops and you get a longer cooldown, unless you turn it off yourself the cooldown will be sorter. (Almost like a garen passive)\r\n\r\nE - I totally forgot my idea for his e, maybe you guys could think of something lol\r\n\r\nR- Punches the ground, slowly targets and costing mana the longer you have it on. This would work well with his passive. Short cooldown and can be interupted by AoE abilities.  (Almost like a gangplank/anivia  ult but can be stopped) \r\n\r\nThis is just an idea that i thought of when i was bored","replies":[{"poster":"RAVEL0RD AZIR","date":"2016-07-14T08:14:30.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so something like sandking+sandman train scene?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ¯ghtkeeper","date":"2016-07-14T10:15:17.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Q is so...
