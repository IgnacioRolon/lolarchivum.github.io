( Varus and autofill support as well) All those games were great and I can confidently say all the players knew what to do or how to play their roles at least.\r\n\r\nI was in series for silver IV and I noticed my mmr was silver II ( 13 win streak and I think it was a 90 something % win rate with Lucian which was cool and all) so I was hoping maybe I would skip or something. Well I didn't skip which was totally fine. After I got silver IV my friend wanted to play a normal before I got off and so I did. I don't remember what happened but I am pretty sure I was fed as well as my friend but we lost the normal game anyways. \r\nNext day on my work break I decided to just check out my stats because I was bored idk and I noticed my MMR went straight to silver V?\r\n\r\n Basically since 2 weeks ago since that happened I cannot get a winning streak or just win in general. (I understand you can't win them all) Went down to silver V twice now. My Lucian win rate is now 75% which I am not mad and I try not to care about stats but still.  I cannot get a solid team that knows what to do or how to play. I am also matching with new accounts that its their first rank game and then go 1-11 or something silly. As much as I get fed and get a double kill bot 2v1 or multiple solo kills mid lane etc. I cannot carry a 1v5 if I don't have support to hold or just do something. My team afks, trolls or feeds and it is mind boggling at how people play league of legends. I am sorry but why or who finds \"fucking\" around for 20 minutes enjoyable.\r\n\r\n I am not the best but come on honestly. At least I am trying and I care. I personally think the league community, gameplay wise is by far the worst gaming community there is. There are great people outside the game but when you are physically playing I cannot stand it --\r\n \"?\" \"Same\"\r\n\r\nSo the question is does normal games effect your mmr? If not why am I getting \"new to rank\" accounts on my team or my mmr randomly goes down after I ranked up / win? Lastly any tips to just improve my solo play to carry literally a 1v5?\r\n\r\nLol Idk I really dont get it.

I feel like it is just a gamble. I think the ranking system should be fixed or tuned to separate the good and less skilled because every rank has them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmoothHits","date":"2017-03-07T04:19:33.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normal games shouldn't affect your ranked mmr, but losing streaks do.  For instance, when you were doing really well on Lucian and had a 90% win rate, the game matches you with higher players, but the opposite happens too.  If you get a few numb skulls on your team a few games in a row then it can tank your mmr.\nI've played my fair share of silver ranked games, (currently stuck there again smh) and I find that silver ends up having so many unranked players.  Again, I don't know the coding behind it, but from my experience I would guess that when new players get carried or win their first game or 2 in their placements, they get sent to silver mmr even if they don't belong there based on their play.\nThe way to win isn't to get fed then carry the game.  You have to understand this is a game of resource management.  You can choose to put all your eggs in one basket, but if they're squishy and die because they misposition, well gg.  Best way I've found to win is to ping, take command of your team and tell people what resources to get.  For instance, I was playing poppy top today and I destroyed my laner solo killing him 3x.  I knocked his tower down and then pushed the wave out and started roaming.  Instead of me going topside the whole game to catch the giant waves, I told my mid laner to grab the giant waves.  My mid laner was even in lane, but had a massive cs advantage, therefore more items and as a poppy I was just as tanky.  Gotta be creative and decisive. hopefully that helps","replies":[]}]}
