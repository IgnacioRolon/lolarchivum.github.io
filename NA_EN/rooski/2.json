Always 1 or 2 teammate that play against you. You keep killing and they keep feeding, like a fucking actor (player who gets paid to troll). The amount of troll there is fucking unbelievable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aurlec","date":"2016-07-29T18:50:12.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be bad luck, there has always been a lot of toxic players, i too think i see more of these now than a few months (maybe a year) ago but maybe some people can say they tend to see less","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-07-29T16:58:12.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least bad players try to win, and honestly I can go 31/7 and can't kharry because my team doesn't listen to me and do jackshit and wood division plays. \n\nTrolls are literally on the enemy team. :/\n\nLike who here feels great about winning a game because the enemy laner/players were boosted animals and try to fight you when you're 3/0 and have morde's 3rd q ready and all of his cooldowns (morde's cds) up? I don't.  And it's tough to carry layers like this and then they say in /all chat \"Omg\" or the lux support \"gg noob team vs pro team\".
