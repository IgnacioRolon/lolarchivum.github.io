I haven&#039;t played her in such a long time although she is my favourite support.\r\n\r\nWhen i played her she felt very weak compared to other supports, i understand how janna&#039;s play style is but when i play but i like to auto / dmg when i can on any support. When poking with janna i normally e myself and auto / w to get dmg off and block any autos back from enemy side. Janna is a good support but i feel like Karma, Lulu, Soraka and Sona do her job a lot better. So i thought of some changes or buffs to give janna to help her out but not completely rework the champion.\r\n\r\nPassive - Maybe lock onto a champion where you both get movement speed when walking towards each other (like zekes harbinger lock on how you can swap after anytime given the cooldown)\r\n\r\nQ - Lowering the mana cost from 90-105-120-135 to 80-95-120-130 help early game (i think i got numbers correctly)\r\n\r\nW - have the same passive of movement speed and going through units but change the attack part to ..when using w on enemy slowing the target (putting the little cloud bird on enemy) when hit by allies it explodes doing a little bit of aoe dmg for x amount. \r\n\r\n\r\nE - i think it&#039;s fine\r\n\r\nR - maybe increase the healing and lower the cooldown \r\n\r\nThats what i thought when playing janna, i feel like she will get a rework but i want her to feel the same and not get ruined by her changing her completely.\r\n\r\nThanks would appreciate any feed back lol","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-05-25T02:03:00.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make it so her ult doesn't heal at 1s intervals. Make it similar to Singed thingy. Nerf her base stuff but buff her ratios.
