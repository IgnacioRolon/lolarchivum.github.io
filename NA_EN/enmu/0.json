This means your connection takes a different path to League than it does to any of those other games. This means that while you don't experience issues with any other games or services, you can still have issues getting to League's servers quickly or correctly. \n\nThis issue is often caused by network routing to League specifically, so we can run a traceroute to figure out exactly where the issue is happening. First, though, I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local network settings are fine before we start looking at everything outside of your network.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
