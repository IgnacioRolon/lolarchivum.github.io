Or at least, it&#039;s because not enough people want to play support that the game can&#039;t make teams with it.\r\n\r\nIf that&#039;s the case, why don&#039;t they give support mains the option of having only-support options?  The reason I ask is because I usually only get support but I accidentally forgot and was assigned bot instead.  I was looking at the new champ rotation to see who I wanted to ban and BAM two supports.  Was that dumb on my part?  Yes, absolutely.  I&#039;m an idiot.  \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not like I would mind waiting longer.  I don&#039;t mind waiting 3 minutes instead of the 30 seconds it takes to queue in.  It takes longer for people&#039;s computers to load into the game than it does to get a queue to pop anyway\r\n\r\nSupports get no love man.  If we do our job properly and have 30+ assists, 0 deaths, we may get one honor per game.  And people complain when they are forced into support as if the game has exiled them.  So, wth?  Just give Support the option to only-Support.  What would be the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-08-15T21:15:28.459+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple.

The reality is I probably play top(even middle but I don't suck at middle) way less than other people get autofilled.\n\nEven when I pick jungle as primary, I don't even get autofilled with it no matter how many games I play. I just don't get jungle often enough for that to happen. I blame it on the fact that Kayn is popular as a jungle and is the new champion.\n\nI think it would make sense for fill primary to have a secondary, but if you choose to not have a secondary then it would be great if that meant that your allies would never be autofilled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2017-08-16T15:59:30.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Three reasons\n\n1.

But if you play it smart you can do well. Or just have two supports. Once the bot tower falls, yours or theirs, you can take turns pushing out the lane while you pick a lane and go camp the shit out of it. Who doesn't like their own personal guardian?\n\nBut I hit the point where I was playing support so much that I was forgetting how to do other lanes. I got into support cause I used to fill (it was a thing, everyone was expected to be able to play every lane, typically 2 champs per lane so you had options) and we'd all shout out what we wanted so I'd just fill what was left. So lately I've been playing legit fill and it's really not fill=support. You'll become a better support by having to learn other roles and what they need/want. You get a stronger grasp of the timings. You realize there are other items than Locket, Redemption, Knight's Vow ... It's crazy but they really do exist. There's this thing called a black cleaver. I've never built one before yesterday or the day before that, well not the version from season 4.\n\nBut I'd be against mono-laners.
