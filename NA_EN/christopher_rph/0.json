Let me just say this, I played my first 3 PVP games yesterday and we won all 3 games and I had a decent KDA.  But today, I had a really bad bot game with mid lane Ahri and I was bitched out.  I tried to explain that I was playing against bots because I was trying to become better and that bad players have to start somewhere.  I mean, it&#039;s totally understandable if you&#039;re in a PVP game and you&#039;re frustrated with a person for not performing (which is why I don&#039;t join PVP games) but there is little chance of losing a bot game.  Is there no safe haven for practice?  \r\n\r\nI dunno.... I just apologized and was told to go support top lane and I tilted and just kept dying and of course, the hate kept spewing.  If these people don&#039;t want to play with newbies who are bad and practicing, why play a random bot game????\r\n\r\nUgh.... I think this was more of a rant than a question.  I know I can just mute them.  But damn..... just frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Dolyna","date":"2015-07-26T21:19:28.706+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You never know what kind of people you get in a bots match. I once had a teammate that flamed people for \"kill stealing\".  In a beginner match. It's pretty rare that I see anybody get nasty about dying too much, though.\n\nIn one match yesterday, we had one player who ended up at 0/15/7, and another at 0/8/4. Nobody got mad. It was a long match, I got to level 18 as Jinx, and mowed down towers. I look at it as a training challenge. In another match, we did have a couple players get miffed at a player who wouldn't leave bottom lane that two others had called, was completely unresponsive, and kept getting killed; but they didn't get nasty, just a little frustrated. In another, a top laner kept getting killed, and the only response from the other top laner was that he couldn't play that lane any more, because the enemies were too fed. \n\nOn an unrelated subject about bots games, I've noticed that I end up solo bottom a lot. Probably at least half my matches. Strange. Well, it's good practice.","replies":[{"poster":"Vet Vimpeii","date":"2015-07-26T21:21:20.822+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kill stealing isnt nothing bad\nbot games arent about the kills\nits about winning","replies":[]},{"poster":"Christopher RPh","date":"2015-07-26T21:22:21.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I try to main jungle so that I'm not getting caught up in the chaos of people getting confused about which lane they're in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"alfavhunter","date":"2015-07-26T20:34:33.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Depends on how bad, if they are 0/30 at 25 min I think I have every right to be mad","replies":[{"poster":"Keisto","date":"2015-07-26T20:38:59.425+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you identify the difference between being mad and being mad in chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Christopher RPh","date":"2015-07-26T20:46:56.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was 0/8/7 that game.

No one should be taking it that seriously as to flame someone for feeding or playing badly. And if they do, it's more sad than anything.\n\nFunny story. I was playing a bot game match and was trying out AD {{champion:89}}. I didn't care what lane I went in, so I ended up getting shuffled to bot lane. With a player playing a marksman. As Leona. Looking back on it I admit I may have made a mistake not specifically telling that guy that I wasn't going to be playing support, but I think he's equally at fault for assuming someone is actually supporting in a bot game. I'll consider it even between us.\n\nAfter the first three kills in the lane (and a healthy amount of cs) went to me, he started complaining about how I was KSing him. Then, after I picked up my {{item:3074}} he said something to the effect of \"hydra on support leo lolol what a noob\".\n\nI was hesitant to tell him that I wasn't his support at this point, since I thought that the revelation may have broken his brain in two. I set up a few kills for him and he shut up after that. I felt like a parent feeding a crying baby.\n\nToward the end of the match, I was feeling pretty strong and a teamfight broke out in the enemy base. Of course, we won that fight hands down and ended the game off of it. I managed to get a quadra in that fight, and was pretty impressed with myself as AD Leo. Here comes Mr. Marksman just before the game ends \"OMG supp took four freakin kills wow never seen a leo so bad\".\n\nIt became apparent to me at that point that this guy had never realized that I was never, or had any intention of, supporting him. This was after me having an inventory of items like {{item:3153}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3035}} and was actually doing more physical damage to opponents than he was. He was a bit frustrated in after game chat that his support was so terrible. I couldn't even laugh to myself at him, I was stunned by his stubbornness.\n\nTo this day, I like to imagine when the first time someone he respected (a mentor, pro player, youtuber, etc.) took {{champion:89}} to a role other than support, this guy's mind was absolutely blown. The prospect of a support champion _not_ supporting may have caused him to question his entire life; his very existence. Something akin to coming face to face to Cthulhu, it may have driven him mad. I believe in my heart that there is a very real possibility that that man is in a straightjacket in a padded room mumbling about a Janna going midlane at this very moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C0ME ON AND SLAM","date":"2015-07-26T20:32:55.164+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I see people in bot games I always assume they're practicing or just goofing off.
