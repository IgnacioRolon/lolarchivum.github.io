I totally outplayed him so hard with all my damage early on but he didnt die.\r\nNasus gets back and gets a glacial shroud and outfarmed me because he only had to fokus on csing while I had to fokus on lashitting AND trading to avoid nasus getting q stacks.\r\nHe ignores me, I cant even trade him anymore and then the lane gets a farmlane for him.\r\nBalanced champion, I completly wrecked him and outplayed him so hard and then he can suddendly 1 v 1 me, k.\r\nThen midgame Nasus just qed me TWICE and I was nearly dead and had to backport everytime.\r\nSoooo op, how can he win even though I won earlygame so hard?\r\nMy conclusion is Nasus is overpowered and needs to be gutted.\r\nThis abomination is terrorizing toplane for enough time now, delete cancer nasus 2015.","replies":[]}
