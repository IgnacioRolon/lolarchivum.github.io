Why doesn't riot save your S' you get with a champion when you are working towards Mastery level 6 or 7? Why does it only start to count them after level 5.

Please give me your thoughts and inform me if there is a good reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T05:41:00.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are still rewarded for those scores!
