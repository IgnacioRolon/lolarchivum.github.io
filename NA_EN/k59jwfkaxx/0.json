I have made a club and few days later there was that club bug happening for over a week. Now it's fixed, but I'm no longer in my own club that i made, but my friends still are. I don't have my club chat in client and i don't have club tag in game. Nobody can add me because they say I'm in club and I'm its maker. Is there anyone with same thing happening that can help me? Thanks. {{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T02:50:37.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aware of this issue and are working on a solution.
