Why","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had 2 accounts become inaccessible at once. Why does Riot not respond to support request? Why is their security so lax that someone can alter my accounts and steal them from me obviously from a different IP, probably from a different state, maybe even a different country without that raising a red flag. This happened within 24 hours of me last using both accounts. Account names are **[REDACTED]** and **[REDACTED]** summoner names are \"sir slops\" and \"slops\" both are level 30 and my main, **[REDACTED]**, has hundreds of dollars of skin purchases on it. I honestly cant understand how a company as big as Riot Games can get away with having such terrible security and customer service, that 1. something like this can happen so easily and 2. its actually not possible to talk to someone to get this kind of thing resolved, either over the phone or through online chat. I honestly cant see myself ever spending money on this game again knowing that my account can easily disappear and I am then put at the mercy of a horrible customer support system. Maybe Riot should focus a little less of their revenue on ESPORT nonsense that the vast majority of users couldn't care less about and a little more on services to prevent this from happening and helping out their customers","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T05:28:31.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Losing your account certainly sucks, but our support team **does** answer requests, in fact, there are tons of agents me right now answering those requests. Tickets are answered on a first-come-first-served basis, so we'll get to your ticket in the order it was received. Until then, I'd recommend changing the password for the email address that was associated with your League accounts, in case your accounts were compromised via your email.\n\nAdditionally, please avoid posting your usernames publically, as that sort of information can assist more malicious folks in compromising your account. I had to redact them from your post in order to protect your account information. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"slops333","date":"2016-12-05T23:52:52.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OH IM SORRY. Your right they do answer, once every three days, then they ask for the same information that I already gave to several times before and once you do it again you get to wait another 24 hours for them to ask the same bullshit again. I assume at this point both the accounts, which would never have been taken with even the most basic of security measures (honestly, you should be legally required to offer 2 step verification if you keep payment information of any kind), are never going to be returned to me. This is the WORST customer support Ive ever had to deal with. I have Comcast and I used to have AT&T, they both suck but at least its not literally impossible to talk to a customer support representative. I wouldn't be surprised if an actual human being has not even glanced at my support ticket in the 5 days since ive made it. This asynchronous communication is LITERALLY the worst possible way to deal with these kind of problems. And HEY if I ever get my main account back, which I DOUBT I EVER WILL, I get to look forward to dealing with these incompetent assholes again to get my level 30 smurf back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BewareTheIdes","date":"2016-12-05T14:53:18.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ya Targon's blade is lying to you pretty much and is giving you empty platitudes about the quality of the support system.\n\nWell then again Riot's support is a copy pasta mess and their ban/security systems are jokes. If you actually do get a response in a timely fashion then it's a generic thing after they skimmed the tickets. Heck I asked one something and they didn't realize what I had asked for 4 messages, don't ever ask specifics or more than one thing in your messages either they will copy paste you to death with nothing you asked for after repeated abuses. Heck one time I had a support member look into a complaint I had with one of the riot team's response and they said they were sure they meant nothing by it or it was okay after they investigated. And yet when another person took over the ticket that support member asked for a link to the post since they couldn't find it. Now you tell me if that isn't biased and a clear glossing over of things. I'm sure they investigated after they ask me for a link to the post the other just said they read through, which was obviously a lie then when someone actually asks for a link to it and then you think hmmm they just lied to me about all that and if i hadn't said something they would have done nothing. I have never seen more disrespectful employees of a company and I think I'm going to make a post about some of these things soon since they want to hold the community to high standard but not themselves.\n\nTheir support in every experience i have had with them is worse than Comcast's or ATT. Trust me it takes up to at least 3 days just to get anywhere with support and would highly recommend not spending anymore money on their products until they fix their support infrastructure. They also have the right to terminate your account for no reason so if they don't believe you like if someone hacks in and becomes toxic then they won't help you. Thus you might be out of any money spent and if you want a company that is reliable and trustworthy I would go elsewhere. In my experience Dota2/valve is has much better people at this and you can actually call when you have an issue and they might be able to get you instant help. Riot takes weeks in some cases and their customer support treats you like shit/copy pasted the entire time.\n\nAlso about their security systems, they had a leak a few years ago by a guy named Jason, (real name Shane Duffy) and they lied about it for years without telling people(look it up). I think some people even brute force crack accounts now on their servers to crack the passwords if they have your username from some posts I have seen recently. If you trust a company like this with money then you better be ready to lose both time and money you have spent.\n\nObviously also their community ban system is a joke also since you see so many toxic/a crap ton of trolls in games. But if you get mad at trolls you can get banned since they have a policy of its never okay to talk back to trolls in game and will ban your account. Then when a real flamer / troll get banned they jump on other accounts and troll/ say hate speech some more since they are usually prepared for that to happen.\n\nThey have such an outdated ban model compared to every other moba out there it's almost funny since Dota2 and HOT which are run by well respected companies don't permaban people they silence/ put them in lower priority queue to seperate them from the good players without taking their money and saying tough luck like Riot does. It would be funny except they ban people that have spent $1000 plus in game and don't give it to them on new accounts so it's obviously a cash grab.\n\nIf you do put money in(which you shouldn't) don't use chat because they can jump straight to permanent ban. This is why you see a lot of lobbies of silence where no one says any jokes or anything since they are afraid of being banned. Riot's system doesn't instill a good community it instills fear so a lot of people inflict permanent chat bans on themselves so they don't lose their money they put in to this money hungry set of monsters preying upon gamers that like the game enough to spend hundreds of dollars on it and want to have good games not ruled over by trolls. If you want to say they are being negative and shouldn't be that is fine, mute them for good (ie silence them) like you tell us to do ever single time we ask. I don't care if they are muted that is fine most don't talk anyway. But when you take their money for having backbones against the trolls then you are in the wrong and hypocrites. Then put the trolls in a lower priority hell so we don't see them but they can not make new accounts to troll on. EVERY OTHER MOBA COMPANY does this. Riot is the only one that does this since they think they can make money off it by those trolls/flamers buying EXP BOOSTS. Which they don't btw and they go to those account sharers to get their accounts.\n\nAlso if you want to reply google my name \"BewareTheIdes\" and tell me where it is from to know you read it and have respect to read the entire comment before replying.
