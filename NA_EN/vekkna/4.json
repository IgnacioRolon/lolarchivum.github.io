First off, I really like Poros.\n\nCan you explain a bit about how this works? I set a hotkey and held it down during a series of attacks, which I hear is correct.\n\nBeyond that, I don't know what it's supposed to do. Based on the name, it sounds like holding the key and using attack-move-click should *never* result in attacks against non-champs, right? I also tested with attack-move and attack commands.\n\nWhat is actually happening is that I still attack the closest target to the cursor, regardless of whether it's a champion. I tested this in a whole mess of minions, so I confirmed it was happening by 1) making a new dummy for every test to see its damage numbers, and 2) in real games looking for my passive shield proc.\n\nI also tested it using the default keybind to eliminate the possibility of config error.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T00:10:47.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware, Target Champions Only will only ignore minions and such on the actual click. Using the attack move feature with this turned on will still have your champ attack the closest enemy since you're only clicking on the ground.\n\nEssentially, that function only checks for champions on the initial click. For instance, if say Teemo was hiding behind the Golem which gives blue buff and you click there, you would ignore the monster and click on Teemo even though you physically couldn't click him. With the option turned on, you ignore everything on the actual click except for champs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
