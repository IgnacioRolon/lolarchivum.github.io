The first page of the menu shows pages 1-9. One mousewheel down shows pages 12-20.\r\n\r\n I cannot select pages 10-11 at all. This is in legacy client in new champ select only. Works fine in old select like ARAM.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a bug or user error, but I need help either way.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T18:22:24.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an odd issue that a half of your rune pages aren't showing.

I'm not sure how to demonstrate with screen caps. Is the dropdown menu supposed to show 10 pages at a time? \n\nOr is there another way to scroll through them other than mousewheel? I tried highlighting a page and using up/down arrow keys, but that didn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T21:27:29.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, you're doing it just fine.
