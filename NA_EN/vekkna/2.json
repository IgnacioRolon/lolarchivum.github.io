You can unlock the camera. You can mouse-scroll the camera to pan from the edge of the screen.\r\n\r\nBut can you set a camera position and then lock it in that position relative to your champ? What I want is basically the \"per-side offset\" option but with an extra 100-300 units offset. This would be very helpful when playing certain champs or positions (eg bot red side).\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"12belowzero","date":"2017-11-05T22:55:33.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would honestly be soooooo useful.  Why not have a custom per-side offset where I can submit a value from 0 to 100 (0 being my character on the top right, and 100 being bottom left) or something of that nature.  When clicking space to refocus on my character, its annoying to have such a small per-side offset.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-11-06T21:25:03.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's even easier than that. All they have to do is create a \"lock camera with champion follow\" that tracks with your champ movement no matter where you locked it on the map. HotS has something *almost* like this where the camera tracks with your hero, but it only works when the camera is semi-locked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-15T03:00:34.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmm I'm not 100% sure if there's any way of setting the camera up that way.
