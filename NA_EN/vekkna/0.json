One that was mentioned by others is opportunity cost. Creating a Genderbent version of a Champ is roughly the same work as creating an entire Champion (from a Visual design standpoint). New VO, new model, new animations - its the same work that would go into a new Champion.\n\nAlso, Riot talks a lot about a Champion's \"silhouette\", the visual read on a Champion so that you immediately know who you're looking at. With 130+ Champions you immediately need to know if the character coming out of the brush is Caitlin or Graves, and if Graves is Annie Oakley, you may risk blurring those lines even more. Certainly you could argue all day long about how you'd make a certain Champion maintain the same visual read while being genderbent but it still weakens that element of immediate identification, which can bring up some tactical/balance issues.\n\nPersonally I'd be more interested to see the Champion designs themselves be a little more diverse - more androgynous or genderfluid characters, but that risks flaring up the community if poorly handled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2017-04-05T21:41:14.577+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"LE MAO\n\nLE MAO\n\nAbsolutely hilarious (not sure if intended), most hilarious thing I've read all day \n\nMAYDAY PARKER?
