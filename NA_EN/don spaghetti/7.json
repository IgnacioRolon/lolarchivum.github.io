So it&#039;s one of 3 things basically\r\n\r\n{{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:38}} \r\nAll have passive abilities that give them _some_ sustained damage with their auto attacks. For Diana it&#039;s her passive 3rd hit and everyone else it&#039;s their W passive. At least Riot is consistent about that.\r\nIt makes sense because when they fully commit to a fight they (usually) don&#039;t have a way to reliably disengage, so they need some sort of damage to keep them relevant in a slap fight. At least until their cooldowns are back up.\r\n\r\n{{champion:84}} \r\nShe also has passive on hit damage, but that has a fairly noticeable cooldown. What lets her stick in fights is her W, which allows her to wait until she has some cooldowns back up before she reengages.\r\n\r\n{{champion:55}} \r\nI&#039;m not gunna lie I never play this champ so I&#039;m not exactly an expert on her, but she can reset her shunpo pretty easily if she plays it right so it&#039;s not hard for her to disengage and reengage safely to make up for any lack of sustained damage.\r\n\r\n{{champion:28}} \r\nSpook lady here doesn&#039;t have any of that. She has her 3 q&#039;s and an E, then she&#039;s sorta just chillin for another 4 or so seconds while she waits for anything else to come off cooldown. The ult is pretty unreliable considering it has a base 140/110/80 second cooldown, so it&#039;s extremely unlikely to have for every fight. It&#039;s nice that new Eve gets more burst when she lands her Q for followup Qs, but old Eve had sustained damage coming from her Qs that made her more of a threat early on. Not having that sustained threat makes her early game incredibly underwhelming unless your laners have a lot of lockdown.\r\nI don&#039;t really have any fixes to throw out there, it&#039;s just something I noticed she&#039;s lacking compared to all the other melee ap assassins. She&#039;s also the only assassin that doesn&#039;t have a reliable gapcloser, but her stealth sorta makes up for that.\r\n\r\nOf course, all this starts to matter less and less as you get more items and all these champions can just burst reliably without having to worry about needing any sustained damage, but considering Eve is a jungler, the sustained damage is pretty important for her early game.","replies":[]}
