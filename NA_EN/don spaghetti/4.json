I always end up shutting down when I lose pace of the game like that because it ruins my tempo, and I just try to farm/ward and try to pick off people mid rotation or just tilt into another dimension. So I was wondering if there was anything else that should be done or can be done when the enemy team gets a snowball like that going.","replies":[]}
