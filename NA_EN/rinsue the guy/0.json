(PLEASE READ)","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":22,"down_votes":23,"body":"On February 19th, 2016 my first league account, Rinsue, which I have had since 2010 was permabanned. After repeated reports for verbal abuse, toxicity and a considerable amount of other behaviors that should not be so common place in our community, Riot layed down the ban hammer. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had many interpersonal problems throughout my life, problems with family, with friends, and even with people I barely knew, so those problems just kind of latched on and stuck with me. They were rooted in who I was, how I was, and how I treated other people and what I thought of them. Problems like this affect everything, whether you know it or not. Around December, things started to get really bad, and come January, I can&#039;t genuinely say I felt anything besides anger and confusion. At the end of January, everything kind of fell apart, and I just didn&#039;t really care about anything anymore. \r\n\r\nThen in February, I got perma-banned. At first, I didn&#039;t really care, the monetary value of the account didn&#039;t really mean anything to me, and I was numbed to the sentiment I had towards the account. I&#039;d had it for around five years, and I still remember the earlier days of League fondly. But after about a week, I took a look at myself and realized that what I saw was not a good look, and to be honest, I really only have the permanent ban and Riot to thank for that. I started to try to repair what relationships I could and apologize to people for the wrongs I&#039;d done, but I didn&#039;t feel that that was enough. \r\n\r\nSo I decided to commit myself to making a positive change in the world by working for a non-profit organization committed to helping people who need it just for the sake of helping. I&#039;m not perfect, and nobody is, but we can put our best effort forward into trying to help each other and our communities. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this, and thank you Riot for all you&#039;ve done for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Arya Nuada","date":"2016-05-26T15:29:19.836+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm not perfect, and nobody is\n\n*ahem* {{champion:202}} *ahem*\n\nOn a more serious note, congratulations on you becoming a better person. xD League of Legends has helped me improve my ow attitude myself.

But honestly, people in this game drive other people to become toxic. People pretending otherwise are completely inured to the ridiculousness of this game, have group of friends they are constantly playing with that don't find fun in ruining everyone else's fun, time and effort, or are one of the trolls that are driving people to be toxic.\n\nIt's all downhill from first report because it automatically flags you to get harder for subsequent reports, whether they are merited or not. And then it doesn't wear of for MONTHS. Like you can be cool guy and never say anything for months and if you get reported again, BAM. This system is so beyond stupid in how it handles people and the ineffectual  power you have against the trolls.\n\nSure, RIOT will put out numbers and pretend that so many toxic players got banned, but I guarantee those players on the ones driven to just not caring anymore and spazing out in chat. The trolls who find it fun to feed, and be completely useless no matter how much you beg them to pay attention, suggest what they are doing wrong, or running to help them out only for them to kamikaze or run on you are still there. Why? Because they aren't usually saying anything in chat logs that can be reported. And everyone else just leaves game without reporting because by time the match is over they want nothing else to do with it anymore.\n\nOnly recourse if you don't have a group of people on hand to play with? Don't play or don't play to win.
