Same thing goes for gunblade. i don't see her being able to really use the life steal too much tbh. However i could be wrong, i haven't played too much AD eve lately. ap eve is just more my playstyle. i'll have to try out some of these AD builds. let me know if you try this one out and what you think :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"resumed","date":"2016-02-21T03:51:42.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i use this build on evelynn because im disgusting\n{{item:1400}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3009}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3147}}  ({{item:3025}}/{{item:3078}})","replies":[{"poster":"Ńord","date":"2016-02-21T04:26:54.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that in order to win with eve, you have to be as disgusting as possible so no problem.
