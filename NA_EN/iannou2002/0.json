Its not my wifi, I did every damn solutions on internet and still lagging. If someone could help it would be great.\n\nEditing my edit: I just changed router, 0% packet loss, im on laptop and im suspecting my wireless adapter to make me lag. My ethernet cable works fine","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-24T15:56:03.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see in your edit you mention 8% packet loss. This can definitely cause a ton of issues in League, as each packet is crucial in communicating both your actions and movements, as well as your client receiving and displaying each other player's actions and movements. While there are a number of potential causes, our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) goes over some great first steps in resolving your packet loss. \n\nLet me know if you continue to still see issues after following that guide.","replies":[{"poster":"iannou2002","date":"2016-07-25T17:53:15.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm suspecting my wireless adapter on laptop to make me lag.
