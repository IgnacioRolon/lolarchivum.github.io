As someone who wants to prep for NACC 2016 with a new team, I was wondering if there were also awards available for the team coach if they had one?  I mainly ask because I am taking on a coach position for my school&#039;s team and I was curious if I would be eligible for rewards should my team make it far in the tournament.  \r\nHelp/Knowledge would be appreciated :)\r\n\r\nAndrew (135246)","replies":[{"poster":"Sherman","date":"2015-08-26T17:43:40.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In last years NACC, we awarded 6 players on each team.  If the coach was also their registered 6th player then they also qualified for the scholarship.  We're still locking in the official rules for the 2016 season, but in the current design, the rule doesn't changing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xFeelsbadx","date":"2015-08-26T14:29:02.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe you do get any rewards. Mine do it just for the fun. But the team is nice enough and knows, at least I do, and so I mystery gifted our 2 main coaches 3 skins and an icon. I'm sure there will be free pizza and that for them.","replies":[]}]}
