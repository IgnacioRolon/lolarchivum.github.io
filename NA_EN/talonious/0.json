I haven't played in months. I hopped on in August to play a few games and before that it was nearly a year since I last played. I decided to hit up League on Tuesday of this past week and I find out my account has been permanently suspended. I have many skins on the account, plus some extremely premium and rare skins, and I don't want to create another account. I'd like to get my account back if it has been wrongly suspended. I know I am not a toxic player, I even don't condone people I play with to act like that. Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated. I put in a ticket for the incident, the ticket number is #23612748. I will give you guys any information you need to look more into the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTalonious","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T03:02:57.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Porocles* and I cannot discuss account specific stuff like suspensions here on the boards, but if you remain patient, an account specialist will get back to you on your ticket. Just as a heads-up, we've had a lot of ticket submitted recently, so response times may be a bit longer than normal.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-10T06:46:45.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We cannot comment about suspensions, Player Support  will give you more context, if not already. Usually, it means you were sharing your account and someone else did forbidden things. If I would go to Mars for 1 year, I know no one would use my account because I follow basic security/privacy measures.","replies":[]}]}
