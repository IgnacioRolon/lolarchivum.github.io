As The Djinn stated, champions need to clearly still be themselves, which they wouldn't be if they were genderswapped. Remember, in Lol, mostly every female champion has an hourglass figure, while mostly every male champion is built like a castle. Sure, some don't fit that description, but it'd no matter serve to have the champion's silluette change. Ontop of that, if you want a genderswapped version of any champion, wouldn't you want the champion to actually look female or male respectively? How'd you do that with FX. Garen? Just give him a different head? Then what's the point? If they had to implement this into the game, they wouldn't be able to actually go all the way because their silluette would have to be the same. Garena (super thought through name) would still have to be super bulky, covering her entire physique in armor. Sir Price (Miss Fortune gender swap) would not have the strut in his step, and his entire physique would be vastly different from miss fortune unless you specifically make his very sassy. I don't think actual genderswap skins would work, but I'd definately love some art of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sauceyapples","date":"2017-06-18T22:14:20.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that certain champs wouldn't be able to be able to have this skin. I agree.\n\nHowever, like Djinn stated, I do think certain champs would be able to hold their identity as champs, but as the opposing gender because of identifying marks, like Singed's bottle, Sejuani's boar, etc. I never really thought this would actually happen because of the amount of work they'd have to put into it with new art, VO, graphics, etc...

It shouldn't ever be confusing as to what or who you're looking at in-game, so any gender-swapping skins would have to make sure that the character's shape, size, silhouette, and graphics are close enough that you can't mistake them for someone else.\n\nThis limits your available design space somewhat significantly, but I don't think it's a dealbreaker. Just something to keep in mind when thinking what champions this could work for. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sauceyapples","date":"2017-06-18T20:50:43.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree and was thinking the same thing, too.

(Other than one&#x27;s white one&#x27;s black but that could be easily mistaken).\n\nOff the top of my head, the following champions rely on props/armor/etc to convey their form (or have a physique that could work roughly for either gender), and could easily be swapped:\n\n* Aatrox\n* Ezreal\n* Garen\n* Gragas\n* Illaoi\n* Ivern\n* Jhin (might be hard to tell?)\n* Kayle\n* Kled\n* Malzahar\n* Master Yi\n* Morderkaiser\n* Nasus\n* Pantheon\n* Poppy\n* Rumble\n* Singed\n* Taric\n* Thresh\n* Udyr\n* Vi\n\nI think you could sell all of those -- they all either have strong identifying traits that even a shape change can't fully mask (dog head, shields + armor, floating gems, spirit animals, kegs, etc), are identified by their exaggerated shapes (Illaoi, Gragas, Kled, Yi), or have VERY clear visuals that would help identification (Malzahar, Singed, etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Sauceyapples","date":"2017-06-18T21:08:01.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg imagine a female gragas haha","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-06-18T21:12:06.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sauceyapples,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=z5pNuobI,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-18T21:08:01.002+0000)\n>\n> Omg imagine a female gragas haha\n\nPretty easy sell to me!
