All Q. W. E, and R have different and miscellaneous issues ingame at the most inopportune of times, mostly on teamfights or when it is a critical moment, so it is difficult to recall exactly what happens.\nI will make a thread later on and link all the issues with at least 10 people having the same problems with R Conqueror's divide, and W Shifting sands mostly.\nFor me:\nIn game bug\nAzir unable to use Shifting sands\nLevel 2 Azir unable to instantly use W right after casting a soldier.\n1- Cast a soldier\n2- Use E immediately\n3-Nothing happens\nthe spell icon presses, the cast sound plays, but azir stands still until the timer for another soldier is up.\nE can be cast repeatedly with sound and animation for the spell correctly prompting, but the champion makes no movement or interaction.\nE does not go on cooldown in the process mentioned above.\nCasting E a few moments after casting W will enable champion's interaction with the soldier, but it is not flawless as intended.\nEvery single game I play I get the same problem with his E.\nThis is only one of the bugs with azir.\nThere are also bugs related with his range and his soldiers, and interactions with his ultimate R Conqueror's divide.\nPlease take a more thorough look at the champion since there are several threads about this champion.\n\n\nNow please Take a look at these threads, they are all Azir related and all have about the same issues.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/GAmYZxmk-azir-is-still-bugged?comment=0000\n(Issue with shifting sands)\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/v531eJAH-riot-please-be-honest-did-you-actually-do-any-bug-fixes-for-azir-last-patch-like-you-said-you-did?comment=0002\n(Cooldown issues)\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/Xaw8iQHy-azir-w-bug?comment=0000\n(Auto attack issues with soldiers)\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/QRjplYe0-gameplay-azir-bug-fixes-are-no-longer-fixed?comment=0003\n(Azir combo issues including W, E, and Q)\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/zmKk8dr3-azirs-magical-journey-bug?comment=0000\n(Azir combo issues)\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/4TdP7mPM-azir-kit-buggy?comment=0000\n(Azir kit issues, all spells Q, W, E, and R)\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/3n4LGEb2-gameplay-gamebreaking-azirs-q-range-nerf-bug\n(Azir Q issues)\n\nI would add videos, but I am not sure what software to use.
