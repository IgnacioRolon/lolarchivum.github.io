The new (lol) client now recognizes my capslk key as an shift input. Both in typing and when I remap attack move click to shift+b1 (I press my capslk key and left click). When I load up a game my capslk key now registers as shift when typing in chat or the store, but when it comes to actual gameplay the game still registries the capslk key as capslk. \r\nThis is a problem as I cant use capslk as a modifier key. I know a script program like AutoHotKey may solve this, but as far as I know, that breaks the TOS. \r\nIs there anything I could to fix this other than getting a new keyboard where iI can reach my shift key?","replies":[{"poster":"mconst","date":"2017-10-06T07:32:13.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can actually do this just by editing League's config files!  Here's how:\n\n1. Log in to the League client, but don't start a game.\n\n2. Open the file C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\PersistedSettings.json in a text editor (like Notepad).\n\n3. Search for \"input.ini\" -- you should see something like this:\n            _**\"name\": \"Input.ini\",\n            \"sections\": [**_\n\n4. After the square bracket on the \"sections\" line, insert the following text (make sure to copy it exactly, including the comma at the end):\n                _**{\"name\":\"ModifierEvents\",\"settings\":[{\"name\":\"evtShiftR\",\"value\":\"[CapsLock]\"}]},**_\n\n5. Save the file.\n\n6. Start a custom game and try it out!\n\nLet me know if anything in the instructions doesn't make sense, or if you have any trouble getting this working.","replies":[{"poster":"cruZtop","date":"2017-10-06T19:43:00.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My man! This solved my issue! I read something about the config files trying to solve this on my own, but I could not write the correct code my self. Copypastaing this worked like a charm tho!

If you need to switch those keys around in League, you're going to need to set up those Hotkeys through the in-game options.","replies":[{"poster":"cruZtop","date":"2017-10-06T19:46:06.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry but neither the in-game or the client options could do anything in this case as i wrote in my post. The wonderful MCONST solved it, however.","replies":[]}]}]}
