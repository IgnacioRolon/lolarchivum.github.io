Thank you.\n\nThe only thing you need to learn about is getting around it in due time, rather than instantly coming here to whine after losing to 3 Sylas matches after 1 day of release.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CrazyMonkeyCZ","date":"2019-01-27T12:09:00.523+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> his W is a dash that does extra dmg to turrets\n\nYa sure?\n\n> his ult is the worst at rank 3 he can use the ult he stole every 15 seconds (his knock up is 10 second cd so all you need is a yas ult and there a yas in almost every game)\n\nNot like you have to wait 200% cd of that ult, so that's 60 secs for yas ult.\n\n> either way something need to be done about his overloaded kit the only way i can think of killing him reliable is cc him to death but thats about the solution with every other problematic champing if their not 1v9ing while flying around the map at the speed of light\n\nThere is not possible way to 1v9 unless you are fed like god, which is no longer problem of champ, but yours.\n\nHis laning phase is weak in almost every match up(mid and top, idk jng and bot). His teamfight potential isn't good either, unless you can steal some dope ult and then you have to wait 200% cd. He is nice duelist/split pusher with his sheen/passive and W outplay potential. \n\nSo no, he is not op, nor overloaded, my prediction is his winrate won't go higher than 48-49% at best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-27T16:00:13.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This pair of adjacent posts at the top of this very thread encapsulates the problem with Sylas:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Akheteru,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JHPk03kX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-27T11:40:20.784+0000)\n>\n> I been watching sylases getting shat on for 2 days.

If he doesn't get good ults to steal, he won't be nearly as strong. Unlike champs such as Ryze and Azir, this discrepancy isn't based on coordinated play vs solo queue; it's just how the ult works. Any given player could have two back-to-back Sylas matches with totally different power levels. It's definitively unbalanceable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2019-01-27T15:53:23.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now, he is getting rolled.  My worry is that because of how bad people are doing with him, he gets a buff and then the real scary part of him comes out, when people get experienced with him.  Honestly, the dust needs to settle, but I also think that new champs like this should not be inserted into ranked games right away for this reason.  Once people learn to play him and vs then we will see what is really going on.  I do think he is overtooled and will be insane once people figure him out, but for right now I don't see it in most games.","replies":[]}]}
