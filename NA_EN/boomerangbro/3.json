So, Syndra mains and enthusiasts (and other mid lanes that would come at the expense of this), does she need to be dominating her lane in order to function?\n\nCurrently she does need to dominate lane to function, because her scaling/kit make it so that she falls off in the late game and therefore has traditionally been about taking her early power, snowballing it into the mid game and ending the game before it reached the late. If she doesn't have a strong laning phase then she is no longer capable of doing that barring luck/significant outplay of the enemy laner/successful jungler assistance. So you play her and you watch as the laning phase passes you by, you progress into the mid with no advantage to push and you wait for the enemy mid to outscale you. It's horrible. \n\nIf you give her a stronger late I will be more than happy for her to retain her mediocre laning phase but right no it's a completely unacceptable power curve for a champion to have. Mid is full of champions like Azir and Cass who have a strong early AND then hypserscale into the late. On the other hand you get champions like Orianna and Karthus who suffer a poor start, but will hard carry for you later on. And then you get Syndra, the champion who starts out AND ends poorly, banking her game on the *chance* of having a strong period in between. It's so obviously an unacceptable state for a champion to be in.\n\nShe needs to dominate the laning phase or she needs insurance of being useful later on. Buff her late game scaling and her early game is perfectly fine. Don't want to buff her late? Then she needs to be dominant in lane. She just will not ever be viable if you don't do either of those things and I am continuously baffled that she has been in this state all year long.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-08-13T00:47:59.418+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yes.\n\nHer late game is abysmal.

I didn't think that it would get so many upvotes as to have a Rioter come and read and comment on it. \n\nOk, maybe wanting her to be a lane bully is asking too much, but I'm a little confused here. I have to ask myself, What is Syndra? Before, it was easy. Early game control mage that shifted nicely into late game damage mage. Now I find myself struggling to place her. She does poor in the early game, which if she gets behind leaves her struggling to reach Transcendence and ultimately makes her an easy pick in the mid/late game. If she get's ahead in the laning phase, she reaches her potential faster, and can make some decent plays late. The struggle with Syndra though, comes in the laning phase. The goal with her, is to reach max transcendence with each full-pointed ability. Well, to do this, you would think, \"hmm, I should max my Q first\". Good plan! That's what you want on Syndra as well. The problem is, when you put points in it, you spend MASSIVE amounts of mana to the point where getting Q at lvl 1 just isn't worth it; Dmg/mana ratio. You end up putting a point in your W first. \n\nWhen you kit revolves around your Q, and you're not putting points in your Q early, there's your first problem. \n\nThis lead me to my next point. \n\nSyndra's lore describes her as a being that started out with potential. Each day, she grows stronger into a woman with unrivaled immense power, capable of maintaining raw energy itself, gaining transcendence with only will-power alone. \n\nBefore, she started out with early power, then transitioned into late game through the use of her passive. Now, she's generally thought of as weak, because she now doesn't have that cushion to help her move into fully stacking her passive. She doesn't need to be a bully, but when YOU are the one struggling with keeping a lane (Her former role), shes left with not knowing what she is, and what she should transition into. \n\nShe is known as the champion with one of THE highest learning curves in the game, and one with which streamers recommend you not to use during your promos. With a high learning curve, you need to know all her combos, how she revolves around her Q and when you combo all while micro-managing your spheres in teamfights. This gets you out of sticky situations. However, I generally don't feel as rewarded for when I successfully win my lane, micro-manage players and spheres in teamfights and generally her overall gameplay. It may be just me, but players should be rewarded for managing to pull off a tough champion. It just doesn't seem to happen with Syndra though. \n\nLastly, we come to her Stats. She has NO moblity, NO tank stats, and (arguably no reason to pick her competitively). As I said, she just isn't rewarding enough for players to actually deal with her learning curve and pull her off effectively. She's left with Raw damage and control. This leaves me to conclude like others have mentioned, SHE NEEDS TO WIN LANE to be effective. If she doesn't have a lane to win, she just becomes dead weight to the team and becomes a stun-bot. She needs to be more. It doesn't need to be her \"dominating her lane\", but I can't quite place it, she just needs something. \n\nSolutions: Increase the damage of her lvl1 Q. Decrease the cost of lvl1 Q. Balance the Dmg to Mana Ratio of lvl1 Q. Make her passive feel rewarding. Make is so that Winning lane isn't her only objective. Shift around her power while still keeping her balanced. Make her learning curve to player accomplishment feel better (you want to feel good about pulling out great combos effectively). Her ult is straight burst, maybe the spheres could have an after effect based on the last ability syndra used? (max Q could have the sphere explode after a second, max transcendence could have her getting one more orbiting sphere, max E could have her use her spheres to shield herself, and how about at lvl 18 her orbiting orbs float farther away, but deal damage with each enemy they hit. Think IO from Dota 2.)\n\nShe's a Transcendent being of infinite power. Don't be afraid to let her show it. \n\nThank you RiotR for listening and reading this thread. As always, please read everyone's comments as they really care as much about Syndra as I do. \n\nCheers!\n\nEdit: maybe it's her reliance on her Spheres is what's stumping me. I think that's what is giving my brain a hard time. All her kit is basically revolving around her Q. Maybe stylize it so that different combos reward different interactions her Q can have! Her kit is good, just needs the Q not to be the spotlight. \"So much untapped power!!!\" \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wildnil","date":"2015-08-13T21:05:20.507+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I figure I can probably fill in as a Syndra expert here. I'm a Diamond-level Syndra main on LAN (I wish I could post on english forums with that account). When I play her in teambuilder, I get matched with challenger players (after waiting for at least a half hour, usually more).\n\nRight now her biggest problem is the Q damage relative to its mana cost. Between the direct Q nerf and a series of indirect nerfs to mana (which affected all mages, like regen changes, chalice nerfs), she's been hamstrung.\n\nHer entire kit revolves around spamming Q. Mana/regen nerfs hit her twice as hard as other mages because her E, W, and R pretty much automatically have to also include the cost of a Q, but may not necessarily include the damage of that Q.\n\nAs it currently stands, casting Q at rank one is a noob trap. If I am forced to cast my Q at rank one aside from when I'm at max mana, I consider myself to be losing lane. I _am_ losing lane, mathematically speaking. **When the skill that gives a champion their CORE IDENTITY is a trap.... that's a problem.**\n\nShe needs 10 damage added back to her Q, and her mana costs (or stats) tweaked. The 10 damage will make the skill at least somewhat satisfying - better than an autoattack, anyway - without making her a lane bully again. The mana tweaks will help smooth out the rest of her troubles.\n\n**Unlike some of the other players here, I do not consider her to be weak in the mid/late game. I actually find her to be extremely powerful during this period. She has a lot of tools and I've optimized their usage over several hundred games.** Honestly, the thought of buffing her late game seems completely nuts (as in ridiculously overpowered) to me.\n\nI personally think of her as a jack-of-all trades, and feel her power-curve should match this - her power curve should be relatively flat. Right now the mid and late game achieve this, but her early game is far too low. A slight Q damage buff would raise the early game back up, and mana tweaks would raise the (now flat) bar up to a competitive level.\n\nPersonally, I would not adjust her late game power beyond mana tweaks. Her damage is in a good spot. I don't have any problem with her percieved \"lack of passive.\" I would not trade the Q or R buffs for the world. **Adding something else to give here a \"real\" passive would mean you'd have to take away power elsewhere, or she would be undoubtedly overpowered.

I do not think she needs to be a dominate lane bully, but I do think she could use slightly stronger tools to get to the late game.

Also, [as you can see here](http://imgur.com/LJ0fzhC) DFG was most frequently built last and if anything means she wasn't an abuser of the item compared to other champ who bought it first or second item and who can delete without any warning. The number of spheres pre-ult should be a good enough warning to other players to back up or go all in. Most Syndra player's built it down the line because 25% cdr from athenes and masteries would not be enough in terms of late game than her used to be 35% . So in reality her late game did get nerfed. Being able to Q every 2.5 seconds than 3, being able to E every 7 seconds than 9. every millisecond counts especially in team fights. The utility it brought for her was really good, fortunately Luden's is somewhat a good alternative for utility b/c the ms just makes it easier to reposition and actually makes late game around 45 minutes somewhat manageable but still difficult to pull off.\n\nAlso DFG late game was essential to her not falling off since the active made it so her ult wasn't useless. You could prematurely set your ult off with one Q and do the same amount of damage as a 5 sphere ult. This was important because most mages late game that are considered mid range burst mages, need to do their combo with in 4 seconds to delete someone. Every other mage kept that intact due to how their kit is, while Syndra's you need to wait out 6-8 seconds or even longer to get a good catch and/or opportunity to get the damage burst out. She kinda lost that and it's easy to avoid her threat now. her team fight presence is gone since the removal. Meaning Q>R>E would be less efficient than Q>E>R. \n\nAs for your question. She does need an early advantage to be good throughout the game. She doesn't have a good late game despite what people say. It's really easy to shutdown Syndra late due to her immobility. She doesn't have any means to reposition so other champion kits just seem more rewarding and more forgiving late game in terms of how they function. Then again, there is Luden's but almost every AP champ build Luden's so the richer get richer due to the net buff since the dfg loss. \n\nSee the patch before Syndra was nerfed, she was already on a decline of pick rate and win rate mainly due to the meta shift. This is one big problem I see sometimes, a nerf to a champ already falling out of the meta. Right now all I can say is wait it out and see where the meta takes her, or buff her during the early or late game. I'd rather see a buff late game. Might as well keep the trend going. You have already nerfed the early game of Champs like Viktor or Cass who's strong early game was nerfed to trade off for their insane late game. I have several ideas but I'd rather share it when Meddler get's into discussion as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-08-13T19:20:52.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra's Q and E was nerfed.

That's how bad it is.\n\nAnother QoL change that I've wanted since Season 3 and I'll repeat it here, I want her Q with smartcast to behave like Zigg's Q.
