Also, once I read my post before, it kinda sounded like I was dissing the skins, but I actually really do like her skins, just that I'm looking for a little more POP! \n\nThank you for your reply!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-09T23:21:13.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, no, you didn't come off harsh.
