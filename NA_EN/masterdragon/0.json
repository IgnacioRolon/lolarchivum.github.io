Are there any error messages, and what does it say?  At what percent exactly is this happening?  I do see that you already have a ticket and a Specialist has been looking into this with you.

The issue will vary depending on what % you're getting the unspecified error.  Errors below 33% can suggest permissions or security setting issues. \n\n If it's at 75% or higher then you are likely having a network problem failing to smoothly download updates.  To prepare, and possibly even get this solved, I recommend going over every step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  \n\nYou could just be having a combination of problems here.
