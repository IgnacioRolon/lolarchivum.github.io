More frequently now with the new patch for whatever reason but something has to be broken here, Let me explain...\r\n\r\n{{champion:420}}   illaoi&#039;s E ability &quot;Test of Spirit&quot;\r\n_**ACTIVE:**_ Illaoi sends a tendril in the target direction that stops at the first enemy hit. If the enemy is a champion, the tendril pulls their Spirit, places it in front of her and tethers it to them, granting True Sight icon true sight of them while it remains.\r\nThe Spirit has 100% of the target&#039;s**_ current health_** and lasts for 10 seconds, reduced by 1 second each time Illaoi receives damage from the target. During this time, the Spirit can be attacked by Illaoi and her allies, inflicting a _**portion of the damage**_ it receives upon its tethered champion. DAMAGE TRANSMISSION: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45% (+ 8% per 100 AD)\r\n\r\nNow this is pretty specific. Meaning that if someone has full hp (for example say 2k hp) and illaoi lands her E ability on them, that if they were to stick around for the spirit to be killed and her E was at level 2 which is a 30% damage transmission, that they would have roughly 1.5k hp (give or take based on her AD, your champs armor blah blah).... Right? Because the way this is worded, and the way this is suppose to be working is that you could literally never kill anyone with the spirit because you can&#039;t deal the full amount of damage to them because it&#039;s reduced through the ability. Well here&#039;s the problem...... I&#039;ve played a couple of games now where an illaoi lands a &quot;Test of Spirit&quot; on someone, and every point of damage she puts on that spirit gets transmitted to the champ. All 100%. Meaning she was killing people just by pulling a spirit to her and beating the crap out. My allies weren&#039;t running away for the spirit to latch onto them and them to become a vessel for the tentacles to slam onto them. They didn&#039;t even take a single point of damage from anything other than the spirit. I watched as my top jax walked under his turret, got grabbed by her &quot;E&quot;, her immediately dashed under his turret and watched as his life bar got demolished while never being touched by anything until the spirit died and he had about 5% of his hp left. (he then died from getting hit by a tentacle that spawned as he rage typed in the chat about how BS this was). It seems that Illaoi E is super empowered or bugged by something, but I&#039;ve noticed the last illaoi that I ran into that was doing this was using Death Fire&#039;s Grasp. I don&#039;t know how this really effects anything, but it never actually triggered DFG on anyone as a burn, but it for some reason was amplifying the effects on the damage taken. Don&#039;t know what to think about this, but figured y&#039;all would want to know.\r\n\r\nPS. Hope I&#039;m understanding her ability correctly, if I&#039;m wrong enlighten me please. But I&#039;m pretty positive something is not right.","replies":[{"poster":"RazerSaber","date":"2017-03-28T00:50:50.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Happy Honker\n@TheLastShadow45\n\nCorrect, that was the only way I saw this to be possible as well. since the ghost would have the HP of the target since it was pulled by her ability. My view on though was that there wasn't anyone around, it was just illaoi and her target with the E, and no damage onto the actual champion itself, only the spirit. She was somehow able to kill them that way. Not sure how it's possible.\nI will try and get some video or Screenshots of this later if I run into this issue again. Just wanted to put it out there for some reviewing by people/devs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-03-27T16:01:21.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is one way to kill someone with it. If you grab someone and start hitting it and your tea(or even you) start hitting the guy pulled and do enough damage, it would allow you to kill with the spirit.

I haven't bothered with video stuff for a while. I've been playing illaoi a lot as well and I haven't had that happen to me either. I do understand that illaoi was fed and she can get crazy damage going when she's fed, but I'm just telling you this isn't the first time it happened to me. It's about the 3rd time I've noticed it while playing. I watched several times as teammates died with a spirit tether on them from damage transfer, which according to the ability can't happen. The ability doesn't allow you to do enough damage unless you're somehow able to get 900 AD on an illaoi, ramping the damage she does the spirit to 45% + 56% = 101% meaning full damage plus some...","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2017-03-27T07:36:37.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Video?\nShe ended the game 15/2.  Turns out people with a lot of kills can do a lot of damage. Jax probably got messed up by jumping into her, standing where the spirit and his champion will get by tentacles, then tried to run  and didn't dodge the tentacles that spawn trying to hit him","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-27T07:17:15.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a lot of illaoi and the spirit transfering 100% has never happened to me.  I'm pretty sure you are just misinterpreting it.  I looked at the game, the illaoi was quite fed and she could easily one shot jax. The spirit would probably take 60% of his hp, with at least 1 q hitting him as well it can account for the other 30%.","replies":[]}]}
