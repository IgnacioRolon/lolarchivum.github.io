Generally, issues with the store loading up involve Internet Explorer settings.  Regardless as to whether you actually use it or not, it is tied to your Windows OS and it is used by League to display the store properly.  Because of this, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Store Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753044-Store-Error-Store-appears-blank-black-or-empty) to make sure they are configured properly.\n\nFeel free to give me a heads up if this doesn't appear to resolve it at all!","replies":[{"poster":"boatjesus","date":"2016-06-02T00:30:46.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didn't seem to do anything, and I did restart League. Doing a little further inspection, it seems that the _\"Featured\"_  tab is the only thing effected, while all the other tabs load properly. Thanks for the help, and if you have anything else, it would be appreciated.","replies":[]}]}]}
