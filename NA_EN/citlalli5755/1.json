Games not going your way? lets have 2 of us afk real quick instead of ff'ing and just get a remake on our match history instead of a loss and not lose any elo in flex que. Even in solo q this can be abused easily. You know how stupid of an idea this sounds?","replies":[{"poster":"citlalli5755","date":"2020-01-06T06:40:44.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well he said it's still count as a loss.  I don't mind losing, I know that 4v5 is 97% chance i'm going to lose.  what triggers me is the assholes that refuse to FF.  especially when the enemy is 30 kill lead.  like wtf Is even the point of even trying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Disco Swiss","date":"2020-01-05T13:04:05.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What league should do is take a few pointers from Dota.\nIn Dota if a player afks, after 5 minutes its safe for the remainder of the team to leave without any penalty.\n\nThe game still counts as a loss obviously, but it's better than waiting out a 15-40 minute unfun game with a high chance of losing. The difference in Dota though is you can't ff.. Not that i can remember anyways.\n\nEveryone has had the early rage quitting team mate. Hell, if you look at my last match on the 4th, my Ekko jg died twice, asked to ff at 15, then afked with 8 farm.. All within 6 minutes.
