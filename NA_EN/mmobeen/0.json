I am not here to gain pity, i don&#039;t want it because i know what i did.\r\n\r\nThis game was a source of enjoyment for me. Notice the word &quot;me&quot;. I felt it was my GOD given right to call out every afk players, feeders and every troll player (buying wrong items on champs, picking teemo support and all the other troll behavior that goes on in ranked). I have become exactly what i used to criticize others for; namely being toxic at others.\r\n\r\nAlthough i never wished cancer, death etc or engaged in extreme toxicity that goes on in this game, it does not make my behavior any less bad. \r\n\r\nI started playing this game in 2010 and within a span of 6 months this year, i laid waste to my own character. Now, looking back at what i have lost i don;t have it in me to start all over again. I could have ignored the trollish behavior that goes on in the game but i chose not to. I used to criticize my own friends and my cousins for being toxic in-game and yet behind my own screen i was being toxic. I became and acted like what i used to scoff at: A Toxic Troll.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I am terribly sorry to every single player who i belittled on my team during my time playing this game in the past 6 months. You did not deserve it. Furthermore, i am extremely sorry if anyone stopped playing this game because of my in-game behavior. I can not find and apologize to the people i offended but i am deeply sorry for ruining your in-game experience.","replies":[{"poster":"SheSleepsAllDayY","date":"2017-09-26T01:45:42.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"None of them are going to read it.\nRiot isnt going to give you the account back.\nGet over it, you did nothing wrong.

But there has to be some logic behind it. I can still justify AD Anivia for having one of the longest ranges in the game. I can explain jungle Karthus because his clear is amazing and he's pretty safe in the jungle if your map awareness is on. But with AP Garen, I can't really say much except... maybe magic pen specifically for R? Which sounds like a very weak reasoning. Break metas all you want, but at least put some thought into it rather than \"It's funny\".","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-09-27T22:06:09.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3001}} {{item:3076}} {{item:3136}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3078}} \n\ndft, tld, etc. they all provide magic damage or ap.\n\nif you go with certain on hit builds you can increase your regen beyond the normal amount.","replies":[{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2017-09-28T01:30:22.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BLACK REALM GOD,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TT4fjAif,comment-id=000500010000,timestamp=2017-09-27T22:06:09.913+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3001}} {{item:3076}} {{item:3136}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3078}} \n> \n> dft, tld, etc. they all provide magic damage or ap.\n> \n> if you go with certain on hit builds you can increase your regen beyond the normal amount.\n\nI could see a bush Garen going Dusk/Luden's/Gunblade/Shiv/IE for the 1 shot silence I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-09-28T03:06:50.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seeee. now you're thinking.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mmobeen","date":"2017-09-27T03:47:23.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, i don't agree with your or RIOT's definition of trolling. But hear me out.\n\nThough i agree there can be a difference of opinion on what to buy or what not to buy OR what champ to play in what role. There are limits to it logically and morally. A player shouldn't come into a ranked game and pick teemo support knowing very well that it is a really bad pick or as you said build ap on garen.\n\nYou are also wrong that my mentality about the above argument was the reason i got banned.\n\nMy mentality is not and was not the problem. What i did about addressing the issue was the problem. instead of doing the mature thing e.g just playing the game, I chose to immediately call the person a TROLL. That is where i was wrong. That person chose to be a troll or try something in ranked game without thinking of consequences for his other teammates AND i worsened the situation by name calling him.\n\nI am not saying this because i got perma banned.\n\nI finally get it that it is a game. It is the luck of a draw, i would have gotten good teammates and bad teammates. Win or Loose it was just a game and I or YOU or RIOT cannot compel anyone to play a certain way because that is the meta or behave in a certain way because it is appropriate.\n\nI can only affect my behavior. instead of just grinding through these trollish games i chose to sit behind my keyboard and fume and call the other person troll.\n\nLike i said i wasn't toxic by standards of Ocelot or tyler1 or many other notable names. I just chose to call others trolls/idiots/feeders not thinking that i was an idiot myself for name calling.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-09-27T22:55:46.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just make a new account and smurf then. apparently league doesnt prevent new accounts so while yes you did lose everything up to the point of the ban that you had earned there is also the silver lining that you have new things to earn anyway and a lot of the game features are genuinely free. if you're good you should be able to earn S ranks no problem. if you have friends that are good you can get piggy backed by them. when you enter ranked you'll have next season to look forward to with a fresh mmr and LP rating. \n\nwhile the reason you were banned specifically is due to you addressing the issue, you have to realize that had you not had the issue in the first place then you'd have never reacted. to that end the ultimate reason is your inability to accept the validity of potential skill or the existence of the inexperienced. a fear of the unknown if you will and a grudge towards those that you feel caused you or others to not be able to win. So really it's natural to be angry about something you disagree with. Controlling that anger is step one of course, but there's so much more that needs to be done before even considering yourself \"mature\". maturity is merely a societal baseline for comparing ideas and such. it's not something that's set in stone. Today it might be \"dont talk back\" and tomorrow it might be \"report them to the authorities\".\n\nthat might seem confusing, but if you dont get it just let me know and i'll try explaining better.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Verbally Abusing","date":"2017-09-27T01:02:14.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The past is the past verbal abuse is wrong.
