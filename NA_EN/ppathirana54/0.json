After the Bloodmoon update I have been getting random ping spikes and I have absolutely no idea why. My ping in most games is below 50ms but every 30 or 40 seconds my ping will spike to 500+. Some of my friends who I have been playing with said that they weren't having a similar problem. \r\n\r\nAt this point I have tried:\r\nUninstalling and reinstalling the game\r\nUninstalling my wifi card and reinstalling the wifi card\r\nChecking the wifi antennas to see if they if they were covered by wired\r\nReinstalling my wifi card's drivers\r\n\r\nI have run out of ideas  so any help is greatly appreciated. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T17:35:23.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing packet loss, which can appear as sudden and high ping spikes.
