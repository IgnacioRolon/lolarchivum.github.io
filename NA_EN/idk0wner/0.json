I remember as well, a while ago you were able to change to EUW for free if my memory serves me correctly. I rather not create a new account and play my self back up to level 30. It requires a lot of time which I do not have.","replies":[{"poster":"IDK0wner","date":"2017-09-09T17:44:56.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Porocles for your help.

Playing on NA from such a far physical location will certainly cause some higher pings, so hopefully something can be worked out.","replies":[]}]}
