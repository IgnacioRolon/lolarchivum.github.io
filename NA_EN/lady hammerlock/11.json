Last whisper & executioner is also cheaper, but it's not likely they'll grab that first in bot. \n\nThey can grab an early Executioner, but the stats aren't really that good and it applies grievious wound like Morell (at 40% HP). I still feel like marksmen need damage and AS than spending their hard-earned money on Executioner. I may be wrong because an AD top might grab early executioner vs Vlad, but as marksmen bot lane, I dont see spending money on executioner is worth.\n\nThe only problem I have with that right now is which it lasts for 5 seconds. That's a bit too long. Reading from you guys' statements of new Las Whisper (Mortal Reminder) is a late game problem. I think it's more effective vs LIFE STEAL than it does injustice on healing. It might give marksmen a bit too much control over healing champs, which their healings don't even scale that well to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-11-05T00:57:11.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People don't get this but you don't have to build the full item.

The application of GW should have been an active effect that lasts for a short window of time with a cooldown. This way, smart players who deserve to win can use it to skillfully shutdown problematic sustain, while other skillful players can take advantage of the actives downtime and utilize the strength of their sustain.

But if they're already below 40%, then it'd be lame to let Mundo with Spirit Visage heal up to 100 WHILE you're casting at him.\n\nADC's are pretty much the designated tank and tower killer, so them having access to greivous wounds makes sense. And even with the item, I doubt teams are gonna be telling Caitlyn to focus down Shen.\n\nLastly, mages are so completely different from each other, it's super difficult to make items that are balanced for all of them (Spellvamp for instance; a stat that when tweaked wrong doesn't affect Diana much but makes Vladimir insane). If morellos worked on spell casts against targets at any health percentage, some mages would be_ constantly applying it to your entire team_ which would be wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-11-04T22:40:38.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GW hurts Fighters more than any other class.
