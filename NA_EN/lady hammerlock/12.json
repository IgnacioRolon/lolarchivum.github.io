So why do you want more gay stuff? Taric is (still) gay, Heartseeker Varus too and now think about Cottontail Teemo or Vancouver Amumu. And the most of the female characters have boobs. That's enough porn for LoL.\nOr what do you want?

The WHOLE heartseeker line is modeled after cupid. I don't even want to know how the hell you pulled gay from that, cause hearts/love and a toga isn't gay to begin with. That's like saying hate and shirts are a guy thing, when girls are by far some of the cattiest things on this planet, or that shoes are a girl thing when plenty of guys actually really like shoes. \n\nCottontail Teemo is celebrating Easter (Where, in the literal fucks, are the gay references?), and just because Amumu is wrapped in something kind of colorful doesn't mean it represents the gay flag. If that's the case i feel it's also fair to pull at the tiniest of straws and say Annie worships Satan cause she uses fire and her main color is red. See how absurd that is?\n\nThis is where I lost it. When did \"boobs\" automatically equal porn? That's a natural part of a woman's body. It's also one of the most notable ways to distinguish the sex of someone without having to drop their garments. Imagine if NO ONE had a chest. How would anyone know anyone's sex/gender? By their haircut? Their speech? Their tendencies? All of which don't exactly determine gender/sex and sometimes make it hard to tell which line their walking anyway (Hell in the gay community there's already feminine and masculine guys. slap a wig on some of those Feminine guys and things start getting really really weird when you want one thing but get another).\n\nEducate yourself or at least drop some of the ignorance","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kyutoryus","date":"2016-04-14T19:33:25.376+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's already a joke....or did you not get that?
