It has effectively become a crutch to some mages, with exceptions to {{champion:30}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:136}} who may never build it at all.\r\n\r\n2.{{item:3030}} Is actually pretty fine, I got nothing to say about it, I normally purchase it on a ROA champion if I fall behind and feel that ROA would take far to long to stack.\r\n3.{{item:3152}} No longer does absurd damage, but let&#039;s be honest, a 300 range dash on an active makes for some &#039;unhealthy&#039; tendencies, it&#039;s also far to niche to be that popular.\r\n\r\n4.{{item:3285}} Is an item that works for both artillery and burst mages because it basically serves a dual purpose. Now if we ignore it&#039;s passive and it&#039;s roughly somewhere in between 80-90% gold efficiency, it could probably use gold slashing by 50-100 gold. Problem is, it&#039;s like death cap, it isn&#039;t that efficient on paper until you actually buy more items(now we&#039;re counting the passive) because it scales with AP, it&#039;s value goes up with more items.\r\n5.{{item:3100}} falls into a similar situation, without the passive it is about 82% inefficient but unlike Luden&#039;s it has multiple stats while paying 3% ms and 20 AP for 10% CDR and 250 mana. We&#039;re not even counting the fact that Lich bane&#039;s passive scales much much better compared to Luden&#039;s in damage;albeit it&#039;s usability is locked by auto attacks, semi limiting it&#039;s fullest potential to a couple few.\r\n\r\n{{item:3116}} On to the first subject of &#039;AP reduction&#039; now mind you, the Rylai&#039;s nerf was very much deserved because like Morello, it became far to general of an item(where it&#039;s intended use was for AP bruisers/AP dot mages) was used on artillery mages and burst mages as well. Although on the other hand it got HP and had it&#039;s price slashed massively for it&#039;s lost AP, and some lost utility(not a lot of HP though).\r\n\r\n{{item:3027}} It&#039;s to gated by that fact that it takes time to stack, now this isn&#039;t a bad thing at all but it&#039;s a problem when you fall behind and fail to catch up quickly. It&#039;s previous balance changes also make you question, what you&#039;d rather have, 20+ AP, some more mana and HP in trade for a slightly higher price(which mind you still needs to scale, this is all at 10 ROA stacks) or 20 less AP, less mana and HP for less money. \r\n\r\n{{item:3174}} Haha, yeah, how about let&#039;s not go into this\r\n\r\n{{item:3135}} It&#039;s still pretty good, I mean, it didn&#039;t really change all that much.\r\n{{item:3089}} For the AP IE, it sure doesn&#039;t feel like the &#039;powerspike&#039; in the mid game and is on the norms, bought as a later item rather than early to mid item(with the obvious exception of being ridiculously fed and playing {{champion:45}} ). Now I get that this item is ludicrously strong, but it&#039;s passive effectively locks it into a later buy because you need AP to make it worthwhile(and I suppose that is the point), this is one end where AP was increased. It&#039;s passive had it&#039;s effect increased by 5%(which isn&#039;t large until you realise how much AP you get in a game).\r\n\r\n{{item:3001}} {{item:3157}} Two items that had it&#039;s AP reduced, abyssal had it reduced by 20(if I&#039;m not mistaken) and Zhonya&#039;s AP was reduced by a WHOPPING 50 AP!\r\n-As for abyssal, It&#039;s still kinda ok, but going into abyssal is pointless, considering the PBE changes coming soon\r\n-{{item:3157}} It&#039;s really hard to decide, whether I&#039;d have more AP and armour and remove the god forbidden randomly attached CDR that nobody asked for, or keep the CDR for an item with decent stats. As a person I Like me so CDR, but it creates a situation where we have an in excess of CDR and a little less AP than wanted, and for the record, it&#039;s active is not useless, you can dodge ultimates, synergise with abilities(i.e {{champion:9}} {{champion:25}}) or wait off cooldowns.\r\n\r\n{{item:3003}} Takes time to stack, overall terrible value before it&#039;s stacked but for this item specifically it is meant to to scale over time, and also gains value assuming you purchase mana items. Gives massive AP given the correct items.\r\n\r\n{{item:3151}} It&#039;s actually pretty decent.... considering the items around it as well at least.... you can only make full use of the passive if you have CC or better yet Rylai&#039;s. It has magic pen, health and 80 AP, overall no big problems.\r\n\r\n{{item:3115}} Doesn&#039;t fit all champions, only certain few can actually use it effectively. Otherwise 20% CDR, 80 AP, 50% AS, make for great stats.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot including gun blade or rage blade because it&#039;s far to niche(even more so than Protobelt.","replies":[{"poster":"DemoGuide","date":"2017-04-12T17:31:07.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel it more like Support items.\n{{item:3165}}  =  {{item:2049}} Mandatory buy because it outshines all the other AP items.\n{{item:3135}}  =  {{item:3190}} or {{item:3107}}  Mandatory because of how good it is, and if you don't you are not going to deal damage to anyone with a single MR item.\nThen you have one item of variety. Not that big of variety though. It's either {{item:3001}} or {{item:3157}} depending on the matchup.\n\n90% of the time game is already decided/finished when you bought these items + boots. But anyway, half of the time your last 2 items will be: {{item:3116}}  +  {{item:3001}}  or {{item:3157}} because teams tend to have mixed damage output with rare exceptions of being full AD (full AP are much easier to counter). It's too late to buy {{item:3003}} or {{item:3027}} beceause they require 10 minute stacking. And they don't really grant you enough utility compared to previous choices. {{item:3285}} feels cost-inefficient , and {{item:3089}} costs much and don't really feel needed because you still deal meaningful damage to squishies and would rather have slow and additional defences.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-04-12T16:43:19.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like {{item:3100}}  is plenty strong\nand {{item:3003}}  is good, but i would change the build path a bit so u don't have to spend over 1k at a time TWICE\n{{item:3285}}  is \"ok\" but what sucks is that the jungle AP item {{item:1410}}  SHARES the unique passive\n\nmeaning that is another 100 AP item u CAN'T get in a jungler\n\nand becuase of this the ap on{{item:1410}}  really needs to be 80\n\n{{item:3116}}  needs more HP and AP \nOR\nwe need another item that gives flat 100+AP and and 400+ HP that doesn't scale and isn't gated by a passive or active  that champs only work on certain champs with more AP.\neven an item with 100 AP 400 hp 200 mana and 20 CDR would be amazing we can call it \"Zhonya's Battle Armor\"\nbut what i would do is give ap a 100 ap.. 60 armor 20 CDR item\nmaybe building from {{item:3191}} {{item:1031}} {{item:3108}} .. something like{{item:3157}}  but WITHOUT gold gated by an active is it can have stronger flat stats.\n\n{{item:3001}}  IS FINE DON'T TOUCH IT\nwe dont need to give EVERY CHAMPION  a spellshield + damage item..

I understand it fell into the same problem as Runic Bulwark (AURAS MOTHERF**KER, DO YOU GOT THEM?), but couldn't we have reworked it instead of adding new items? The only thing adding new items to the mage shelf does is confuse people on what they should buy. \n\nI don't know any champions beside Swain and the occasional Aurelion Sol that even buy Hextech GLP, and I only ever see Protobelt built on Kennen or Vladimir. Also, why the hell was GLP given such a confusing name? Players new to the game are going to be like, what does the GLP stand for? What does this item even do?
