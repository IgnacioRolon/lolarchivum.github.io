Unfortunately there seems to be a visual bug on Deep Sea Nami now. :( The front part of her hair is missing.\n\nEDIT: I saw another player's post about the bug just now and also your reply to it.

It never hurts to poke me about something. :) I log all the issues for skins that come in, but it's a bit tricky to keep an eye on everything. \n\nBut yeah, we are aware of the Deep Sea Nami issue (looks like weighting, and was likely caused by the other Nami fix. D:) I know we had a dev working on it, but lemme follow up on the status. I don't believe the fix will be in for the upcoming patch, but I can ask to prioritize for the one after (7.3).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
