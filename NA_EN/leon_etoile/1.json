The only time I&#039;m not dreading queueing for a match is during RGM&#039;s on weekends. Any tips or advice from players appreciated.\r\n\r\n**What Got me into League*****\r\n\r\n1. I enjoyed the solo aspect of rankings due to not having friends to play with. It reflects what I&#039;m able to do and not who I can get to play with me.\r\n2. I enjoyed the lore.\r\n3. I enjoyed that you could outplay and outthink your opponents.\r\n4. I enjoyed watching the best players stream to learn what they are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What I hate about current LoL*****\r\n\r\n1. Riot blatantly lied to us about solo queue; I honestly wouldn&#039;t have spent money this year if I knew they were going to not bring in solo queue.\r\n2.  Premades ruining ranked games by not trying due to &quot;playing with friends&quot; or shouldn&#039;t be at a level due to getting a better queue due to being premade.\r\n3. Ranked games are determined by who gets the worst premade; not by 5 people randomly trying to work together.\r\n4. The top players aren&#039;t streaming b/c they aren&#039;t playing DQ. They are playing on TR and aren&#039;t allowed to stream it.\r\n5. The client is buggy as hell. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ll end on what I like about current LoL.\r\n\r\n**What I like about current LoL**\r\n\r\n* I think balance (on the ladder; not pro play) is at an all time high. Besides tank Fizz, I don&#039;t think anything is &quot;broken&quot; (way too much damage and tankiness).\r\n* I really like the new champ select. It has prevented me from having to dodge ranked games due to get stuck as JG. I suck at it; not going to lie.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-06-13T23:16:16.883+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been playing less and less.\n\nI won a match with a 4 man premade on my side recently... we then queued as 5 and steamrolled for like 4 games straight.
