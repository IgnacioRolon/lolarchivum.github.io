It's typical trading pattern on any caster. With Viktor's low range (for a caster) I'm on the frontline anytime I need to trade. We didn't have a tank to stand behind b/c it was an aram so you have to position even more.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2017-04-21T04:36:19.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:222}} W\n\nFANCY LONG RANGE LASER","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dispelle","date":"2017-04-21T09:58:27.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:101}}  :  \"I don't see the problem.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2017-04-21T05:02:40.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at dat fancy laser coming from Iron Man's severed arm attached to Viktor's shoulder.","replies":[]}]}
