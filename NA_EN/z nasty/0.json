However, on League, I experience FPS drops from around 70 to ~25 when minions spawn.\r\n\r\nThe problem does not begin just when minions spawn, but it also continues to grow; my fps continues to drop from 60->50->35->25 throughout the game. I have had no idea what exactly is causing the problem besides the spawning and increasing number of minions on the map, and have been doing research, but I have not found any relevant posts that have helped solve my problem.\r\n\r\nPlease leave any recommendations down below; I play on \"very low\" for all my settings, shadows off, and all the graphically intense boxes unchecked, and I have reset my drivers multiple times.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T05:21:07.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be a few different factors causing your FPS issues at the moment.
