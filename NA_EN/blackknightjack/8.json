Darius is suppose to be really good right now. I keep hearing on Youtube that I should be climbing if I just keep playing a champion I have around 400k mastery in. And, to be fair, I usually at least end the game with a positive K/D. So why the hell is it that I keep losing? I get matched up with feeding teammates so often that I have a negative MMR and can't seem to get it back up. What am I suppose to do? It's not like I can just bum rush a fed enemy team and hope to 1v5 them. I mean, I try to clear waves pushing in the sideline when I can since there's nothing I can do to stop my team from feeding in teamfights, but when I do then they just feed even worse. I mean, I can accept this is just part of the game, but I have a friend who has played about a quarter of the ranked games I have and gets wins with Illaoi consistently even when he feeds horribly to the point where he's not just a rank higher than me, but well on his way to being two ranks higher.\n\nI'm such a failure of a human being I can't even climb with a supposedly meta champion I have 400k mastery in and I don't know what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"bewarefeeding","date":"2019-08-16T22:11:30.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trash","replies":[]},{"poster":"EquinoxEX","date":"2019-08-11T07:10:04.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try {{champion:58}}","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-12T04:42:57.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't work.

Because darius may be \"meta\", but he isn't actually that good. \n\nThink about it. \n\n-Terrible objective control (does small damage to drag and baron, mediocre split pushed because he needs tri force to do any damage, and he can't quickly escape when 2 or 3 come for him). \n\n-Terrible chase/escape. Can't chase people over walls without flash, has absolutely no escape. The best thing to do is use pull right when they are about to engage to provide the slight knockup and slow as a disruption, and then hope that you are close enough to tower\n\n-Good damage, but gaited behind stacking, which takes time. There are champs like jax (burst and insane dps), riven, irelia, aatrox, renekton, who don't need to take as much time AND have better defensive tools and mobility to properly use their damage\n\n-Darius can't force his way to a win like other top champs, he relies almost entirely on the mistakes of his opponent, thus giving matchup agency to the enemy and not yourself\n\n-He gets CC locked all the time in team fights because he can't dodge hardly any stuns, slows, or knockups\n\n-His E is a lot higher cooldown than most other champs mobility spells\n\n-His durability is weak even when he builds mostly tank because of the high damage meta combined with the fact that he gets zero armor/mr/hp scaling boosts and zero defensive abilities (just look at jax with E and R)\n\n-He's easily kited by many adcs. Ever try fighting a trist? A vayne? A Lucian? A kaisai? Sure they're easy to kill if you already have passive stacked and you have flash or ghost up. Otherwise they just dance circles around you\n\n-His Q is slow and telegraphed, and can be countered by stepping INTO or OUT of the blade.\n\nSo in the end, you may even get a good KDA as darius, but how else did you contribute? Darius simply isn't as useful as other carries. Assassins have target priority and are safer due to mobilty.\n\nADC's have great range and when protected, really shine.\n\nMages have ranged damage and often a good amount of cc.\n\nSkirmishers and divers and attack people under tower pretty easily.\n\nAll of those carry classes tend to have good damage vs towers and/or baron/drag.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-10T00:23:41.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why are you able to get with Gold with him and I'm not?","replies":[]}]}]}
