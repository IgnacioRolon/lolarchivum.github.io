I mean, I GUESS you could just sit at the mid or back line and just wait for an opportunity to dunk someone who&#039;s low health and try to set up a dunk chain, but that seems to be difficult particularly because I don&#039;t have Dead Man&#039;s yet and am very easy to kite (It&#039;s become even harder to do this recently for some reason whether it&#039;s because of medication or tilt since my reactions have been slowed to the point where I miss most of my pulls in team fights and either dunk too early or too late and don&#039;t get my Noxian Might). \r\n\r\nSo my question is this: Should I still be grouping up for teamfights after I&#039;ve won my lane and just git gud with my reflexes, continue pushing my lane and hope that this causes the enemy team to have to send one or two people to deal with me that I should be able to deal with by myself if one of them is squishy until I have my core built (Possibly farming the enemy jungle as well), or something else entirely?","replies":[{"poster":"PermabannedGaren","date":"2016-09-29T03:48:52.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Peel for your ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2016-09-29T04:30:21.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could, but Darius isn't exactly the best peel in the world.
