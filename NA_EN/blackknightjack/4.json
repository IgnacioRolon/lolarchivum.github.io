Now, I know that Darius is certainly PLAYED in Diamond+ when he happens to be meta (If I recall he was even played quite a bit in the season 5 LCS), but I was always told that players above Platinum (Hell, probably players IN Platinum as well) were too well adept at exploiting Darius's weakness to kiting and limited utility when behind for him to be consistently viable in those higher elos. However, I'm well aware that I could be wrong.\r\n\r\nSo am I?","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2016-09-24T20:33:09.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I suppose Master is good enough.

Don't use Q unless he starts dashing in. If he ever dashes towards you, activate q and immediately start backstepping, you'll almost always hit your outer q to smooth out the trade.\n\nYou outscale renekton at level 6, at level 11 you massively outscale him for the rest of the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2016-09-24T16:50:36.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AdziOo.\n\nThe king of Noxian might.
