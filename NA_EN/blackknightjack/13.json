It&#039;s so easy for my lane opponent to deny me my heal and even then it doesn&#039;t seem to do nearly enough damage. I also can&#039;t seem to duel anyone without losing early game (partially because it seems so hard to land Q now). And late game I hardly do enough damage to be useful to anyone and that&#039;s if I even get kills to begin with since it&#039;s so easy to escape. Even then, though, I&#039;ve heard people say he&#039;s still one of the highest tier top laners especially in low elo. So is Darius really just not good right now or do I just suck at this game?","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-05-03T23:13:45.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're just bad.

But first, I need to know how you currently PLAY him and BUILD him.\n\nWhat is your Runes and Masteries setup?\nWhat skill are you taking on him first?\nWhat is your typical build path?\n\nIf you can answers these question for me, we'll have a basic idea of where to go from here onward. Otherwise, I'll just have to guess on what you do.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2017-05-04T01:06:01.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build path for me is usually {{item:3071}} > {{item:3111}} (Though I've been trying Swiftness because I can't catch up to anyone) > {{item:3742}} > {{item:3065}} > {{item:3143}} > {{item:3053}} \n\nMasteries are 12/0/18 with Grasp.

Not ALWAYS, it usually depends on who I'm facing and the enemy team-composition.\n\nI tested an all AS/Tankiness Runes and Masteries idea once, like so:\n\n9 AS Marks\n5 Armor/4 Scaling Armor Seals\n5 MR/ Scaling MR Glyphs\n1 Flat Armor Quint\n1 Flat MR Quint\n1 AS Quint\n\n18 (Fervor)/0/12 Masteries\n\nIt worked in the sense that I was able to proc Noxian Might faster than ever before. But my last-hitting suffered because of the lack of AD, so I was behind on CS and items against my opponents. So I went to this setup that is my currently tried-and-true:\n\n5 AD Marks\n4 Scaling AD Marks\n1 AD Seal\n4 Flat Armor Seals\n3 Scaling Armor Seals\n9 AS Glyphs\n3 Scaling AD Quints\n\n12/0/18 (Grasp) Masteries\n\nThat's just MY setup, you are free to do with this information as you will.\n\nThe build is a pretty standard one, and I follow a path pretty similar to that myself. There might be an item here or there that gets changed for the same reason as above with the Masteries/Runes from game to game. Perhaps you're just a little off-your-game at the moment.\n\nChin up!
