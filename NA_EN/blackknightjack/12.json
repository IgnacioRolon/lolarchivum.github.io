I mean, it's not like the idea of a support would be completely alien to Noxus. You could make a vanguard character like Leona and it would still fit perfectly with the flavor of Noxus. I know that it's technically possible to play Swain or Leblanc (even Darius) as a support, but they tend to do so terribly in these roles that it's never worth it to play them off meta.\n\nEDIT: I know Sion also exists as a potential support and has seen success in the past, but it just doesn't feel right or optimal to play him in the role with the way his W and E work.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-08-10T04:54:08.073+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, but Noxus actually is not the only region with a similar problem.\n\nBandle City: no jungler\nIxtal: no ADC\nPiltover: no support\nShurima: no support\nMount Targon: no ADC\nVoid: no support\n\nSo there are quite some regions which are still not able to build a complete functional team.
