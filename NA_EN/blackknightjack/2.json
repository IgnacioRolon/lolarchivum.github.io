However, I&#039;ve recently started questioning exactly what that means. I THOUGHT this meant that crowd control would only last 25% of its normal duration on you (For instance Morgana&#039;s bind should be 0.75 seconds), but it doesn&#039;t really feel like that. Does this mean each instance of tenacity has diminishing returns and that&#039;s why these masteries aren&#039;t played very often or am I just being paranoid?","replies":[{"poster":"LyingOnLine","date":"2018-02-27T07:16:37.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tenacity stacks multiplicatively, not additively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2018-02-27T07:07:23.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a good visual aid made by Vandiril.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KNpnPWVrqA","replies":[]},{"poster":"D2T Undeeds","date":"2018-02-27T09:38:21.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Tenacity](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Tenacity)","replies":[]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2018-02-27T07:01:27.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't add together.
