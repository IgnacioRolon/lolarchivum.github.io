I haven't put any thought into what a Noxian jungler would look like, but I did put at least a little into some concepts that could be used to make an aggressive Noxian support champion. \r\n\r\n--**Lore**--\r\n\r\nI don't have a definitive story, but I do have a few bullet points in a storyboard that I want to hit.\r\n\r\n•Lenore grew up in a mining town in Northern Noxus that supplies darkstone\r\n\r\n•The steward in charge of the mining town was extremely corrupt in some way that made life difficult for his constituency, but was allowed to act with impunity because the emperor of Noxus, Boram Darkwill, was quite negligent of the affairs of his own empire in his later years and used the empire for his own ends rather than to serve the empire itself (Quite possibly there could be another reason such as the steward striking a deal with Boram in his quest for immortality or the Black Rose controlling Darkwill).\r\n\r\n•Lenore was fed up with this treatment and decided that, if her steward wouldn't listen, then she would march on to the Immortal Bastion and make Darkwill himself listen.\r\n\r\n•When she finally reached the Immortal Bastion, she began to harass the first Noxian officer she could find and demanded to see the emperor. Fortunately for her, the person she hassled was actually Swain finalizing his plans for revolution against Darkwill.\r\n\r\n•Swain listened to her story and made her an offer that, if she assisted him with his revolution, he would give her the strength necessary to reclaim her village. \r\n\r\n•During the revolution Lenore used talents she'd learned about the weaknesses in materials to cause strategic collapses in structures in favor of the revolutionaries\r\n\r\n•Because of this, Swain decided to enroll her into the warmason corps and teach her how to put those skills to use for the empire\r\n\r\n•Years later, Lenore appeared before the Trifarix and demanded to know when Swain would hold up his end of the bargain and help her reclaim her village.\r\n\r\n•Swain simply explains that she already has the strength needed to reclaim her village and that she needs only to exercise it. \r\n\r\n•Frustrated, Lenore does exactly that leading a revolution against her corrupt steward and leaving her father as the new steward who could maximize productivity as he actually understood the mines while she continued on as a warmason.\r\n\r\n---**Intended Stats**---\r\n\r\nDamage: 2/3\r\nDurability: 1/3 (She simply has no durability in her kit. You're still suppose to build her fairly tanky)\r\nCrowd Control: 3/3\r\nMobility: 1/3\r\nUtility: 3/3\r\n\r\n--**Abilities**--\r\n\r\n•_Passive - Structural Flaw:_ Whenever Lenore deals damage to a champion or structure 3 times it receives an \"Unstable\" debuff that is consumed when an ally auto attacks the champion or structure. Champions that are Unstable take 45 - 185 (+3 for every 1% attack speed built) true damage and structures that are Unstable take 100 - 500 (+3 for every 1% attack speed built) true damage when the debuff is consumed.\r\n\r\n•_Passive - Heavy Hammer:_ Bonus attack speed on Lenore does not actually increase her attack speed, but rather increases the damage on her passive.\r\n\r\n_Note: In essence it gives her ADC a free Demolish and supercharged Cheap Shot that scales off of level. But, to compensate, her attack speed is quite low and cannot increase with items._\r\n\r\n•_Q - Quarry Breaker:_ Lenore leaps in place for 0.625 seconds (Same as Caitlyn's Q) and slams the ground stunning units for 1 second and dealing physical damage (Scaling with 15% bonus attack damage) to champions in that area. The area 450 units around the center of the impact then becomes worked ground that lasts for 1 - 10 minutes depending on Lenore's level. If Quarry Breaker hits an enemy champion or worked ground then half of its cooldown and mana cost is refunded.\r\n\r\n•_W - Darkstone Road:_ Lenore converts all worked ground within a large area (About the scope of a teamfight) into Darkstone Roads for 5 seconds. Allied units gain a 10% movement speed towards enemies while enemies standing on Darkstone Roads have at least one Unstable stack for as long as they are standing on it.\r\n\r\n_Note: I'm the least sure about this ability. I kinda just want it in here because of the Warmason theme, but I feel like it's a bit wonky with the rest of her kit._\r\n\r\n•_E - Seismic Shock:_ Lenore hammers the ground releasing a shockwave that knocks aside enemies and knocks up enemies for 1 second at the tip dealing physical damage to them (Scaling with 15% bonus attack damage). The entire area of the skillshot is then turned into worked ground for 1 - 10 minutes depending on Lenore's level.\r\n\r\n•_R - Gate of Noxtoraa:_ Lenore summons a massive, indestructible (For the purposes of Ornn's E) Darkstone gate for 5 seconds that acts as impenetrable terrain. Enemies on top of the gate are knocked aside and enemies around the immediate area of the gate (Including the ones knocked aside) are knocked up for 1 second then feared for 1.5 seconds. Any attempt to path through the gate will force a character to go through the garrison which slows enemies by 80% and speeds up allies by 20%.","replies":[]}
