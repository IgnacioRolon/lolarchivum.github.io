I haven't put any thought into what a Noxian jungler would look like, but I did put at least a little into some concepts that could be used to make an aggressive Noxian support champion. Right now the concept is very incomplete with missing abilities and abilities that don't make sense together (And may even need to be reworked completely), so I'll need feedback to polish this up as much as possible.\n\n\n**Design goals**\nOne of the more interesting roles I've seen in the Noxian empire is that of the warmason. Warmasons are charged, at least on paper, with engineering and constructing the darkstone roads that connect the various territories within the Noxian empire. Because of this, though, their job also extends to things like engineering other facilities like gates and garrisons in a distinct fashion that shows this territory is under Noxian rule (Important as Noxus would have to enforce cultural homogeneity across a plethora of diverse territories which would otherwise have nothing in common). I say this because this all sounds like the ideal background for someone from Noxus hoping to provide tactical support in the only way Noxus knows how: As aggressively as possible. While it would be ideal for this champion to be a vanguard like Leona, I wouldn't mind if she went in the direction of being a fighter like Riven. Unlike Riven, though, I would like it if she were explicitly built as a support. (If Pyke can be a support assassin then why can't there be a support fighter?)\n\n\n**Abilities (So far)**\n\n**_Passive: I haven't thought of one yet_**\n\n**_Q: Quarry Breaker_ -** [Champion name] leaps in place for 0.625 seconds (Same as Caitlyn's Q) and stuns any enemies hit in her immediate vicinity for 1.5 seconds dealing physical damage. Terrain around the impact becomes worked ground (Like Taliyah's Q) that lasts for 1 - 18 minutes depending on [Champion name]'s level. If Quarry Breaker hits an enemy champion or a patch of worked ground then half of its cooldown and mana cost is refunded.\n\n**_W: Darkstone Road -_** [Champion name] turns all worked ground within a large area (Enough to cover a lane widthwise) into darkstone roads that slow enemy champions by 50% and deal magic damage equal to that amount to the champion each second he or she is on the darkstone road. Darkstone roads last for 6 seconds.\n\n**_E: I haven't thought of one yet -_** I was thinking some kind of pull, but I don't want it to be as reliable as Blitzcrank or Thresh. Likewise I'm not sure how it'd work thematically with the character. If I want to go with the worked ground mechanic I'm also thinking it should leave behind a little more worked ground for consistency (Perhaps in a skillshot line).\n\n**_R: Gate of Noxtoraa -_** [Champion name] raises a massive, indestructible (For the purposes of Ornn) darkstone gate in target location for 5 seconds that acts as impassible terrain. Enemies in the immediate vicinity of the gate when it is raised are knocked up (And knocked back if they are standing where the gate is) for 1 second then feared by the gate for 1.5 seconds (Think Cho'Gath's Q, only it leaves a big ass wall behind).","replies":[{"poster":"WTBeGirl100EUhr","date":"2019-08-20T00:05:23.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with Q and W is that you'll fundamentally need to get worked ground _behind_ your opponent in order to aggress in the lane. Whilst this is ok when the lane is in an even state, as the lane will periodically bounce from one end to another and even creates synergy with some champions such as Sivir who have the ability to force these bouncing lane states, if you're being shoved in then you won't actually be able to do... anything. Also, she would be very easy to punish for preparing these areas in advance, as it is her main source of crowd control.\n\nAvoiding the re-use of phrases like \"worked ground\" is important for a finished product but is fine to ignore for conceptualisation. Rather than Taliyah who is weaving, working the stone (thus \"worked\" ground) something like \"broken earth\" or some such since this is a much more violent exchange.\n\nA pull seems to be appropriate for the champion in order to have a functioning kit. You would pull them, Q and then W. It's fairly linear, with the theoretical skill expression of pre-creating the patches from Q likely being lost due to the inaccessibilty. Perhaps, from a thematic standpoint she could rupture the ground at her feet, causing it to shoot up elsewhere. Think stomping on a seasaw. A fixed distance displace as such, similar to Morde's W and Pyke's Q would seem logical in that scenario?\n\nWhat is stopping this champion from going top lane instead of support? Her Q and W would likely have to have special interactions with minions to deny her of having any waveclear and there are plenty of top laners who exist with no wave clear that just build tiamat. Would the passive be something that requires a nearby ally to get full use out of? \n\nFrom a thematic perspective the darkstone roads are designed to be, well, roads. Why are people slowed for travelling on them? Given they are engineers and craftsmen, should they have some interaction with turrets such as perhaps being able to heal turrets or similar?","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-20T00:40:04.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Perhaps, from a thematic standpoint she could rupture the ground at her feet, causing it to shoot up elsewhere. Think stomping on a seasaw.\n\nWouldn't that just be a carbon copy of Taliyah's E, though?\n\n>What is stopping this champion from going top lane instead of support? \n\nHonestly I've been wondering the same thing for a while now and the only answer I can come up with is \"She has no wave clear\". That seems to be the main thing holding Pyke back at least.\n\n>Her Q and W would likely have to have special interactions with minions to deny her of having any waveclear\n\nThat's why I tried to word it so that champions specifically would be affected by it.\n\n>and there are plenty of top laners who exist with no wave clear that just build tiamat.\n\nTechnically the same thing is true of Pyke, but we don't see him top or mid anymore. I'll admit there could be more to it, but this is the reason I'm familiar with.\n\n>Would the passive be something that requires a nearby ally to get full use out of?\n\nIt'd be nice, but I can't think of anything that'd work.\n\n>From a thematic perspective the darkstone roads are designed to be, well, roads. Why are people slowed for travelling on them?\n\nBecause she's suppose to be closer to a vanguard in that she has no way to really help disengage. After all, Noxus doesn't look kindly on deserters.  This was just the only thing I could think of that stayed with the theme of a warmason.","replies":[{"poster":"WTBeGirl100EUhr","date":"2019-08-21T05:05:07.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's incredibly similar to taliyah's e which given there's already overlaps would probably be best avoided, true. \n\nI think Pyke top is probably better than people are giving it credit for. You rarely used E to waveclear unless your opponent was out of lane anyway.\n\n\n> Because she's suppose to be closer to a vanguard in that she has no way to really help disengage. After all, Noxus doesn't look kindly on deserters. This was just the only thing I could think of that stayed with the theme of a warmason.\n\nIt feels like she has more disengage than engage though. If your opponent tries to engage onto you, you can Q as they come into range and then pop the slow to walk away and they'd have to walk the full distance through the slow in order to reconnect with you. Whilst she would have pick-making potential with her pull, she can't start fights like a vanguard can by diving in. Vanguards typically have mobility of some form (If just at the level of Leona E, Maokai W).","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-22T17:48:36.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something I've been thinking with her E is more to make it like Ivern's knockup on Daisy where she shoots a skillshot that microstuns people in the way and knocks people up at the end all while leaving behind more worked ground.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
