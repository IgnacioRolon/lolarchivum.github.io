Don't get me wrong. I'm not asking Riot to revert it back to the old Nevermove or anything, but I've been wondering if it would be too broken to make it a doubletap spell so you have a better chance of nabbing the target you actually wanted to get with it.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-08-10T17:36:07.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would trade the AoE grab off of minions for the ability to reactivate it and cause the claw to come back early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trundle Bundle","date":"2019-08-10T17:24:22.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They won't do it, especially not after the most recent changes. I agree that it's awkward, and it doesn't help that all of his abilities aside from his Q that feel like they summons a crossing guard to escort your enemies away from it. \n\nBut the issue is you get to a point where Swain's too good at being a lane bully to melees, and they have to balance him around only that and he becomes utterly unplayable against range. His Q already has a disproportionately high access to melee champs, and now minions aren't proper cover against it. Letting E be double tapped leads to Swain excelling a lot more at close range fighting, where people won't have any real agency to avoid it. He simply has to let a melee reach the border of the his E range, then advance towards them. You end up with a degenerate playstyle where on a melee you either never enter into Swain's E range or pretty much guarantee taking all 3 spells/ autos while he has time to back off. Add in getting 2 soul frags for that for healing and mana, and a nice splash of electrocute, and things will have to start getting pruned back.\n\nThey've side into having Swain be the one that has to maintain distance early, which is easier for him to do and lets him not be so specialized into fighting melee that he has to be ass at everything else","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrosan","date":"2019-08-10T14:23:23.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be a buff over a QOL change\nYou get so much from the ability as long as you use it right and it wouldn't make sense to change it as it is because it's in line with his E\n\nE > W verifies that it lands if they don't dash/flash/ms boost away and even with the MS boost it's likely to hit still\n\nW has a large range and can practically be used as a temporary damaging blue trinket\n\nIt's quite valuable as an ability, if you'd want this change to go through you'd have to remove it giving soul fragments, even if it's fully charged","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-10T14:38:23.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait what?
