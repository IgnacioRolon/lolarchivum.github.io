It's Genius!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For all the people who complain about too many people mistaking LoL for CoD, the solution is ingeniously simple.\r\n\r\nJust make a Team Deathmatch mode!\r\n\r\nThat way, the people who just want to kill stuff can kill stuff, and the people who want to play an objective-based mode can play an objective-based mode.\r\n\r\nShoot, while we're ripping game ideas from CoD, why not throw in a Domination mode?  Teams fight to control 3 bases on the map.  Controlling a base gives you points-per-second.  The first team to reach a pre-determined score (I dunno...150 points?) wins.\r\n\r\nHell, even better.  Free-For-All.  Legit 1 v 9.  10 players enter, only one can win.\r\n\r\nLet's just go all the way with it and introduce a Kill-Streak system (to those modes).  \r\n3 kills in a row?  You can see the minimap.\r\n5 kills in a row?  You get a Cloud Dragon buff.\r\n7 kills in a row?  Infernal Dragon buff.\r\n25 kills in a row?  Umm...what's the equivalent of a nuke in this game?  Baron + Elder Dragon buff and a Karthus ulti?\r\n\r\nCreate a game mode that's like a fly zapper, luring players that don't want to cooperate away from cooperation heavy game modes.\r\n\r\nJust spit-balling here.","replies":[{"poster":"NY64","date":"2020-02-18T19:30:02.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest the team death match and kill streaks sounds cool as a quick alternative mode but the kill streaks should be things with low power, like getting red or blue buff, but you lose them upon death or after staying alive long enough.","replies":[{"poster":"TIKrunk","date":"2020-02-18T20:19:45.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely.  Steal and mimic as much as possible.  UAVs don't stay in the sky forever in CoD, so whatever buff you gain shouldn't last forever either.  Some are on timers, and others could have \"ammo\", and once it's depleted the streak is over.  And, just like CoD, the player chooses when to trigger a kill streak once it's obtained.\n\nThe power of whatever buff would have to increase with kills though, just like CoD.  Hell, we can even go the \"Custom Kill Streak\" route.  People get to pick 3 Kill Streak rewards to activate, should they reach the required kills.  I'd anticipate, just like CoD, you'd have people that spam low level Kill Streaks and people that try to stack up for the more powerful streaks.\n\nWe could even try to make it noob friendly and have different streak paths.  An Assault path and a Support path.  Assault path = only consecutive kills count towards a streak reward / deaths reset your kill streak.  Support path = all accumulated kills count towards your streak rewards / deaths do not reset your kill streak.  I think it goes without saying the Assault path would have the most damaging rewards, while support would have weaker rewards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2020-02-18T19:03:32.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://blog.battlerite.com/the-future-of-battlerite/","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2020-02-18T17:28:48.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FFA alienates most of the roster because of how much many champions rely on teammates. It just doesn't translate well to league which has balanced around having 4 teammates to back you up.\n\nTDM has a better chance but the whole killstreak reward system adds even more unnecessary snowball to an already snowball heavy game. Call of duty can function with it since individual skill makes a large difference in each individual encounter (and even in CoD the snowball can get out of control thanks to kill streaks).","replies":[{"poster":"TIKrunk","date":"2020-02-18T17:56:16.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**_FFA alienates most of the roster because of how much many champions rely on teammates.

Really drive the point home that League is a team-based game, and no one character is going to be able to win a game by themselves (nor should they be able to, honestly).  For those who wish to test that theory, hop into FFA and win this 1 v 9 with a Yummi.  Really shove it down people's throats, hand touching lower intestines style.\n\nAs far as snowballing...I don't really care, especially in a game mode like TDM or FFA.  People still complain games last too long, so give 'em a mode that caps at 10 minutes tops.  If someone avalanches their way to a 5 minute victory...hey...at least it only took 5 minutes to have your ass handed to you, rather than having to suffer through 40 minutes of the enemy team wearing your cheeks like a pair of shoes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MetaGeek","date":"2020-02-18T17:29:12.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need more modes in general","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2020-02-18T22:04:36.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They already made a death match game mode.

They don't want a slow game and they also don't want to wait for a \"fast\" game.  The problem being that (in the past) most of the people that came to league were looking for a team RTS style game with the understanding and expectation that it would be a slower game than FPS style games.  The fast play shitters don't want to spend 40 mins playing a game, and they don't want to wait 5 minutes in a lobby since the majority of people that play League want to play slower SR.  So they ignore the faster game modes that were made for them and instead bitch and moan to Riot about how slow the core game mode is.  This is why Riot is stupid for catering the game to those people.","replies":[{"poster":"TIKrunk","date":"2020-02-18T21:18:10.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have some kind of point there, but think about this.\n\nAll of those game modes kind of cut to the core of a specific form of toxic player.  The loud-mouth that says he can 1 v 9?  Well...here's your chance to prove it.  That know-it-all that _says_ a character is so strong they can 1 v 9?  Now they can see how wrong that assessment is.\n\nThe people who don't want to deal with towers and other objectives?  Now the game can specifically be won through getting the most kills.  No need for Nexii, turrets, minions, or dragons to get involved.\n\nAnd, hopefully, all those \"shitters\" get attracted to the game mode that best strokes their ego.","replies":[{"poster":"HeeroTX","date":"2020-02-18T21:37:24.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you in principle.

There was zero snowballing, you reached full build by 15 minutes, and pretty much every champion was viable. There were no roles and/or rigid team compositions like on SR, you could just pick who you wanted for the most part.\n\nUnfortunately, most players were too ignorant of the benefits to having game modes like these, so they let Riot remove both. Now we have nothing, so great job I guess. All of those \"resources\" Riot promised they would use to improve the client, SR and the RGM really paid off.\n\nThis is the future the majority of the playerbase didn't care about becoming a reality.\n\nYou'll have to excuse my salt, as I played Dominion, Ascension and Twisted Treeline exclusively before their removal. At least regarding the first two, they offered much more flexible, faster gameplay than SR will ever have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lunarcana","date":"2020-02-18T18:27:12.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds fun tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2020-02-18T18:04:13.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blood Moon is kind of that game mode, but a FFA version of it would be a bit cooler.  \nMaybe reduce it to 4 players, with the Alcoves being the other Nexii. \nFirst to 10 kills wins, dying 5 times is instant defeat as is dying to fountain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2020-02-18T17:22:48.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ascension is close enough","replies":[]}]}
