I don't find that acceptable having to pay 20 euros for a small change, some of us are moving families (also known as expats) and we travel to various countries every year or few months. So having to create new accounts to play league and having to level up again is a pain in the (blank). I just hope you can pass this to your superiors and make league of legends more of a connected game where we can move to a new country or go on holidays and still be able to play league no matter the region you're in. Right now I'm stuck and I'm not motivated to play league with a level 8 account whereas I'm Silver in my Oceania account (which was in Euw a while back).
