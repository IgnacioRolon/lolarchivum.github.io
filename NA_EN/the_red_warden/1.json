{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-11-04T07:42:20.846+0000","title":"Summoner's rift Snail (open RP)","subforum":"Roleplaying","up_votes":14,"down_votes":12,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/3czyRa4.jpg\nI am **the** snail found on Summoner&#039;s rift, always present though typically unnoticed. I have witnesses more battles in my grassy  domain than their zed&#039;s failing to be Faker. I have seen more noobs die to Krugs, than people have spammed &quot;Draaaaaaaaaavvvvvvvvven&quot; in chat. I am the watchful observer, who is tasked with summoning the many so called monsters, that populate this forest. So for this week I will inform you of anything you want to know about my life and experience as the guardian spirit of what players call the &quot;jungle&quot;. \n\nPlease be forgiving of any typos as my lack of appendages requires the use of Blue side golem to record my thoughts and responses. His fingers are a bit large for the type writer, so mistakes are common for him.\n\n(I don&#039;t believe a snurf account is necessary for the snail, as he has no functional presence in the game. His POV of the game is also easy to utilize since there is no specific details about it. If this works out, I will do other humorous takes on the wildlife of the maps; such as the dick that has a 1:10 spawn rate, or the dog-cow-bear-furry thing owned by the one shopkeeper)\n\nAny question must be addressed to **Rosco, the Snail**, unless it is to be taken as an insult to his position in the Rift&#039;s chain of command.","replies":[]}
