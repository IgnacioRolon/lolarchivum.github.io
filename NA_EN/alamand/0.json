As of today signups are still down.\nAccording to a riot employee, the reasoning was that the signup sight needed to be remade according to a riot employee and they would put it' back up when it's finished. \n\nIm just wondering if there is an update on when the pbe signups are coming back or at least the current status of the fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-06T17:29:01.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are correct! The PBE signups are still down at this time for maintenance and we don't have an estimated time on when they will return. Your best bet is to just check back now and again :)","replies":[{"poster":"Alamand","date":"2017-06-06T22:20:07.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll make sure to do that.
