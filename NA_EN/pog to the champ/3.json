And, especially when your brother buys 3 new games and decides to let each one download while he's playing the other ones, causing you to have a constant 250ms+ whenever you're playing, you need to do something about it.\nOf course, I can just use Mac Filtering to completely block him from using any bandwidth at all, but he'd realize I did something. I've done it in the past, but it's not a reliable solution.\nSo I decided to use QoS (Quality of Service). After reading about it, I found out it's a method which pretty much lets you manage the bandwidth usage of specific computers or activities.\nI replaced my old router with a TPLINK one, where I found the option \"Bandwidth Control\".\nI went to \"DHCP server >> Address Reservation\" and reserved an IP address for my MAC address.\nThen, I enabled Bandwidth Control and made a rule. I entered the IP address I reserved before (the one my machine had as well) and added ports from 1 to 60.000 (not quite sure about this one).\nI left the protocol to \"ALL\" and set the priority to 8, the highest. Finally, I set the minimum upstream to 300 Kbps and the maximum to 789 (maximum I can ever get). In the same way, I set the minimum downstream to 1500 Kbps and the maximum to 7070 (also the most I can ever get).\nEven the minimums should be enough for me to never lag.\nI joined a custom game and my lag was ~90, which is what I normally get (sad). Then, I simply loaded a YouTube video on my phone, which was connected to the same network, and BOOM. It rose to 300.\nI increased the minimum upstream and downstream to the maximum possible (789 - 7070) and I was still getting lag when I loaded videos on my phone.\nWhat am I not doing correctly?\n\nAdditional information: [this](http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5814087508) is my speedtest.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T02:18:48.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't personally messed around too much with QoS, but with previous network deployments I've done for others, I've added each device in the home to the QoS list and assigned them unique operating parameters. You may want to give this a go, that way you can assign your phone and your brother's devices specific parameters that may end up resolving your issue.\n\nIf this doesn't solve the issue, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Pog to the Champ","date":"2016-11-21T11:30:58.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you SO much for this answer.\nThis solved everything. I assigned a maximum downstream speed to my phone and to my brother's computer.\nBefore I did so, I checked the network status. My brother was receiving and sending an incredible amount of packets for some reason, even though his computer was still at the login screen (couldn't open it as I didn't know the password).\nAfter assigning specific parameters to my phone and to his computer, my lag was stable and did not surpass 100 even when I was loading videos on YouTube using my phone.\nI still have not seen the extent to which this will help, as I have to do some real-time testing (e.g. in a non-custom game, while my brother is downloading things or while multiple devices are online), but I can say that after I set rules for most of the usual devices on the network, I will certainly be able to enjoy lag-free gameplay.\nAgain, thanks a lot!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T21:53:33.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so glad to hear this advice was able to result in a more stable bandwidth environment!\n\nIf you have any other questions or issues you'd like help with, hit me up anytime. ^.^\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
