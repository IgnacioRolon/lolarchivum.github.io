I just closed it because the client worked normally. Today the chat wasn't available. I couldn't send a message and none of the names appeared, just the clubs.\nI started a game. It got stuck at \"Connecting...\" in champion select chat. The game then, instead of the post-game screen, gave me a black screen. I couldn't ALT + TAB out, CTRL + ALT + DEL did nothing, etc. I restarted. I reconnected and got a black screen again, this time followed by a League logo. ALT + TABbing worked so I got back to the desktop, where I saw a DirectX11 error together with a \"Failed to connect to server\" error. I followed the instructions of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jafsIpB2IEA) video and deleted some files. Then I repaired the client. It took a while. I launched the game again. This time, I'm stuck at the reconnect screen. It will not immediatelly reconnect me, just like the new client usually does. Instead, I get a useless \"Reconnect\" button that does absolutely nothing.\nRiot fix your game please or give me some suggestions about what to do. The game worked perfectly fine until yesterday, if you exclude the bug report entry I got even though everything seemed to be working fine.\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-02T21:14:53.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The window you're getting is a bugsplat, which happens if you're having driver or hardware failure, or your game files become corrupt.
