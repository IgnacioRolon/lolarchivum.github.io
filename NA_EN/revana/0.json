I&#039;m not a pro. I&#039;m not the best at any champ. I play URF and ARAM mostly JUST to avoid getting yelled at and insulted for making mistakes. But I still get bent over all the time FOR PLAYING A RANDOM CHAMP AND NOT BEING AN ACE.\r\n\r\nAnd to make matters worse, I BLOCK them, and then get matched with them.... AND THEN CAN STILL SEE THEIR ABUSIVE CHAT.  What the fuck is up with that??? Then even if I mute them again, once the match is over, I CAN SEE THEIR ASSHOLE CHAT AGAIN.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m really fucking mad. And yes I&#039;M YELLING. I can honestly say I NEVER, EVER berate or belittle anyone for sucking in a match. EVER. Yet here I am being a fucking punching bag ALL THE TIME WITH NO WAY TO MAKE IT STOP.\r\n\r\nFUCK YOU RIOT. Fuck you for making me endure their cesspool of shit to play your game, which I happen to enjoy if I can actually play the fucking thing without having to interact with your toxic-as-shit playerbase WHICH YOU DO NOTHING ABOUT. FUCK. YOU.","replies":[{"poster":"Upgrades","date":"2019-02-12T00:27:39.267+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just calm down dude.

The chances of getting matched with the same person twice on NA is incredibly tiny, outside treeline.\n\nIf you want to ensure you wont see someone again, just wait a minute before you re-queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-02-12T01:08:02.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is possible for ARAM and ARURF if you jump right back in queue at the same time.
