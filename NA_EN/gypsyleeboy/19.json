He listen&#039;s to suggestions and even let&#039;s people know if he will suggest it to the team. He&#039;s awesome and isn&#039;t incognito like riot&#039;s employee&#039;s.. He&#039;s the coolest guy ever because of this. (and he plays league too)\n\nI will say though, sure.. he&#039;s the only one at nexon that talks to the players, (The others are quiet) but wouldn&#039;t it be great if we had at least ONE riot employee that talks with people on the boards and reddit, takes good suggestions, and isn&#039;t a here and there person!!? It&#039;s rare to see riot post on the boards..\n\nDammit, I&#039;ll take the job to be an active &quot;Listener&quot; at riot.. You guys all have great idea&#039;s i see every day here and they go unrecognized, or at least none are commented on, like &quot;Good idea I&#039;ll talk to the development team about something like this. thanks&quot; NEVER. or even a simple &quot;This is not something we are looking to change any time soon, but I&#039;ll keep it in mind! we may do something in the future, but no promises.&quot;\n\nGreat suggestions go unnoticed and it makes ~~me~~ US mad.\nRiot, please.","replies":[]}
