YOU MADE HIM QUIT RITO. YOU&#039;RE LUCKY PEOPLE LIKE THIS GAME A LOT, CAUSE.. He could have taken all your fan base with him..\n\nNow, here&#039;s a few of the best raps I&#039;ve ever heard. These are what made me a fan, then i watched his other videos and i instantly knew that he is my FAVORITE youtuber/streamer of ANY game, not just league.. He is by far the funniest person on youtube (Pewdiepie sucks compared to this guy, and, well, most people cause he&#039;s not that funny.)\n**Warning: Lots of Curse Words, (which is my favorite part)**\n----------------------------------------------\n**DuNKeY IS KiNG**\n\n\nlisten to this till the end, trust me! it changes and the second half amazing\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyWwRivr1wE\n\nPart 2\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYHh6he3Jig\n\nWatch dunkey&#039;s league videos, it&#039;s time well spent cause there more you watch, you&#039;ll never get enough of him. He still does other game videos now but has quit league due to F@#$!#G RIOT.. we miss ur leag vidoz duknie.\n\nso many dunkey haters for no reason. If you don't care then dont bother. League isn't fun with the trolls and it consists of 98% toxic players. So, to be 'toxic' about how dunkey is 'toxic', thats like saying you hate pie, while eating pie. No one cares that you don't like dunkey.. Damn, last year the forum loved him, now just the trolls are here hating.","replies":[]}
