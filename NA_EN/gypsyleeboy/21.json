We had so much team work and we should have won.\nJust cause they had a yasuo, we lose every team fight regardless if their team had 25% hp, cause yasuo would ult and life steal any damage we dealt, and the kicker is that i was playing darius and totally crapped on him in laning phase. I couldn&#039;t even touch him mid game cause i&#039;d just get shit on as soon as i got close. If we managed to kill him, it was already to late cause now the other 4 people are just gonna clean up.\n\nYasuo shouldn&#039;t deal 2300 damage in a second, something must be changed..\n\nDon't even get me started on xin, jax, and every other champion that is banned 80% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Powderkegg","date":"2016-03-12T16:00:28.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had 50 armor and you're complaining that a yasuo wrecked you, why did you even make this post!?","replies":[]},{"poster":"baby reksai","date":"2016-03-12T10:16:12.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, you bought zero armor... So obviously he's gonna wreck you. Plate is so much more offensive than defensive it's silly people think its a defensive item. Besides, unless you landed first, you could never get your full plate stack on him. Meaning you had no chance of shutting him down. Perhaps randuin woulda helped. Idk just a thought.

Looking at match you guys were even in kills in early game. Still that doesn't mean he should be able to 5v1 you guys but to put it bluntly good yasuo players are rewarded with extremely good outcomes. Cuz yasuo is not an easy champ to play well. Its just part of the game, some champs are put over the top because they're difficult to play.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chronic Diablo","date":"2016-03-12T09:56:14.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well death recap is broken. and as darius you should just w-q-e-aa-ult or q-w-e-aa-ult or aa-q-w-aa-ult idk should be easy","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2016-03-12T10:02:02.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you cant know the situation.\nI normally w, a, w, aa, ult or for using w to animation cancel, may start with e, q? aa, w, aa, q?, e?, ult.. ? = if not on CD\n\nIt made no difference when his attacks were just life stealing every attack i did.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chronic Diablo","date":"2016-03-12T09:50:08.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you did then he wouldn't be doing 2300 damage to you. but you're upset i understand. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2016-03-12T09:52:21.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in the time it takes for him to e, q, ult. he was dealing at the least 1500 damage, and at one point i read he did 2280 damage in 1.3 seconds or so","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chronic Diablo","date":"2016-03-12T09:43:20.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you build armor. that wasn't a question because i know you didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2016-03-12T09:48:08.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"of course i did, I'm not retarded.
