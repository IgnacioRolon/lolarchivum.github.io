I can not play corki effectively maybe because I&#039;m a noob, or just because he just doesn&#039;t do enough. his ADC role has never actually made me an AD Carry of the team, but more of the &quot;AD Carried&quot;\n\nI know he&#039;s pretty meta right now but i seen he recently got a pbe nerf to his Q (BUT that&#039;s not what this is about)\n\n&quot;Actual reason for this thread&quot;\n\nHis E - Gatling gun his so annoying to me. I would love if they could make it so if you HOLD &#039;E&#039; you can hold the direction of the spray&#039;n&#039;pray.\nThere&#039;s so many times i feel awkward using this skill, and feel like i need to stand still when i do so. However this can be fixed by making it kind of like lucians ultimate where you can walk in any direction and it locks in the direction you used the skill in, BUT toggle-able by holding the E button down, or letting go to just spray wherever you&#039;re looking at (the way it is now).\n\n*Insert salt below*\nThis is just IMO. Not an actual suggestion, just, &quot;it&#039;d be nice&quot; Perhaps if he always had this, it wouldn't seem like such a big deal, versus if people (me) asked for this.\n\nAmi stoopid? am i rite? idk, watchu tink?\n\nEdit: I didn't expect people to actually agree with me but here it goes.\n\nE - Corki activates his gatling gun and sprays bullets in a cone in front of him for 4 seconds, dealing equal parts physical and magic damage every half-second and reducing his targets' armor and magic resistance each time, stacking up to 8 times. ã€Œ MIXED DAMAGE PER HALF SECOND: 10 / 16 / 22 / 28 / 34 (+ *~~20%~~* 18%? bonus AD) \n\n*Gatling gun* (~~does not hinder Corki's actions, and its cone remains in front of him as he moves. ~~) Skill can be toggled two times once activated; After activated, press the key again to lock in direction, and again to return to shooting in front of him as he moves. (Once pressed twice after activation, it cannot be pressed again for the duration of the skill.)\n","replies":[{"poster":"KyroRayne","date":"2016-02-03T16:34:59.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a good point. That ability has always felt awkward for me when I'd every play Corki. I think making it a point-in-direction-to-used-for-the-duration is a good idea. His numbers on it might need to be changed a little to account for the better control, but also might not need to be considering it's short range as well as being locked into a single direction.\n\nThe downside to your change would be that since you're locked into a single direction, you won't be able to use any abilities or AA in any direction but in the direction you're locked into facing.","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2016-02-04T02:42:50.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i thought about it, and came up with something, checkout my edit to the post","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"summonermhrysos","date":"2016-02-03T20:48:55.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who loves to play {{champion:42}} and play him every time I get the adc role,I can agree that his gatling gun has always been the least usefull part of kit.It is always awkward and difficult to get the full armor and magic resist shred out of it in the middle of a fight,especialy in a duel.But since it actually became more usefull with the marksman update(now it shreds mr too) and the changes to the masteries(it can proc thunderlords decree) I believe that it is now at a good/better state(although it could be slightly reworked again to be more accurate).Besides,the image that the lol community has about him right now is actually a little bit fuzzy(there are some threads that state that he is broken,but the comments are not enough to prove if the majority of the community thinks of him like that) so let's leave it be like that for now up until things get more clear.","replies":[]}]}
