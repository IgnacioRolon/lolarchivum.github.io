I bet most of those kids on the wall lived in the slums of Zaun like Janna did, except Janna got away before Zaun consumed her, Jinx got crazy cause of it, and Ekko is fighting against it.","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2015-05-11T22:10:52.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very well thought theory","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-05-11T02:00:12.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"hes fighting augmented singed i think","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-05-11T07:31:59.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah,that big guy is most likely just some random enemy.Although I originally thought ekko is from piltover,but if he has guys like that one running around then he might actually live in zaun(his hair would also fit more into zaun)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2015-05-11T05:18:28.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soon is really overstating it.
