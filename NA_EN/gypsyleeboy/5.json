He's by far one of the most annoying.

A champ with that much zone control doesn't need a 273% AP, long-range nuke on his ult (w).\n\nThe counterplay *should* be to engage on him after he misses a w or e, because his cooldowns are LONG (like lux), but you also need to take down his turrets, which means you also need to run down his supply of turrets first, which gives him time to get off another W-E rotation and force you back.\n\nThat is to say, azir is what heimer should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2014-08-28T19:16:02.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, he definitely needs some more rounding out. 3 turrets, super strong poke, and long range. with some knowledge you can not be killed unless targeted hard by the enemy team. 1v2's are even easy for a heimer. i think 1v3 is where he falls off but of course, unless fed. Just zhonya and ult. Watch the triple kills and possible pentas arise.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptainWednesday","date":"2014-08-27T19:51:22.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has been confirmed that Ohmwrecker's active will work against Azir's Sun Discs, but that it has not been hooked up yet.
