Take Yasuo for example, no one really knew how to use his windwall as they do now back during his release (among other things), and a good Yasuo player that early was rare enough to make him seem UP.  Espeically when they bring in a new mechanic as Gnar, Yas and now Azir bring. \n\nAzir may not seem to good on paper, but once his passive is utilized to full effect (I give it...2 months) I think we'll have several people calling for nerfs on him. Personally I actually see his power level acting like Sona's, where in solo que it's not amazing, but can be abused to hell with a full, communicating, competent team.","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2014-09-11T06:52:35.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're totally missing that \"Just right\" or the \"Gspot\" on characters. They can do as much as expanding their PBE to more players to get more of a response and maybe hearing it from more people will ensure what needs to be done.\n\ni get what you mean about yas and such but player skill has nothing to do with what i am talking about.\nYou can tell when someone is straight out bad with a champion, and when a champion is just not up to par. I see azir's utility but he packs no punch and he's gonna get smashed by almost every popular mid right now. and they didn't even give a choice of ability path to pick through, there is no \"I'm up against X champion and a should max my Q first or max my E first. Its gonna be the same path no matter what. He also don't have any skills that have a zing, no good damaging skills, terrible gapcloser, does crap unless playing with bots type of skills.\nOf course they wont change his kit, but at least make what he has better for what they do. Make his gap closer better! make it knock up and allow you to pass THROUGH them or something.. i mean.. it's just annoying when 98% of league games are gonna have an Azir, and it's gonna be a 4v4 or possibly 4v5 because this champion is just so useless, besides azirs ultimate which is only sometimes gonna be useful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-09-11T06:27:29.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as a new champ being weak sucks, seeming him getting nerfed in 1-2 weeks because he's OP sucks more.  Sadly not all champs are released in a vekkers state.","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2014-09-11T06:34:29.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See the thing is that they're trying top put them in the right place, but i mean azir's kit just doesn't have enough damage to be useful. why not realize this and just slightly compensate with something. He brings some utility with the ultimate but his skills are just straight out bad and weak.","replies":[]}]}]}
