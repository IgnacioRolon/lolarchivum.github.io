I've tried using the Hextech Repair tool and uploading my logs to the tool on the support website, but to no avail. My friends see that I am logged in but I can't access the game. Tried flushing my dns. Leaving the client to load doesn't do anything - I left it open overnight but nothing changed. Also tried reinstalling and restarting PC. Any advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-20T22:14:55.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network might be having a hard time getting connected with our servers and just isn't able to get loaded into the client. You mentioned flushing your DNS, but let's make sure to check up on the rest of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) settings as well. Hit me back up if that doesn't help much, and we might need to look at repairing some of the game files.","replies":[]}]}
