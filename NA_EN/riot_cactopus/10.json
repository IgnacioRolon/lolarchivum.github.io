If you applied to the alpha, you should now have access, no matter what region you're from. The only exception should be if you applied in one region and are trying to log into another region. Let us know in the comments if any of you are still having trouble!\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nWaddup! I want to give y&#039;all a quick update/explainer on some issues we ran into after publishing [this article about the League client update alpha](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update/article/f65bf0d3-28ec-4601-9b0b-26260f0c4761). In the post, we said we&#039;d turned off signups for the alpha and granted access to the alpha for *everyone* who&#039;d signed up. Only problem: we weren&#039;t actually able to grant access to everyone. WHOOPS. \n\n\nBut, luckily, we&#039;ve worked out a solution. The good people on the client update team worked overtime this past weekend to make sure that everyone who applied for the alpha will get access, and that&#039;s now in progress. The process could take a few more days (or longer) because we have to individually approve batches of players from each region. I&#039;ll edit this post to keep you all updated on our progress. In the meantime, keep an eye out for the acceptance notification email and file a player support ticket if you&#039;ve been accepted but are still having trouble logging into the alpha!\n\n\nPlayers in OCE should already have access, with other regions coming immediately after&mdash;this is because we&#039;re also launching the client open beta in OCE slightly before other regions so we can properly stress-test it. Basically, we&#039;re prioritizing regions where players will have less time to enjoy the alpha before we begin rollout of the beta. \n\n\nI wrote the original article that said we&#039;d *already* granted access to all applicants, so this is ultimately my fault. As a form of self-punishment for the mistake, I will play one Intermediate Co-Op vs. AI game as Yasuo top and post the results in this thread (I have never played as Yasuo before lmao).\n\nUPDATE #1 - 11/7 at 2:31pm PST\n\nWe've successfully granted access to all applicants from OCE, LAN, EUNE, and BR.  If you applied for the alpha and you're from that region but you still don't have access, file a player support ticket! We'll be able to check your application. If you didn't apply, you'll still have to wait for open beta, obviously. Some players in EUW and NA are getting in now. After that we're focusing down RU, TR, JP, and LAS. \n\nUPDATE #2 - 11/7 at 8:18pm PST\n\nAll of NA and LAS has been completed, meaning that every applicant in those regions should have access to the alpha. Some TR and EUW players have gotten in, and we're working on getting the rest. After that, only JP and RU remains!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cactopus","date":"2016-11-07T19:42:30.032+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played it... dear god that was boring.
