Or it was the time where I accidentally spawned way too many Skaarls, and yes, they all run back to Kled as a horde. \n\n> 3: Kled's kit, aside from is passive. Is one of the simplest you guys have made in a while. What are your feelings about this, and was there anything crazier tried in development.\n\nSince the champ had a complicated passive that changed his form and involved risk taking, we wanted to keep complexity low elsewhere on the kit\n\n> 4: I have been dying to know, for his ult. Why does Skarrl roll into a ball, and not simply charge. It just feels off to me.\n\nAs far as I know, we have too many running / charging at'em animations. We needed something more HAM-burgers. Something more recognizable, and through the magic of mushroom juice and our talented animators, we got the animation we have now.\n\n> 5: I can't really figure why he is a manaless champion. It seems like mana would work just fine for his kit. Was it just to weaken things like iceborn on him?\n\nBars. Too many Bars. A Skaarl HP Bar, a Courage bar, Kled HP Bar and Mana bar was way too many things for Kled to track.
