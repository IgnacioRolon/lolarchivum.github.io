His name is Scarra.  So for two straight seasons I spammed {{champion:55}}.  Sadly, as tanks got stronger, my kitty cat {{champion:55}} started to fail me...Fast forward to S5.  I'm playing {{champion:84}}.  This is the day i learn that one person shouldn't take all the kills.  I go 50/10/8 and we lost the game.  Because of my tenth death.  But I kept spamming {{champion:84}} , and essentially spinning my wheels in ranked.  I would never really start \"maining\" another role, but between all the changes and the \"noob champ\" insults, I was getting frustrated and therefore starting to get extremely toxic.\n    Fast forward to my 12-draft-win ban from ranked and my 48-game chat restriction for toxicity.  I spammed ARAMs to get off chat restriction, and started chipping away at that draft ban slowly.  During that time, the greatest events of my League career happened to me.  I'd been looking for someone to replace {{champion:84}}  and {{champion:55}} .  SO...on this one particular day of continued ARAM spamming, i get this weird champ I hadn't seen in like two years played by anyone in games I was in.  I'm like...ok...great. Something I have no clue what the hell to do with.  And then I proceeded to have possibly my most fun ARAM ever.  More fun even than my {{champion:55}} guaranteed pentakill games.  And I learned too that one does not simply Leeroy Jenkins and expect to win.  Chat restriction, even more than being a punishment for toxicity, frustrated the hell out of me because now, when I NEEDED to communicate with teammates, I couldn't.  Same as being muted, I suppose.\n  So lesson learned.  Only communicate when you need to unless you're saying something funny to lighten the mood.  (Like telling the _Toxic_ player on the team to stop being such a Britney Spears.)  Or saying something entirely random to get people's minds off who fed who and make them be like \"lolwtf\", and then just go back to playing.  Ex.  Rainbow wombats are fighting a civil war over a golden cockroach leg on Pluto.  Or, telling a joke to lighten the mood.  \"Hey, you know blind monks have stopped buying houses.  They prefer Lee Sin their property.  I know you're over there saying Irelia wish the bad league puns would stop but they won't beKha'zix too fun to make them and I got a Zilean more.\"\n\n\nFast forward more.  Back to ranked.  Armed with my new champion, I had this weird feeling like this was my season to get out of B5.\nAnd soon enough, I won promos and moved up to B4.\n\nTell me I play noob champs now, fools.\n\n{{champion:34}} \n\n(http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1942285692/202989558)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loggerten","date":"2015-08-15T01:41:58.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i go to a high school school that is different than most \n(no i'm not \"Special\") (OK maybe a little) but, that really isn't the point.
