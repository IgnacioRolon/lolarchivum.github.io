We&#039;ve since seen tons of questions about how we&#039;ll transition to the new system, as well as what players should do about purchasing runes now. We&#039;re still working on the first question, but let&#039;s talk about the second.\r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s our plan: when preseason arrives we&#039;ll refund all the IP you&#039;ve spent on runes since May 30th, 2017 (the date we published the Riot Pls video linked above). This deal is effective now, so if you&#039;ve got the IP for some runes you want, go ahead and grab &#039;em! We&#039;ll refund you later. We were originally going to roll these changes out with our bigger announcement in September, but we wanted to put this out there now since many of you have been asking about rune prices. \r\n\r\nAt some point before the transition to the new runes system we&#039;ll also drastically reduce the prices of all runes. We won&#039;t refund rune purchases made after that point.\r\n\r\nBut what about rune pages, you ask? The plan is for your rune pages to carry over into the new runes system, so prices on rune pages aren&#039;t being changed and they won&#039;t be refunded. The difference is you&#039;ll be able to edit them in champ select. \r\n\r\nLet us know if you&#039;ve got any questions and we&#039;ll be happy to answer in the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"UOL LagsAlot","date":"2017-07-20T17:55:31.335+0000","up_votes":115,"down_votes":8,"body":"So, you said that you want to keep multiple rune pages.

That way I can just change like a few runes on one of my preset pages and then have time to grab a beer or whatever.

If that hadn't been an option I would have no qualms about the current plan for pages.  However, I would never in a million years spend money on these 'new' Rune Pages.  Because they're not really Rune Pages as they exist now, they're Mastery Pages.  There is a reason that Mastery Pages are free, being editable in Champ Select makes putting them behind a paywall purely a bad user experience since all it does is limit convenience.  With non editable Rune Pages, that's not the case.  You go into a game and have to select from predetermined (by you) load outs whichever page is best for the current game.  More options there isn't just paying for convenience, it's paying for potential competitive advantage.  Changing the ecosystem from static to editable in champ select feels like a bait and switch.  So while I agree that a static page doesn't make sense for Runes Reforged, it also doesn't feel good to say, \"I spent money on a static system to increase my options.  Now that the system is dynamic I have no use for those options and my money evaporated.\"  So if we could get the option to refund our RP purchased rune pages at the very least it would feel much less bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"r xy","date":"2017-07-20T20:52:30.481+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aside from the fact, that i dont like the fact that none of my runepages will get refunded, this is going to cause a really backwards distribution of runepages: the people that are very familiar with league and thus probably dont need a lot of pages will have a lot of them, while new players, that tend to netdeck pages and as such need a lot of them will have very few.

Freeing up rune IP (in the absence of any other changes) would let players buy a bunch of champions and spend less RP overall.\n\nNow we *are* making some other changes to the system, but overall, Riot is losing money on this deal. Potentially a lot of money. This was something we had to talk about a lot internally, but everyone was ultimately behind the decision, all the way to Tryndamere and Ryze. I don't want to make too big of a deal out of this, but if we seem cautious with some of our decisions here, this is part of the reason why. (Another big one obviously is that we are taking a gamble by overhauling such a core part of the game for something that we believe will be better.)\n\nWe are making the new runes free because we believe 1) That it's the right thing to do for League and for League players, and 2) Our business model has always been to make a fun game that players want to keep coming back to year after year.

If I could, I would have made a custom rune page for every matchup during champ select, just like masteries. I would have never wasted my ip on rune pages.\n\nIf the new system lets you edit in champ select, multiple pages are pointless, and I'd like a refund.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kumungu Affair","date":"2017-07-20T18:42:17.643+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"So what about those of us that spend RP on rune page bundles, will there be any sort of compensation for that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghostcrawler","date":"2017-07-20T20:12:09.183+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"Just make runes free until preseason.\"\n\nWe talked about this as a solution, and we went another way for a couple of reasons. Would be interested in your thoughts.\n\n1) The current rune system is not very robust technically, which in fact is one of the reasons for why we wanted to rebuild it (though not the main reason). For example, there is a maximum rune number that you can hit, but the game doesn't really communicate that well, and so many players open up support tickets when they can't add another rune. Yes, we could go fix all of that, but why spend the effort on a system that we have already planned to remove?\n\n2) Letting players get as many runes as they want invites a lot of experimentation and unusual builds and trying out runes they never had before. All of which is kind of the wrong focus for a system that is about to go away. We'd rather players be making posts and videos and streams about the *new* rune design rather than pumping a bunch of excitement into the one whose days or numbered. It just felt like a weird message to send.\n\nSo we hit upon the solution of making runes cheap enough during the transition that you could still pick up a new champion or try out a new build, without encouraging everyone to go out and grab every rune they could find.","replies":[{"poster":"Aevilok","date":"2017-07-20T22:32:04.427+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and while we're at it, when is preseason?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-21T00:19:37.877+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"November's the plan.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShieldWarrior","date":"2017-07-20T18:53:20.179+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I ask, if we can edit them in champion select unlike now there is no need of other 19 rune pages i have.
