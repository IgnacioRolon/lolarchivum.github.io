When I made my account and logged in for the first time I was asked to created a summoner name, upon doing so and being told it was available it asked me if I was sure I wanted this to be my name. Here is the problem, I can click yes all day long and it will not change over, and will not do anything, but if I click no it will allow me to change the name. Essentially I am stuck trying to pick my summoner name indefinitely, And advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-14T18:27:54.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really awesome you made an account to play with your friend!  The issue you're describing sounds like it's on the updated client.  It looks like the available message will come up even if it's not actually available.  Try making the name on the legacy client instead:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nHopefully that does the trick!","replies":[]}]}
