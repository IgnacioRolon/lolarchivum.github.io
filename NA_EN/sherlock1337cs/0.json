For some reason, your network isn't able to get the notification that a match has been found so you don't ever see the enter lobby button. \n\nGo through our [**Connection Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and the steps there should be able to help.

Not 100% related but my friend has been having problems connecting to games. After champ select he gets disconnected and the reconnect button shows up but does not actualy allow him to reconnect. He has tried running the in-client repair and reinstalling but is still having issues. I did not know if there was any network fixes or such that he could try. Thanks!","replies":[]}]}
