There are multiple sources -- the wiki for one -- which explicitly say that Ashe is given for free. But, as of level 12, I haven&#039;t received her. I think I was supposed to get her at level 2. Is the information I&#039;m seeing out of date? If not, is there some recourse for me to get her?\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2019-01-05T01:00:54.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TickleM0nst3r,\n\nYou should have received the free Ashe Champion Permanent with the opening of your Level 2 Level Up Capsule. Please check your Hextech Loot for the Capsules and open them, and you should receive the Permanent which you should be able to add to your Inventory.\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to reply here! ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"TickleM0nst3r","date":"2019-01-05T17:00:32.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, HeyItzSteve,\n\nThanks for the reply. I've definitely opened all my capsules. The permanent shards I have are Ahri, Brand, Garen and Caitlyn. Perhaps I got Ahri instead of Ashe? I guess that's a better deal but it seems odd that the rewards would vary.","replies":[{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2019-01-05T19:37:20.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is definitely odd.
