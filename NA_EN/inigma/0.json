I have good internet. The new client does not run well on my computer. I have a reasonably new MacBook Pro, it runs 70fps and I normally have 60 ping. There is nothing wrong with my computer. After installing the updated client so many problems have come up. It takes me 10 minutes of restarting the client and my computer to get it to launch properly. I have tried using the legacy client but it won't let me log in. I'm stuck in the new client which often lags out mid champ select and gets me kicked from the lobby. I have struggled through many ban timers which were not at all my fault. I have tried adjusting fps settings and have looked online for a solution and have found nothing. Please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T23:29:43.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious as to what error you're seeing when trying to login to the Legacy Client, however, I'm convinced that an *unstable connection* to our servers is what's causing the symptoms you've mentioned.
