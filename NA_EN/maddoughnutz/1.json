Playing the game does not make you a professional balance'r, which it feels like most people are claiming to be these days. Regardless of my rant, I just hope this community...

For stuff that's outright bugged, absolutely, we should be getting on that quickly if it's a significant bug and, ideally, letting you guys know about it.

We can't work on every rework at once for example, and that leaves us with only two real options when it comes to reworks that won't be out for a while. We can either say nothing, or we can tell you it's work we agree needs to be done, but that we're doing other stuff first.

It's 3am, so I apologize if my response is not worded the best (I'm currently running Teemo in any and all lanes because I can't think straight enough to pick anything else) , but I definitely wanted to get one in before bed.\n\n\nHere are my thoughts on your response in the order that they come to me:\n\n*Bugs*. Your guys' turn around rate on fixing bugs is pretty damn quick.  I mean, once you guys say one is being fixed it usually is done so within a few days.  I don't know what the industry standard is, but that is pretty damn good.  I think for bugs, things breakdown in prioritization and receiving notice (on your end) that the bugs exist.  \n\nA while back bugs was a big topic, because the community felt like they would submit report after report and the bug would just never be resolved (and then when and if it was fixed, it wouldn't necessarily be announced anywhere that it was).  Both of these clearly remain an issue - there are still random little bugs here and there that have been reported for longer than these new forums have existed AND apparently not all bug reports are read or forwarded to the correct people (as I believe Katey said today in regards to a bug not even being on record as existing - and it's one that has been noted time and time again for months).  \n\nIn this same category: exploits.  This kind of left a scar on me that last time one of these rolled around (Blade of the Ruined King).  Apparently the exploit was first reported literal months before the outbreak happened - and multiple times by multiple sources (as shown via Reddit).  Then, when it became popular, everyone was told to be hush hush about it and that we couldn't mention it or more people would abuse it.  But, honestly, it kind of felt like the issue was even only dealt with once it became something that was talked about - and it was definitely not done in a timely manner, even if you ignore those months of ignored/never received bug reports. And it isn't in any way Riot's fault that people choose to abuse the game, but for the entirety of the exploit's life the only communication that was allowed about it was that it was being fixed.  At some point.\n\nAll of this culminates, I believe, into the fact that I guess we need a better platform for communicating issues/bugs!  I don't know if there should be some Riot approved grand master list that we all keep applying to have bugs added to or what, but clearly submitting tickets or posting on the forums doesn't always find its way to the people who need the info.\n\n\n*Communication in regards to prioritization*.  I totally see your point here and completely understand.  And realistically even with a huge team of people there's no way you could get everything done at once.  I think where things breakdown, again, is in the communication zone.  We all basically understand your guys' position here - you can't exactly tell us all the details of what you're working on, some things could get scrapped before they even see the light of day, the community will try and control all aspects of it, things can change from concept to live deployment, etc - but at the same time we're kind of like what could you possibly be working on that's more important than X or Y, because X or Y seems pretty damn important to us all!  \n\nI feel like this is a huge topic that could be talked about forever.  But I think I can sum up my ideas pretty quick.  First, it feels like the community and Riot are moving in two different directions.  That the community has this idea of what this game should be and where it should go, and what should be done to get there.  Likewise Riot has goals and direction, and they are taking the steps necessary to get to their end game.  And I can't help but wonder, as I read post after post and Riot response after Riot response, if we're just not all on the same page.  Is that a communication problem?  I think it's just one of those things we're all dancing around but maybe just don't realize it.  \n\nRiot prides itself on being one of the biggest game companies and, while being so, one of the best at communicating the absolute most with its players.  I mean, hell, you guys have a constant League server up just for testing and input.  That's pretty sexy!  And I don't think anyone on these forums will disagree, you guys communicate non-stop in all sorts of topics.  But truly, really, I feel like we've just got a huge misunderstanding.  What is Riot's direction?  Why do you guys do what you do?  What is Riot's priorities?  Where are you guys going with this huge thing you've built up?  To us, you're multifaced and it makes you guys seem like double talkers and promise breakers.  One day you guys are epic story tellers pulling us into the world of runeterra, the next there is no story or lore put out for 6 months.  One day you're all about updating splashes and making beautiful art, then the only splashes that matter are base skins.  Then you guys want to unify all cc and make a standard, then you introduce new types.  You guys agree there is mobility creep, then you release even more champions with mobility based skills.  \n\nIf I am the only one to say it, so be it, but the truth is I just feel disconnected from you guys, Riot.  I do.  I feel like to me you guys were always a grounded, well organized, game and company that I fundamentally agreed with and understood where you guys wanted to go and take us with you.  But to be honest, for over a year now I've just been sitting back asking myself where we are and what is happening.  Because I don't know.  I don't know what you guys are working on behind the scenes, I don't know what's happened to projects that were up and coming that took priority over things the community was hoping to get, half of the characters I play have had their identities tweaked or changed for updates or skin releases (I will forever stand by that Ashe is a young Queen, not an annoying tween as her VO now portrays), the soloQ ELO system still makes no sense to me (if any Riot mathematicians would like to talk some time, I would love to hear the ins and outs of how this system was developed and how it works behind the scenes, because I feel like I'm just missing something), some times some things are okay and sometimes they aren't, I'm being told that the justice system is the best its ever been and yet not one player will tell you their experiences in game have ever been better than last year in fact it is quite the opposite, and I have no idea what or where we are going as a community or company.\n\n\nIn conclusion, to simply answer your response in a tl;dr version: yes, communication good.  But I don't think it is good enough right now.  And I don't know why.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPS: \n\nI would like again thank you for taking the time to respond.

It exemplifies most of the things I feel are being ignored. There is one thing I'd like to add however:\n\nThere are certain champions who are immensely outdated or nerfed too much. I feel like Riot is constantly tweaking champions in the forefront of popularity to maintain balance when there is a very real alternative. Raising older champions up to balance newer ones is a way that the meta can stay active and alive. Otherwise those current \"good\" champions are all that will be played. Updating Anivia to keep up with the current meta as well as staying true to her identity as a camp mage could help deal with champs like Veigar. It's two birds with one stone! An old champion is made better and a top-tier one now has another threat. Fixing Urgot, buffing Skarner, making Zac relevant, tweaking Ryze, updating Amumu and Rammus...these are ways that you could account for the rise of Jarven, Tristana, Veigar, Gnar. Tweaking popular champions while ignoring those in need of changes won't change the meta.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2015-02-26T14:04:09.768+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying something is DEFINITELY better than silence, I agree entirely and I'm sure a lot of other people would too. One thing I remember hearing lately (for example, and from another department) is that Cho'Gath is probably getting a visual update, but it isn't really anywhere in the pipeline yet; this is useful information because it lets people know that the problem is acknowledged, and even though we know it won't likely be solved SOON, we know it's on the minds of the people with the power to change it.\n\nAs for champ reworks and updates, there are a few that I feel are high-priority, but that I don't see a lot of other people talking about much (Zyra and Diana, for example) so I don't feel like they'll be tackled any time soon. But I DO see people talking a lot about Lee Sin despite his win rate being numerically inferior, and that looks to me like a design problem - he needs a minor rework to reduce the frustration of playing against him because his tuning isn't the problem. *No one has said a word about him.*\n\nWell, aside from recently where someone mentioned the 5.4 Warrior enchant nerf as if it was a solution to the problem. I don't think that's the message the rioter was attempting to convey, but it's how it came across.\n\nIn situations where no work is being done despite the entire community having an opinion on the issue, someone NEEDS to make a statement even if it's to say \"We aren't doing anything right now, but we understand it's important to the players so we will make it a priority as soon as we can.\" Optimal situation in my opinion is that a Rioter comes in now and then to say \"This is what we see the problem to be, these are a few things we have tried that HAVEN'T worked and this is why, we are still looking for a solution that's up to our standards.\" This tells us that work is really being done (which is hard to tell sometimes from the players' point of view) and sometimes insight into the process can be just as impressive and satisfying to get as the end result itself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solaxo","date":"2015-02-26T11:21:07.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=3vchfsGp,comment-id=00330001000000020000000000000002000000010000,timestamp=2015-02-26T06:56:07.303+0000)\n>\n> I wanted to respond to this bit because this can be really tough sometimes.

A lot of times peoples feedback isn't coming from a place where they've explored that. One example I can give is looking at World of Warcraft... people are posting that they have 'nothing to do' but the game has never had more opportunities available so clearly something's wrong with that feedback. There are many examples across every game's feedback forums but that's the one that came to mind atm.\nPeople frequently post feedback without investigating the reason why it bothers them to find the root cause, and while it is still valid feedback, they could help make things easier for the devs if they took some time and considered the 'why'.","replies":[{"poster":"Byrnes","date":"2015-02-25T20:55:42.003+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just wanted to jump in here real quick and speak up.

What do we resort to if for years asking for a fix or change receives no response other than \"we'll get to it, one day\"?  \n\nI don't know that rage is ever the solution to a problem, but I think this point is well made. There are problems that have been around for a long time, uncorrected, and Soon(tm) is a crappy way to deal with them. I would really like to see a public pipeline. Like a chalkboard-style list of issues that are known problems, cross them off as they get solved. This would be a nightmare for Riot employees, but would greatly improve accountability and make long-term problems harder to ignore. Players would submit polls for problems to add to the list, with enough votes they go on automatically. Moderators would remove entries like \"Helmet Bro nao!?\" as this would be a serious list.\n\n> The thing that irks me the most, above all other silliness in this game, is the fact that things that we pay for specifically hang in a \"will be fixed in a week even though it worked yesterday\" loop.  I get this is e-commerce, but if I pay for a skin I need to be able to use that skin when I want to (champion select aside).  If I pay extra RP for fancy particles that for some reason disappear during the patch, you better get that fixed ASAP or prepare to offer me the refund between skin tiers.  I know this seems like such a small and insignificant thing, but it happens *frequently*.  \n\nPersonally I've never cared about this one, if I can't use my skin for a month or two that doesn't ruffle my feathers. I could see how someone else might feel differently.\n \n> You want to rebalance the entire map?  Add weird mechanics for the sake of making this season different?  \n\nActually I like that they are trying different stuff just for the hell of it. Keeps the game fresh. I love that little river crab.\n\n>Won't open a real dialogue with people who at least partially know what they are talking about?  \n\nlol, most of us don't know wtf we are talking about any more than they do. Even if you've played a champ since beta, that doesn't mean you have correct insight on how that champ performs across multiple continents, with different builds, and against every champ. We have to give Rito a little benefit of the doubt, for better or worse. I feel your pain though.\n\n>Hey, that's just your flushing good PR down the drain.

For me that makes it not upsetting.

Rage posts aren't 'making a stand' they're 'throwing a childish temper tantrum and feeding the belief that the community is full of spoiled 12 year olds'(NOT trying to say you make them btw) - the simple fact is that the hierarchy for 'ways to get a developer to respect your opinion' goes like this:\n\n1) Stop paying\n2) Stop playing\n3) Logical, rational feedback\n4) Civil, illogical feedback\n5) Rage posts\n6) Death threats\n\nSo if you're considering stepping from 'logical rational feedback' and going DOWN to 'rage posts', then you're not helping your cause. If logical feedback isn't working, take a stand by not playing.\n\nIt may not work, but it's the only step you have above 'logical feedback'. It's what I've done over their ridiculous changes to the leaverbuster system, for example. Check my match history, I haven't played since they announced them. They probably won't change their mind over me not playing, but my ethics can't support them right now with the message they're sending, so I stopped playing. If you feel strongly enough about the problems, then that's your next step.

I am going to guess you joined sometime during or after season 3. The reason this is important is because Riot substantially changed their patch schedule and balance practices. In season 2 we had a new champ and a new balance patch every other week. This made knee jerk reactions happen constantly and balance always be a nightmare. Champs were also released horrible over powered or not playable. Now we get more unique champs that are over all playable. Occasionally we get an overpowered champ but not nearly as often as we use to. That also stated ( I don't remember what season) that the game has been so saturated with mobility that adding mobility isn't that big of an issue. I tend to agree with that policy. Honestly. balancing a game is really hard. It requires a lot of intentional action and a lot of skill. For example, say you nerf lee sin. you kill his damage. Forcing him to be a tank type champ. His pick rate plummets. However who steps in to fill that void? More likely we just see the next strongest champ step up like rengar. However this doesn't fix the problem of junglers. Instead it just puts a next best champ into his role. So how riot takes it time to nerf champions and usually finds a creative way to deal with a problem is admirable.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-26T03:43:44.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have Judgement Kayle.\n\nLee has been top pick for 3 years + already, which according to Riot's own set of policy, he should have already been gutted at least 3 times at this point now, which isn't the case at all. That's their first problem, they are selectively consistent with their own rule.\n\nGeneralists should stay a master of none, if you have an incredibly mobile champ, with extreme base stats and actually have a high scaling in his own spells, just look at it. How is this fair? Because it isn't. \n\nLee's design philosophy is a mess, catering towards his extreme mobility while having 0 compromises will ultimately ruin a game (which we are seeing more lately). Not to mention Riot is also systematically making all spells skill shots, which again, another emphasis on the importance of mobility.\n\nLoL was never about twitch reflex action, why change now? Again inconsistency, or we can say, abandoning the roots.\n\nThere are just too many things wrong at once in the foundation of LoL since they never removed the roots when issues came up. This game will simply continue to dilute itself until nothing is left, unless they take some extreme measures which would never happen (they didn't do anything when there were less issues, they won't do it now or in the near future).","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-02-26T08:30:57.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you either didn't play in season 2 or more likely forgot what it was like. He was not a top pick in season 2. He became really popular in season 3. This season he barely makes the top 5 with what the pros have been picking.\n\nLee isn't a master of anything. he is sub-par at tanking and he is sub par at damage. Granted he has good damage early. However if you build him damage oriented he dies to fast to be useful. If you build him tank he is below average. His strength is being able to soak more damage then a squishy well dealing less damage then a carry. Basically he is the best bruiser. \n\nWhat exactly would you consider lee's design philosophy? He seems to fit perfectly towards what he is intended to do. be a bruiser. What compromises should he have? he already sacrifices late game damage and early game tankyness. Mobility is a valuable stat but it isn't really related to landing skill shots. You can literally dodge skill shots the same way you can land them by predicting what the opponent is going to do. The only mobility that really fucks skill shots are things like arcane shift which cast regardless of whether you hit them or not.\n\nLoL has always partly been about reflex. The better reflexes you have the better reaction time ultimately means the better player you can be. However reflexes are not and haven't ever been so dominant that you can't over come them. I fail to see the inconsistency maybe you can elaborate.\n\nWhat exactly is wrong with the foundation of LoL? You can't make broad claims like that with out actually stating what exactly is wrong.

Online, people tend to be a bit more vitriolic than in person because consequences are usually so far removed from the act and its easy to dehumanize the entity you're directing the complaints towards(I'm not insulting a person, I'm insulting 'Riot Games', for example)... and if you can remove someone's humanity mentally, it's easy - hell even natural - to treat them poorly.(see books like The Banality of Evil for more details on this concept albeit taken to a greater extreme)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Circuit Bear","date":"2015-02-25T16:37:28.792+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":7,"body":"You haven't been playing long or haven't been listening to Riot long if you think this hasn't grown worse with time. \n\nMost complaints stem from a growing and increasing problem.

And you tell them \"Well sucks to be you, we don't give a f-\" Yea, you deserve the hostility. This has happened for a lot of reworks now. Karma was somewhat half and half. Veigar it's been the same two people defending it, usually on smurfs. Same for Cass, same for Skarner. And what happened to the playrate on all these characters? Either they ended up solid and were nerfed to being almost never played. Or they were unplayable, as expected and buffed until their numbers meant they had to be good. But none of them were fun to play.(Well, with the exclusion of Veigar since he hasn't been released just yet). \n\nSo all these immobile zero dash characters got a bunch of flaws and dependencies. What about the Kass, Katarina Rework, and mobile character reworks? What about Leblanc? None of them were made entirely dependent on skill shots. None of them have real flaws except two of them being melee. Leblanc has a skill shot that should be hit, but when you can blink in point blank its pretty hard to miss anyway. \n\nBut who isn't nerfed into oblivion or made miserable to play? The same flashy playmaking characters.\n\nSupports, who is nerfed? Traditional supports that counter Blitz/Leona Thresh who are the most played, and Blitz Leona were barely .7% below Sona in win ratio? Who gets nerfed? Sona, for \"Being unhealthy for statistics we can't show you\". I want to see these \"unfun to play against\" stats cause I think getting tower dove by Leona 15 times in a row gets old personally. \n\nBasically?

Yes. It's unfun being a 4000 health tank and being quarter healthed by a nidalee spear, then her diving in as a cougar and using takedown which SOMEHOW does around sub-3000 damage at times. (Are you building MR? Haha, take a trap and a void staff.) Yes, it's unfun being a skillshot based champion and never hitting a decent Yasuo or kalista with anything. (And when you do manage to hit yasuo, he has two ways to negate it anyways.) Yes, it's unfun being stuck fighting a hyper-tanky jarvan that does 10% of your health on hit every 6 seconds or so. Yes, it's unfun dealing with a Lee Sin who's second Q (again, SECOND, considering he has a double kit) does percent health, and his E doing a gratuitous amount of damage, so being a tank doesn't matter. \n\nThere will always be champions that are stronger than the rest. Simply due to the fact of how they're made. (Ex. Even if Thresh literally had all damage removed from his kit-- he'd still be one of the strongest supports simply because of how much utility he has.) There will always be champions who are favored by the community, simply because they're a lot better than others if you play them right. (Zed is one of the largest offenders here, but there's also Yasuo, Lee Sin... pretty much any of the high-mobility manaless (resourceless entirely in yasuo's case) champions as of late)\n\nThat doesn't change the fact though of what's fun for people in the game. Personally, I LOVE playing Twitch adc. Is he weak as trash this season? Yes. Does Kalista's rend completely invalidate Expunge/Contaminate? Yes, plus with a slow. Does base health regen counter twitch's passive the same way that health potions used to counter Mordekaiser's ult? Triple yes. Doesn't change the fact that I love being a roaming ADC with stealth, and a piercing ult.\n\nProblem with champion tiers is, it's not as black and white as they make it seem. Yes, Ahri has been on the strong side lately, but she's still just as beatable as before, she just got a little too bursty with her combo. Yes, Katarina can still burst an entire team in about 3 seconds with no warning, and gets resets. That's a bit more situational, considering you have to have harder cc than a root, but still, she IS beatable. Strong? Yes. But can still be managed. Yes, Vi, dear lord Vi, with Trinity Force, is SUPER strong right now, being very tanky and doing an insane amount of damage to anyone on the team, regardless of how much armor you have. But with a focused effort from your team, she's still beatable. (I used those champions cause they're all God Tier as of patch 5.3)\n\nPeople will play what champs are currently stronger than others, because people want to win. I think anyone can admit that it's unfun playing against the same top tier champions every single game, but it's going to happen no matter what because as some champions are, it's literally impossible to perfectly balance the game without reworking entirely champions such as Thresh, Yasuo, and Zed. (...Pretty much any of the fun, but oh-so-strong CertainlyT champions, plus others like Lee Sin) Unless you completely work them, or literally rework **every single other champ in the game to be able to make \"plays\" such as the previously listed,** there will never be a complete balance in the game. \n\n\"Because I want to. Because I enjoy the champions design and the way THEY perform their role. So what if there are generalists that are better? They don't do the same thing my 'handicapped' champion does. Same outcome? Yes. But it's not the same thing. And that's where the fun is for me.\"\n\n^This right here is VERY true. Like I said earlier with Twitch-- Yes, he's extremely weak at the moment compared to pretty much any other marksman, even Ashe. Could I pick Draven or Kalista and hypercarry my game with a crapton of damage? Yes. But neither of them have Twitch's invisibility or his ult that I enjoy so much. Yeah, it'll end up with a higher chance of me winning if I play the stronger champions, but that doesn't mean anything to me if I'm not having fun with it. Everyone's gotta remember, *this is a video game, not the Olympics.*(Even though we do have E-Sports) It's meant to be for FUN, yes, there is ranked, but it is over all, meant to be for FUN. I could care less if I lost if I had a lot of fun every single game I played.\n\nHeck, I know EVERYONE here remembers URF. No matter what, whether you got ROFLStomped or had an even game, EVERYONE had fun with it simply because of how fun the game mode was. Yeah, there were the infamous Facemash Sona, Q-to-Win Soraka, the perma-stun Brand, and the Heca-Copter running around the mode, (Thank goodness they removed Ryze) but it was still super fun playing it with anyone. \n\nThat's how people should act in this game. Yeah, you have a higher chance to win with the currently higher tiered champions. But what's the point in it if you aren't having fun with it? \n\n\"I play immobile mages. I play traditional supports and jungles. I play everything the community here hypes up to be misplaced or underappreciated, and not once have I ever had an issue with all the supposed 'OP' champions the boards claims to be.\"\n\nI've gotta agree with all of this. Yes, I *hate* playing against Yasuos, simply because of how much of a pain it is to hit him with most midlaners, or survive him in some cases. But he's honestly the only one I truly have a gripe about. As for playing the lower-tiered champions, yeah, in most cases, the ones with high mobility, high damage, high cc, etc. etc. forever etc. will do better. But I really enjoy the ones that are considered \"low tier\" by others. Heck, old Xerath was quite literally the most immobile champion in the game, and he was my FAVORITE mid laner in the game. (Now, it's probably Galio or Lissandra) One of my favorite ADC's to play is Varus, and he has 0 dashes and a really poor escape in general. (A neglegible slow, and an ult that roots, not stuns, and has a spread that base movement speed on even the slowest champions can out-walk.) But I absolutely love the Sniper-style play on him, and playing him really does force you to mind your positioning, unlike most other adc's where you just have to worry about killing everyone else before they kill you. (Again, mostly talking about lategame Draven, Tristana, Vayne, or Kalista here-- the usual ones who can 2 shot entire teams and 3-4 shot tanks.) \n\nAnd as for support, I'm a literal support MAIN. I play almost exclusively traditional supports. I picked up lux lately but I surely won't be using her in ranked, cause her ult steals too many kills. I flat out refuse to go Annie or Leblanc support, cause I don't think a support should build a gold income item and a sightstone, then just build straight AP and be a second APC. (Same goes for Lich bane sona) With all of the APC's \"hurr durr I'm support\" in bot lane this season, that just build straight AP and end up with a better K/D than the adc at the end of the game, sure, it's a lot easier to just 2-shot anyone with champions that can do what supports do with more damage. But I sure as heck enjoy playing (even new, frantic-healing Soraka) traditional supports more, like Sona, Lulu, Zilean, Karma, Kayle, Nami, Thresh, and especially Taric. (The only support I don't like playing is Janna-- she's strong, but she's very boring for me.)\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nSo yeah, there are stronger champions in the game. But strong =/= fun. And in a video game, which was solely created for the purpose of fun, I could care less if a champion was the most OP thing and could literally 1 shot every other champion in the game, if I had the choice to play a more fun champion. \n\nAnd as for the ACTUAL reason for this thread, yeah, I'll agree with Doughnutz, super kudos to the rioters that come here and deal with all of this hate. I can totally relate with that (although maybe on a lower level) considering that supports and junglers take the most blame from teams in the game. Dealing with unpleasant and negative people while still doing your best to help is truly an admirable thing that I love. Heck, if I wasn't in college right now, I would see if there was a way to join Riot. (But for now, must get my Art degree and continue my portfolio of character designs, and take some info. tech classes. OTL) I've spoken to some rioters here on the boards and the old GD, and some of them are some truly awesome people. Heck, I spoke with the one that designed Bard just yesterday, and they were super nice and seemed just as excited for his release as some of us others in the community. Yeah, I understand that the company makes mistakes sometimes (Release rek'sai, in which riot literally said on the patch notes: Oops.), but they sure as heck are doing their best to bring us an enjoyable game that is a good time to play.\n\nSo, to both Doughnutz the OP, and Riot themselves, thank you guys.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Finnical","date":"2015-02-26T06:00:39.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Most complaints stem from a growing and increasing problem. And Riot's treatment of it, does deserve the hostility.\n\nI completely feel your frustration and I get where you I coming from. But I have to question the use of \"hostility.\" I think that a concerted and consistent effort to tell Rito how unhappy you are is definitely warranted, and their level of response is subpar (especially Narrative). Hostility though? These people didn't threaten to rape your mom, they just made a video game less fun for you to play. \n\nPerspective is a good thing, try stepping outside once the weather gets nice again. Smell a flower, have a picnic and a long relaxing bath. Then decide if you want to tell a total stranger that he actually deserves to be treated with hostility. Remember these are people reading your comments, not lines of code. It really might ruin their day to see someone post that they deserve to be treated with hostility. \n\nI agree that Riot's performance has degraded over time in regards to community feedback, and there are certain consistent balance problems that have never been corrected.

Where characters went in and out of style. Sejuani was barely in style for a while. Amumu is one of the only tanks who really stayed consistently but with how frequent character like Lee sin are and how high damage junglers have been common, running amumu was always really risky against competent junglers. And with him being nerfed harder then lee in the new jungle, yea it feels like there is some weird hatred when the tank has less armor then the guy with sustain, and damage out the ass. Now amumu's damage reduction just feels like compensation for the armor loss. \n\nI can see where your coming from for the most part honestly.\n\nAnd I'm the type of person who will give the reasons for my dislike. I didn't actually post my numbers on Cass cause like 10 other people did and got the same results.

But the recurring problems with Riot's disregard have me really question their intent for the game. And when I see them acting like they care, I try to be respectful, but when we are blown off time and time again (Anytime I can play tanks in the jungle or Leona/Blitz/Thresh are nerfed and all their counters aren't being(Sona(least the way I played her) and Janna) will be a day my mind is blown. With the constant nerfs to any supports that aren't played quite as frequently as the trio and Morgana and Annie still there, traditional supports are just being pushed out. \n\nAnd what reason were we given? \"Cause they are unhealthy due to magic stats we can't show you\". \n\nI think this deserves some flack.

Leona Blitz I somewhat felt like I could deal with) it feels like crap that THAT is their excuse for nerfing my characters.\n\nIf you are going to say they are unhealthy, I want to know these statistics at least. Are more cusswords used in games with them? Do more people rage quit? How do you decide a character is \"unfun\" to play against?\n\nAgain, I don't think Riot owes me anything personally. But if someone kicks you in the nuts because you didn't wear pants they like(I don't really enjoy Leona/Blitz/Thresh who have had the highest play rate for over half a year and two of which are just below their counters in win rate(janna)) you are definitely going to yell. \n\nI have been pretty vocal about when they do things I appreciate and when they do things I dislike. Positive and Negative feedback. \n\nAnd as someone who plays what are ending up as \"niche picks forever\" (traditional supports, immobile mages, tanks and counter junglers) the past two years have left mostly negative feedback for me because these are subsets that have been ignored and abandoned and consistently made worse. \n\nI don't want to upset anyone, but after two years of dealing with it. I guess I hit my limit.

Not cool to be crass and rude to other people. Read the difference here:\n\nTotally OK: Riot, I'm really upset. You buffed ZED AGAIN! This is bad for the game and I don't like it! Do something different! I'm not having fun anymore!\n\nvs.\n\nCrass and Rude: You idiots don't know how to do your jobs! I'm gonna go play another game where I don't have to interact with morons! I hope you get fired; I'm gonna freaking kill you if you don't.\n\nSee the difference? They both say more or less the same thing with the same tone, but one of them is completely acceptable and fair and the other is just bad, bordering on dangerous.\n\n \n> When I have to try twice as hard to beat my opponent to win with a character I like for 2 years, I stop wanting to play.

No one is threatened by the idea of you going to play a different game. Riot is wildly successful; their player-base is enormous.

He did something far more intense. He DISAGREED with people. He made the decision that regardless of the player-bases desires/expectations that Cass needed to go in a different direction for the health of the game. I personally think it was a mistake, but I don't have access to enormous meta-data like he does, so it is entirely possible that he's right and we're wrong. It is important to sometimes admit you could be wrong, even when you feel so right. \n \n> And what reason were we given? \"Cause they are unhealthy due to magic stats we can't show you\". \n\nYeah, that never feels good. But when I was a kid and my Mom told me I couldn't eat a whole package of cookies in one sitting or I would get a stomach-ache, she was right. I couldn't see that because I didn't have access to the magic stat called experience that she had.\n \n> And treating my characters like they are unhealthy when Thresh, Lee Sin, Zed, and a number of highly popular and EXTREMELY unenjoyable characters to play against(regardless of if they are overpowered, none of them are fun to play against.

Should the game be balanced strictly towards what you like? Or should it be balanced to what most people like? Not that I don't understand, I love Singed and many people hate him. Just saying what you want in the grand scheme of balance is a smaller consideration than what most people want and the over-all health of the game.\n\n > If you are going to say they are unhealthy, I want to know these statistics at least. Are more cusswords used in games with them? Do more people rage quit? How do you decide a character is \"unfun\" to play against?\n\nI think these are legitimate questions, though I don't know that those particular metrics would be a valid way to measure this. I have read Riot posts on the subject and I usually find them revealing, though I don't remember it well enough to provide a summary.\n \n> Again, I don't think Riot owes me anything personally.
