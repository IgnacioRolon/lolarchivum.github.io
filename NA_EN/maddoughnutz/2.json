Zed, Yasuo, LB, Fizz, Riven, Lee Sin, the whole shibang. Thing is, and it&#039;s a fact, people don&#039;t like being outplayed. Which is what all these champions are based on doing. Zed needs to harass you down with a skillshot before pressing R and trying do enough damage to kill you with his other skills. Yasuo dashes around to dodge skillshots and his windwall helps in keeping projectiles away from him and his team. LB, I give on this one, is very annoying and hard to deal with when she Q-R&#039;s you. Fizz is self explanatory. Riven is a monster when she snowballs and she&#039;s a lane bully at the same time. Lee Sin is in the jungle ganking your lanes with flashy mobility.\n\nThing is, they don&#039;t out stat you, they don&#039;t pass a check that says &#039;I have enough X to kill you&#039; like other certain champs. They perform mechanical combo&#039;s and generally are built squishy, with their defense being in their damage and mobility. \n\nTo me, that isn&#039;t unfun. That isn&#039;t infuriating. If I get outplayed, sure I&#039;m upset; I lost. Anybody would expect to be upset. But at the same time, I would admire the guy who outplayed me, I find it fun that I got to experience that skill against my own. And when I beat them, I smile and am happy that I didn&#039;t beat them because they had less stats then me, I beat them because I out-skilled them. THAT is why I enjoy seeing these champs and enjoy playing against them. That is also why I hate playing against champs like Irelia and Vladimir. They don&#039;t out skill you at all, they just farm up with sustain until they get enough items to beat you down with right clicks or spamming Q-E on you repeatedly while surviving not thanks to their skill with their mobility, but due to being tanky. Which is just raw stats. When I win against an Irelia or Vlad or any other champion like them, I don&#039;t feel skilled. I don&#039;t feel like I outplayed them. I feel like I just beat a champion that didn&#039;t have any tools to out skill me besides passing a stat check.\n\nMy opinion on the matter is, as much as the community calls them unfun and unfair, I feel like they are better for the game as a whole. They are fun to play against BECAUSE they aren&#039;t ball of stats champions. They are all full of active abilities and skillful mechanics when played at a high level, and I enjoy seeing them, playing with them and playing against them(Though not as them). They&#039;re a challenge, and when I win that challenge I feel good about myself.\n\n\ntl;dr, I enjoy seeing and playing against Lee Sin, Zed, Riven, Yas and others, and I hope they stay.","replies":[{"poster":"PDE5 Inhibitors","date":"2016-01-18T18:21:11.905+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":4,"body":"The problem that most people have with those champs that you can't outplay them. You have to hope they fuck up and aren't that good with the champ. They do extremely high damage, but are so mobile that they can get out of any situation that isn't going their way. That's the frustrating part. It's easy to \"outplay\" someone when you have 10x the amount of tools to do it with. That's the issue.\n\nXerath could outplay the shit out of me.

Conversely, when I beat those champions it is more often than not a result of them fucking up badly than of me actually outplaying them.\n\nAnd another thing which just adds fuel to the fire: **those fuckers are in every goddamn game.** This game has 120+ very different champions, and yet Lee and Thresh, two biggest offenders, are allowed to remain in state in which they maintain a constant 33% + pick rate, while champions like Sej and Sion are intentionally overnerfed because \"they have had their time in spotlight\" in a magnificent act of hypocrisy and favouritism by Riot. **120 characters. 2 see play on average in 1/3 games.** There might be a problem right there that isn't related to \"but they're just so fun to play\".","replies":[{"poster":"PDE5 Inhibitors","date":"2016-01-18T21:22:52.280+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, the reason they are in every game is because they are considered fun to play.

You can't argue that those champs are overloaded to hell and back, and that plays a huge factor. You can't argue that Lee is constantly being kept an #1 spot, with either champs standing on equal ground with him getting nerfed or him getting buffed when the meta does not favour him.\n\nAnd champions can be fun and flashy without being overbearing,Take Shaco for example. He is capable of pulling off some of the sickest plays in this game, and yet sports below 8% pick rate. Zac can make insane plays with his slingshot/ult combo and he comfortably sits at slightly above 4% pick rate. Kassadin, the epitome of mobility-based champion in this game has around 4% too. Azir is also downright insane when played properly, and he goes barely over 3%.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-01-18T21:06:18.871+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much this, said champions have way to many get out of fail free cards","replies":[{"poster":"FrickendaChicken","date":"2016-01-18T21:26:25.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Yasuo has NO reliable escape to his team/tower without your minions or team giving that to him, in which case he should have been caught out and killed.

And LB has almost free escape, if she wasn't so squishy that sneezing on her while she is jumping to you would kill her. \n\nMost of these champion's get out of jail cards are generally used in a fight, instead of after, in order to outplay damage and skillshots to deal the most damage.\n\nAnd all of these examples are for teamfights. 1v1'ing a champion meant to outplay a 1v1 is a completely different.","replies":[{"poster":"PDE5 Inhibitors","date":"2016-01-18T22:02:03.679+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo's nado provides a lot of escape.\n\nLee might be an issue if missing his Q didn't mean it was up again LONG before you can even think about getting away from him.

And you can just side-step it if you pay attention to the animation/ are far enough away.\nUsing his W is still using his mobility to get to you. And if he missed his Q and it's on cooldown while he is trying to get to you, it generally means he has to flash, therefore putting him in a horrible spot because the person he kicks is not his method out.\nYes, chasing a Riven is not a good idea. But again, this is for team fights, which is how a large majority of games are won. The only reason she is using her abilities to get away is because she lost the team fight, so it doesn't matter if she does get away or not.\n\nLet's say I'm Zed. I ult the adc in the back-midline. Who else is there? Amumu, Blitzrank, Alistar, Ahri, the adc, etc. They can see you coming, they know when you're landing, and they know their cc. Alistar isn't going to let you touch the adc. Blitzcrank is gonna blow you up. Amumu isn't going to allow you an escape or the ability to attack, and Ahri is gonna touch you inappropriately. Did you live from any of these guys? If your answer is yes and you Ulted back, then you have un-successfully done your job at killing someone, and is at low health.\nBtw this isn't a fed Zed because you can't count being fed towards balancing a champion.\nFizz generally maxes his E first, and it does the most damage. Again, since we aren't talking about being fed, he ALMOST needs to use it for damage. That or pop ignite, which is a long cool down summoner spell.\n\nThe best way to deal with slippery assassins is targeted cc. The other best way is to be able to out perform your opponent, as the OP said, they don't outstat you, they outplay you. Characters like Vladimir just RUIN these champions. Annie, Malphite, Pantheon, Ryze. All of these champions are really strong and have at least 1 targeted cc. (except Vlad, he just out stats and out sustains them.)\n\nAlso, I said all of those examples in the previous post are for teamfights. This isn't generally them trying to get away, but why they use their get out of jail free cards. And it's usually for damage. All 3 of Riven Q's, used right on someone's face. Yasuo E is placed on a champion to deal damage and move around the fight. Yasuo's Wind wall is generally used to stop a cc from hitting him in a fight. I will NEVER let a Morgana Q hit me, especially when Jinx is right there. It does not matter if I want it for after the fight, it benefits me now.\n\n\nAnd when you're going to make an argument, please don't be snarky. Display your points so the other person can display their points. The point isn't to win your side, the idea is to bring two or more sides to a point up and discuss each. However, both parties have to be willing to look at each side equally. I don't have half the information from you when you just say LB doesn't die if she doesn't want to. Zed doesn't have an escape? lol. Which escape are you talking about? Both of them are aggressive and you play around them, \nAlso, last thing, read the entire post I made, and realize I was talking about Teamfights and included that 1v1's are a completely different story. Ganking them is a different story. But a 5v5 fight is completely different.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-01-18T20:18:13.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"You could make that \"hope they fuck up\" argument for any champion. \"If they miss that skill shot; If they don't roam; If they don't wait out CC ... they're bad\"\n\nGetting out alive means jack all, you don't have to kill your lane opponent to win lane. It's undoubtedly useful when the junglers get involved which is why they can be such strong competitive picks. But on the other hand, that's still kinda situational. \nE.g.

So is LB and Yasuo has no escapes no matter how crosseyed his opponents are. If you're tanky (or strong) enough to bodyblock Lee's Q, he's only got a low range Insec to fall back on.

He's a top teir duelist at all levels, lane bully early game, and split pusher mid/late game. He's useless when shut down, but is exceedingly hard to do so for most of the champion roster. The risk/reward paradigm just isn't there.\n\n>Riven\n\nOh gods, the snowball potential. High mobility, high burst, high DPS, AD scaling shield. Thankfully they nerfed her early game.\nThe real problem with Riven is the burst. I've never had problems with your standard riven; but you can always recognize a regular by the animation canceling. She can turn what should be about 3-5 seconds of DPS into a Rengar Style insta-gib - Starting with a Stun!.\nOf course, only Riven and ADCs (orb-walking) are allowed to animation cancel. Do it on anyone else, and it's actually *bannable*!\n\n>Lee Sin\n\nThis guy is actually easy to summarize: \"kit overload\".\nHigh mobility, high base damage, high scaling, good sustain, High utility, blatant favoritism by Riot. The only thing keeping this guy in check is his skill floor.\nHe's [debatabley] the flashiest champion in league and one of the most consistent picks in pro play. He's so strong, that he has single-handedly dictated the jungle meta for most of his existence. And the moment he falls out of favor, the bastard gets ~~straight buffs~~ quality of life improvements that shouldn't affect high level play.\nBecause of this, he's also one of the most popular champions in league. And lets be honest, playing him properly is *hard*. Which means riot can just rattle off his win rate at low elo and claim he's balanced (For any other champion, \"win rate is rarely indicative of balance\").\n\nBut I digress. Lee Is just flat overloaded. He has all the tools to out-play most of the champion roster when and how he wants with incredibly safety. You don't actually beat a good Lee, you're just there when he F's up. *Unless* you play a specific subset of OP champions, allowed to exists for the sake of jungle diversity (see: Lee, Elise, Vi jungle of S3).\n\n>Fizz\n\nThis guy is also easy.\nHigh burst and mobility is fine on an assassin - they're basic tools of the trade.\n0.75 seconds of untargetability every 4.4 seconds (45% CDR) attached to a 400 range dash. . . Now we have an issue. \nTroll pole your initiation, combo you, troll pole your retaliation, turret dive for the kill, troll pole turret agro. \"outplayed\"\nGive the troll pole a more meaningful CD, and he won't be an issue.\n\n>Yasuo\n\nAdmittedly, I don't have the most popular opinion on this one. I'm all for the out-play potential on this guy. I'm *not* all for the ridiculous amount of safety nets he gets.\nI've trashed him with hard counter*s*, hard counter*ed*, and just about everything in between. And for all my hard work, what do I get? He can't solo carry the game anymore. (>_>)\n**Weaknesses/safety nets:**\n-*Situational ult*\nBut can be used on *any* displacement; not just knock-ups and not just his own.\n-*Situational mobility*\nBut has almost no CD and is strongest in lane phase.\n-*Situational CC*\nRequires 3 Q stacks, which last 10 seconds, has no resource investment, and super low CD.\n-*Reduced late-game DPS*\nIn exchange for a lot of free stats resulting in super early power spikes ensuring that he never truly falls behind meaningfully.\n-*squishy*\nHas a huge low CD shield refreshed by ult and windwall.\n-*Windwall has a high cooldown*\nIt completely deletes any bullet that touches it (and associated skill) resulting in some weird interactions (see Nami and talon ults). Has a hit-box bigger than him, which means he can sit in for 4 seconds of 100% projectile immunity.\n-*often gets focused in teamfights resulting in above average death counts*\nGee..... I wonder why?\n\nPoint is: Yasuo either hard carries, or is average. Beating him means ***nothing***, losing means you potentially threw the game. *That* is infuriating.\n\n>LeBlanc\n\nDash->blink back, repeat.\nSlow->root, repeat.\nBurst 1/3 your health, repeat.\nYa, her ult makes for some really f'ed up combos.\n\nOh, look, you caught her!\n. . . Oh look, it's her passive again.\n\nThere's a reason a lot of junglers don't bother ganking LB.\n\n>Irelia\n\nPunishes you for punishing her. Passive is super annoying in team fights.\n\n>Vladimir\n\nA tank that heals and does damage - both in spades. Troll pool.\nEnough said.\n\n----------------------------\n----------------------------\n\nThe common trend with frustrating champions isn't when they are OP/UP or they're ability to play around others. Give them every tool in they world, I don't care (personally). The problem is when those out-play tools remove or severely limit your ability to out-play them in return. When your only option to beat (not just go even) another champion, is to hope they F up, there's a problem. Similarly, you have a problem when beating a champion has no significant value.\n\nI don't mind getting out-played. I *welcome it*. Just like you said, losing in a match of skill is interesting and potentially educational. I got trashed by a Nami mid once - one of the most fun lanes I've had. I've done Vel'koz/Zyra and Veiger/Azir match-ups - had a blast.

Lee Sin's ult is also point and click. LB's mimick is point and click when used to mimick Q. Point and click abilities aren't bad as a concept. Their effect is either toxic or not depending on what it is. Zed's Ult doesn't do instant damage and it's damage depends a lot on what he does and how many of his skillshots hits aftewards and also it can be completely denied and/or dodged.

To put it simply, skill floor is how well you have to play a champion to see success with them, while skill cap is how much more success you can accumulate by becoming skilled at the champion. \n\nSure, {{champion:238}} and {{champion:64}} have high skill caps that result in skilled players making God tier plays that are fun to watch, but they also have fairly low skill floors. This means that unskilled players can pick them up and still do fairly well after a couple of games. As well as a 4K game Zed main? No. But well enough to pull out more wins than they should be able to. \n\nZed is unfun because he isn't punished for missing his Q, as it costs no mana. He's unfun because one five unit misstep means getting hit by two Qs and an E, automatically proccing Thunderlord's and taking 3/4 of your HP after his first back. He's unfun because he has no prerequisites to do reliable damage aside from \"wait for R to be up\" and can mindlessly all in you in a wave (or even under tower) because he has access to two blinks (plus flash). He's unfun because he can then use that absurdly reliable mobility and burst to run to another lane, dive your teammates with relatively low risk, get out, come back to lane, and one shot an entire wave. He's unfun because he can literally all in one person and kill someone else by accident with AOE (Thunderlord's only makes it worse). To sum it up, he's unfun because he has no real weaknesses. Certainly far less than most assassins. \n\nLee Sin is unfun because you don't actually have to be a God to do anything on this champion, much like Zed. You can literally miss your Q and be rewarded for it with your passive. He is unfun because his base damages are honestly ridiculous and, while he does fall off, he's still fairly useful all game. He is unfun because he's absurdly mobile. With the vision changes, odds are you'll never find Lee Sin without his ward jump available, and contrary to popular belief, it is not hard to ward jump. Lee has defined weaknesses late game, but he's too easy to pick up for what he can become when you start to play him well. I can respect a top tier Lee Sin play and I love to see them, but Lee missing his Q three times and getting to beat the shit out of you with passive+ red buff because of it is ridiculous. You shouldn't ever be rewarded for mistakes. Oh, and no. It isn't hard to Q someone at point blank range, ult them away, and jump to them. It looks cool, but it doesn't make anyone InSec. It's a basic function of the champion that literally anyone can do if they hit their abilities in the right order. So basically Ryze.\n\n{{champion:105}} and {{champion:92}} are completely different. They're not relatable to the other two at all, in my opinion, or each other for that matter. \n\nFizz is just Fizz. He's easy as hell to play and while you can learn a few tricks, his skill cap isn't that high up there at all. It's not like you can really make \"huge outplays\" that often on Fizz. You use your combo, you kill someone. You E and avoid some damage. Cool, Yi can do that too. If you're playing Fizz, one shotting someone, and then \"outplaying\" and getting more kills without ult, you probably aren't outplaying anyone. You're just so fed that you're killing people in two basic abilities.\n\nI might get hate for this but, uh... Riven isn't very good right now. Yeah, if you're good with her, you can do some impressive (and respectable) shit, but I'm not sure how people are getting pubstomped by non Riven mains. Honestly, I don't think that they are. I think that the Riven they remember is the main who beat their ass, and not the one who heard Riven was pretty good and died five times in eight minutes... or the million Rivens that were never picked because there are a dozen champions that do her job twice as well with none of the risks. Compared to the other three here, Riven has the highest skill floor currently. That might change if she keeps getting buffed, though.\n\nSo, yeah. I give credit where credit is due for impressive plays, but the bar is pretty high. A Q ult combo on Lee Sin is a basic champion mechanic, not an InSec tier play. I've seen it a hundred thousand times and it never gets more impressive. A Zed player pulling a perfect 1v3 while only a little ahead is cool, but you know what isn't? A Zed player missing all his Qs, finally landing one combo after missing forty, and killing you because he never had to back since he doesn't need mana. Again, Fizz is Fizz. I play him, he's a pretty bullshit champion. He isn't hard. I don't find his plays terribly flashy. You land a shark and kill, you miss it and don't. That's pretty much it. You get fed, you Q+W or E+Q someone and they die. Wow, LCS level play. Truly outstanding.

Even LeBlanc, though anyone can combo and delete squishes on her, has some complex mechanics like moving your clone to bait the enemy. Lee Sin has a plethora of combos that he can use to outplay his enemy. Zed's shadow management is hard to master, but watch any good montage and you'll have a tough time even keeping track of him as he kills his enemies. Riven is THE animation cancelling champion. Fizz, too, has mechanics such as his E and flash, and cancelling his ult animation with Q. His early laning too, is very hard to play against ranged champions. \n\nWhat makes all these champions popular, in part, is the amount of dedication you need to master them.
