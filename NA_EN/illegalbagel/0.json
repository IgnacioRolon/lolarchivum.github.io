There's always been a a slight feeling that the number is too high. But, we aren't convinced that lowering it makes for a better game.  \n\nAt the current number, it creates interesting decisions for players.  Do you stick around for longer and risk your life for the turret? Do you attempt to create more pressure in lane?  It's possible we could retain the those questions with a lower number, but nothing about the decisions it's creating would make us want to change the bonus amount.\n\nThe other important question, that other posters already reflected on, is what is it doing to the game pacing?  It is a snowball mechanic, and on the patch it was released we saw the expected increase of snowballing off of the first tower. However, the movement wasn't that large, and there was a general sentiment I'd heard and agreed with that the game wasn't snowbally enough at that point in time. Winning lane or early game contributions didn't hold enough weight. \n\nI don't know that we're in a perfect state now for pacing.  But we've had game states in the past that were much more snowbally by my personal feel.  If we determine that pacing is an issue and the game gets too snowballed, I don't know that we would actually reduce the bonus gold here, and might instead use a different lever.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2016-12-28T12:52:26.040+0000","up_votes":67,"down_votes":9,"body":"it doesn't do anything creative\n\nit makes people ganking as 5 botlane, getting 2 kills+first tower+drake and auto-win the game\nhow creative is this?
