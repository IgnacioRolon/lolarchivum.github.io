Usually giving hard CC to a carry champion is so they can land their damage easier (from my understanding). But Xayah's hard CC basically is her damage and it makes her ult a neat instant teamfight winner. \n\nNow personally I enjoy playing her. I'm not very good at positioning the feathers, but it feels very satisfying to land a root with them. It makes me feel tricky, like I'm planning a few steps ahead (most of the time I just try to set up enough in one area quickly though). I didn't know you could move while casting her Q at first, which gives even more playmaking potential without being \"hyper mobile\". \n\nPart of me wants to say she could use some damage nerfs, but that's only because I keep getting surprised by her E damage. She might be balanced, who knows? \nAll I know is that when she's with Rakan, towers fall much faster than against any other adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-05-12T22:03:19.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only tried her in ARAM but really, I was also surprised by the E damage.
