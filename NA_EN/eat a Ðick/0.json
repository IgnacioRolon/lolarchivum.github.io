That being said when i run ping tests elsewhere my ping seems to be alright. So far i've run the Hextech Repair Tool and tried resetting my net. What do you guys think I should do to fix my issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-29T18:13:42.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Often when there are latency (ping) issues during specific hours, it's a result of network traffic rerouting by an ISP in order to mitigate network congestion. I'd like you to run a traceroute log during the problematic hours so we can get a good idea of what's going on.\n\nI'd recommend running this with a network app called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/). Simply boot up the app, then plug in 104.160.131.1 into the host IP field and start the trace. After the trace has passed 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them here.\n\nLet me know if you run into issues with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Eat A Ðick","date":"2016-09-30T02:39:39.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.0.1 -    0 |  454 |  454 |    0 |    0 |   14 |   14 |\n\n|        cpe-76-185-192-1.satx.res.rr.com -    0 |  454 |  454 |    5 |   14 |  167 |   12 |\n\n|       tge0-0-0.snaxtx4901h.texas.rr.com -    0 |  454 |  454 |   16 |   28 |  106 |   25 |\n\n|          agg66.snantxvy01r.texas.rr.com -    0 |  454 |  454 |   19 |  171 |  413 |  151 |\n\n|          agg23.dllatxl301r.texas.rr.com -    0 |  454 |  454 |   13 |   22 |   57 |   16 |\n\n|bu-ether14.dllstx976iw-bcr00.tbone.rr.com -    0 |  454 |  454 |   12 |   22 |   40 |   20 |\n\n|            0.ae2.pr1.dfw10.tbone.rr.com -    0 |  454 |  454 |  120 |  298 |  538 |  514 |\n\n|                           24.27.236.233 -    0 |  454 |  454 |   14 |   19 |   33 |   16 |\n\n|                          104.160.134.35 -    0 |  454 |  454 |   29 |  177 |  419 |  155 |\n\n|          ae35-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  454 |  454 |   30 |   38 |   68 |   36 |\n\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  454 |  454 |   31 |   38 |   52 |   36 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  454 |  454 |  148 |  354 |  608 |  322 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\n\nHere is what i got after 5 minutes\n\nHere is a screen shot just in case too since it looks kinda weird. https://gyazo.com/64bcbe72f27250bb804433b8fe3f7a57","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T15:33:24.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems your latency jumps up to 167ms on the first hop outside your home network and continues to fluctuate to upwards of 538ms along your route to the server.
