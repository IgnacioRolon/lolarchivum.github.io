In case Riot is running out of ideas (ahem.. *cough* Ivern *cough*)\n\nI&#039;m not pushing a name or anything but Bushido would probably be a good name. Obviously he would have traditional samurai attire, and he would probably fit very well with the lore. Samurai hate ninjas. Zed and Shen are ninjas (and Akali?).\n\nEDIT: Guys go look at Yasuo and Master Yi's lore, they are swordsman, NOT samurai. Regardless, yes samurai are known to be swordsmen, but just because we already have 2, doesn't mean a third one, completely different should be out of question.........\n\nJust thought i&#039;d share my random thought.
