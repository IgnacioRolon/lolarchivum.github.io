So you would start off with about 2/3 of what you&#039;d get with only flat health seals, which would leave quints open for whatever. Of course it would scale better into the late game, but it is definitely nothing much.\r\nwith 3000 hp you&#039;d get a bonus 270 HP. You could have just went hp/lv seals for the 216 health at lv 18 and you&#039;d have your quints open for whatever.\r\nI think the %health runes could use a buff. No one ever uses them for a reason, they are far too weak. I realized this messing with runes for a support page (nautilus).\r\nI think boosting seals from 0.5% -&gt; 0.75% and quints from 1.5% -&gt; 2.25% would still be healthy, and definitely add a reason to consider using the runes. That would total it to 13.5% from 9%.\r\nThat means at lv 1 with 600 hp you&#039;d get a bonus of 81 health. slightly over what you would get with flat health seals. However lets not forget you are also using your quints here. So it balances out.\r\nwith 3000 hp you&#039;d get a bonus of 405 hp. If you are going for a very high HP build like 4000 hp that&#039;d get you a bonus 540 hp. Even then, especially for supports it&#039;d be a tough choice to sacrifice 4*3=12 armor from quints alone for 6.75% max health boost. It is a weaker start.\r\nI just think we have some runes in the shadow of the more mainstream stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryuyah","date":"2016-10-03T23:30:53.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"{{item:1401}} {{item:1409}} {{item:1413}} give 15% bonus HP\nStack it with %HP runes and you get loads of free HP","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-10-04T00:31:08.547+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically only health-stacking junglers can get them to \"not shit\" status.

For example, lets think about %Max Health vs Flat and Scaling Health seals:\n\n* Flat gives you 72. \n* Scaling gives 12 at level 1, 216 at level 18. \n* % health gives 4.5% of max health. \n\nFrom that, we know:\n\n* Scaling Health outscales Flat at level 6. \n* % max health is better than Flat at 1600 HP. (In game, this is level 9 with one health item)\n* % Max Health is better than Scaling at early levels. At level 1, you need 266 base health to match. At level 2, you need 533 (I believe the lowest - excluding Kled - is Anivia, and she will hit this with Dorans). At level 3, you need 800 - a small handfull of champs will hit this with their starting items alone, but a decent amount will hit this with their starting item+Veterans scars. At level 4, you need 1066, which is practically impossible. \n* Everything aside from health stacking supertanks are better with Scaling Health at level 18 (unless you get more than 4,844 HP)\n\nSo what does it mean? % max health is the bridge between the two. Its not as strong as Flat at level 1-3, but its stronger than Scaling. Its not as strong as Scaling at 1600 HP, but its stronger than Flat. Its a neutral choice between the health options if you arent sure if youre going to survive 1-3, but want something that scales into the game. \n\nThe problem I see is that at the end of the day, the difference between Flat and Scaling Health at level 1 is 60 HP. Thats like, at max, 2 autoattacks. There really is no need for the middleground, since the decision to pick one over the other has a minuscule impact in-game and for the first 5 minutes of the game. The problem with buffing the middleground to a point of reasonable viability is that they become so strong that both the Flat and the Scaling would be second-best. Youre basically deleting two other sets just to make 1 set viable, instead of having 2 viable sets with 1 set unviable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-10-04T00:27:25.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, this is a good point, but if these runes are buffed too much then some\nchamps will be buffed in the process.

They are way behild, only benefitial to chos mundos and afk farm sions. Just kidding, not even on them. Your suggestion brings the breakpoint to 3200 hp, pretty spot on number.
