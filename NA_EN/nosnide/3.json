Then it got silly. They were unkillable no matter how much CC I put out with nautilus, the twitch would sometimes sneak in, the hecarim tank AF and dealing so much freaking damage would just ult to the back line, and the Leona ult would catch at least 1 or 2 people, then ahri charms. The karma damage is insane compared to how tanky she becomes wit her shield and shit. Late game was a freaking night mare. We couldn&#039;t win a single team fight. This is insane. I am trying to just laugh it off and not tilt. but holy shit what do you do when you hit this unmoving wall? The most insane game ever. They&#039;re team was literally unkillable. One time Hecarim dived 3v1 at late game and tanked like 5-6 tower shots + Caitlyn attacks, while I CC&#039;d him, plus ori attacks, and only lost 2/3 HP, and killed cait and got away. It was just ridiculous...... We tried so hard to win but like what do you do? I don&#039;t think it was possible to win that","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-12-09T05:31:43.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That looks more like a colossal throw than an op team.","replies":[{"poster":"Nosnide","date":"2016-12-09T05:34:12.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=I am Pacman,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IMRdGXQR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-09T05:31:43.592+0000)\n>\n> That looks more like a colossal throw than an op team.\n\nWell we got *dragon* and they came in and we had a team fight. Well they melted our whole team and I think we only got 1 or 2 of them. This was pretty much just after lane phase had ended. At about 20 minutes. We had just started grouping. Once it was about team fights and not roams, ganks and catching people off, we were playing by their rules. Like there was nothing we could do against them in team fights.","replies":[{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-12-09T05:57:03.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Username,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IMRdGXQR,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-09T05:34:12.895+0000)\n>\n> Like there was nothing we could do against them in team fights.\n\nthe power of a good twitch with a good initiation\nwhy do you think people ban twitch all the time nowadays, he is worse than vayne","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-12-09T05:48:24.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's just 8k lead, happens all the time\n\ni saw it can happen even with 12+k lead\n\np.s. also the main reason for your loss seems to be twitch and his very strong late game, especially together with hecarim/leona. twitch seems the main reason of your early lead too; note also that shyvana kind of falls of late game and cait falls of mid being strong again late (not that strong as twitch)","replies":[]}]}
