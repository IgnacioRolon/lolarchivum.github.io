The reason why I was AFK at the start of the match was because I got a knock on my door. I needed to get that and it was a friend who needed something of me. I figured why not, the game will just remake and no loss will be dealt to anyone. Unfortunately, no loss was had from that remake match but I received a big penalty of a 10 minute wait before queuing to a match for 5 matches. So there will be a total of 50 minutes I have to just wait before a match to queue as a penalty for my first time cause to a remake. And I don't even have a record of dodging, or AFK what so ever either. This is very harsh honestly. And I do understand that on the other side of the coin people get very frustrated when they have to remake, so some punishment is reasonable to contain it. However, first time offenders, or even offenders that haven't committed the act in over a month shouldn't get such harsh punishment. Is there a reason why I got this high of a punishment? or is that simply the lowest punishment there is for being AFK? If so I think it could use a nerf, or a slight tweaking to favor the accidental, but still punish those frequent trolls.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T01:58:16.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll never receive a penalty such as this for a single game. It actually takes a trend of disconnections or going AFK before you see a 5-game penalty. I took a look at your account and it looks like you've left/gone AFK a few games within the last 30 days, so this was likely the cause of your penalty.\n\nIf you're experiencing a technical issue that causes you to disconnect from matches, please let me know. I hope this clears up your confusion about the system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chrisvj","date":"2016-10-16T18:53:42.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you broke the \"Summoner's Code\" that you agree to... then complain about the consequences? \"don't leave the game or go AFK\" http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/","replies":[]}]}
