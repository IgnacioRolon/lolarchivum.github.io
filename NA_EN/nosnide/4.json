He has a lane phase with a lot of free stats, damage and kit sustain, also very low cost abilities. He is also a nightmare in a team fight because he is very tanky, meanwhile still dealing a lot of damage to anyone in range. In team fights it is especially hard to kill him because while there are more people to cc him, there are also more people for him to heal off of with his Q. mid-late game he heals for 36% missing health wit his Q, and he is always built full tank which normally means he is healing for about 1000 health. Not to mention this is an ability that when maxed is on a 5 second cooldown. with a Black cleaver alone it becomes a 4 second cooldown. \n\nThen the icing on the cake is his ultimate. An ability with decent base damage and scaling damage (75% AD), but that can also be increased by 20% for every auto attack/ability he used on you. With his slow, and pull, if he is in range to ult you he most certainly is able to at least get 3 hits on you before doing so. It is almost a guarantee he will get 60% bonus damage on his ult. Oh and of course it needs to be true damage.\n\nNot only is he strong in lane phase, but he also gets some love late game with a cooldown resetting overload on his ultimate when it is maxed (level 16). There is nothing more necessary in a strategy game then seeing a Darius dunk back to back, because why not fuck it.\n-----------\nTL;DR I know the argument with Darius is that he doesn&#039;t do well, and his win rate is normally at a balanced state 49-51%, or below satisfactory. My thing is **what does it take to get this champion right? How many times are you going to buff him to get him fixed? I don&#039;t think he needs anymore free stats, or free sustain etc. I think something else might be his problem.**\n\nIt is laughable that my main Wukong can maintain the same win rate as Darius while having a lot less to show for it when you look at his abilities. Darius&#039; problem needs to be something else.\n-----------\nFor those that don&#039;t know Darius was buffed in:\n8.4, 7.24, 7.22, and was nerfed in 7.2\nSo 3 buffs in a row, because he is that bad off apparently.","replies":[{"poster":"YaÅ›uo Main","date":"2018-03-20T10:45:32.674+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"why you keep saying free sustain like he heals on every ability he has","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-03-20T11:27:01.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"free\n\nwhen it's so hard to hit Q in a teamfight in high elo\n\nlol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SeductiveCelery","date":"2018-03-20T04:11:16.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"darius is a juggernaut","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-20T19:04:33.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn to take advantage of items with grievous wounds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2018-03-20T16:33:12.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It is laughable that my main Wukong can maintain the same win rate as Darius while having a lot less to show for it when you look at his abilities.

He gets kited by competent ranged champions. He is Juggernaut. Not unlike Illaoi, Nasus etc.\n\nKassadin gets free damage reduction vs mages, but not vs AD champions.\n\nJax poops on auto attack reliant champs - Maokai loves it when he's up against spell spammers.\n\nEach champion has his or her strengths. Darius does NOTHING at all to anyone outside of his E range, period. Which can be side stepped, no less. If his enemies play properly, Darius has to E them or burn Flash otherwise he has zero damage uptime on them at all. Seems somewhat reasonable to give him reliability vs melee, at least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2018-03-20T04:21:59.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Food for mages in teamfights lol","replies":[]}]}
