Of course she is going to contribute more to the damage department because she wont be contributing things like the wukongs knockup or his w clone.  She is hard to compare to other champions because she sacrifices everything else for more damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Nosnide","date":"2017-02-24T06:16:55.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea but damage in itself provides a lot. She had very good zone potential. If she catches you with  a tentacle and pulls you they can make it that more difficult to then win a team fight, she has range, AoE, a slow, and lasts the entire team fight with all that insane sustain on top of being able to go full tank and still out damage the ADCs.\n\nSeems a little odd to me, but i'll go with what you said. I shall continue to fear her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2017-02-24T06:38:57.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illaoi is extremely strong if you fight her head on. She's strong either as, with or against splitpushers and has seen pro play. If you run into her, she will destroy your entire team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-02-24T06:24:07.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is powerful certainly and if she is ahead sufficiently ahead then she starts being able to facetank damage and also deal fucktons in return while healing it so it feels unfair as fuck when behind against her. One of her biggest strengths is being able to harass the enemy while they are trying to defend the tower and effectively zone them off of it. \n\nBiggest thing is do everything possible to avoid getting hit by E and immedietly disengage (hopefully you have dash/flash/janna/your team also disengages) as soon as she ultis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-02-24T06:18:28.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Without a doubt she's one of the most poorly designed champions in the game, but posting a single game like that where she did alot of damage doesn't really prove anything.","replies":[]}]}
