I just got this suspension now. Why and how so, This seems fairly dumb and unreasonable seeing as I had people that Didn't report me and i was with my friends. They did not report me so i'm wondering why I got this suspension.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T22:51:30.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, yea that'd be pretty shitty if we banned you just for doing poorly in a match. I took a look over the game chat logs, and they paint a preeeeeetty different picture of what happened. You mentioned several times throughout the game that you were going to intentionally feed each lane, then were going to purposefully AFK. These types of behavior only hurt the other players experiences, and it looks like most of the players in that game reported you for those actions.","replies":[{"poster":"WiccanBKaplan","date":"2017-06-24T00:37:38.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS SNATCH HIS WEAVE","replies":[]}]}]}
