You could try reaching out to their player support specifically, or better yet I have a much quicker way to find out. With league being a F2P game, go ahead and create a new account on the Turkey server and hop into a practice/custom game. That'd be the quickest and easiest method to test your ping on those servers in an actual game ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Quinnstance","date":"2017-06-26T23:54:20.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help!
