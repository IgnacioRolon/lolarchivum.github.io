That \"click\" sound when you press one of your skill buttons? The \"cannot cast skill right now\" noise? All muted (via legal mods).\n\nThis game is actually noisy as fuck. I'm surprised no pros have muted their pings and/or HUD.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-10-24T04:59:11.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Why don't you create a mute all button instead of forcing me to type /mute all or resize my chat window every single game. If you refuse to deal with the toxic community you created, then maybe you should give players that are not toxic the option to ignore them. I don' care what anyone who plays the game or is  Red Name, you do not ban nearly enough people for toxic and immature behavior. There is way too many rude, immature children sitting in their parent's basement being toxic to players that want to enjoy the game. Fix the problems and don't tell us to move a chat bar.","replies":[{"poster":"FÅ‚ame","date":"2016-10-24T07:27:36.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're blaming riot for something they can't control. People will be people, and unfortunately people are toxic. Report toxic people. If you're muting everyone before you even know if they're toxic or not, how will you be able to report them?\nMuting everyone out of nowhere is toxic because it's a team game, and quite frankly the way you brought this topic up and replied to the riot staff here is similar to all those toxic people we see in game...\nWhat the current system is designed for you to do is individually mute whoever _begins_ being toxic, so you don't have to listen to that person being toxic _anymore._ **Unless** literally everyone is being toxic to you, you should not be muting everyone all at once. If you mute _everyone,_ you're also muting that \"1%\" of nice people without even knowing they're nice. The only situation in which what you suggest would be helpful is if **all** of your team mates and/or the enemy team are being toxic.\nOnly mute the toxic players; don't jeopardize the nice players because someone else was being toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanjie","date":"2016-10-26T16:32:21.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot doesn't care about their community. I can have a child, like two days ago when I played, call me every derogatory LGBT insult in the game and he won't be banned. I can have a child feed intentionally and make it to where the system reads it like he is playing. I can have a child throw games because they are offended by another toxic players rants about him, thus effect everyone else. Riot DOESN'T CARE. They need to ban more people. They need to start caring about their community. They need to stop going on podcasts and interviews telling the community they want to communicate and care more, but aren't doing it. Don't punish the good players that are not toxic. Ban the filth or give me an option to permanently do it all at once. I have no faith in this community anymore. Almost every single player is toxic and rude.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-10-24T06:47:22.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait I don't understand, why not just !mute all then don't unmute anybody?","replies":[]}]}
