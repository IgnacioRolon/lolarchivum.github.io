I always out-cs her and I almost never give her any kills (then again I rarely kill her, but I do put her on edge), but it's just weird fighting the same lane over and over again (To be completely fair, they usually have a different skin on each time).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else ever fight the same lane whenever they play a specific champion? Does it annoy you?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone find Ahri OP? I feel that she's rather lackluster compared to Karthus.","replies":[]}
