I have no idea what's happened, but it seems 10 times harder to get people to try anything out of the ordinary, or persevere just a little bit more in tough games, or not flip out or give up at the drop of a hat. I seem to be running into all the people in moba communities that I wish I could avoid like the plague. But now, they're all I see in matchmaking lately. I don't know what it is.\n\nGlad you've had better luck. Not sure why I haven't. Can't for the life of me figure out why so many people are bent on meta-pushing in a very unusual pre-season that, for all intents and purposes, doesn't HAVE a meta. Seriously, nobody has a freaking clue what a winning combination is right now! The only certainties are a) melt towers and b) play Yasuo. Everything else is debatable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-11-17T07:31:02.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support Ashe got nerfed to shit with her rework. Her laning phase sucks now that she doesn't get free crits on her autos and now that multiple volley arrows can hit the same minion. Then they also removes Zekes Herald which was an item absolutely made for support Ashe. 20% cdr AOE AD and lifesteal to beef up her ADC and her attacks a little bit. Now they even nerfed CDR boots. Before you could just get Zekes', 5% cdr from masteries, and 15% from boots and your volley was on a 3 second cd. Now it's not so easy to get full CDR. Here's an old thread where I went into detail on it.\n\nThe only buffs she has, post rework, is to her hawkshot being global and her slow not costing mana. But her slow isn't as good anymore. Anyway, if I were you I'd try going with the 45% cdr mastery for more volleys.\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4714903&page=1","replies":[]}]}
