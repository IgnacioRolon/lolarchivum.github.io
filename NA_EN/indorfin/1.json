Sometimes their Vayne and Nasus are already reaching their lategame spikes while your Shaco runs around and tries to finish his first item, and playing on would be a legitimate waste of time, even in ranked.

They probably know already.\"\n\nI'm not sure what you call \"grief\", but stating something simple and useful like, \"we gotta watch the bard/'mumu combo ults. They cancel.\" is not \"grief\" nor should it be shunned, nor should it be assumed your team noticed. A lot of players will go through a face-roll fight like that and use it as an excuse to pretend the other team is hopelessly far ahead, completely ignoring the factors that resulted in the lost teamfight. Factors that can be eliminated in the next fight.\n\nIf you're concerned about players snapping over advise, don't be. I probably stopped being upset over videogames when I was 10. If people haven't, they need the practice. Seriously, if someone is snapping over perfectly neutrally-posed suggestions, they NEED THE PRACTICE and OPPORTUNITY to take those comments the RIGHT way.\n\nWhether they do or not should not be your concern. You might lose a game if they have an unjustified emotional meltdown over it, but what SHOULD be your concern, more than that? The fact that the League experience is going to decay even more if you stop giving MEANINGFUL advice. We already have enough utterly pointless comments/\"advice\" people make when they're upset with a teammate (i.e. \"quit sucking\", \"so-and-so useless\", \"troll\", and my personal favorite in champ select, \"don't feed\"). Are you gonna make matters worse by eliminating the few USEFUL comments that players can actually DO something with?\n\nP.S. My note to those RECEIVING advice: \"Thank you Captain Obvious\" should be reserved for the pointless comments, (i.e. \"don't feed\"). If the suggestions are more specific, but you still think they're obvious, don't flip out over it. Just say, \"ditto\". Problem. Solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Indorfin","date":"2015-12-29T12:35:32.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your point, but at a gold-plat leveled game, you don't have to tell people that those spells don't work that way. Nothing like that mistake happened again, because it was an *obvious mistake.* And no, it isn't at all reasonable for players to get upset over legitimate advice, no matter how it's stated, but that doesn't change the fact that it does happen; I can upload countless videos of players becoming toxic or refusing to group with the team because I told the jungler that we can't lock down top, so they should leave me alone and gank bot instead, or because I asked them to try to be on the same side of the map as dragon when it spawns, or because I asked the support to use their sightstone. A lot of players are mature enough to just take advice as advice, and not flaming, but you're still risking that you're on a team with someone who's going to turn it into a gamelong argument, or has been behind and is just looking for a \"reason\" to AFK, especially when you've been losing all game. I'd rather not risk that over trying to help, because no matter how receptive they are, you are not going to fix another player in time for the next teamfight anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-12-29T16:55:46.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I already discussed all that in my second last paragraph. The question is whether you put the remnants of normal chat and player behavior above a successful game. I do the former, but then again, I'm not that competitive. Either choice is a decent option.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
