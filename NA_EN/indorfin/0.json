I&#039;ve never been sure why; seeing as Taric is supposed to be a tanky, in-your-face kind of support, as shown by his two AoE spells and on-hit passive, it seems counter-intuitive to reward him for \"landing\" a targeted stun from a long distance, especially when the reward is so small that I don&#039;t think anyone&#039;s ever actually accounted for it when they&#039;re playing.\n\nSince Taric is supposed to be a close range support, I think his stun should have increased duration when it travels short distances. This allows Taric&#039;s stun to have a little more strength for following up on cc&#039;d targets and peeling without giving it too much power for making picks and brawling in lane. This also allows for a little more counterplay, since carrying the stun out once you&#039;re targeted with a dash/blink will not only move you to safety, but decrease the duration.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-10T00:30:44.625+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"The damage actually increases the *closer* the enemy is to Taric, meaning a point blank stun actually deals about twice as much as a max range stun, which is actually very thematically relevant because being dazzled by a bright light would hurt you eyes more if it were right in your face.\n\nI like your idea though, but it probably isn't all that significant at this point, since they are working on his rework right now (he was the project that was running alongside Ryze (just released today) and Poppy (to be released later on in the year). That fact makes me think he'll probably be coming out within the next couple of months if everything goes according to Riot's schedule.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-04-10T03:08:11.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The sad thing about his stun is the further away the champion, the less the duration of the stun is...

It would simply make him too powerful to combat. Mind you, he already has incredible bursting power and functions as an anti-assassin tank (On even footing, Taric can out damage Master Yi). His strength is having a small, yet deadly range of power in a fashion not so different from brawlers like Trundle, Darius, or Garen. Unlike any of them, however, he doesn't have a grab (Darius), a speed boost (Garen), or some even ground between the two (Trundle). The only thing he has to close the gap is his stun, which only gives him enough time, even at max level, to run in, maybe get shatter off, and that's it. A smart player is not going to stick around long to allow Taric to burst them into oblivion.\n\nSo what should Taric's dazzle be replaced with? I don't know. It wouldn't make much sense for him to be leaping around the Rift like Braum, and his short range of bursting power would make any kind of speed boost too overpowered for him and fit poorly with his gems theme (besides, that's what Righteous Glory is for). One idea I had was to give him an obstacle/slow ability like Trundle's Ice Pillar, obstructing the enemy's movement and allowing him to close the gap while also giving the target a chance to either continue escaping or dig their heels in and stand their ground.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jv21blU7oD","date":"2015-04-10T11:16:08.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a point and click stun, it's already powerful enough and should be the last thing you'd want to buff on Taric.
