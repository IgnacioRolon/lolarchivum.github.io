Yes, you can bait it so hard that she misses it completely, however in most cases it is impossible to dodge. \n\nIt's not the AoE that's the problem, it's that it's treated like a skillshot (so it has nice range and good base damage) when it's not. Annie's Q is very strong poke but even that is less annoying, because it doesn't chunk you for 250 damage at lvl 9 from 1500 range.\n\nAnd not even this alone is the problem. Cassiopeia, Xerath and Syndra are just as bad. \nHowever, none of them have a big-ass shield that prevents them from dying even if you manage to get at them. Orianna has the same problem, however at least she can't 100-0 you so easily because her kit has less damage.\n\nI seriously don't see why Lux has to have a powerful defensive spell when she's so good at sieging. She already has her Q to keep people away, just like Syndra has her E and Xerath has his E.
