Everything went smooth, i downloaded the patch and enjoyed a couple games on the rift. After that i turned it off, left my home for the night and didnt return to the client til this morning. What surprised me this morning was when i attempted to login, it had notified me that my account was \"suspended permanently\" and i should check my e-mail account for details. Now me, im very confused as i had no warning of wrongdoing, i didnt do anything in those games that would get me permabanned, and i also hardly ever play as im away at school for 8 months a year. And to top it all off, there was no e-mail from riot explaining the details behind my ban. Now Im not entirely sure what happened to my account overnight when i wasn't playing, but im almost positive my account didn't go off on its own and get me banned. I was just curious as to see if this was a bug or not? Any help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-20T17:36:57.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, it looks like your account was suspended for suspicious activity.
