One of this details was the Decision to keep some Keystones (Thunderlords, Stormraiders)\r\nWhen I heard that Riot wanted to keep Stormraiders  I was super hyped because it was simply my favourite rune overall. But now months later even after a ton of buffs. Its just not the same.\r\n\r\nLets be real here: \r\nStormraiders was always designed to be an assasin rune  to make up for the lack of escape on some champs like Vlad and Talon. \r\nPhase Rush is the except opposite.\r\n It just makes champs that are supposed to be kiteable extremely sticky (Nasus, Darius, Garen, Xin) and is completely useless on others.\r\nHave you seen any assasin pick it ever since it was reworked? No? Me neither.\r\nWould it be great to have a rune for assasins that does just that? Probably.\r\n\r\nSo I beg you:\r\nPlease make some changes or even a new rune if thats possible to fill that hole.\r\n\r\nUpvote if you want Stormraiders back,\r\nDownvote if not.\r\n\r\nThank you for your Attention.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-08-04T00:53:58.980+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins don't pick it because they don't need it, damage done is all that matters atm and its much easier to kill your target and get out with the lack of dedicated supports and tanks.\n\nAnd you don't downvote a thread because you disagree with it due to your opinion, you downvote it if it lacks any content or has a straight forward enough answer to it so that it cannot spark conversation and debate.

I'm think particularly champions like Arhi (who doesn't need it but still) Cassi, Ryze, Karthus, Kennen, and Vlad. And I mean I feel like the problematic champions who abuse phase rush end up doing way more burst damage than these mages anyways, 1 Darius combo, 1 Nasus Q","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IdveYsUfSK","date":"2018-08-04T13:57:53.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"rofl stormraiders is not a assassin rune, its for immobile champs and mainly for juggernauts.\nmages and assassins were abusing it to remove their counterplay which is why its nerfed and replaced by phase rush.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-08-04T10:47:36.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually prefer phase over SRS after using it for a bit.

Thoguh luck, you die....Fed enough to get the threshhold on the back of a single abillity? Have an easy time to chase down that kill.\n\nThe Phase rush procs allow you to 100% plan you're combat patterns around them. The main issue is that the tuneing for most melees is a bit to low especially in the early(it's certainly high enough for battle mages) **and because the opportunity cost is to high, aka other runes offer to much by comparision**\nIf other runes get tuned down, especially in their raw combat power, utillity runes like phaserush and glacial augment actually become good options. But right now, what good does it to stick in a fight that you can't win becuase you give up to much combat power by going for the utillity?","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-08-04T15:43:03.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"except Stormraiders did exactly what you're saying Phase Rush does, making people extra stupidly sticky like Cassiopeia.","replies":[]}]}
