Oh, did i mention he makes use of lifesteal, and Energy, and has good ratios, and has been in a state of always on the strong side since nearly release?\n\nAll that being said, Zed has massive strengths and there is little opportunity to outplay him. He has a similar problem as Yasuo, even if you play perfectly, he has so few weaknesses that you very well may not be able to do anything about him anyways, even if you do buy items like Zhonya's or QSS (but hasn't Riot been in the mindset for many seasons at this point that counterplay should be on an individual skill level, not a stat/item check?)\n\nThis may not be the best way to curb some of Zed's strengths (which should be weaknesses) but I think it is highly inappropriate to consider Zed as a champion with \"windows of weakness\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blumpkin Nation","date":"2016-02-08T23:36:02.347+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with all of your points.

But the difference between them and Zed is that Zed can get in and out flawlessly unless you focus 100% of your CC at the exact moment. The reason why Zed is so strong is because we don't have any targeted CC to help lock him down. instead people are forced to use all their resources fighting him and then you have to deal with the rest of his team.\n\nI honestly think he needs a lot more risk in his play.

Playing against an assassin - a TRUE assassin - is frustrating, but I can respect it for the playstyle.  Zed is _not_ a true assassin since he violates the qualifications that the class has.  He has safe zoning farm,  easy wave clear, easy escapes, oops buttons, and he even has a free execute passive just because he might have a hard time killing 90% of the minions in lane.\n\nTo top it all off, despite Riot admitting DFG was providing unhealthy gameplay, you're steamrolling ahead with Duskblade, reasoning being  the exact reason DFG was removed, which will make Zed even stronger.

They both have good wave clear and a way to refund their resource.  The difference is that Annie has range and CC while Zed has mobility and safety.
