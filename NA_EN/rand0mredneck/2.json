Which is something I think was true of Borderlands and such too.\n\nMore on topic, I'd say Taliyah does have a personality, I just don't think it's a very impactful one.  In a world full of Southern Gentleman Fish Demons,  Extradimensional Floating Eyeball Scientists, and Rock Toting Battle Priestesses, Taliyah is...uh...she's a teenager who loves her family and can use rock magic.

It's a shame, because the VA is Matt Mercer, who is an incredible voice actor who can do a huge range of emotions, and they just give him \"growly\".  Braum is also fantastic.  I was a big fan of Tahm Kench too, a lot of his taunts and jokes are just really sassy and it's great.\n\nI wouldn't even say Kled's badly written, he's just not my style of humor, and that's fine, they can't all be.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2016-08-13T00:31:10.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New GP's biggest weakness is that there's no depth. \"The Dread Pirate\" is literally 100% of the character.
