I heard of league in 2009 and now, 2016 I have decided to play, I refused to play even when my best friends have played because I always heard comments on how the community makes you cry, how they are uncivilized, how they are idiotic and overall don't have a heart. So, why did I join? Because of my girlfriend, obviously. But still, I'm glad league is pushing something like his because most people don't join because of these stereotypes.
