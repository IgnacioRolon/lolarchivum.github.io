Hopefully you are rested and feeling an improved sense of health. (How are you recovering from the past few years, I know it has been a struggle and up-hill battle, but keep at it and take the breaks you need, no point in working yourself back to being bed-ridden)\n\nI'm happy this has finally bubbled to the surface, this has been a long time coming, and if we are being honest with each other it should have been planned and in production shortly after the retcon. If you get a chance, now that your back and since there has been so much radio silence, would you perhaps be willing to pick a time/date that you could create a thread and block off some time to hit the pavement so to speak with questions? I am sure a lot of us want to talk about cadence, direction of lore, and outstanding pain-points that still need addressing (Short-form bios being on that page is an easy one that I can throw out there as bait, Tahm Kench style.)\n\nSeriously though, welcome back it is good to see you again. Let's talk, but let's do it in the right setting with the right expectations.\n\nAKA: Jaredan, no more 4 AM threads while you should be resting! Block some time at work if you can, I know you've got a million threads of things going onto at once, but one community thread certainly won't break the bank right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-16T21:27:23.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank the crew for the present^^  I know what I'll be sifting through tonight :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-11-16T21:24:17.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=cixu3Wls,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-16T21:09:21.731+0000)\n>\n> Partly that yeah.

I don't trust the lore of champs because it is the most fluid aspect of them and is the easiest aspect of a champ for rito to gut.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elemental Lux","date":"2016-11-16T20:52:30.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gonna mention Lux's lore how and it doesn't interact with her kit, the spell thief who steals magic.
