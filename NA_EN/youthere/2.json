After every game I get the \"Trying to Reconnect\" dialog, followed by the 'waiting for stats' dialog which will then last until eternity. \r\n\r\nIt's kind of annoying issue because I can't honor players, chat, report, etc.\r\n\r\nPorts are all forwarded. I've tried the hextech repair tool. Firewall bypass is setup. Internet connection is fine all game, chat works all game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-02T03:18:19.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your connection is dropping out enough to prevent you accessing the post-game lobby, then there are likely some issues between your PC and our servers. Since it sounds like you've already run through all the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), we'll need to look at your network route to figure out where this issue is coming from. I'd like you to run a traceroute with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) in order to accomplish this. After loading up the app, simply plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and run the trace for 5 minutes. After you've finished the trace, you can export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you ran into any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"youthere","date":"2017-03-05T19:56:29.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.0.1 -    0 |  296 |  296 |    1 |   11 |  287 |    1 |\n\n|                          142.254.155.17 -    0 |  296 |  296 |    9 |   28 |  514 |   13 |\n\n|                           24.164.107.69 -    0 |  296 |  296 |   17 |   92 |  675 |   24 |\n\n|         be23.clhgohcc01r.midwest.rr.com -    1 |  292 |  291 |   12 |   28 |  478 |   17 |\n\n|         be14.clevohek02r.midwest.rr.com -    0 |  295 |  295 |   12 |   35 |  524 |   34 |\n\n|         be25.clevohek01r.midwest.rr.com -    1 |  292 |  291 |   13 |   34 |  421 |   18 |\n\n|bu-ether17.vinnva0510w-bcr00.tbone.rr.com -    0 |  295 |  295 |   21 |   41 |  490 |   42 |\n\n|bu-ether11.asbnva1611w-bcr00.tbone.rr.com -    1 |  292 |  291 |   23 |   44 |  398 |   31 |\n\n|            0.ae2.pr0.dca10.tbone.rr.com -    0 |  295 |  295 |   21 |   43 |  494 |   44 |\n\n|                            66.109.9.191 -    1 |  288 |  286 |   32 |   48 |  425 |   37 |\n\n|                          104.160.137.35 -    1 |  292 |  291 |   33 |   49 |  440 |   39 |\n\n|          ae35-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  295 |  295 |   32 |   50 |  500 |   47 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    1 |  292 |  291 |   33 |   51 |  403 |   39 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-05T23:53:12.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your traceroute reveals that your connection to our servers is fairly unstable.
