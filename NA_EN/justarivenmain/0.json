I think I may have commented on that thread? We keep in mind player requests for sure, and since we can't release them all at once, it may seem like we aren't hearing you. We have spaced dedicated to player concepts and ideas that we visit when we'restarting discussions around a new thematic for a champion, or when a holiday rolls around, like Snowdown.\n\nOn the contrary, there was actually a front page Reddit thread of a fan-created Arclight Yorick skin that popped up while we were in the middle of developing Arclight Yorick internally. There seemed to be a fairly big interest in the thematic there. Now, I'm not saying 'Reddit liked it, so we did the right thing', I'm saying that it was a suggested thematic elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-09-19T18:45:09.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Na if \"Reddit liked it\" you did the right thing :3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JustARivenMain","date":"2017-09-14T01:58:12.938+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Nzzbu6IM,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-09-13T23:22:35.462+0000)\n>\n> Hi JustARivenMain - \n> \n> I&#x27;m sorry to hear you&#x27;re disappointed with the new Yorick skin.

I honestly think a summoner theme would have been awesome, maybe even a full on corruption version of himself aswell, as for Arclight changes all I can say is I hope you guys do the best you can, and maybe had a \"Holy\" type of background noise to his voice so it isn't so gritty and not fit the theme of the skin.\n\nIt's totally on me for hoping for two Legendary skins for both my mains in the same year but what can you do eh?\n\nTotally appriciate the reply Katey, I know you guys try your best.. I know you guys didn't mean to make it feel rushed, or do it just to kill the meme. <3\n\n\nP.S: A sorta frost themed skeletal Dragon lich king-themed skin would be 10/10 for the future.\n\nEdit: ALSO, I don't post a lot, but this means a ton to me, I'd honestly even wait for a higher tier skin as a Legendary or Ultimate, as it's a major feelsbad for Yi to get two same tier skins in 5 months as Yorick in 6 years. (Ik he got a rework and all, but that was NEEDED for him to be noticed by Riot on the balancing team again.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2017-09-14T02:00:57.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We know why he had to wait so long, but it's just unfortunate that there's characters in the game that get 1-2 skins a year, and some (Like Yorick) that people have to wait for a bone to be thrown to.  Arclight, in my opinion, is one of the blandest skin lines ever created.  The only character I've even remotely enjoyed seeing it used on was Vel'koz, with Vayne being a followup.\n\nWhat really salts the wound too is that there were so many fan concepts and ideas that received hundreds, even thousands of upvotes over the years.  Arcade Yorick with a Pac Man theme, Crazy Cat Lady Yorick, and a couple others that have popped up.  To see that he gets Arclight is really disheartening, and this is as someone who plays him on and off.\n\nOverall, the skin screams rushed, and like it was created to end 'meme' material.  The fact that it's also not seeing a voice filter is just laughable.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-09-14T02:05:44.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">with Syndra being a followup.\n\nDo you mean Vayne?

Beekeeper Singed is a creative skin, which in comparison makes the Yorick skin feel even worse since Singed has many skins and still is getting good, creative skins but Yorick can't. Crazy Cat-lady Yorick would be a creative, interesting skin. A Poro-based Yorick skin would be very interesting and fun. Arclight might as well be a palate-swap - the only interesting thing going on is the change to the W and to a lesser extent the sound effects.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asamas","date":"2017-09-13T06:38:25.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but it's a Yorick skin and I am to buy it.
