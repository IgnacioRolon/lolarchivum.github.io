I like the idea of hastening the decay but I do not have the time to play 1 game every day.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like I am being punished for not being able to devote 4 hours a week to league of legends. 1 game every 10 days was already hard enough to keep track of and it is fine I guess for the (pro) players who do this for a living but I do not have the time for this while transitioning into grad school and I am very upset that I will probably just have to decay (and maybe sit myself at d1 into masters promos) for the rest of the season.\r\n\r\nI feel like Riot is just assuming that I have all the time in the world. I would still be fine if it was 2 games every 10 days or maybe even 3, but I cannot do 1 game every day. (yes I know you can store games, it just averages to 1 game every day).","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2016-09-07T20:00:03.063+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Obviously people who don't have time to play the game shouldn't just have accounts taking away a spot from someone who plays often enough to earn that spot","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-07T20:24:16.123+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"People have lives, especially high-ranked players, who are mostly going to be adults, with, you know.. lives.\n\nBeing able (or inable) to devote time to a game should have no effect on skill and should not be punished.\n\nThis seems like a poorly-considered baidaid fix instead of simply changing how matchmaking and ranks work at high levels, there is no reason why inactive high-ranked players should reduce queue sizes, except that riot uses an outdated and inaccurate ranking system.","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2016-09-07T21:40:15.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=knAu3wo3,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-07T20:24:16.123+0000)\n>\n> People have lives, especially high-ranked players, who are mostly going to be adults, with, you know.. lives.\n> \n> Being able (or inable) to devote time to a game should have no effect on skill and should not be punished.\n> \n> This seems like a poorly-considered baidaid fix instead of simply changing how matchmaking and ranks work at high levels, there is no reason why inactive high-ranked players should reduce queue sizes, except that riot uses an outdated and inaccurate ranking system.\n\nThere's a reason LCS teams never look for talent in our own challenger scene...","replies":[]}]}]}
