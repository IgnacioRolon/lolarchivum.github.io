Just looking for what role and character you switched to and if that has proven better/worse or nothing at all for you.\r\n\r\nFor me, I started as Soraka, placed Silver II last season as Blitz, hit Bronze III then back up to II as Zyra this season so far, started fooling around with Trundle and decided to take him to ranked after getting an 80% or so win rate with him in normals, then pummeled back down to Bronze III and pretty much almost Bronze IV.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve enjoyed support until this point, where I am finally starting to learn a bit about the game.  It&#039;s annoying to get blamed for everything, even when you&#039;re on your A-game (and in a few cases, carrying the team).  I&#039;ve fooled around with the other lanes and feel like I do okay at top--even won some ranked in mid.  But 90% of my collection is support characters, so now I have to figure out which lane I&#039;d enjoy and which characters I can play with.\r\n\r\nSo, if you have given up support main and switched, please chime in and let me know where you found even better game play.  Thank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"MrwiOzV6pB","date":"2016-02-09T13:11:57.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually have the some of the best stats on my team as support even when I'm losing, except like snowbally tanks. I think if you're losing, even as support you should have the 1st or 2nd highest stats on your team to know you did truly as much as you could. If everyone on your team has like 1 kill and you have like 4 as an AP support that's usually a sign you were in a game that wasn't possible to save. Very few times teammates can be so unreliable when you're playing support it's best to KS (Kill Secure) to at least get a teammate fed by some assists.\n\nAlso with a support like Soraka I highly recommend basing a pick like that based on your team comp. She's really good, but if you don't have a decent tank on your team by mid game your team will normally get deleted. She doesn't do hardly any damage if you're going full HP regen Soraka and her heals are useless if the enemy team has enough power to kill your teammates within a couple secs.","replies":[{"poster":"Jyoeru","date":"2016-03-16T04:42:06.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get a lot of S- to S+ rankings when I play.  I know I generally am doing very well if that's any indicator.  And when I am with an ADC who isn't doing it right from my POV, I have no problem taking their CS and kills.  In fact, having started playing around with Heimer support here lately, I've been WAY more aggressive with that take-over.  If my ADC is way behind on CS (not because of me because I put my turrets along the wall to control bushes) and can't or won't get kills that needed to happen, I will take over the lane and get the gold so we can push lane and move on to other things.\n\nIn that regard, Heimer has become one of my favorite supports because he isn't as dependent on his ADC.  I can keep people off my turret while my ADC sits at base for the fourth time dying to stupid.  It's amazing how many games we win when I play Heimer that I know I would have lost playing most any other support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tormyth","date":"2016-02-09T13:10:22.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you still enjoy the playstyle of support helping allies and keeping track of wards and such? and how are you at csing? if yes then jungle is pretty much the same mindset only you roam more and keep tabs on buffs/other objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Jyoeru","date":"2016-03-16T04:47:04.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried to jungle.

Considering that my build was not glass canon, but rather actual support focused, with my points starting in the shield and maxing that first, I tried to explain this to my ADC, but to no avail.  Abuse to the point I had to mute him and others on the team.  \n\nBut those JGs, they do tend to get it bad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2016-02-10T03:24:17.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I've mained support on and off throughout the time I've played the game. The only other roles I really play are ADC, Mid, and Jungle. ADC has kind of a specialized champion pool, so it might be difficult for you to make that switch. I think Mid is probably easiest to switch to, given overlaps in champions (You can keep playing Zyra; Lulu is common; Morgana and Annie very easy to pick up in mid lane) although this next patch will probably have Zed and Xin 100% pick/ban, so it may be difficult picking up a mage (although the Zeds in Bronze/Silver aren't usually something to worry about).\n\nI placed in silver my first ranked season, dropped into bronze the following season and climbed out.

Zilean is my go-to right now, but I enjoy Nami, Blitz, Janna, and other champs that can turn the tide of battle with smart positioning and timing rather than just raw power. It's hard to stay faithful to it because when you get bad carries you're struggle becomes 100% harder. But at least as support you can offer some protection to weaker players and try to give them an unfair edge. \n\nLaning phase is still incredibly boring though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2016-02-10T00:27:34.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started my League \"career\" as a support main because no one takes it, and my internet was too shitty to even handle last hitting.\n\nLater, I tried other roles, such as mid, jungle, ADC, and ~~top~~ feed. Turns out that they aren't for me because supporting is actually playing a different game from that of your teammates.\n\nEven took it to soloQ, and getting blames? Nah, that's everyday stuff; I'm used to it anyways. It's like jungler mains have to deal with whiny teammates *and* carry their shitty asses at the same time; getting blamed is just second nature. Also, not telling anyone in particular to \"git gud\", but if you know how to play smart and keep your cool, you'll realize that people who blame are almost always the *bad* players and that getting blamed is quite rare. The longer I played, the more I got used supporting, and all those \"problems\" are just everyday shit. Bad teammates, toxic teammates, idiots who has no idea on what on earth is a Lulu support, idiots who doesn't even know how botlane functions... you name it!\n\nBut seriously, no matter how much shit supporting has; every role has their own kind of shit.\n\nYeah, yeah, it stinks trying to climb alone because duh, supports are *supposed* to function with at least one other person. But if you like tactical things, go jungle. If you like playing and showing off mechanics, go ADC/mid/top.
