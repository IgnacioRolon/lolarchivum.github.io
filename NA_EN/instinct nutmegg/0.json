Having low level toxic behavior that gets reported but does not get punished can still result in you staying on thin ice even many months after the 14-day ban.\n\nIt sucks that you got perma'd and I'm sorry that happened, but it did happen for a reason. Undercutting your teammates like that even if they were being absolute shitters doesn't solve any of your problems, and here's why:\n\nIf your teammate is trolling you, they are harassing you to try to elicit a response from you. If you react, then you feed their behavior and let them know that what they did worked. If they know that it worked to accomplish their goal, then they are going to do it even more.\n\nThe much more effective strategy is to mute them and report them after the game. Riot will deal with them accordingly and you don't have to put yourself at risk of getting in trouble by trying to punish the other player yourself with retaliatory harassment. Plus you won't have to read their vitriol if you've muted them because anything else they say won't even be visible to you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arsinik","date":"2018-01-19T23:10:14.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say a chat ban but not a perma ban seems kind of ridiculous keeps happening to me too havent been perma'd but I talked to a support agent last night who said that even if you dont say anything vulgar just arguing is enough to get you a ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Cream Reaper","date":"2018-01-19T07:18:11.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">fuckin moron\n\nif you had a 2 week ban before this game then there is no need to check the rest of the log since according to the rules those two words are plenty","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2018-01-19T02:15:35.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I see worse at least weekly, I think the problem was mostly calling someone a moron after so many punishments.
