Supports like Sona and Janna can get ridiculous benefit off of these items. \n\nI really dont understand you logic behind \"People buying this items are about to feed\", because the item is designed to punish you for dying?","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-10-27T04:57:58.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> \n> Not true.

Akali needs Gunblade ASAP, and Kat typically goes DFG or Zhonya's first item, rushing these items (which don't become cost efficient and are simply a burden until you gain three stacks) delays you.  The only reason to build them is pretty much to slap your opponent in the face by saying you have already won lane.  It can help a snowballing champ snowball harder, but to start the ball rolling, no, these items won't help there.\n\n> I really dont understand you logic behind \"People buying this items are about to feed\", because the item is designed to punish you for dying?\n\nThat's part of it, look at the cost efficiency of the items, it's horribly inefficient until you have some kills under your belt.  And dying even once costs you a sizable chunk of stats.  It's simply not efficient.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hi lm Kalista","date":"2014-10-27T18:15:35.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mejai and occult the best :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minishmaster","date":"2014-10-27T05:06:19.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mejais and Occult can't really be considered snowball items because even fully stacked, their marginal value is still worse than most 3rd tier items for mages and marksmen.
