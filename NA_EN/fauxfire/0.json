I decided after attempts to force the client to patch with no luck to reinstall League. After starting the installed launcher, it freezes up in the splash screen and after some waiting Windows then suggests to debug it:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/UC1Pq5t\r\nI can't progress from there. Are there any known issues that you're aware of @Riot? May I have assistance in getting League running? Thanks in advance for your help!\r\n\r\nps I am DYING to play the SG Ahri skin. Please Riot I cannot wait another day. &lt;3 {{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-06T16:45:43.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error happens when an OS or antivirus security setting is blocking game files from being access.
