Vayne spamming perma stealth and riven being perma shielded are practically the same level of broken. So, if youâ€™re okay with riven being as broken god tier as she is you should be fine with Vayne right?","replies":[{"poster":"bluefire mark 2","date":"2019-05-07T06:44:48.586+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Again, riven doesn't build it like ever.

When those champions were created, the number of hits required to procc an effect was set at a balanced level (for some like Varus and Kog, the level is 1). Most of those have their own scaling boost, be it AP or AD, so every Phantom Hit effectively doubles that boost; Phantom Hit is effectively the Deathfire Grasp for On-Hits, and DFG was removed for being a stat-stick (albeit with a toxic extra stat-check active ability). The only On-Hits I can think of that don't deal damage themselves are Yi and Vayne; Yi gets an extra auto, so that's a 1-to-1 AD scaling, and Vayne gets faster access to %Max HP True Damage, which flat out should not exist at all, let alone be faster to achieve....\n\nTL;DR I think Phantom Hit breaks all On-Hits and want it removed","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2019-05-08T13:02:42.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or.....hear me out....since everyone only complains about the same two champions we can nerf those 2 champions 0.0 amazing","replies":[{"poster":"MessyStuff","date":"2019-05-09T01:14:48.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh they will just complain about other champs then or just go back to complaining about Yasuo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FederationFurry","date":"2019-05-08T14:52:09.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3147}} still exists and Riot does nothing about that so I wouldn't bank on it.
