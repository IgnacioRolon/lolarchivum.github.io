I've never had any issues with patching before, so I apologise in advance if I miss any important information.\r\n\r\nMy patcher gets to 33% and then states the update has failed due to an unspecified error. - http://imgur.com/a/zVN5P\r\n\r\nI have followed the guide in order to fix it - deletion of files/folders, hextech tool etc. but to no avail. I do have logs, but it seems there is a lot of information in the .zip and wasn't sure what was the best way in order to make that information available.\r\n\r\nNot sure if Korean client playing on Oceania is of any relevance..\r\n\r\nThank you for any help! ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T18:58:49.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what guide you were using, but there's a lot going on here that makes it tough to offer the best fix here.  Deleting and modifying files are likely to cause you more problems to fix, and using[ languages or versions not supported for your region](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751594-Changing-Game-Language) can cause further issues.  \n\nGenerally, getting stuck at this percent indicates a connection problem that's failing to reach the patching servers.
