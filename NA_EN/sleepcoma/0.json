There also AOE abilities - make sure you hit the support with those too. If you are going to flash engage with some hard CC - make sure you get the support in that too. If you can gib anyone - gib the support (it's the easiest target). Any 4v5 situation is favorable - usually free baron or drag mid/late game. Silences are huge too. For example the other day I took fiddlesticks support specifically to mess with soraka. After we won soraka instantly logged off and her ADC gave me huge props for completely shutting them down.

The thing that it shows is that enchanters rarely dictated the meta beforehand, as Janna or Lulu were more situational picked that were not favored over more meatier supports like blitzcrank,, ali, or braum, or even Nami, an enchanter who overall is still strong without it, and basically left her other class members in the dust.\n\nThe reasoning is that the enchanters kit is almost naturally toxic to the game since it doesn't provide a lot of thought input to pull off amazing stuff. Right now, Janna, Lulu, and Sona somewhat boast some of the highest winrates for quite a few first-time or newer players to the champion, over 50% winrates all around. Now, if it was after 50 games, or 100 games, it would be quite reasonable to say \"Enchanters are just strong\". But when the subject majority can easily rock over 50% without even needing the basic skills of the champion because one item is particularly busted, we have a problem. Enchanters overall needed a way to be appealing without being, well, anti-fun. Janna and Lulu embody anti-fun. Lulu harasses far too much, capable of being played midlane without much thought as a secondary support-mage, and can outright deny engages just by point on a target and giving them a silence. She is one of the ONLY characters with a point and click silence that is still in the game. Janna equally denies basically a ton of all-ins, forcing teams to plan their entire engages solely around if janna shows up, and dictates the fight based on her reaction. Right now, supports can decide a game, and Riot has state they despise having a single lane the center of a match naturally because of how the mechanics of a character work.\n\nThis happened in years previous where the cheese krugs/gromp level 3 botlane gank was the literal embodiment of toxicity. The same goes for Ardent Censer. The champions might need to receive a buff to compensate for the loss of item power since its one of the few things keeping them most relevant, not saying just to buff support as a whole. Read between the lines and analyze the problems the game is facing rather than saying \"You're wrong because we shouldn't buff _blank_ because _blank_ (2) is still viable\" Yes, whatever else is viable will still be solid, but when the item Ardent Censer was the MOST used item name in the entire week 1 group stage. Hell, Cloud 9 strategically played around the fact that Janna and Lulu were the most played supports and focused their game plans around those being one of the champions picked for theirs, and one for the opponents, and designed the rest of their comp to deal with the respective response support pick.\n\nWhen a single character pick dictates the game, _something has to change_ Because no one wants to win or lose almost solely based on whether or not someone gains a good lead with a dumb item early on.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2017-10-13T21:02:37.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw Ali banned in one or two of the games, so I suppose I was wrong about how competitively sought after he was.

Ideally censer was fine, and did it's job, but enchanter supports weren't that good, nor were the first initial effects good. However, when the item got revolutionized, it wasn't because people were screaming for support buffs, it was during a time where ADCs were complaining about tanks being too durable. Of course, people soon realized it was kinda foolish since only a few were real threats and quite a few lategame carry types popped up, but not before the buff occur almost at the same time. The item's power spike discovery lead it to be the most unintentional buff in history, similar to the stoneplate cho'gath interaction. It was never intended to be that powerful, but it just amplified and forced required picks just to compete with the item.\n\nEssentially, it wasn't people screaming for a buff, it was riot deciding they wanted to see an item more, because it wasn't seeing play, and so they overcompensated.

It consisted of a single support dedicating 50% or more of their income to filling their inventory with wards and clearing out any wards they saw. Supports didn't get to build items in most cases. In addition, warding wasn't strategic and it sure as hell wasn't a decision. You farted wards all over the map so that you could get the entire map looking like you turned off fog-of-war. There was nothing creative or decision-based around it. There was no \"strategy\" to warding beyond dumping as many wards as you can.\n\nAlso, supports have -always- been slaves to the meta items. They just change season by season. Sometime it's 10 stacks of greenwards, sometimes it's runic bulwark, sometimes it's ardent. At least now there's more experimentation. \n\nI'm not defending ardent because that shit is legit broken (Even though I think the goal for supports to have attractive itemization is a nice one) but please don't justify the terribly awful time of supporting in earlier seasons as \"strategic warding\" and \"Giving supports more power/control\", because the last thing a support had in S1/S2 was that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2017-10-11T18:50:03.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, frankly i agree that S1/2 also was far from ideal, however I do think that it's completely fine to have a role(support) that is more focused on the macro than others.\nS1/2 and the wardwars were overkill, but what we have no is by far to little.\n\nS4/5 were pretty good, still a bit to little on the support side, but the best we had fro the vision game so far. Compared to earlyier season, we had the limit that prevents lighting up the entier map, but wardstones had more wards and you could get extra wards so you could 'move' the 3 wards around to where they are needed rather easily. Now you need to recall every time you want to move your vision around, or once they expire.\nAnother HUGE difference from then to now is how much allies can contribute. In S4/5, everyone could get green wards, and totems actually were quite awsome, so the rest could really contribute to vision, covering core areas like baron/dragon, which freed the support up to be more creative about their wards.\nNow, the burden of vision still is prettymuch on support(and jungle) because even if they want, the rest simply can't bring any meaningfull contribution. Combined with the 'recall for every ward trip' issue, this makes it near impossible to do more than the absolute minimum as support, especially since most soloQ junglers don't go for the trackers.\n\nI think going back to S4/5 vision and then workeing a bit from there woul be ideal, like increasing the wardlimit to 4 as passive on sightstone, maybe some refile mechanic on sightstone, and finally a wardslot that can be used for either greens or controllwards.\nWith some buffs to sightston and totems, one might even be able to remove greenwards and thus reduce the impact from gold on vision.\nBut to be honest, anything would be better than the current darkness, even S1/2...","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-10-11T20:46:21.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree with your point and I wouldn't mind an upgrade that lets your yellow ward regen faster (So that you can get more use out of your vision as a non-support), I do think that you're still missing the mark: Vision isn't strictly on jungle/support. It -is- on them for deep ward and by far taking the biggest risk in most cases. In addition, supports/junglers are usually the ones getting ward items, meaning they have the important job of getting anti-ward coverage down. (Unless duskblade)\n\nI'm, however, a bit biased because I play jungler. I enjoy being able to pull off ganks easier because the enemy wastes wards and doesn't cover their backs. It feels good to clear out the small bit of vision they have and control their map because they made the mistake of warding too early, etc. I think darkness is important. It makes the times you CAN ward more important and makes you really pay more attention to map control. Plus it forces you to prioritize which areas you want to control, For example: Do you control baron or dragon late game? Do you ward all over Baron and make sure they have zero approach or do you 50/50 dragon and baron so you can't be caught off guard? etc. The macroplay is there, it's just more strategic because of how limited your resources are.\n\nThat said, I'd be fine with having a backpack/buy slot so you can always have a red-ward on-hand. I'll fully admit it does feel shitty to not be able to place a red ward because you're at six items. I think if we were to do that, having those 5 extra wards at ALL times would be incredibly helpful.

Im looking at mechanics, not balance.\n\n{{champion:40}} Queen of peel. A spirit that  gains power through the prayers of those in need, Janna uses strong winds and violent storms to protect those who ask for her protection. Janna players love the feeling when the other team is trying desperately to reach one of Janna's allies(or her :-P), and the Janna is making their attempts meaningless with skillful use of her abilities(\"Janna isn't skillful blah blah blah\" Look. When you are able to block Alistar's engage, you know, the un-telegraphed .54 second dash, 4 out of 5 times, then come talk to me). \n\n_The direction to differentiate her_: Play up the cc/keep away pattern of Janna, and downplay the ability to defend against those who wish to keep their distance(the likes of {{champion:51}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:110}} ect) or want to go in and out of combat({{champion:245}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:35}}). Janna should be sub-par when the enemy team doesn't want to hard engage on her team, but a top-tier pick if they wish to pick a target and dogpile on them({{champion:5}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:122}}) (_note:_ champs shown are just who came to mind, not necessarily the best fit for the groups I picked.) Right now Janna is the [best friend](http://champion.gg/champion/Janna/Support) of ADC's who pack a wallop themselves(look at the adc synergy list of the link) but either need to be in the thick of things to do the most damage, Vayne, Draven and Jinx, or are want to fight at long range but have little to no cc to protect themselves with, Kog & Twitch.\n\n_What parts of her kit could be changed_: So based on what has been said on r/Janna, very few Janna's are that beholden to her sheild's ad increase. They don't necessarily want it reduced, but if it was removed entirely and replaced with something that made more sense thematically, they would be fine with that(some even want that to be the case). Another place that could be looked at would be her ult, more specifically the secondary effect of channeling it. If the healing _had_ to be reduced, adding a small slow(or rather, adding the slow back), could be one way to go. The shield bonus change would make her purely defensive support, and would change her decision making process for who to shield from \"#1 who can use the ad best, #2 who needs to live\" to \"who is going to be dived?\"\n\n{{champion:16}} Embodiment of healing. Soraka hates the suffering of those around her, and would be willing to sacrifice herself to save another. Some of the most enjoyable times as Soraka is when you are keeping your team alive and healthy, even while you are trying to balance on the tight rope of death.\n\n_A way to differentiate her_: Honestly, out of all the enchanters Soraka is the least like the others in playstyle. Unfortunately, while being so good at healing she is the healing goalpost for the BBI(Banana-Burn Index) She isn't exactly uncontested. While she isn't the most balanced of champs(Gw exists in part because of her), 4/5 of her abilities interact with healing in some way(passive gives her ms towards those who need healing, q heals her when she hits it, w heals and transfers her regeneration, ult heals everyone) and there isn't that much that can be done without taking some of her healing away.\n\n_What parts of her kit could be changed_: All of her kit is dedicated to one thing, so the only way something can be done is if you remove some of her healing power and gave her some other direction in addition to healing. But that would also affect how she plays, so it probably would be best to leave her till last and take care of any overlaps after the others have been changed.\n\n{{champion:37}} The Grand Maestro. A renowned musician, Sona travels far and wide performing on her Etwal, able to pluck her audience's heartstrings as easily as she does her instrument's. Sona's players' wish to perform for a crowd, and for them, deleting a squishy, protecting their team with a well timed shield, and landing that 5 man ult are all part of a standard performance.\n\n_A way to differentiate her_: Sona is a famous musician, and famous musicians are only powerful if they have many people listening to them, right? Sona should be a top contender for the spot of \"best teamfight support\", because who doesn't like a ballroom blitz? Her identity of an aura support, while sometimes ignored for her ability to obliterate some poor person, has been what drew some Sona mains to her(back when her auras were actually sustained auras). While Sona has always been somewhat a generalist support(can't compete with Nami in healing, can't do as much damage as Zyra, can't move around the map as fast or as well as Bard), she can do a little of everything. But who says she can't do that in a unique way?\n\n_What parts of her kit could be changed_: How her aura's work. Currently each time you cast a spell an aura briefly surrounds you and it does stuff(ms buff, on-hit damage that no one seems to take advantage of and cannot affect towers, small shield) While it works, it isn't very true to the music theme. When you pluck a note, that note hangs in the air even after you pluck another. It doesn't suddenly disappear, adding nothing to the mix. What could be done is have each spell cast build up Sona's sustained aura( with her q giving more damage, her w more defenses, and her e faster movement speed) along with a stronger but shorter lasting aura(as it is on live) appearing for each cast. Sustained aura would be weaker, but would be a mix of the last 3 spells(2+ of one spell would stack the effects, like dragons do), allowing her to choose what song, and what mix of effects, she needs to play.\n\nAnother idea, if the first doesn't work out, would be for her spells to be stronger the more champions there are around her(maybe have it be the highest # in the last few seconds so that ally or enemy deaths wouldn't suddenly weaken her). This would kind-of force her to be a teamfight champ as she would only be at her strongest in a full blown 5v5, but it is an interesting idea to toy with. It would also give her the weakness of not being as strong if she is caught out alone.\n\n{{champion:117}} The Fairy Master of Whimsy(also debated with \"Meet my unkillable juggernaut, Kog'maw\"). Lulu is a whimsical yordle who unrepentantly causes chaos with her fairy friend, Pix. She doesn't mean any harm though, promise. Lulu's love cockblocking any assassin or diver that gets too close to their... special friend, and then turns the tables on them by making a mountain out of a molehill.\n\n_A way to differentiate her_: Lulu and Janna share some of the same design space, protect someone at all costs while buffing their damage, but lulu's kit can do so much more of damage buffing than what Janna's can do, so I think it would be best for her to cede the diver cockblocking to Janna, and focus on the being an annoying disruption and enhancing her allies ability to do damage. Since (with this change) Janna would lose her ad buff on her shield, Lulu can corner the market on all natural dps enhancing. \n\n_What parts of her kit could be changed_: If Polymorph wasn't one of her signature skills, it would be the first to go. But it is, so its staying. That doesn't mean that the tenacity resistant cc can't have its duration cut though(mainly due to it being resistant to tenacity and being twice as long as most other resistant cc's). Maybe change her ult to buff % of max health to synergize better with juggernauts, but lessen its effects on adc's(goal would be to make it a better secondary engage tool than a panic \"save their life\" button. Another thing that can be done to allow her to buff her allies damage is allow her passive to scale off the targets ad/ap(something along the lines of 30% bonus ad, maybe less maybe more) when it is applied to them, instead of her ap(as support lulu isn't getting large amounts of ap usually). Not too sure on the last one.\n\n{{champion:267}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:26}} are all considered \"Enchanters\", but they are fairly unique themselves.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sleepcoma","date":"2017-10-10T21:58:50.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Trading Stance,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HiV8tNrd,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-10-10T03:03:59.177+0000)\n>\n> In mid-season, one of our projects was to increase the attractiveness and general agency of the support role.

So yes, I would agree that the role and items have been power crept, but this needs to be held in the context of supports having less gold income as well.\n\nI understand that you want to make the support role more appealing to players, but supports at worlds actually have close to or more gold than their junglers, and when supports have extremely gold efficient items it becomes a problem for the game as they can get items much more quickly and those items have a massive impact on the game, adcs are starting to build relic shield for supports because their itemization is just through the roof crazy.  Meanwhile most junglers are building tank items that are around 80 - 90% gold efficient which just makes no sense. In a world where supports are making a lot less gold then it would make sense for very strong items but currently that's not the world we're in. I personally believe that this should be toned down but you guys have all the database and I don't.\n\nEdit: thanks for taking the time to reply to my post","replies":[{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2017-10-14T17:54:24.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports at Worlds are running gold gen Seals + Quints for 4-5 additional gold per 10 seconds.
