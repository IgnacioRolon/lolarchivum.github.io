It's not Riot's fault that you have certain tastes in what you like to watch, so please don't blame them.\n\nFor me, this Worlds has been very amusing to watch; seeing certain strategies (like different picks in the ADC/Mid/Top positions) and upsets make this one of the less one-sided Worlds in a long time. It cool seeing different iterations of a certain strategy. My favorite moment was when WE beat an ardent censor team fighting comp with an early-game siege comp. \n\nAnd Fizz coming out today is such a treat!{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2017-10-15T07:09:57.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The upsets are a joy to watch, but the team compositions are incredibly dull. The current meta is incredibly bad for entertainment, because it is very slow. Its just two walls moving towards each other with an adc behind it single-handedly winning the game.\n\nPlay-making supports and carry junglers/top-laners are much more fun to watch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arock52","date":"2017-10-15T06:46:45.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"this years worlds has been i believe very upset heavy and very interesting for years when its been tank meta and adc's were useless so its nice to see adc's be able to play and actually affect the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp창rky","date":"2017-10-15T08:50:29.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be careful with that comment.

Am I an adc main? yes. But I much prefer this meta to the \"adc 2k17\" meta. Even though in that meta it wasn't adc's being weak it was tanks being too strong. I like this meta much more than that meta because adc has much more diversity (in solo queue not esports)  and I really think people are blowing how strong adc are out of proportion. Is ardent strong? yes. But I have had games where I or the enemy adc gets fed but my solo laners do well and shut him down. I think the real problem in this meta is the jungle position.  Jungle is such an important role right now and basically can win you so many games based on what jungler picks a better ganking jungler or sejuani because shes total bs right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Sleepcoma","date":"2017-10-17T00:45:52.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mind adc being strong but its just they they are too strong, ardent locket knights vow and redemption just enable them to fuck up too hard and still live because of the amount of defensive tools that are available. Also, tanks are too weak right now as they are basically walking locket. Champion wise there is a good amount of diversity with xayah, twitch, kog, trist, varus, and situationally ashe.

I also think other playmaking supports don't have the best itemization. Also I think solo queue adc diversity is way higher. The adc's you listed plus jinx, jhin, oh and we cant forget about kalista, and now cait is creeping back into the meta as well. I basically think that there are enough situations in solo queue that any adc can play (except ezreal because tear is garbage).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BabyNaix","date":"2017-10-16T17:28:56.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Especially since the games are at 3:00 am  -_-''","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp창rky","date":"2017-10-15T08:49:00.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just dont like that i have to strain my body to watch all the games.. at fucking 3 in the morning...","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-10-15T08:47:38.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":^)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7tmwKeo.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-10-15T06:16:06.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is definitely a very interesting group stage.
