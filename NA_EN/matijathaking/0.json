Her passive is off the stronge. With a 20% health shield that would block the type of dmg that would hurt her more. Her Q is like a {{champion:24}} W but you can cast it twice with insane true damage, Her W heals just for a bit though, but has a 90% slow that decays on all levels. It also does percent health damage. Her E is a double dash and is all purpose. Almost E into 3 enemies? E again. Chasing someone down? Double range. Missed intended target? Do damage anyway. To me personally her R is alright. Not that it matters, but almost none of her abilities are skill shots. I don't count E as one because you can't miss a wall, and her second cast is also easy to nail.","replies":[]}]}
