My friend who i want to duo with now for our placements was unranked last season. But, in the preseason he finished Platinum 1 and for some reason we're unable to duo our placements together. Is the reason because he was unranked last season ? Or is the premade ranked not working correctly right now ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T01:09:49.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First up, preseason doesn't count towards overall ranking since ranked isn't in effect at that time. Placements I believe work off your previous rank, so if they finished the season unranked you may not be able to queue together for placements. Also keep in mind there were some previous issues earlier this week where nobody was able to queue together as well, but those should be fixed by now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matt2423","date":"2018-01-18T20:28:13.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been getting multiple messages saying that people can't be in the same party as me for ranked.\nDid the duo rules change?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadster","date":"2018-01-18T13:11:36.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seem to have the problem with another friend.
