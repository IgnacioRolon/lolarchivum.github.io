Most games are already being decided at the 10 min mark, as one team will have first turret gold and the added pressure of roaming that comes with it causing the other team to collapse to defend or face increased ganks and roaming.\r\n\r\nA quick summary of this spell: \r\n\r\nFortify was a global summoner spell that made all turrets invulnerable to damage and increased attack speed 100% for 7 seconds with a 300 second cd. \r\n\r\nDoesn't that sound like it would fit into this meta quite well? Lets be honest, with higher levels of mobility and tower dodging bs (rework akali) being introduced, this has only resulted in towers becoming further absolute garbage mid-late game. At least with this summoner spell, you'd still have your tower alive after the first recall. \r\n\r\n\r\nRead the following for a second, and just grasp the most fitting description, in resolving the sad excuse for towers today and countering the absurdity in damage. \r\n\r\n\"Fortify was mainly used defensively to prevent turrets from taking damage and clearing minions faster than normally. However it was also a very effective method to punish turret divers or quickly do damage to foes that got caught by pulls and taunts like  Rocket Grab.png Rocket Grab and  Frenzying Taunt.png Puncturing Taunt.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThis was removed from league in 2011, due to a lack of use I can bet dollars to donuts, this spell would save lives today and might result a good way to put the brakes on the 4 min 4 man gank bot to take bot turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-07-23T12:04:22.796+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nobody _wanted_ to use it because it isn't a combat summoner spell.

They'd *have* to 4 man dive twice if they wanted that kind of play to work for first turret.\n\nSure you'd still die to the 4 man, but they won't get first blood tower off the first dive as well.

Fortify usually was either useless since the CD was super long and it didn't have enough defense, or it was overtuned and you'd stack Fortify and totally nullify pushes.  If you let it be pretty strong but prevented it from being stackable by putting it behind an item or a specific rune, then there'd be opportunity cost to have a Fortify available to your team.  Hell, it being on Unsealed Spellbook means you'd get 1 Fortify every 4 spells so it wouldn't ever feel OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-07-23T22:07:39.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have my bow!","replies":[{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2018-07-24T01:17:27.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:2}} And my axe!","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-07-24T15:55:00.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/062/68/aabe4e0fe635e508-e1490304349905.jpg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iamsmurfing0101","date":"2018-07-23T23:31:04.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just buff towers how about that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knockturne","date":"2018-07-23T21:39:11.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the op has a really good idea, if everyone says the ss is shit then why not put it back in and see if anyone can make use of it to lessen the impact of the dive meta. worst case scenario nothing changes no big deal, and if the ss being weak is a concern then reintroduce it while at the same time trying to nerf tower dive abilities and slightly buff towers / fortify. maybe make it 150% atk speed or a % of true dmg.","replies":[]},{"poster":"R35URR3C710N","date":"2018-07-23T12:53:34.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember running 5 man all-tank, all-mid, all-fortify/promote cheese strat when it first came out.
