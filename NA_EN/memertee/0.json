I always play with a 4 man or a full queue, and everytime ive one a game (past ~2 months), i havent got one key fragment. ALL of my friends have gotten multiple KEYS at this point. Im extremelly pissed at this, as i know its a exponential chart, so that the more time you go without a key, the more likely you are to get one the next win, so am i just the absolute unluckiest person ever, or is something else happening?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T16:29:10.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't look like the account you are posting from is the same one you are having concerns about.  Keep in mind that fragments will drop at an increased rate and will continue to decrease the more you get.  It's more of a curve than a line, and will reset about roughly every 30 days.
