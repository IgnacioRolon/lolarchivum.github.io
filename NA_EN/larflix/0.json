I know blitzcrank is considered support, but he looks like he does a lot of damage and could kill champions on his own, why isn’t he top lane or something? \r\n\r\nHis hook can keep enemies near him and does\r\na lot of damage, his speed boost can also keep enemies near him, he has a knock up and his ult passive looks like it could deal a lot of damage (150+30%ap per second if you’r hitt8m him consistently). \r\n\r\nAgain, I know I am wrong, but can someone explain why could he not be in a solo lane and why he is a good support?","replies":[{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-07-11T12:11:10.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can do his job without items/levels, so its better to give solo lane gold+exp to someone who needs it more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2019-07-11T04:35:54.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen Blitzcrank played mid as a counter to Zed.

His rocket grab will one-shot a squishy, but it has a long cooldown and he doesn't actually do anything else.\n\nHe can't mid because he has no way to farm safely and no waveclear until level 6, so his pre-6 laning will be miserable against any half decent mage.\n\nHe can't top because most top laners are too tanky to one-shot with his rocket grab, and they will all kill him long before it comes off cooldown.  He is free food for any fighter or tank pretty much.\n\nHe can jungle, but his clear is so incredibly slow that it's very rare to see anyone playing it.\n\nThus he is stuck as support, where he doesn't have to worry about anything else other than landing the occasional cheese grab.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-11T03:56:22.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His hook can't keep enemies near him; it can only bring them near him, as it has a pretty long CD until it's at max rank with some CDR items. His speed boost is followed by a self-slow. His knockup is basically two autos together. Overall, his offensive capabilities are boosted by a mix of AP and AD, but not in ratios that prompt him to build hybrid items. You can go for an AD build with Muramana and Triforce for a powerful E, or you can build some AP to have a stronger Q and R... or you can buy low-cost support items and focus on bringing enemies into your team to be blown up, which turns out to be the most effective strategy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agent Corgi","date":"2019-07-11T03:52:29.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty much one of the roles he excels at thanks to his [Q: Rocket Grab]. Same thing can be said about Nautilus, a Champion that was previously known for Jungle/Top that's seen more play as a Support thanks to his CC. More or less, Blitzcrank **hypothetically can **play other roles outside of the Supporting role, but he's just better off in a Botlane Comp due to his Grab.\n\nAlso worth noting that there is one player in High ELO (diamond range) from EUW that does play Blitzcrank in a solo lane. I've seen videos on this player, he's actually pretty damn good at it.","replies":[]}]}
