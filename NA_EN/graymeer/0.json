About two or three years ago I was able to modify my keybindings so that I could use my left mouse button with attack move click and attack only click (i've gone back and forth).  Mostly to prevent misclicks and accidentally walking forward. To do this I also had to change how I interface with the menu's in game to shift LMB click.  I did this through the notepad and the config input.ini file. FOr the most part it worked, but I now have to use autocast for everything.  Not a big deal. Here is where the problem comes in. For some reaon I can't go back to the original settings. I  also can't go back and rebind attack only click to the lmb (my ideal right now as attack move click keep getting me to attack the wrong target).  I've deleted the config file, I've restored to default in both in game and client menus, and I've even uninstalled the game and deleted all the file from my hard drive, to reinstall and the settings and keybinds are persisting. \r\n\r\nAny reason why these settings would persist through an uninstall?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-17T00:17:21.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These settings are actually saved server-side, so they're intended to persist through reinstalls. You'll have to delete the **config folder** (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config) while the client is open and running in the background. This should reset all your in-game and keybinding settings to default, where you can them make the configurations you want.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Graymeer","date":"2017-02-17T00:37:31.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK that may have been where I was messing up. I was always closing out of the server. Deleting the config and init files before starting the server up again. I must have did it right last night because it seems to have returned back to normal. I have LMB set to attack click, and it still seems to work in menus without holding shift. So partial success. I think LMB bound to attack click with menu and selection options on shift LMB was the best setup. Just need to find the command to return select menu to shift LMB. Thanks. At least I don't have to uninstall anymore.","replies":[]}]}]}
