I appreciate you voting, and I encourage you to read the pastebin link below. It contains the full chat logs for games 1-3.\n\n**Edit2:** It seems the majority of people think this punishment is too harsh, although a punishment was needed. I have submitted a ticket explaining how I intend to correct my use of text chat in game, and I hope to have my account reinstated as a final chance. Wish me luck, and thank you all for the responses!\n\n**Edit:** [Here is a pastebin](http://pastebin.com/ueasKhfj) of the entire chat log attached to my perma ban. In game 2 we got outscaled and tilted off the planet. Game 3 every lane and role got outplayed and the game was done, we all agreed to ff and our top lane left. When reading chat logs, you have to account for context and in which chat the message was sent. Telling your cocky 5/0 opponent that he is horrible is a lot different than saying the same to your 0/4 tilted adc.\n\n&nbsp;\nI would like to get your opinion&#039;s on whether this is worthy of a permanent account suspension. The game was very evenly matched rank-wise (around diamond 3 MMR), however individual matchups were not. Our team had two players, me and my mid laner, who were on their experienced roles, while the enemy team had all five players on their main roles. In this game, all 3 lanes got absolutely crushed. \n\nMy mid laner became increasingly toxic towards me and blaming me for the losing side lanes. My top laner (bot main) decided to play his second Riven game to-date, even taking the time to inform me of this fact right at the start. My adc was extremely toxic and negative throughout the game and refused to allow herself to be carried. My support ran the wrong runes/masteries. I tried my best to farm it out until late game, but come 20 minutes the game was just too toxic. We tried to surrender, and it failed 3-2. At that point, I was stuck in a lost game with unfocused, AFK, and openly toxic players until 28 minutes. As always, I tried my best until the nexus fell.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShould I have muted chat and shut up? Of course. But when my teammates flamed me, gave up, and then held me hostage for 8 minutes, there was no way to contain my frustration. The intent of a permanent ban is to permanently disable access to one&#039;s account, and remove them from the community forever. Was this punishment justified?\n\nGame 1\nMe: we outscale them so hard\nMe: fio f\nMe: stop pushing bot pls.\nMe: you have no wards\nMe: and now they have lots of gold.\nMe: focus.\nMe: hangon\nMe: rengar 6 bot\nMe: care rengar\nMe: NICE\nMe: eh\nMe: we scale\nMe: why force it?\nMe: i was nowhere near bot\nMe: dont force fights.\nMe: you dont even play riven\nMe: you should not expect to just randomly win lane\nMe: just outscale thwem\nMe: no\nMe: just outscale.\nMe: can you guys stop\nMe: just ward\nMe: ward and stop pushing\nMe: thjis game is free unless u feed\nMe: Report sivir for extreme negativity and toxicity, I am done giving her chances.\nMe: muted chat\nMe: ty :LD\nMe: ^\nMe: focus\nMe: and dont be toxic\nMe: theyre troo fed\nMe: just famr\nMe: hope they dont force it\nMe: mobis useless we nbeed combat stats\nMe: u wont be dove if u stay back\nMe: because u already fed and gave up\nMe: its ok now\nMe: u have another chance\nMe: freeze bot and focus\nMe: cuz this is second time riven\nMe: i have to help top.\nMe: yeah\nMe: so\nMe: I dont understand diamond 5 players\nMe: Second time riven this season she says\nMe: why even play?\nMe: im not toxic im trying to focus\nMe: 80% wr\nMe: not d5.\nMe: no one is riven.\nMe: lol wtf\nMe: pls yes\nMe: we cannot win\nMe: gg guys\nMe: Report this lb too\nMe: toxic to me\nMe: sivir asks why i camp top\nMe: I say cuz riven is second time riven\nMe: LB thjinks iom bad cuz i have losing side lanes.\nMe: What is d5\nMe: rofl.\nMe: tru\nMe: i lost 4 tonight\nMe: i thought my mmr was lower\nMe: rengar u say you are better jungler?\nMe: just ridiculous ppl waste my time\nMe: I am diamond 1.\nMe: you had winning lanes\nMe: You did not win your lanes.\nMe: Why are you trying to use that as some sort of leverage\nMe: if ur seocnd timing a champ in ranked you are d5 skill lvl.\nMe: idgaf if u d2\nMe: bot and top?\nMe: i had toxic sivir too\nMe: it took a toll on my mental\nMe: she gaev up in chat\nMe: anyways muting\nMe: this is useelss\nMe: ff\nMe: dont waste my time\nMe: Ridiculous players like sivir and riven even have to queue\nMe: This is what the ban system needs to target.\nMe: No\nMe: Trolls.\nMe: Second time champs in ranked and giving up early\nMe: Ridiculous\nMe: Wont even ff.\nMe: no i didnt\nMe: i dont give up","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-08-03T18:46:54.809+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":17,"body":"1.

Toxic? No, everyone was shocked by her burst. I believe a teammate said something like \"they're strong\" or whatever, and I said \"idgaf\". I planned to play and carry. Again, annoying to have a lot of messages, but should not even be a factor in a punishment.\n\n> Me: \\our map control is gone\n> Me: we lose\n> Me: all our control\n> Me: because of those plays.\n\nWe lost turrets and had no control of the map.

After it happened several times in a row, both of them died and I needed to make it clear in chat. We teamfight or we lose. There is no other option. Nothing toxic here.\n\n> Me: FUCK\n> Me: SO MANY THROWS\n> Me: ONE MORE DUEL I LEAVE**\n\nThis can be considered toxic. I threatened to leave.

The game was nearly at its breaking point and I wasn't on a carry so without my teammates, I lose.\n\n> \n> \n> \n> I&#x27;d never want to play with this player\n\nThat is unfortunate.

There is nothing toxic in the snippet you provided aside from threatening to leave, which I would never go through with, and when players are already doing stupid things and refusing to communicate, I have to use a last resort. There is no other way to get people to listen in a fast paced game, you exhaust all your options and hope they stick.\n\nAs for the yelling is toxic, I did not yell. Yelling is emphasis of speech, caps is emphasis of typing. I'm emphasizing what I'm saying so it doesn't get lost in the rest of the idiocy being spewed into chat. I need my team to teamfight, I need them to focus on our one and only win condition ASAP before our window is up and we lose. If there was voice chat, this would be so much easier, but there isn't. Typing is my only option. You will find few truly toxic messages in my chat logs, far too little to justify a permanent suspension. And if I refine my use of chat to not include these messages, my shotcalling will be in a perfect spot.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-08-04T04:24:49.804+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":">There is nothing toxic in the snippet you provided aside from threatening to leave, which I would never go through with, and when players are already doing stupid things and refusing to communicate, I have to use a last resort.\n\nYou NEVER have to use it, first resort or last.

Backlash is generally not okay, but it is expected and understood to be a direct product of being messed with. Caps, or yelling if that's what you choose to call it, is the absolute minimum and acceptable form of backlash to someone who is messing with you. And if you're insinuating that yelling is in violation of the rules then you need you're too far gone to reason with because that is just ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-08-04T04:50:40.187+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":">Competitive League is about winning, nothing else.

Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. But most professionals know that such actions won't help them win, so they rise above and behave like they (and you) should. That's part of what separates them from the rest.\n\n>Caps is accepted, I have never reported someone over using caps...

That's why players don't get banned (or even punished at all usually) for one small offense. But if you demonstrate a pattern of such behavior, that isn't acceptable. That's what you did.\n\n>What about the large amount of messages I sent in those chat logs that were meant in good humor and/or banter with the enemy team?\n\nNot being toxic ALL of the time doesn't excuse a repeated pattern of toxic behavior.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BIH Diamond","date":"2016-08-04T04:06:18.081+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nothign toxic there, unless he actually left.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-08-03T20:12:44.723+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"He just said he was punished for multiple games.

I believe Riot had good intentions and a clear goal; to rid the game of toxicity and create a positive environment. They tried to account for the players who were circumventing the punishment system by creating stricter punishments with less chances, but that just forced players to sneakily troll games with no chance of being caught. While there are many possible solutions, I believe a final punishment that targets only the original problem (toxic chat) is the solution they need to implement.","replies":[{"poster":"TheVoidScyther","date":"2016-08-03T14:52:57.779+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's pretty funny cause they create a champion like kha'zix who was intended to have skills which evolved accordingly to his situation/state of the game but end up with a reform system who has one straight set of guidelines that aren't circumstantial","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-08-03T09:37:25.820+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's salty and negative, but let's be honest, it's not enough for a perma ban, Unless you've been salty and did stuff like this before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hî îm God","date":"2016-08-03T09:16:21.737+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Apulmadikout","date":"2016-08-03T09:27:19.333+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hî îm God,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3BP5Y1pp,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2016-08-03T09:16:21.737+0000)\n>\n> You didn&#x27;t deserve the ban for that, but i see that you use chat FAR too much.
