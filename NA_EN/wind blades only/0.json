There appears to be some testing points for changing names on there so you may need to log onto the legacy client to change it:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI looked into your account as well to make sure it will prompt a name change.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
