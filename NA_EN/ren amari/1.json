In 98% of my other games im positive and am not a general asshole. Why is it, that riot&#039;s banning system bans people over a single game? And before you say &quot;oh its over a lot of reports and what not&quot; You have to understand, i have had about 5 perma banned accounts. Because i am toxic over 1 game in 50-100 games. And its always 1 game, that i&#039;m &quot;Unbearably toxic&quot;. If i play this game i&#039;m going to be inevitably banned, and if anyone else decides to be toxic like me for 1% of their games, they will be perma banned too. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer my toxicity is me saying &quot;Fuck&quot; A few times, and telling people the reason we lost is because of certain lanes. Literally nothing else. No racial slurs, no 50 page essays in chat, just about 25-50 lines of me saying &quot;Fuck&quot; &quot;Shit&quot; and blaming people for the loss. That&#039;s legitimately it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-08T15:11:25.417+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This type of system isn't without precedent in real life though, even in situations where there's the human element involved. Keep in mind that you only get punished for one game if there is *extreme* toxicity in the one game.\n\nIt's akin to workplace safety. You forget to follow a minor safety guideline, you probably won't get punished unless you do it frequently. If you get caught doing something blatantly and extremely unsafe, such as attempting to recap a needle (after use), not using a sharps container, violating someone's privacy... you'll likely be reprimanded or put on unpaid leave the first time, and fired the second time. Yes there is a human element - everyone makes minor mistakes and they do so infrequently. However, making minor mistakes frequently or making major mistakes even once adds up.\n\nKeep in mind that the things I discussed (not using a sharps container for example) may only happen once every thousand patients - it's still an extreme safety hazard and liability. Likewise, you may only be extremely toxic in 1/100 games, but if you're extremely toxic in even 1 game to the point you get punished for one game (instead of the usual 2-3+ games) then that's unacceptable. There is a line where toxicity becomes 100% unjustifiable and 100% unwarranted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-11-08T15:09:29.040+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've had 5 banned accounts, I can't muster any sympathy for you.

It doesn't punish toxicity in 1-2 games, unless those 1-2 were really bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beyhive","date":"2017-11-08T14:47:40.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 perma banned accounts... lol play microsoft pinball","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ren Amari","date":"2017-11-08T14:37:38.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes so saying anything in chat when you get people who feed and lose lane 8 games in a row, isn't justified.
