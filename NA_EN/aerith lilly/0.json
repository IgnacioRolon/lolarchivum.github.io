I'm wondering if, for instance, the emotes were working on SR because you had the right emote page selected next to your ward at the bottom. Then, maybe it wasn't working in the next game because it was a different game mode where the emotes weren't correctly selected. Make sure you're choosing the emotes at the bottom right next to your ward choice and summoner spells.\n\nIf this *is* a bug, make sure you post it in [**Report a Bug**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) where the devs will actually see it.","replies":[{"poster":"Aerith Lilly","date":"2017-10-31T22:31:12.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I'll do some confirmation tests to make sure.
