Can he use magic without the gauntlet like the old lore, or is that no longer a thing\r\n\r\n3. What are the little triangles under his eyes?

It sounded pretty good. Tell us who in the music department to spam tweets at lol.\n\nHearing theres 3 comics in development at marvel makes me want you to write an ezreal series btw.\n\nI do have a question about the relationship between ezreals magic and the gauntlet. Without that gauntlet, ezreal can still teleport or fire blasts the same way, but it's more difficult, slower, weaker? Or does the gauntlet also give you unique powers if you can fuel it, like the teleporting?\n\nIn other words does it only augment your existing abilities or does it open up new powers if you're a mage? If taliyah put it on would she just do way better earth magic?\n\nOh yeah and I wanted to say while ezreal was already overall my favorite adc, his update has made me spam him nearly every game.

The gauntlet is probably the most iconic thing about him, so that it may be a hinderance one day (instead of an expedience) is really interesting.\nAlso, are there any other *actual* mages in Piltover?
