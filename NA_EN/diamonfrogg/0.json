MUTE ALL\nOne day in champ select, Hi guys i'm extremely toxic so i'm gonna mute all and focus on the game, ping me to communicate. I carried that game and did something like 16/4. In Post Game Screen Hey WTF Jungle Why do you mute and don't communicate we are reporting you for your behaviour.\nAnd i got chat banned for 25 games and Honor = 0\nSo finally Honor System is for those who don't have Honor IRL.\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-08T15:12:59.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"stop being toxic, you get reported far more than you get honors.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diamonfrogg","date":"2017-07-08T16:31:34.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just had a yi top.. didn't say anything.. so proud.. -.-","replies":[{"poster":"BenDoverOTL","date":"2017-08-16T08:39:02.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had a top laner get solo killed and he started to flame twisted fate for not ganking.
