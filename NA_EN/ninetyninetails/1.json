She just looks super straight and blocky with one color, adding gradients in pixel art can give the illusion of more organic shapes - making things look curvy, or even pointy, if you do it right. The balls on the edge of Sona's arcade board actually look a little round with the different colors - kind of wish you extended that elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"NinetyNineTails","date":"2014-09-20T15:45:17.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're basically entirely right. The reason that the skin tones are so unvaried is that I'm actually working with a particular color palette; Perler fuse beads. I actually make the patterns I create with my son and iron the fuse beads; I have the finished versions of Ziggs, Vi, Leona v1, and the Hulk on our work table.\n\nSome day, we're going to live in the future of fuse beads and I'll be able to order fuse beads with arbitrary RGB values. Then I'll really go to town! Thresh'll be grateful.\n\n[Perler palette](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4822358825_675792d3b2_b.jpg)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-09-08T21:54:23.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YESSS!

I'm becoming relatively comfortable doing this sort of thing, but 1000x1000.... that'd take skills of a different sort than I have or am learning.\n\nI am considering doing some work in the 90x90-ish range and doing some Street Fighter II styled pieces.
