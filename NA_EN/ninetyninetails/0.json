My idiom is actually perler fuse beads; making patterns to assemble and iron together with my son.  The palette is terrible because of the limitations of the palette of beads available, and the size is small because of the small size of the pegboards used.\n\nMaybe someday I'll expand my range of efforts, though.

In time, I got to the point where I don't need to do that (much) anymore, though I do still refer to some of the best work I've collected when I need to figure out how to do something tricky (anybody know how to make Vi's gloves not look like blurs or blobs at this resolution?
