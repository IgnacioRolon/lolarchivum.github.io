Is this a bug of some sort? Am I the only one that's getting this bug? \r\n* The only way I can fix it is when I exit out of the client and re-login, and when I come back, the enemy comes back with level three or four.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to fix it, but it works for every key in the game [example: q,w,e,r trinket, etc.] that I can't cast. \r\n\r\nIs this a known bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T23:58:03.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like either a hardware or config issue is failing to receive your inputs.  What happens if you swap your keyboard?  Otherwise, try resetting your config to troubleshoot, but make sure to test it out in a custom game to avoid any penalties:\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.
