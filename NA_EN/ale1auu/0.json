When I finish selecting a champ and leads me into the loading screen, my screen suddenly shows black and the cursor. I can't even change windows when pressing Alt + tab or Win + tab. I'm also playing on a new laptop. I had no problem before but all of a sudden it happens. Because of this, my pc crashes and I'm now in the low priority queue. Is there a solution to this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T01:18:09.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kind of sounds like you're having the issue where your network wasn't able to secure that new connection with the game server you were being put in which can sometimes cause this type of 'crash'. Let's make sure your ports and DNS settings are configured correctly in order to get a stable connection with those servers. Check out those two points in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) really quick and let me know if they help or not.","replies":[{"poster":"ale1auu","date":"2018-01-17T08:24:50.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do I know if they are stable or not?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T21:13:51.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnections are a type of instability.

But i dont think it's about connection, cuz i can hear all the sounds in the game. I can even cast spells but the screen stays black.\nI can get out in windows and when i Alt + Tab in windows i can \"see\" the game in the tab, i can see me standing in base. The champs even  shows in loading screen for Â½ a sec before disapearing.\nHad this problem with my old PC, when i decided to play LoL again after a year or two. I thought ooh it's my PC that's to old, but I got a new one last week and i have the same problem now....\n\nEverything in the PC is new, and i can play CoD WW2, CS:GO and PUBG with no problem. So i have no idea wtf i can do to solve this problem....","replies":[]}]}
