And for some reason 800 range... no clue what that is doing there.\n\n ⚠️ **Keep in mind that there will be some base stat adjustments done too!**⚠️ \n Most noticable are +20 armor for melee supps, and 9 armor for everyone exept for mid mages. All numbers can still change obviously. Heres the current list: [The guys from Surr@20 are awesome!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DmrdKznTZ8gXYjaYAibySgeuzODrW0lCRDj-I_WP4A0/edit)\n\nWith all of the basic infos out of the way lets get started!\n____\n____\n\n# Comparing the 3 Runes\n\nHonestely just by simply comparison we have a clear winner: Conditioning.\nThe 3 Armor/Mr mean even less with the base stat adjustments, and the % part has a really weird condition. It could be that after a certain HP regen number you get this forever, but then again you get the same strength and both Armor and MR in conditioning, plus 3 more.\nThe only down side is its 10 min mark condition, so ~ lvl 7, or a lvl 10 worlds nocturne and 2 toplaners below 40 cs. But 3 armor/mr more in the very every game doesnt mean much...\n\nTo bring it together:\n\n- flat early buffs for **Iron Skin** and  **Mirror Shell**, both to weak and have a weird condition on the 2nd part.\n- the later/&quot;scaling&quot; **Conditioning** is much stronger in every part.\n\nSo we could\na) Buff the early Runes or \nb) weaken Conditioning or\nc) change the idea/system\n\nIn general all 3 and especially both early runes are pretty weak runes in comparision, so b) is automaticaly off the table.\nFor a) we just need to find a worthy tradeoff, so just some number adjustments should do the trick.\nBut lets make this a bit more interesting and take a look at c)!\n_____\n\n# Change Them!\n\nWe can generaly keep the early/early vs midgame+ theme if wanted, but I would focus more on the Armor vs Mr vs Both component!\nIf I remember correctely one goal was that players should/need to adapt to every game depending on the situation etc.\nSo why dont we focus the runes on this? Against a full AD comp? Pick Iron Skin! Full AP? Mirror Shell at your service!\nOr just against your lane opponent for a easier lane? You get the drift...\n\n**The proposed Changes:**\n\n>**Iron Skin:**\n> 6 Armor + 6 Armor and 7% Armor at 10 min (or some other scaling like lvl)\n\n>**Mirror Shell:**\n> 6 MR + 6 MR and 7% Mr at 10 min (or ...)\n\n>**Conditioning:**\n>10 Armor&amp;MR and 5% Armor&amp;MR at 10 min (or ...)\n\nThis gives the solo runes a decent early advantage and also a better single stat scaling, while the combinded rune grants better overall stats.\nBasicaly its like the hybrid pen rune vs solo pen runes.\nAs a side node a 20 base Armor increase for melee sups seems a bit much in my eyes ~15 armor should cut it already, since there are no (reliable) Lethality/Mpen runes anymore. (RIP MagicPen once again)\n\nWhat do you think about this suggestion? Complete rubbish or pretty realistic suggestion? \nMaybe you have some other ideas for those 3 in mind? \n\nThanks for your time!\n\n_________\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThe reactiv part of my suggestion is unique compared to every other rune/runetriplet.\nNormaly you pick certain runes for a champ and then never change that again. Its \"this is the best/what I like the most\" and thats it, there is hardly a \"this might be better now\" option. You rather pick a complete different runesetup.\nWith those 3 there is not a \"best\" option! Everything is situational. You always can and should adjust this trio to your needs.\nYes, they are still pretty boring, but we are talking about minor runes for tanks, which are accessable as secondaries to other trees. This definitely needs to be kept in mind!\n\nBut we all seem to agree that the current triple is weak/not good :D\n\n\n _______\n\n**Edit2:**\n\nAs expected some suggestions combined Iron Skin and Mirror Shell into 1 rune.\nThe baseline is that this combined rune grants both Armor and MR and is still early focused,\ncompared to the later scaling of Conditioning. \nAn adaptive buff could be done too, but this might lead to a redesign of Conditioning too.\n\nThis leaves us with a free rune spot.\nThere are no resistance buffs in the tree, exept for the keystone, which is only reactiv armor/mr and requiers hard cc.\nSome \"survival\" enchanting runes could be usefull for tanks and as secondarys. \nRemember this is a must pick row for tanks and also other trees could pick this as secondarys, so kill/assist based things need to be made carefully.\n\nWe have an early game armor/mr buff and a scaling variant, so we can make a more fun and activ new rune, which is not so boring.\nMaking a new rune this \"late\" is tricky and riot will likely not do this, some stat adjustments on the otherhand are pretty easy and should not be a problem. \nTherefore there is no guarantie that anything will happen even if you come up with fantastic ideas, but do not let this hinder you in any way, shape or form!\n  \n\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-10-06T11:12:35.636+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"after iron skin and mirror shield are turned into one rune, i think legendary guardian (+3 armor/mr for every enemy nearby) should be brought back and take that third slot.\n\nso we get:\n\nfocus on early game power on a single resistance type (iron skin/mirror shield) vs. \n\nsituational, flat resistances dependent on enemies nearby (legendary guardian) vs. \n\nsacrificing early game power for a large resistance boost at 10 minutes with a 5% scaling component (conditioning)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2017-10-06T14:16:24.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you missunderstood something here :/\nIron Skin and Mirror Shell dont merge, and sadly as I would like to have a free slot for experimental runes, they cannot be merged easily because we cant determen which buff (Ar or MR) you want. \nBut it is not impossible, a \"choose option\" ingame similar looking to the kindred hunt thing might work.\n\nAs for the Legendary Guardian I personally would stay away from another flat resitance buff, but a situational buff might work.\nAnd we could go all out with this one!\n\nTenacity, Slowresistance, Something like brittle(aka lowering tenacity), critreduction, shield & heal buff, HP, flat/% armor/mr and alot more to choose from.\nDmg amps are a bit tricky because we have differs and assassins which could benefit a little to much.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-10-06T14:46:01.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XcEd2Htk,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2017-10-06T14:16:24.595+0000)\n>\n> I think you missunderstood something here :/\n> Iron Skin and Mirror Shell dont merge, and sadly as I would like to have a free slot for experimental runes, they cannot be merged easily because we cant determen which buff (Ar or MR) you want. \n> But it is not impossible, a &quot;choose option&quot; ingame similar looking to the kindred hunt thing might work.\n> \n> As for the Legendary Guardian I personally would stay away from another flat resitance buff, but a situational buff might work.\n> And we could go all out with this one!\n> \n> Tenacity, Slowresistance, Something like brittle(aka lowering tenacity), critreduction, shield &amp; heal buff, HP, flat/% armor/mr and alot more to choose from.\n> Dmg amps are a bit tricky because we have differs and assassins which could benefit a little to much.\n\nread the post above the one you reacted to.\n\nwe can easily do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2017-10-06T15:08:43.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no clue which one you are talking about xD\nCould you give me a link or a title?

But we somewhat need to be a bit carefull for the super armor tanks ramus, malp etc, the % could get pretty strong :D\n\nWhat do you mean by staking exactely?\nscaling with min/lvl?\n\nAnd would you say that they are ok with these changes or still pretty weak?","replies":[{"poster":"Jackom1","date":"2017-10-06T20:34:56.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the bonus is conditional on 20 health restored, which isn't a lot, but it's still implied that the champ using these runes has some degree of self healing. \nWe don't know yet if self-regen counts toward this bonus, although i hope that it won't, otherwise the 20 health condition would be meaningless. \nStill, they could add that the runes work only on self healing, so no soraka shenanigans.\n\nThat way, rammus and malphite (and galio for mirror shell) would be forced to take conditioning, since they lack any kind of self healing besides health regen. If they can't heal themselves in some way, they can't get either the bonus armor or the bonus mr (depending on the rune). \n\nAlso, making the runes stats means that, in order to make full use of the runes, the champion must not only be able to self heal himself, but to do it consistently, at least in some windowed instances. \nMundo comes to mind, and since he's also been made to better counter ap champions, him being able to full use MIRROR SHELL during the ult would be a good thing, and it would only be during the ult, since mundo's passive is counted as simple health regen. \n\nAlso, both iron skin and mirror shell offer a much more dinamic gameplay: \nYou have to heal yourself in order to get the bonus stats, but most melee champions need to go into melee to get any form of healing, which means that you can only make use of those runes if you commit to a fight. Not only that, but you need to fight those champions that this rune will eventually counter (there would be no point to fight a mage if you're going to stack iron shield). \nThat to me sounds like healthy gameplay, because it is dictated by decision-making. \n\nConditioning on the other hand is simply: don't look too hard for fights in the first 10 minutes of the game, then do what you want. \nYou're getting only 6% bonus mr and armor anyway, which isn't a lot. 6% of 300 is 18... it describes itself.\n \n\n10% of 300 is 30, now we're talking, kinda. But to get that 10%, you have to heal yourself at least twice in a 5 seconds window, during which there is a 99% chance that you're into a teamfight. Otherwise, chances are you've wasted a necessary heal. \nAdditionally, if you take iron shield, for instance, it means that you're going to invest into armor, which will eventually leave you open to champions who deal magic damage. Again, counterplay. You don't have that dinamic with conditioning. \n\nI think that a 10% bonus behind the self-healing condition (now it's just healing in general) would be ok for both iron skin and mirror shell. \n\n\nConditioning probably needs to go back to drawing board, since it provides no kind of dinamics besides take this bunch of free stats after 10 minutes. Conditioning could work based on the kind of damage you're currently tanking. \n\"Gain 6% bonus mr for 5 seconds when you suffer magic damage. Gain 6% armor when you suffer physical damage. 10 seconds CD.
