Is the support item change a buff or a nerf?  - An Analysis -","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":100,"down_votes":14,"body":"{{item:3400}}\n\nThere is a huge discussion around the new support items. \nSome claim its a huge buff, others say its the complete opposite. So what is it?\nLets check the changes and the facts!\n(There is a TL;DR: at the end...)\n__________\n                                   #**Arguments:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- save 1400g because of the free upgrade\n- 1st item earlier\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- worse overall stats\n- weaker early\n- loss of passive\n- complete loss of goldincome after Tier3 upgrade\n- worse gold generation\n----------------------------\n----------------------------\n# Item stat changes\n------\nLets look at the stat changes in detail:\n\n#**Tier 1**\n**Relic line:**{{item:3858}} /{{item:3854}} \n\n- raw stats 50g more gold efficent\n- loss of shared passive heal (5-30HP)\n- gp10 aprox the same\n\n**Spellthief line:** {{item:3850}}/ {{item:3862}} \n\n- raw stats 140g less gold efficent, no manaregen\n- loss of dmg passive\n- max of +4gp10 possible\n\nSidenote:\nThe relic heal passiv could be compensated by a dorans shield, and the spellthief passive roughly by a ~20 Ap increase (if we approximate ~70%Ap scalings).\nMeaning both items lost ~+400 gold with their passives. This is especially important for the Tier 2 items!\nTo off set the missing manaregen on the Spellthief linie you would also need another 150g. \n\n--------------------------------------------\n#Conclusion Tier 1:\nThe support items are clearly nerfed at the start of the game, especially the spellthief line.\nBut the loss of the healing on the relic line is also pretty bad, because this might cause worse gold effiency, since you might not want to share a minion, because of the dmg you will receive in return.\n\n---------------\n\n#**Tier 2**\n\n**Relic line:**{{item:3859}}/ {{item:3855}} \n\n- 450g upgrade costs safed\n- stats have the same cost efficency, but are arguably worse (_+10 AP/ +6 AD vs 25 HP and 50% HpReg_ (which is very important in the laning phase))\n- much worse gold generation. (old 30s recharge vs 45s recharge; The +1gp10 doesnt help to reduce the offset)\n- loss of passive heal (10-60HP)\n\n**Spellthief line:** {{item:3851}}/ {{item:3863}} \n\n- 450g upgrade cost safed\n- loss of 440g worth of stats, (especially 10%cdr and 50% manaReg)\n- loss of passive dmg\n- loss of up to 6gp10\n\n**Sidenote:**\nThe shared heal on the relic line doubled to 10-60HP (based on missing HP), so a Dorans is still needed to compensate this.\nThe passive dmg on the spellthief line increased so we would need approx 25 AP to compensate this.\nAnd the free upgrade will not happen with your 1st Back, the upgrade will be around the 10min mark earliest.\n  ----------------------------------\n#**Conclusion Tier 2:**\nIf you want to have the same early as with the old relic line, you are forced to buy a dorans. Meaning you have not saved any gold and have worse gold generation. \nIf you want to trade a much worse early for an earlier 1st item, that is possible, but you will not be ahead by 450g because of the worse gold gen.\nAnd you will receive the \"free\" bonus stats only after the upgrade, meaning around the 10-12 min or 20-24min mark.\n\nIt is even worse for the spellthief line, because your 450g \"saved\" is technically completely eaten up by the lost stats. Ontop losing the passive dmg and worse gold generation.\n\nIn both cases you can ether try to have the same early as before, but you will have worse gold generation overall and even less gold in the spellthief line,\nor you go for an eariler 1st item spike, which is not a pure 450g earlier, its a bit less, and the spike itself will be a bit weaker. Only after you get the free upgrades things even out somewhat, except for the lower gold generation.\n__________________\n\n# **Tier 3:**\n  \n**Relic line:**{{item:3860}} /{{item:3857}} \n  \n- 1400g cost saved\n- loss of a total of 170g worth of stats( ontop lossing 200% hpreg and 10%cdr)\n- **catastrophic gold generation**_ (old: 4 stacks/20s recharge (= max 33.5gp10) + 1gp10 **VS** 3gp10)_\n= loss of **up to 189g per minute**, once Tier is reached.\n- loss of shared passive heal (15-90HP)\n\n**Spellthief line:** {{item:3853}} /{{item:3864}} \n\n- 1400g cost saved\n- loss of a total of 106g worth of stats (ontop not having CDR or manareg)\n- **abyssmal gold generation** (old: 3 stacks/ 22g/ 10s recharge = max 22gp10 + 2gp10 **VS** 3gp10)\n= loss of **up to 126g per minute**, once Tier 3 is reached.\n- loss of dmg passive (same dmg &amp; gold as tier 2 btw)\n\n**Sidenote:**\nThe 1400g is technically only 1230g and 1294g saved from the raw stats, but this is even less since we have worse gold generation before the final upgrade. By rough approximation you should have about 200-300g less gold once you hit the final upgrade(20-24min). \nMeaning you save only 1000g and have now virtually no more gold income, but technically you are missing stats which you had before and need to invest gold again to get them back (like 10%cdr= 266g, 200% hpReg = 600g, 50% mana reg = 250g).\n\nThus the 1000g saved, is in reality partly a shifted towards other stats, and not just purely saved 1000g, keep that in mind.\n\nAnother important note is, that often you didnt upgrade the frostfang, and to a much lesser degree targons, because the upgrade doesnt bring you much.\nYou would rather have your first item 1000g sooner! So you didnt save 1400g on your first item, you **only** save 450g!\nAnd as mentioned, the old tier 2 upgrade was much better and had better gold generation, so it is not even 450g that you save.\n\n_____\n\n#**Conclusion Tier 3:**\n\nYou only get the big free upgrade very late into the game, around the 20- 24min mark. Meaning you dont actually benefit from the free stats until then. Ontop it is not 1400g, it is only 1230g/ 1294g respectively that you \"save\" compared to the old items (ignoring the worse gold gen for now).\nBut in there is also a major stat shift, so you need to buy the missing stats, if their absent doesnt bother you, reducing the actual \"free\" gold amount even more.\n\nA very big problem is the loss of the income passives once you hit the Tier 3 upgrade. You lose up to 189g/min and 126g/min, starting aprox. at min 25.\nThis means in a 40min game you have up to 2.835 gold less now than before!\nAnd we are talking about the support role, which has already 3000+ less gold at the end of the game comparded to very other role!\nLets assume the free upgrade minus the worse gold gen, is just a clean 1000g buff, once you hit the Tier 3 upgarde. In less then 8 mins, this will be a flat out nerf to the support role.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n# TL;DR:\n\n**Arguments:**\n**Pros:**\n\n~~- save 1400g because of the free upgrade~~\nNope, its a 1000g save **at best**, once you hit Tier 3\n- 1st item earlier\nYes, technically, BUT: its only, at best, 450g earlier and you have a much weaker early, which could then delay you again.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- worse overall stats\nYes\n- weaker early\nYes\n- loss of passive\nYes\n- complete loss of goldincome after Tier3 upgrade\nYes,Yes,Yes\n- worse gold generation\nYes\n\n\n**Overall:**\n\n1. The supp items are nerfed at the start of the game (especially the loss of the passive heal on the relic line)\n\n2. 1st buy: Worse gold generation, worse stats/weaker overall.\n Ether the freed up gold could be used to balance the early game out, resulting in the roughly the same early, or be used to get the 1st item approx &lt;450g earlier, at the cost of a much weaker early.\n\n3. The midgame is the same, because the loss of the passives and lower gold generation balance out the free upgrade stats and a potential bit ealier 1st item. (Or overall weaker, if you bought things to help out your early game)\n\n4. Once you complete your Tier 3 upgrade (~20-24min mark) you have a small power spike,\n\n5. But this powerspike drops hard every minute afterwards, nullifing it 6 to 12min later.\n\n6. The late game (30min+) is completely trashed, because of the removal of the gold income, and supports were already extremely behind in the lategame.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe support item change is clearly a nerf.\n- A much weaker start/early, \n- at best, the same midgame, \n- a minor powerspike at the end of the midgame,\n- and an utterely trashed lategame, where supports are already behind\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Edit:** I have purposely avoided the Anti-Poaching for now, until I know for sure if there is any special interaction with the CS you get from/because of the relic line passive!\n(Riots wording is a bit unclear to me, especially the 50 CS line (is it flat 50 cs or 50cs/5minute = 10cs/minute(aka perfect cs-ing? Need to test that first):\n\"**EAT THE RICH**_ Farming more than 20 CS per 5 minutes (3 out of 10 waves) reduces gold from minions by 50%. The penalty increases with further CS to a max of 80% reduction at 50 minions._\n**MATH **_Once the penalty kicks in, your CS gold is reduced to (70 - CS within 5 minutes)% _\")\n\nBut I can say 3 things already:\n1. The idea is very good and needed to prevent sololaners from abuseing the gold items!\n2. You still get some gold, its not completely taken away, keep that in mind, but there are a lot of cases where this wouldnt make any sense/be justified anymore. (Like the lategame wave setup, home base defence etc.)\n3. We would need to go through all of the scenarios first (also the bad ones, where the supp purposely takes all the farm, which he shouldnt have to resort to, because we got the gold income items ;D), before we can make a clear verdict about this!\nBut so far the removal of the Anti-Poaching on the Tier 3 upgrade (and keeping the goldincome passive) is a very good idea, and I havnt found cases where this is bad, YET! :D\n(But once again, we will need to run some numbers on the anti-poach penalty (if solo laners could abuse it especially))\n \n\n\n\n**P.S.** Im sorry for all the spelling and grammar mistakes, Im not a native speaker.\nIf you find anymore, please let me know! \nI have made a comment down below, where you can give me feedback about mistakes I have made, to keep this feedback seperate from the other disucssions :D","replies":[{"poster":"Jimmy Rustles","date":"2019-11-22T20:47:10.197+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":4,"body":"Another point is basically no one got tier 3 versions of support items, especially the frostfang line\n\nSo really not as much gold saved as they advertised, except for those long games where you had your 5 items and had nothing to buy except support upgrade","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2019-11-22T21:24:22.915+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I tried to include this inside the \"sidenode\" part in the Tier 3 overview :D\nYou didnt purchase tier 3 frostfang item, but the relic line Tier 3 was bought often enough, because it gave better stats and an even better gold generation^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ηuawei","date":"2019-11-23T18:02:25.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jimmy Rustles,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wAQGmFOh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-11-22T20:47:10.197+0000)\n>\n> Another point is basically no one got tier 3 versions of support items, especially the frostfang line\n> \n> So really not as much gold saved as they advertised, except for those long games where you had your 5 items and had nothing to buy except support upgrade\n\nLol thats so true.\n\nSometimes i even preffered to sell the wards altogether and buy a deathcap if i was playing Zyra for example","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cry of the Celts","date":"2019-11-23T03:16:14.560+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Desert,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wAQGmFOh,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-22T20:41:03.276+0000)\n>\n> Sidenode:\n> The relic heal passiv could be compensated by a dorans shield, and the spellthief passive roughly by a ~20 Ap increase (if we approximate ~70%Ap scalings).\n> Meaning both items lost ~+400 gold with their passives.

The counter to sustain is all in, and the counter to all in is poke. If your all in champion is below 75% health, it doesn't matter if their all in is better.

Brand, Zyra, and Vel'Koz prefer Liandries, just because of how gold efficient the item is with their kit, and Lux abuses Athenes incredibly well. If you buy Ludens on a support budget, you're basically gutting any chance you have to get a lead in the game, because the item is a scaling item that you just don't have the AP to back up.\n\nSecondly, if you're an ADC and you get hit by all the abilities of any support, you should probably die. That was you mispositioning, and the enemy support capitalized on it. If you get punted back by an Alistar, what difference is that to getting full comboed by Brand? Either way you're dead, with no real recourse than pray that your support can save you, after you put yourself in a position to be engaged on.\n\nBrand, Zyra, and Lux specifically CAN'T go midlane anymore. So you're basically saying that \"Oh, Zyra, Brand, and Lux, who already had bad winrates in the game, now get to have even worse winrates, because they're laning champions and we just gutted their lane\"\n\nNot just that, it seriously hurt other champions too. Yuumi, for example. If your support picks yuumi- They're inting. The champion is basically dead right now because the spellthiefs line has been gutted.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Smyrage","date":"2019-11-23T18:56:40.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever played ADC against those champions? I did, and I played Zyra as well for example. I know quite well that as Zyra, you only need to get one AP item and an all-in will instagib any squishies, including  ADCs.\n\n\"Secondly, if you're an ADC and you get hit by all the abilities of any support, you should probably die.\" - I would agree, if mage supports didn't have some sort of soft or hard CC in their kit, which allows them to follow up. At Lv6 Lux only needs to land one Q and 90% of your HP is gone, if you actually survive what will be coming after it. Same for others. Your point is true, if you are playing against Morgana, but even that scenario the damage is done by the ADC mostly.\n\nWhy can't they go midlane? Why are you still pretending that mages can't play on that lane? Especially the likes of Lux, Veigar and Brand? Because of the myth that assassins counter them? Mages can farm with their abilities from safe distance. I'm not a midlane main, but I never lost the lane a single time as e.g Brand and I saw many times Lux bullying and winning against assassins. Heck, during clash our top ran Zyra and it was working.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2019-11-23T07:34:02.828+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XJ99999999999999,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wAQGmFOh,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2019-11-23T04:04:52.521+0000)\n>\n> supports are not meant to be equal to the adc in terms of strength or the jungle/top in terms of durability.\n> \n> you play the character for what they offer against the enemy comp and your comp.\n> \n> people got so spoiled off all the free damage supports got.

Even if a mage support is winning lane, they still shouldn't be allowed to be stronger than a mid laner that isn't far behind.\n\nMage supports CAN outdamage their midlaners.  But this literally doesn't happen unless the midlaner is bad or passive or the support pops off by outplaying their lane.\n\nSure, Galio will get outdamaged by Zyra.  One is a tank that plays farmy and passive.  Other is a spam mage that fits well in support.  Obviously this happens.  There's utility mids and mage bots.\n\nBut that Zyra will never outdamage things like Syndra, Zed, Xerath, ect unless they pop off like crazy or the midlaner does poorly.  If both players perform at about the same skill level, the player with a higher gold budget will do more damage.  The fact you're arguing otherwise is frankly quite insane and I will never agree with you people on this.\n\nSupports finally were allowed a gold budget in S4 and stopped being complete ward bots.  Sure, that means sometimes supports are actually allowed to carry.  The role become more diverse like top or mid, you can play a variety of roles.  You have enough budget to buy carry items or focus on buffing someone else instead.  S7 we had a support dominant meta and if you argued THAT is a problem I'd agree with you.  But you're making an argument that just isn't true to try and revert one of the best and long lasting changes supports have ever got in the history of this game.  Over half the lifetime of this game supports have had good gold items that enable them to do their job without being total ward bots.\n\nBut the fact you're actually arguing that support as a role is on level with mid is insane.  Just because supports overperform in specific matches from someone getting outplayed doesn't mean mathematically support is on level with mid.  That is a total denial of reality.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mr Sa1nt","date":"2019-11-23T07:18:14.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well I only had to play one game of support to notice that as an AP support, I felt just weaker in general. My ADC made 12k damage, enemy adc made 16k, but we were the winning team...and were quite ahead. Meanwhile as AP morg, I have only 8k damage. That's about 4k less than I'd have normally at the same point of the game....without being fed or having a lead.\n\nI felt like any lead I got on the enemy support, was extremely minor. It felt like if my ADC wouldn't hard shove the lane, I'd be punished and starved from gold(luckily my ADC was shoving, and I could auto the enemy tower). I was distinctly weaker in comparison to all members of the team...and weaker than any other Morgana game I've EVER played.\n\nEnemy support was even weaker than I was, by a lot. They lost their lane, and I didn't feel like it meant anything at all to my own gameplay. I could've been losing lane, and aside from less gold generation...I probably would've still had hardly any damage on the board. But my CC score was pretty high, way higher than everyone else's (although morgana has one of the highest CC kits in the game anyways). So I was landing my abilities, was ahead in gold, CC, everything... but making low impact damage wise. Doesn't seem at all balanced to me.\n\nThat and I noted, that since I can't spend the small amount of gold to upgrade my AP support item...I didn't have a lot of mana regen. Which is fine, except that a lot of the efficient mana regen items cost more than the 450g I could spend on my first back. I would go OOM after using only a few abilities.\n\nWhat's even worse, is with that little scoop they added to the side lanes...enemies can now dodge abilities easier, they have more options for moving around potentially. My lane felt more passive, I felt like I had almost no gold, and that I was weak in damage. Didn't matter if I landed the majority of my binds.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2019-11-23T18:19:40.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Good thing Morgana is a primarily mage and not a support, and not a part of this discussion.\n\nThe removal of damage from spellthiefs was specifically intended to hurt mage \"supports\" who bring essentially nothing but damage and poor lane interaction.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Sa1nt","date":"2019-11-23T18:41:46.386+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GinoSoldier,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wAQGmFOh,comment-id=000f0000,timestamp=2019-11-23T18:19:40.035+0000)\n>\n> Good thing Morgana is a primarily mage and not a support, and not a part of this discussion.\n\nNot part of this discussion? This is about supports. Morgana has been considered a support for many seasons...since what, something like season 4?\n\n> The removal of damage from spellthiefs was specifically intended to hurt mage \"supports\" who bring essentially nothing but damage and poor lane interaction.\n\nIf by mage you mean, she doesn't belong in bot lane supporting her ADC, then you're pretty wrong about that. As someone who has played Mid lane Morg since season 2, I can safely say she is just BETTER as a support, as she is a utility champion. Yes she makes a lot of damage, but her CD's and dps aren't exactly the highest. It's her high base damages and crowd control that really hurt. She isn't that bad compared to other mid laners(assuming you never miss your Q), but she is way better at supporting than she is at being mid lane.\n\nAlso Morgana is a CC bot, just like Leona. The only differences are that she is squishy, and also has higher base damage. I don't see how morgana DOESN'T bring anything to lane. If anything, she is just stronger with an ally than on her own. Her black shield is literally one of the best utility spells in the game, for an ADC.\n\nYou want to talk about unhealthy AP supports, Vel Koz/brand scale without having items, or multi purpose utility.
