Champ select is over and we go connect and it gives me a connection error and my client black screens. I had to restart my entire computer. When I reopened league it said there was an error with the patch. It wasn't only me either. My duo partner also had the same error and ending up getting afk queues. My team remakes and I'm assuming that's gonna count as a loss. I guess there's not much to even do about it but honestly it's not fair that I get a loss for something that's wrong with your servers or client or whatever. It's only a minor thing but very very annoying. That's obviously gonna affect where I place and my friend has to sit through five 20 minute waits to get in a game. Riot pls.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-07T23:08:22.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens like that suggests connection problems by failing to download assets, and the error further affirms that.  I wasn't able to see any issues with the game servers, so I suggest you guys try the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get this fixed up.  Hopefully that will do the trick so you and your friend can continue with your placements.  Best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
