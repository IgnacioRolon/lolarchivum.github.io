Having 5 rows of champions on the selection screen is making it glaringly obvious that I have more than 2 champions. I wouldn&#039;t care, except that I want to refund leblanc so I can get ekko with RP. But leblanc is not in my purchase history. Can somebody help please? I really want to have him... I could refund tryndamere but then I wouldn&#039;t have enough IP to get lucian.

It's been posted multiple times and never gotten a Red response that I've seen ever, so i figured I'd give it a shot too for those who've never gotten a response. So here goes:\n\nWill there ever be the possibility of getting more refunds other than a lifetime of 3 on your account. Something like for every X (12) months of activity you will receive 1 refund credit to your account.\n\nOr perhaps to make it easy like player rewards could be like positive behavior one refund per year for positive play?\n\n\nJust Figured I'd ask, especially since we've already got you here Katey. :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-01T16:57:35.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiya lxlLilybellelxl! \n\nAs far as I know, we don't have plans to change how the system works currently. This isn't something my team (skins) specifically works on, but I'd be happy to pass along your feedback. I think the idea for positive behavior would be cool - but lemme ask you this - would you rather receive a skin, or be given a refund token?
