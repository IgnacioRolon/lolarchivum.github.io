There is also a limit on how many chests you can obtain over a period of time until it refreshes.  The limit indicator is available under your profile near your re-roll counter.   I recommend also checking our [Hextech Crafting Guide ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide)for a more comprehensive guide on this.

What gives?\n\n>The drop rate for key fragments is a curve, not a line. With each fragment you earn, the chance to earn your next one goes down slightly. This number resets roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment.\n\nAs for chests, the most common reason I've seen is the fact that people are playing champions that they have already earned a chest with. You can only earn one chest per champion per season, so if you are playing a champion you have already earned a chest with, you will not be able to earn another chest with them, no matter how many S grades you get.\n\nIf you want to check which champions you have already earned a chest with, you can go to the champions tab in your summoner profile. The champions you have already earned a chest with will have a special golden border around their icon.\n\nFor more information about the hextech system, you can check out this guide here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warmanreaper","date":"2016-07-17T01:57:59.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yours probably hasn't reset yet , When was the 1st day you got a key last month , this month , that day is when it resets.","replies":[]}]}
