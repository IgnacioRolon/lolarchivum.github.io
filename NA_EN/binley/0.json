Upon further examination, an axe vanishes when Draven is standing on two axe landing symbols or if Draven is in the middle of an auto right before a regular axe is thrown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Binley","date":"2015-03-26T03:30:52.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a video of the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-03-26T00:38:59.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What specifically have you noticed that is different?
