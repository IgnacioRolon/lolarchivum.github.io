How is that going to help Kai'Sa save her carry during the first 15 minutes of the game?

With good macro and mechanics, you might be able to draw out the game until 20, at which point you can no longer hold your team hostage and they will forfeit. And probably report you for griefing.","replies":[{"poster":"Chainman3","date":"2019-09-22T20:41:25.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They can report all they want.

If your team has expressed that it would bother them and you do it anyway, it's griefing.","replies":[{"poster":"Chainman3","date":"2019-09-23T03:15:36.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"no its not wtf.
