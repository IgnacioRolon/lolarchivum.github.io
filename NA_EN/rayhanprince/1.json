That means full female lineup of new champions in 2019!\nWhen i'm lookig for a champion to play and i dont find any new champion of my taste for years, i feel bored and frustrated.Shouldn't riot release champions of different style of background? \nRiot whats the actual flip is your agenda of new champions?","replies":[{"poster":"SSmotzer","date":"2019-09-16T07:35:49.059+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there are currently 52 female champions\n\nThere are currently 92 male champions\n\nAnd there is one Kindred.\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/SrqXLCj/unnamed.png\n\nAs you can see by this graph, it's going to take more than the next year to make up the gap between male and female champions.

Because I don't like looking at men. It's much harder to impress me with a male character design than it is a female design.\n\nHowever, Disney characters? Really? Yuumi is straight out of Japanese mahou shoujo, if... a little shallow on that front. Qiyana is ambitious to the point of being murderous. Neeko is a fucking chameleon. How are any of these Disney tropes?\n\n> when qiyana yells i'm gonna go now, ur future empress is back etc stuffs - these sounds like qiyana of all people is a homicidal warrior?\n\nAll warriors are homicidal, if you get down to it. What you're doing is seeing things too shallow. Qiyana is but one of many potential heirs in a semi-feudal society. She kills only so far as it will grow her legend and move her to the top of the line of succession. What she sounds like to _me_ when she says that is exactly what she is: A feudal warrior-princess who is extremely self-confident. Strange as it sounds, killing for ambition isn't necessarily a \"crazy evil girl\" thing in feudal societies. It's frowned upon, but it doesn't necessarily expect that the lord or lady in question is \"homicidal\", by technical definition.\n\n> one thing sure she insults a lot but with that hip size she aint crushing any piltover mechs.\n\nWhy not? Does the size of one's hips affect their command over the elements? There's absolutely no science to support this theory.\n\n> i also like anime heros\n\n----\n\n> And kaisa aint fighting any void monsters with pout lips ,spa hair and open cleavge suits.\n\n**REM (RE:ZERO)**, skull-crushing one-horned oni who is perhaps the most vicious physical fighter in her series.\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rezero/images/1/1b/Rem_Character_Art.png\n\n**ASUNA (SWORD ART ONLINE)**, lightning-fast rapier fighter who is among the most skilled and respected warriors in her series.\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dimensional-heroes/images/2/24/Asuna.jpg\n\n**TSUNADE (NARUTO)**, renowned unarmed combatant capable of destroying an entire street with one finger.\nhttp://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140531040322/naruto/images/c/ce/Tsunade_full.png\n\n**SHIHÅŒIN YORUICHI (BLEACH)**, regarded as one of the most powerful warriors in her franchise, ever.\nhttps://66.media.tumblr.com/df743fb467bb3b6187c7ca105a05a6c3/tumblr_oylrb3GpKm1wybe1qo1_500.jpg\n\n**RORI MERCURY (GATE)**, shown across all media to be one of the top three most powerful beings in her universe.\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gate-thus-the-jsdf-fought-there/images/1/18/91f68b71.jpg\n\n**KUSANAGI MOTOKO (GHOST IN THE SHELL)**, a highly capable combatant, hacker, and all around special agent.\nhttps://studiesofamerica.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/motoko_kusanagi3.jpg\n\nI dunno.
