My first game would not go over 20 fps.  I am running Win 10 at this time fully updated on the Microsoft side.  I tried practice games later and still stayed at 20 fps.\r\n\r\nI did 2 things.  I clicked on the options wheel and selected \"Close Client During Game\".  And then I got the latest NVidia Drivers.  This fixed most of my FPS issues.  I've still noticed a few issues with the new client, but nothing like dropping from 144 (capped at my GSync Monitor) to 20 fps.  That should help I hope.  If I have further issues I will post my troubleshooting.  Otherwise, I hope this helped someone.  ;)\r\n\r\n-SJ","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T23:18:38.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Double check your video settings and make sure you don't have frame rates capped.
