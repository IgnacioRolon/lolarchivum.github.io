I've noticed hotfixes are happening less and less often. Granted this may be because the issues that used to be hotfixed in the past are no longer happening, or you guys are deciding an issue is not impactful enough to warrant a hotfix. However, I believe the systems you guys are implementing over the past year and a half have slowed down your ability to make changes to the game on the fly. If you are able to fix something in seconds, you should be able to hotfix it that night.\n\nYou being slowed down by other teams and individuals you do not have information from is a bad sign. You are the one who fixed it, you should immediately have the information of when the fix will occur. Either that or make it happen yourself (I realize this may not be how your company works anymore). I think that since patches are planned so far ahead of time at Riot, when something deviates from the plan it takes more time to be acted upon then in the past.\n\n I agree that this kind of thing shouldn't happen in the first place, but it almost certainly will again sometime. When that time comes I am concerned that the coders will once again be limited by what the whole deployment team and various other people want to do. Make sure to keep the lines of communication open with them. You must not sacrifice game quality for any other influences.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zork824","date":"2014-07-21T14:26:22.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehi!

I don't doubt that this bug is an emergent one, how only riot knows, but it SHOULD be as simple as adding or removing a trait from the item.(key word being should).","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2014-07-21T06:13:03.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"*Touche.*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-07-21T05:45:41.128+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowing the issues that have cropped up in weird places in League's spaghetti code, it's probably a lot more than one line of code.
