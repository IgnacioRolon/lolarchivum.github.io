I admire that you introduced Remake system (which my friend, that I tried to go in game with, used, after my game crashed 7 times ina  row), I understand that there is no way to recognize that the player has lost connection during the game, but when the game crashes? The CLIENT detects that itself. Why would you not implement that, and send report to the server? so I do not have to deal with bans in the future, if the code of patcher f*cks up again? \r\n\r\nPlease.","replies":[{"poster":"Universal Scarf","date":"2016-07-26T09:17:37.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update - I repaired the game, and it is still crashing.

Running a repair was a solid first step, but we may need to take a deeper look here.

I am not talking about connection loss in the middle of the game, I am talking about the specific case where I couldn't even connect because the patcher damaged my files.\n\nWhy is that not detected? Since it requires repairing or another pretty long process, it's not like I am gonna be done in 3 minutes before remake system comes in? Why is that particular situation not detected, and why players take penalties when Riot software fails to work?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Universal Scarf","date":"2016-07-27T08:18:50.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for reaching out to me, but the complete re-install solved the issue. \n\nIt took ages, but it solved the issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-26T10:01:43.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These crashes are likely due network instability.\n\n[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[]},{"poster":"Universal Scarf","date":"2016-07-26T09:21:45.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another Update - my friend, who I went into custom game with, had \"no champion bug\" - nothing loade up, he head no champion to play with, and no allied vision on the map at all.","replies":[]}]}
