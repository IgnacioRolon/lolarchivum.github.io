While I was in my last game, I got \"Attempting to Reconnect\" every 2 minutes or so. I still could see everyone moving, but no animations of damage, death, and other typical \"connectivity issue\" symptoms. I had to manually quit and reconnect a few times. Then I got disconnected right at the end of the game.\r\n\r\nAnd I couldn't see if it counted as a win (because the last thing I saw before another DC, was their surrender vote), or it counted as a leave, because when I went into client, it disconnected me from chat, and now I cannot login. I couldn't report Rammus that was flaming me the whole game, I cou;dn't see what grade I got in the game (it is definitely not an S, but still).\r\n\r\nLogged into boards to see my match history. Shows as a win.\r\n\r\nPlease help. Currently cannot login into client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-12T16:01:33.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there is an unstable connection with your network trying to reach our servers.
