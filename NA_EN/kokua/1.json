Tried to log in today, unable to connect to the login queue.\nWindows 7, so those running around saying \"windows 10 is the problem\" is unrelated.\nMy computer was completely wiped just 2 weeks ago, with only a handful of programs reinstalled. Everything is up to date.\nTried switching the dns to google. Tried using the HRT. Power cycled both pc and router/modem.\nTried to disable avast temporarily to launch LoL, as that was related to some of my past problems. No effect.\nTrying to log in to NA servers from Guam.\n\nGuess there's nothing else to do but play another game today, and hope it works later tonight, or tomorrow.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-13T22:11:43.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah there were a few players impacted by login issues last night.
