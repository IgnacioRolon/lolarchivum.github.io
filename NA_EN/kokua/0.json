Afterwards, clicking resulted in the character moving 10-20 seconds after the first click, and followed wherever it was clicked afterwards, or being idle too long and having the Attempting to Reconnect appear, and finding myself back in spawn. I typed 2 lines in chat just a couple seconds apart, and they appeared 24 seconds apart, with the first message appearing 20-30 seconds after being entered. Obviously as this is completely unplayable, I attempted to restart my client, which I might add, took FOREVER to launch, authenticate, and reconnect. By the time I was able to reconnect to the match and actually be able to move my champion, ~8 minutes had passed, they out leveled me ~6 levels, and they were pushing our nexus. My internet browser and EVERYTHING else worked perfectly fine without any delay while this was happening, except this game had major connection issues for whatever reason. I had no downloads or antivirus scans in the background, and there is nobody else here. My CPU usage averaged 10% +/- 5%. It just so happened to be the one urf game where the teams weren't completely unbalanced, and I actually had a chance at winning, of the 5 played in a row without having issues in any of the previous matches...\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-25T02:47:17.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From reading the snippet of the report you received, it seems like your connection is experiencing a crazy amount of packet loss when your ping spikes.  This means your computer is attempting to send information to the server, but most of it is getting lost in the process.  The best step you can take to get this resolved is to complete all of the steps found in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  There are quite a few steps there, but every single one is crucial in hopefully eliminating this problem for good.\n\nIf it still ain't working, reply back and let us know!","replies":[{"poster":"Å uedo","date":"2017-08-25T11:12:24.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! I've been looking everywhere for something related to \"packet loss\" since this last patch was released and this is the only thing that's somewhat close to it. I've watched my fps and ms and i'm not dropping anytime it happens. My character teleports for 1-3 seconds and casting spells is also delays sometimes as well. I've talked to many other people and they think its because of ornn and when he crafts something. but that's not the case because It happens even when he's not in game. I have a gif of an extreme case of it. this one lasted for about 5 seconds of nothing responding. If you would like a more clear video of it happening I can provide that. I would really like to hear back from you because I feel like it is server side because it's only been happening since the patch launched\n\ngif - https://gyazo.com/73106257fb14e8a3c3d220e711156fc3","replies":[]}]}]}
