But the service status now is showing all green, but the same issue as last week came up. Unable to connect to the login queue. Last time, there were a flood of threads and posts about it, but seeing as there is no current thread about it, I figured I'd post it up. I already tried all the fixes last time, and the only thing that worked was... to walk away for a couple hours, and come back. So. I think i'll just do that again.","replies":[{"poster":"ViggeR","date":"2017-07-21T18:29:17.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fucking same here","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-20T16:08:02.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the post, Kokua!
