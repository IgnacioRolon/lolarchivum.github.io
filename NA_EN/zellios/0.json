She's not even hard to play anymore imo.\n\nAA now has 20% CDR\n\nPresence of Mind refund stacks with Tear/AA refund. So when you proc Presence of Mind, you will refund 115% with tear or 125% with AA of all mana spent for 7 seconds. So you can drop her ult and make a net profit of 25% of the mana cost for 7 seconds. Ofc you can stack Manaflow Band on top of that but you should be just using Manaflow Band whenever it comes up for maximum sustain.\n\nPresence of MInd is getting remade because Riot knows it's too strong on its best users like Anivia.","replies":[]}]}
