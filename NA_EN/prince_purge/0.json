All within the past two days, I had a team got that 3 kills by invading while we had an AFK top laner. They all decided not to vote yes to the remake. We inevitably lost. Not saying that is bannable, but it's ridiculous. Just now I had a player who went Master Yi bot lane, and got extremely fed. But he had a bounty, and kept suiciding by diving underneath their turrets. Getting two kills for one isn't worth it if you have a 700 gold bounty. He died 15 times eventually. I asked him to play smarter, not focus on kills, and not just go in at the sight of any champion. He kept dying to 1v1 a rammus. He then said he was just a for fun player who only wanted to get kills because it was fun and it wasn't his main account. I would be fine with that if it wasn't ranked. The purpose of ranked is to win, and improve your gameplay. He was doing neither, and stopping the rest of us from doing either of those. Because he took every kill (more than 35), 1 player was ahead while everyone else was behind. Not only that, but his bounties kept making them inevitably more ahead than us. I reported him, but because it wasn't for toxicity, (even though in the chat he was toxic, that wasn't what made him specifically reportable the most) and because I was the only one to report him, nothing is going to happen. I have been reported and banned for everything, from the smallest offense, to getting drunk on an account and saying the N word hard R in all chat. That was 100% on me, I am not saying that it was right, but unfortunate. And for someone like me that has been banned so many times, seeing so many players ruin the experience of others IN RANKED ESPECIALLY, and for them to never get any consequence, is absurd. I can not be the only person who sees this.\r\n\r\nAnd for anyone questioning the credibility of my permabanned accounts,\r\n\r\nStone Arrow (will provide screenshots of me talking to riot support, asking to delete that account permanently after my ban)\r\nKid Insomnia\r\nWhistersnivet\r\nYuvn Ti\r\nVanity Trickster\r\n\r\nPS. I really want to permanently delete Yuvn Ti for the username back because it is my music name on social media. I don't know why but Riot Support specifically said they can't do that. Considering that the account is permanently banned, I don't see why they can't do that.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-13T23:41:36.190+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A claim that reports are ineffective and \"never get any consequence\" is directly contradicted by the fact that you've had five accounts permanently banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Prince Purge","date":"2019-05-13T23:56:41.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't been banned in over a year.
