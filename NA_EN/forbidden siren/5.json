Since I don&#039;t have a PBE account, I have to resort to watching random gameplay videos on Youtube until it comes out but after watching a few, I&#039;ve noticed some things that I&#039;m unsure if it justify the 1350 RP price tag and I hope someone from the skin department can provide a few words to justify its 1350 RP price tag.\n\n- Recall Inconsistencies: I noticed Karma&#039;s face disappeared right before her body turns blue. The moment she looks up and about to do the &quot;Yoga Tree&quot; pose, her face become... faceless. Unsure if this was intended but it&#039;s quite noticeable and felt incomplete.\n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wF3pk7ZarGg/WDQXXN3XQ-I/AAAAAAAAY0w/kVWwtcBfIscRxrHDIql1UC7gasLeKGalwCLcB/s1600/karmarecall.gif\n\n- The Tether of W/RW: When she tether someone, the line that connects to her opponent is just a recolored version of her default particles. Instead of deep purple, it&#039;s bright blue. That&#039;s about it. Any chance you guys can do more with it? \n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XzsCFe4Hq6Y/WDQn-TIiVbI/AAAAAAAAY2o/S8I0UPp9m-kuUCIq6TxZsRbV5PU1BxrKgCLcB/s1600/karmaw.jpg\n(Note: I&#039;m aware the snare in the photo is bugged with her default green particles, just talking about the tether)\n\n- Shields: The shield is barely noticeable. It would be nice if the snowflake design is brighter. It&#039;s also a bit too similar to Order of the Lotus shield but instead of orange with lotus design, it&#039;s blue with snowflakes design. At least Lotus was bright and noticeable.\n\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sOaKSnwOr-4/WDQn-IMK1pI/AAAAAAAAY2Y/sUSp7LLNSsgCt26yQKHvjIMma1xhCqF9QCLcB/s1600/karmae.jpg\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/BxHvCIICMAAxfa5.jpg\n\nI personally feel it&#039;s a 975 RP skin and the only reason I can see why you want to price it at 1350 RP is the new recall animation, her Q/RQ particles and the snow sound effects, but honestly, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s much to justify it when comparing it to her Lotus skin. Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s a GORGEOUS skin but I hope someone at Riot can take the time to explain to us why it&#039;s priced this much or perhaps let us know if you guys are looking into doing more with the skin/particles like you did with Bewitched Morgana.","replies":[{"poster":"Death and Doom","date":"2016-11-29T06:44:58.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":16,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-11-29T06:45:54.202+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worldbreakers were 750s...","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbyssionKnight","date":"2016-11-29T07:18:06.221+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Death and Doom,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3TOmRNxn,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-11-29T06:44:58.006+0000)\n>\n> Maybe Order of the lotus is a better skin ( i dont, personally) but this skin definitely deserves 1350 rp, and not 975.\n\nYou realise Order of the Lotus is 975, right?

Looking at her default skin animations, we all know she is missing a few things, so no need to get into that. Another thing to point out is that her Warden Skin on her pre-release video also had a few issues such has her mantra caused her armor&#x27;s color texture to switch back to the default texture while still having the armor shape and a few bugs that cause her Q to be invisible when you R+Q til it hits something, and there was this other bug on her Warden skin that I can&#x27;t seem to remember that also caused some animation issues toward monsters.\n\nIts depressing at this point considering its been 4 years of the same treatment.","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-11-30T19:53:39.444+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R22CgShfxIw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eibAHjgSK0\n######_Skip to 0:40 for the second part._\n\n>Its depressing at this point considering its been 4 years of the same treatment.\n\nAnd thus the truth was spoken.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2016-11-29T15:09:56.652+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with you.

It's a very pretty skin and I will be getting it regardless. The problem is that this skin is not worthy of a 1350 mark. It has the potential to become one if Riot decides to work on it a little more, but I feel like not much is going to be changed about it. Things I would like to see changed:\n\n1) A lighter color purple that isn't so vibrant. If Riot dilutes some of the color from the current model, I think that would help with bringing it more in line with the other ones. I mean I would love to see a white or blue color on her, but the purple is very pretty. The purple just needs to be less harsh. I did a mockup of what I am talking about below.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/qIXyt\n\n2) W and W+R is bland. Riot could have done a lot better with it and it seems a little lackluster for a 1350 RP skin. The ability itself is already bland looking . . . . this is an opportunity to make it amazing. If they add like a lot fo snowflakes around it . . . . that would be cool. Then we get to the point that . . . . . what is so special about W+R then? it looks exactly the same.\n\n3) The shield is hardly noticeable. It is bland too. Riot should make it a little brighter and maybe outline the snowflakes in white. That would make it really stand out.\n\n4) IDK why she turns this random blue color after her recall. It's kind of like . . .. . what is happening to Karma?\n\nI hope Riot does work on it a little . . . . and I don't feel like the changes are that drastic . . . . but as of right now Winter Wonder Karma doesn't fit in with the other ones, the visual effects for her abilities are very lackluster, and there are a lot of questionable design choices. There are things in this skin that need to be toned down a little bit, like the color of her jacket . . . . . Other than that this skin needs to be amped up in the graphics department abilities wise.","replies":[{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2016-11-29T12:32:51.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if they won't do anything to the particles, hopefully they'll reduce the price to 975 like they did with Bewitched Morgana. They even went back and worked on the particles for that skin a bit but it wasn't enough to justify the original cost of 1350. Still, I'm hoping a Rioter from the skin department like KateyKhaos can discuss it with their team to see what more they can do to make it worth 1350.","replies":[{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2016-11-29T15:02:36.418+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think they will get a lot of flack if they do that. Karma mains are already VERY upset with them in regards to how they treated Karma and her rework. The rework was during a time when Riot couldn't do a lot with her, but that still doesn't make it right. Especially since Riot has 3 years to work on the problems with Karma and they really aren't. Karma really only suffers from a rushed visual update that is bland. This is Riot's opportunity to give Karma a skin that has completed visuals, personality, and more. A lot Karma mains have been bombarding the boards for the past couple years . . . . for a good quality Karma skin that is 1350. Riot will have to deal with a lot of drama if they decide to leave the skin the way it is and lower the price. It will be a slap in the face and proof that Riot really doesn't like to work on anything involving Karma. Karma mains are already angry at them for taking away her fans, dress, shield bomb, making her a bland champion with no personality, a rushed visual update, no proper running animations, and etc. If Riot is going to do anything on Karma at this point, they need to go all out because they haven't been the past 3 years with her. Players are getting frustrated and losing faith in Riot.

I just don't think they can make it into a 1350. Even if they clean up the recall and brighten up some of the effects, I don't think that will ever bring it to 1350 status. Riot would merely be polishing it up to be on par with her Order of the Lotus (which I adore and use frequently). It has a lot to do with picking an icy theme to run on her, and Karma doesn't have a whole lot of extra things to justify a 1350 tag. This isn't a Lulu with a Pix or an Orianna with her Ball. It's just Karma. It would be like trying to say Snowstorm Sivir should be a 1350 skin. I don't think this theme could ever warrant a 1350 on Karma.\n\nWell... short of giving her a new dance emote.

This is Karma's first 1350 RP skin and the community was expecting great things. We have been asking for months and a few years for you to give us a good quality skin for Karma, since no department at Riot can be bothered to work on anything involving Karma. With all the things that happened with Karma since her rework and Riot completely ignoring all of her problems, this is yet another example of Riot not hitting the mark with Karma. We did our job and provided you with enough feedback and now we are left with another half worked on thing on Karma. At this point, the Karma community should expect every department in Riot games to give us half worked on content that involves Karma. It happened when Riot reworked Karma almost 4 years ago, when Riot continued ignoring Karma after the failed rework and refused to communicate, ignoring Karma mains when we got all excited for a 1350 RP skin and getting the short end of the stick again.\n\nThis is just another tally to add to what is not going to be worked on Karma.\n\nTally 1: Fixing the identity and problems Riot created with Karma's rework.\nTally 2: Riot continuing to ignore Karma's problems for almost 4 years, not communicating with Karma mains, and refusing to accept elements of rework Karma are terrible.\nTally 3: A 1350 RP skin priced at this mark, that doesn't meet the standards of other 1350 RP skins. I mean Riot can do it with Ekko and Jinx, but when it comes to Karma . . . . it will never happen.\n\nI will say, I don't think Riot did this on purpose. I do not think Riot did this maliciously. This is a habit Riot is giving to Karma players now. Riot works on something for Karma and we get excited, the content is bland in comparison to other things Riot has created and we give our feedback, and Riot ignores the problems and then sweeps all of Karma's problems under an invisible VGU rug that will never happen. This is just definitive proof that Riot doesn't care about Karma. I can hope for the best and be optimistic that Riot will do something more to her kit, identity problems, and now a promised 1350 RP skin, but I am not going to hold my breath. No department at Riot games cares about Karma. Riot cares about Ekko, Jinx, and Ryze apparently. Riot has no problem going all out on content that involves any of them. No one can say the same thing about Karma.\n\n/disappointed Karma main.\n\nHave a happy holiday though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-12-01T15:51:48.545+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's too late to put the work in to improve the skin besides bug fixes, you guys should just drop the price to 975.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2016-12-01T13:12:15.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"After responding to another poster, I was wondering if you can answer this question.

Make a Riot employee in charge of a champion rework that knows nothing about Karma. Have this employee remove her fans, theme, lore, dress, shield bomb, kit, and other things . . . . . and give us a champion with a rushed and incomplete visual update, bland personality, a kit that makes no sense, a champion with no direction, a kit that is probably overpowered for the sake of Riot saying they worked on her, and much more. To top it all off Riot has almost four years now to rectify their mistakes, but the only thing they can do is overbuff the damage on her abilities.\n\nYes. Karma mains are whiney. Riot has an excuse for every single reason they refuse to fix her art and kit problems. Karma suffers more from an art problem than kit in my opinion. If you look at how many times Ekko, Zed, Soraka, Ryze and other champions have been worked on . . . . and then you look at Karma . . . there is no comparison. She doesn't need a full VGU. Karma doesn't need her entire kit reworked. Karma doesn't necessarily need  a completely new model . . . . she just needs some character to go with it and her abilities amped up. Because Riot only does 3 to 4 VGU a year and they have this idea that all champions need to be classified as a VGU, Karma will be waiting another 4 to 5 years. Riot thinks she is in a fantastic place because they buffed her numbers and Karma is being played competitively. The problem is if you really look at the champion and kit, you will see a champion that is bland, has no direction, her lore is bad, an incomplete visual update and animations, and a kit that really isn't that healthy. Is Karma a tank that can heal herself? Is Karma a shield bot where the player is only pressing one button to be useful in a teamfight? Is Karma this weird champion that is an enchanter, battlemage or tank? What is Karma exactly?\n\nKarma is a champion that had every single character element removed. Karma is a champion with no direction and is, quite frankly, bottlenecked as a support . . . . .  when that really wasn't her intended role. To justify their rework on her, Riot overbuffed her numbers and turned her into this champion that can be practically played anywhere . . . . which is a good and bad thing.\n\nLike Shen, Azir, Kalista, and Morde mains, we are waiting for a bunch of Developers to get through the large number of VGU they need to get through, while only doing 3 to 4 a year . . . . to get to champions that they are ignoring. During this time Ekko, Zed, Soraka and Ryze 7 times will be worked on. I mean they updated the visual effects for other champions a few patches ago. Until Riot stops ignoring her problems and the problems of all the other champions that are waiting on minor work that probably shouldn't be classified as a full VGU, Karma will go largely ignored the next 4 plus years.\n\nUnlike Riot, we like to communicate about Karma and not sweep her under the VGU rug. If Riot is not going to communicate and work on Karma, the whiny Karma mains will have to do their job for them. If Ekko can be worked on in a class update and receive more updates than Karma and Morde, over the span of his release . . . when Karma and Morde have been sitting on problems longer than him . . . . . there is a problem. If Ryze is being worked on 7 times and failed reworked 6 times, over champions like Morde and Karma that probably have it worse than him if you really think about it, there is a problem. If work on champions like Vel and Brand are being prioritized over champions like Morde and Karma, when that work really didn't accomplish anything . . . . . there is a problem.\n\nThis probably is not the place say this, but I did it anyways. I mean we are whiny Karma mains after all. It's totally not justified. :D","replies":[]}]}]}
