Usually her arms just stayed still by her legs all the way to the ground but from what I saw, it&#039;s like she&#039;s trying to stop the fall with her arm but looked awkward doing it.\r\n\r\nIs it a new animation or is it a weird animation bug?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-01T16:10:17.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Forbidden Siren - \n\nThanks for the report!
