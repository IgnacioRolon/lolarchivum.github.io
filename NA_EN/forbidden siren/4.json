Which is expected and regardless, it&#039;s still a great skin.\n\nIn a last effort to point out something that I noticed about the skin, the coloring of her helmet is a bit off. Most people would agree her head &quot;looks&quot; a bit big but I think it&#039;s due to the perspective of the coloring on top of the helmet, which is grey, almost exact same color as her hair. Therefore, It&#039;s blending into the hair, which lead to her looking like she have a big head/hair. \n\nSo the main question for KateyKhaos: Is there a way you can discuss with the skin team to add some color in that particular spot? I think it might help, even though it&#039;s minor, it could go a long way for perfection. \n\nMock:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZFEkNuw.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Karbuncle","date":"2015-10-04T12:12:49.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't care since Karma doesn't make them a lot of money,but who knows maybe they'll change it after 4 months like when they added in fans to Karmas Order of the Lotus skin(why not add fans to her base and warden as well?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-29T22:44:41.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Forbidden Siren,\n\nSorry for the delayed response. I was on vacation last week, and wasn't checking the boards. \n\nWhen comparing colors, it's best to use an in-game model, as compared to the model viewer. The model viewer color is off, as compared to in-game lighting. [This is what Warden Karma looks like in game](http://imgur.com/HU0Ya24), as compared to the model viewer. \n\nUsing the splash as reference, the lines you're seeing are drawn in to give depth to the helmet itself - a bit of shadowing. This is something that's [much less obvious](http://imgur.com/vPN9QLI) in the in-game model. We can do a lot more in terms of details when it comes to the splash, as compared to the in-game model. \n\nI noticed in the edit, you added a bit more golden metal to her head piece. We kept that piece a bit thinner due to the view from in-game height. While zoomed in, it looks awesome, but things begin to look a bit muddy with all of the gold pieces - between the gold shoulder plates, and the gold headpiece, shapes begin to get lost when zoomed all the way out. \n\nThis is the tricky part of the design process. While a concept may work really well in concept, it may need to be altered once in game to ensure that we're looking as solid blocks of color v. colors blending from game height. \n\nFor comparison, take a look at Arclight Varus v. Arclight Vayne. Varus was done before we began working more with clean lines and blocks of color, and Vayne was done after. \n\nHope this explains the decisions a bit more!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2015-09-28T20:38:15.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp.

They obviously forgot to edit that part, as the silver is so close to the white/ grey hair that it breaks with Riot's focus on clarity that has been very apparent after the update of Summoner's Rift. I will be blunt and call them out for being lazy. Come on Riot, you can do better! The gem is almost invisible too. It could become bigger and include the current gold area, then the silver are could be made into gold like suggested.\n\nIt disappoints me as much as the leather glove of Project Lucian that has armour on the splash art, but is so plain that is almost looks like his skin in-game. If Riot continues this trend, they are going away from the focus on the clarity and quality I have come to expect. I was more pleased when they had good communication with the community about tweaking the colours of Blood Moon Elise.","replies":[{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2015-09-24T13:52:25.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, hopefully KateyKhaos (though it seems like she's been on hiatus lately) or someone from the skin team sees this and potentially give Karma a minor color tweaking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-09-24T06:47:34.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the gem could be bigger too.","replies":[]}]}
