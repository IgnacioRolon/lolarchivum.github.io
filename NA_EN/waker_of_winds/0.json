First off, I don't believe a lot of the players in LoL are toxic. BUT, I've come to realize the people of lower ranks (Bronze, Silver normally) are the ones that have a tad too much sodium in their meals. I played a ranked game, although, normally I don't due to the stress from a feeding team, or the stress from complete bm from my team or the enemy's. But I'm in my promos for Silver so I want to get that rank up. Yeah, I know I'm terribad but I swear I get ranked with higher people in normals I promise. I first pick {{champion:268}}  and nobody says anything. No communication from the team until I finally ask our jungler, who picks {{champion:254}} , why she's going ghost &amp; smite. \r\n\"Are you Danny Phantom? Because you're going ghost B(\". She then proceeds to tell me how much better ghost is than everything else, which I don't really care, but I feel Vi with flash tends to be smarter than ghost, just because it's a free/quick engage/disengage.\r\n\r\n{{champion:39}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:412}}  VERSUS {{champion:86}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:267}} \r\n\r\nFast forward to in game. I'm feeling pretty good, so I give the team and enemy team a \"glhf\" (someone's gotta do it, right?).\r\nLaning phase: All the lanes tend to be doing well. I get matched against a {{champion:126}} mid, which is pretty annoying, but oh well. Bot lane proceeds to get fed with our Graves getting kill after kill. I end up losing my tower because Jayce's pushing potential is ridiculous without anyone covering my lane. Vi ganks and gets the kill, I get an assist, etc. Nbd.\r\n\r\nAround 20ish minutes in, bot lane makes a mistake (the Thresh says lag, Graves didn't, idk) but they give the enemy {{champion:119}}  a double kill. Graves proceeds to flame the Thresh about how bad of a play that was and how stupid he is. I'll come back to this.\r\n\r\nAround the same time, Vi also ganks my lane and gets counter-ganked by their top laner, the infamous {{champion:86}}. She leaves the Jayce nearly dead before Garen jumps on her. I try to help but all my abilities are on CD aside from my ult for trying to kill the Jayce. I don't want to use my ult because there was a high chance I was gonna miss unless I flashed to save her, which I didn't feel would be worth the trade. She dies to the Garen (if she had flash she could've easily lived), so I let my soldiers that are up eat away at the Garen until he starts widdling down my health. I pop my ult throwing him back, and as I do, our Irelia comes and kills him. The Jayce was also watching the fight at around 20% hp, which the Irelia just q's to him and she gets a double.\r\n\r\nMid Game: The team starts to group and the Graves begins to flame me for building Azir wrong. \"/all This garbage Azir doesn't know how to build\" {{item:3165}}  > {{item:3158}}  > {{item:3285}} typical cd/mana/dmg Azir stuff. We lose Graves who gets caught out, big surprise.  I go behind their team while their under our tower and e+q+ult them towards it. It was enough damage to kill their Nami, and burn a couple flashes in the process. Their team tries to chase but I walk back to base through the sidegate..thing. Graves and Vi begin to flame me saying I only use my ult for kills and I'm trash tier, etc. My only response is \"Flash is better\". I set up a teamfight in the bot lane pushing all their carries into our team and getting my team to kill them. Of course we still lose 1 or 2 people, due to the fact that they still had a lot of damage on us. \r\n\r\nDefending goes on, we lose 2nd mid tower, etc. Drag pops, and Vi decides after a fight that only me and her survive, she wants to go do it. She runs towards the drag, and before doing anything about the Nami practically taunting behind her, she start it. G. G. The Vi doesn't get maybe 5 autos off on the drag before their entire team runs towards her and kills her. \"Where the fuck is the team?\"\r\n\r\nGraves and Vi flame me some more, we lose towers, inhib, etc, we lose.\r\nResults screen: \"This Azir was so trash\"\r\n\"Only ulted for himself\"\r\n\"Knew he was shit from the moment he locked Azir\"\r\nEtc etc etc. I don't think our team did terrible. I think the worst part of that game was the amount of salt and toxicity that filled the air. From 2 people. Our Irelia was fine, our Thresh was fine. But my god, I feel like most Graves players think they're the shit because they can win lane. And that Vi.....oh god.\r\n{{summoner:6}} {{summoner:11}}      {{item:3717}} >{{item:3153}} >{{item:3035}} \r\n\r\n\"Flash is better\"....on Vi anyway. \r\n\r\nI don't know what makes people so pissy and dickish in this game, but this is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong Rito, it's not your fault that your fanbase is literally 12-22 yr old assholes 10% of the time, but I feel like it's ruining this game for me. I promise I don't normally complain about this, but I felt like this was a special occasion. I've never dealt with such terrible people in this game before (I've been playing since November of 2013). All and all, this was just me ranting. Maybe someone will see this and understand my pain. Anyway, gg I guess. System of a Down - Toxicity op. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd hate for this hard work to get lost in the other posts, but oh well. RIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n(btw if you could review that game and get these people off your servers that would be great lel)\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-27T11:42:19.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could always just quit playing along with me?

Shame about the subscription model though.\n\nYeah true the subscription can be a bummer though. But the *echo tone* AMOUNT OF CONTENT! and it being around 600 hours long kinda makes up for it. I think of it like a tip jar. Kinda like how I throw Riot...Or well used to throw riot $15 here and there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
