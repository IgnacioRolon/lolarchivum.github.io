Preventing a remake. Why is it that First Blood stops remakes? It is super easy to prevent them and it is a vote anyway so there isn&#039;t much to complain about if you vote to remake even though a lane got an early lead. By walking under tower, a player can turn a possible /remake tie into an almost guaranteed win and therefore make an already annoying situation flat-out grim.\r\n\r\n\r\n(In the poll I voted yes to see results)","replies":[{"poster":"JunkÎ¿","date":"2016-08-01T18:06:27.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First blood scored by the remaking team doesn't stop them from remaking.

It's only usable if a member has never ever connected even once, by the 3 minute mark.\n\n\nThe first blood part I'm unsure on, but the above is probably why they can't remake.","replies":[{"poster":"Malignant Vemira","date":"2016-08-01T20:49:56.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not true, if you sit at base and don't move, you can type, you just cant shop or move, it'll prompt.","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2016-08-01T20:51:09.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Malignant Vemira,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qxpPYvvA,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2016-08-01T20:49:56.421+0000)\n>\n> Not true, if you sit at base and don&#x27;t move, you can type, you just cant shop or move, it&#x27;ll prompt.\n\nI've had AT LEAST 5 games in the last week that we couldn't /remake because the DC'd teammate had connected for 10 seconds or less right as the match started.
