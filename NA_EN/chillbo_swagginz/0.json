Whats worse, the moves range is crippled in those areas to like 2 or 3 percent, effectively making him unplayable in many situations with locked camera.   This made me so mad I quit for a while, a few months as fizz is the champion I want to play the most.  Am I missing some thing here?  Is there a way to extend the camera out more that I am not realizing?  I really hate playing with unlocked camera...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T02:19:52.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never heard of this before. Are you using a specific mouse/mouse software when this happens? Can you grab an in-game screenshot with the F12 key and grab it from the screenshot folder **(c:\\riot games\\League Of Legends\\screenshots)** and upload it to [**Imgur**](https://imgur.com/) before linking me? I'd like to see this happening so I can figure out what's going on. I'd recommend a custom match in ARAM to get a screenshot fairly quickly without having to play a full game. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Chillbo Swagginz","date":"2017-01-03T14:13:00.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may have exaggerated a bit but i was a lil salty heh but check it out and thanks http://imgur.com/gallery/RPfsH","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T22:51:52.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to confirm this isn't caused by any program running in the background, I'd like you to [**perform a clean boot of windows**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) before testing this out again in a custom match.\n\nFingers crossed that this was the trick!","replies":[{"poster":"Chillbo Swagginz","date":"2017-01-04T02:49:36.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so your saying that the camera should be able to zoom out further or the range should be smaller ?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-04T21:41:55.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The camera zoom from the screenshot is normal based on what I've seen on other PCs zoomed all the way out.

I spoke with some of our game specialists and it seems that you may want to try *Quick Cast* (In Hotkey Settings) while using a locked-camera, otherwise you may have to play without a locked camera in order to make full use of Fizz's ult.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Chillbo Swagginz","date":"2017-01-06T04:19:23.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its fine thanks for the help","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chillbo Swagginz","date":"2017-01-03T13:46:39.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay I will do that asap","replies":[]}]}]}
