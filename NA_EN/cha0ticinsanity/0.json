I  purchased two RP cards today and when trying to put one in, I mesed up a few digits when I hit enter, so I tried again, screwed up and then the third time I put it in everything right and was hit with this message.. I didn't get a chance to actually REDEEM anything so now I'm at all loss..  I screwed up and now I am forced to wait.. Well this sucks..","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-15T16:34:44.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw, sorry about that!  You may need to wait up to 24 hours to submit another code.  You can hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as well to see if our billing team can help.  I can't make any guarantees, though, as the attempt is mostly implemented for security measures.  Still, we'll take a look and help directly!","replies":[]}]}
