I was pretty rude to our support for trolling and taking our adc's role after he (our adc) made it clear he didn't want to support. My team even agreed that he was being pretty rude about it, but I definitely took it a little too far early on in the game and I said some things I didn't mean, especially towards our mid laner who started to take jabs at me. I'm not gonna try and use it as an excuse but I definitely get heated, as I have anger issues I'm trying to fix. League definitely doesn't help with it, but it's one of the only games I've been able to play and focus on, and one of the only things that's kept me motivated the last little while. \n\nLike I said, I've made some bad, bad choices the last few months on things I've said and done in chat that I'm sure have sent me to this point, but it seems weird that I'd get a suspension and not get a notice for it. Just a \"You have been suspended\" and then logged out, especially for a game that I was a large reason for winning. (My team had gotten behind and I happened to get incredibly fed on Darius and made some good plays that brought us back from a for sure loss.)\n\nI'm sure I won't, and I'll have to play out my suspension patiently and wait to hopefully get my account back after it's done, whenever it is, but I would like to earn my account back. I know what I've done wrong, and I am actively trying to fix my personal issues that led to me saying what I said, and I think I've found my own way of keeping myself from this happening in the future. If there is any way I could get my account back, I will. Even if it means being permanently chat restricted, I'll work with it and hopefully someday earn full access back. \n\nIf I could even talk to a Rioter about this, not even to get my account back but even just to talk it over and come to an understanding, that would be amazing. Thank you for reading this and hopefully, someone will get back to me.\n\n{{sticker:darius-angry}}  \"We fight for Noxus.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-29T00:14:47.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate you stepping forward and admitting the things you said in that match were pretty overboard.
