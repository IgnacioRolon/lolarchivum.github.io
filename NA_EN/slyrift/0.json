I just wanted to say I really like the new honor system in League of Legends the only thing I want to have is.. To be able to honor the opponents like we used to. Instead of having like; GG, Team Friendly or Tilt-proof. For the enemy or opponent we could have Best Opponent, Great Skills, Team-sport. Just something along those lines. Because sometimes when people finish a game and you lose sometimes people don't honor their team just because of their defeat, which I believe is a negative attitude to have. But on the other team the enemy will notice who is doing good or great on the opponent side because they are outside of the box. And I enjoy fighting other players to each other's skills and I personally want to honor them for that, the team shouldn't just appreciate it, the opposing team should appreciate it too but not in the same way of course just their skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-30T03:00:47.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooooo that'd be fun to be able to spread the honor to your opponents as well as your teammates. I can't say for sure if this will ever be added into the game, but you should hit up the [**client discussion**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) board to see how other players feel about this idea as well!","replies":[]}]}
