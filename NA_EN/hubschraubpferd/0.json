I freeze in-game and even when watching replays.\r\n\r\nIf a rioter sees this, I beg you PLEASE FIX THIS.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot &amp; much love to you.","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2018-02-15T21:40:01.811+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ZWISSNES. I tested this out a little bit on my machine, and it's definitely not a resurfacing of the old Jayce FPS drop that I fixed a year or two ago. Are you running on a Mac perchance? Does it only happen with specific skins, or is it all Jayce skins? Do you have some before/after FPS numbers? Example: \"It's running at 120 FPS, then when he transforms, I see 10 FPS\" or something like that. I think Ctrl-F is the default keybinding to show FPS if they aren't already showing.\n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Happy Æ’eet","date":"2018-05-20T03:33:24.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had a game with Full Metal Jayce on my team. Can confirm whenever he changes to hammer form there's a fps drop for a split second and it's annoying af. This was fixed a while back but it has resurfaced again it seems.","replies":[]}]}
