They are things that people say to inflict emotional harm on others.\n\nI agree that it isn't okay. I agree that it's a pretty dark thing to say, and I don't think most people that throw it about don't appreciate how dark it actually is.  I just don't think there's anything someone could say that  should get someone an instant ban. That's why we have the escalating punishments. Give them a chat restriction to let them know it's not okay (because for some reason there are actually people out there that don't know it's not), and if they continue after that, then the punishment gets worse. \n\nLet me ask you this: Is telling someone \"KYS\" worse than wishing cancer on someone (or whatever other horrible thing someone can come up with)? What objectively makes one worse than the other?\n\nAnd if you're going to start handing out permanent bans for telling someone to kill themselves, what about just telling someone that you hope they die? Is that worth an instant permaban? What if you just tell someone to do something terrible to themselves that doesn't result in death? If I told you to go stick your hand in a garbage disposal, is that worth an instant ban? Where is the line between instant permaban and a chat restriction, and how do you objectively decide where it lies?","replies":[{"poster":"Youngblood92","date":"2016-09-14T14:20:20.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a good point, and I see now why we have escalating bans. Still, I see a lot of contempt from players regarding just that- people think that they will never get banned or punished, and I have no way of knowing if they were.  So it leaves a bad taste in my mouth after finishing a game with someone outrageously toxic, because for all I know they are just moving on to the next game, ruining the experience for more people (I know, I know, just mute them.  But then I'm awful confused because it seems like players are then just talking to themselves lol =P).\nIt's true though, when you wish self harm on another person it is a grey area, because there are many levels of severity (like your garbage disposal example). I guess deciding the objectivity is a topic of debate for the people making the rules.  So, my original objection boils down to the fact that the report and punishment system is ineffective; racism, flaming, and general toxicity are just too prevalent in League.  My seeing \"go KYS\" everywhere was just the catalyst that finally made me make this post.  I'll think on it, and get back to you. Appreciate the discussion.\n\n-Dan","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xXMrPeanutXx","date":"2016-09-14T02:20:34.516+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I encounter more and more frequently players who whimsically use this term.

However your** hypocrisy** kind of pushes MY buttons. I find it oddly amusing that you find other things that don't exactly relate to you personally offensive and you have no worries with those things, but as soon as it offends you. \"Oh no that shouldn't be allowed to be said\"\n\n\nWhat really you should be advocating for is ANY form of harmful words whether that be Racism or Belittling or Suicide jokes or Bomb jokes.

Muting and reporting them is definitely the best method. It's your level of critical thinking that really shows that you're an intelligent human being and will make you continue to grow.\n\nThat being said, you're right that these level and the highest levels of toxicity need to be changed in League. It's been the cost of many people quitting and leaving the game. I can only hope that the behavior continues to be punished with increasing severity a long with people who intentionally ruin other's peoples game.\n\nGood on ya","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xXI3ADI3OYXx","date":"2016-09-15T20:00:38.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"to everyone who thinks someone saying KYS is not a form of toxicity is really missing their heads, or its not screwed in right.
