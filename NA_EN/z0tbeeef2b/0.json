I'm wired in  directly to the modem with a good cat 4 cable. \r\nHowever, every night around 8 pm till 1 am, I have UNBEARABLE ping. I mean like 200-300 ms. It fluctuates constantly and never stabilizes anywhere. It's absolutely unplayable. I've tried making my ip static, flushing dns, renewing my ip, restarting the router a million times, forwarding the ports, etc etc. I am the only one connected to the internet, and if I'm not its only ever my girlfriend who streams tv shows. I still feel like 200 mbps is more than enough to provide for LoL and 1 netflix streaming. I put a link of my net analyzer on this post. \r\n\r\nIf anyone can help me!! I'd love you long time.","replies":[{"poster":"Team Cat","date":"2016-05-27T00:03:37.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the exact same situation. I live in NYC with the same exact 200Mb/s speed package from TWC, and from 5PM to midnight or 1AM my connection is awful. \n\nIt makes absolutely no sense that I can be watching say, a Twitch stream or Youtube video in 1080p, but my ping to League is 300ms.\n\n I took my issue to support and they claimed that the issue is on TWC's end, so I called TWC and they sent a technician out and I was told all my equipment was fine. I pressed them further and there are even recent posts on the TWC forums about issues like this, and TWC employees believe the issue is on Riot's end. \n\nI've had these issues for a month, and I don't even know who to contact anymore. I can't enjoy the game at all considering my schedule does not match up to when my ping is actually good. There have been several maintenances on the part of Riot and TWC in the past month as far as I can tell, and nothing has helped my situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dillon the Lion","date":"2016-05-26T02:02:24.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get in line, pal. I've been on these forums for 3 weeks trying to get help (no dice) and have had an open ticket doing nothing but gathering dust. \n\nThe best you can hope for is for some Red to come down from way on high and copy pasta the link to the network troubleshooting guide. \n\nBut. In case of a Christmas miracle. Here is mine.\n[SNIP]\n\nMy ping behaves differently from yours, though. I don't have consistent lag at any time of the day. I have perpetual, chronic, crippling ping spikes every few minutes, always. Started experiencing this issue about 2 months ago, maybe less. Feels like eternity. Can't enjoy the game at all, anymore. I've played League of Legends for many, many years. I have always had a stable ping of 70-80 ms. My base ping is now up to 100 instead of 70, which is inconvenient but still playable. The real problem is that I *FREQUENTLY* experience ping spikes every 3-4 minutes up to 800-2,000 ms. I have the best router available to me and my connection is 100% stable. No other games or internet services are affected by these ping spikes so I think they must have to do with my connection to the Riot server. I have tested this with streaming, and other games such as dota 2, magic online, and overwatch. The hextech repair tool detected no problems with my client. I'm continuing to have these crippling ping spikes though every few minutes. If this problem persists I won't be able to continue playing my favorite game :(","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T20:58:35.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the sounds of it given your description, there may be a specific issue connecting directly to our individual game servers, causing the spikes in lag.  This would explain why you can connect to other games and to the internet perfectly fine, but experience problems in League.  Additionally, since no one else in the game appears to have the same issue as you, the problem does not appear to lie on the individual game servers end.  What we will need to do is take a deep dive into your connection  configuration to figure out where the problem is.\n\nThe best step you can take is to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so one of our Tech Specialists can investigate further and work with you one-on-one.

If this is a result of your ISP throttling your connection due to peak traffic, there is unfortunately very little we can do.  I would recommend contacting your ISP directly about your issue to see if you can get any further information about it.\n\nI hope this helps!

Open up _Device Manager_ by pressing the Windows key + R then typing \"mmc devmgmt.msc\".\n\n2. In _Device Manager_ you should see an item called _Network Adapters_ use the drop down menu located to the right of it to display all network adapters. \n\n3. You're using an ethernet cable to connect to the internet, so you'll need to find the network adapter that specifically implies ethernet. For example, I'm using an _Intel Ethernet Connection (2) I218-V_ \n\n4. Right click the network adapter and choose _\"Update Driver Software...\"_\n\n5. Now press the button _\"Browse my computer for driver software\"_.\n\n6. Choose _\"Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer\"_\n\n7. You want to choose the latest one, which each update **should** (But doesn't always) have a time stamp. If it doesn't have a time stamp, just choose the one at the top. \n\n8. Click next and watch your Network Card reset. \n\n**Shut down any alternative internet connections**\n\nWhile still in your Device manager, you should shut down any and all alternative connections. These might interfere with your ability to connect, and for some reason, your computer might be making revert it to certain configs when changing things how your internet works. \n\n**Ping Google**\n\nTo find out if this is an internal problem or a software problem we need to be able to ping an outside source. During the time period that your network is lagging, you should try to ping www.google.com by navigating to Command Prompt, and type ping www.google.com.\n\n**Traceroute Google**\n\nDuring the time that you're experiencing lagginess, you should traceroute both your IPv4 and IPv6 to google.\n\nYou can do that by typing:\n\n**IPv4**: _tracert www.google.com_\n**IPv6**: _tracert -6 www.google.com_\n\nOnce you've done this, report back with the details. \n\n**Record any and all actions that lead to the ping**\nFor example, answer the following questions:\n\n- Does it only do it in a league game?\n- Does it start only when you start to go into a game?\n- Does it affect the ability to stream video?\n- Is it spotty, like is it a constant ping, or does it jump randomly?\n\n**Net View & Beyond!**\n\nSometimes, draggy internet can be the result of someone either maliciously or unintentionally taking up all of your bandwidth. Something to take into consideration is network sniffers. This will tell you who is connected to your network.\n\nIf you're using WiFi (for anything), you should take a look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JVxyoBy5vs\n\nYou can also alternatively use net view to view the computers currently connected to your network by typing \"net view\" in cmd. \n\nKind regards,\nJungleRammusOnly","replies":[]}]}
