(at least i think so) So me and my friend were playing league per usually, we had this one game where i wasn&#039;t doing as good as i would have like.  Towards the mid to end of the game Ezrael and blitz started flaming me and the jungle player to put it simply. Ez tried to surrender 3 times and all 4 of us refused, she he decided he was just gonna troll for the last 10 mins of the game. In which he sat at the fountain and used his true shot barrage to take away cs from us who were still trying to claw back in the game. And once the enemy got to the nexus turrets, he would come out to ks the team and run back to fountain, and continued to flame us until we eventually lost. And they chose to ban me for this:\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nroachblunt: idiot                       (I called him an idiot because he was gonna mute jungle and not talk with the team)\r\nroachblunt: now he cant ommunicate withnus\r\nroachblunt: zeds not op in the slightest\r\nroachblunt: by whom?\r\nroachblunt: true i was picking against annie\r\nroachblunt: or i thought\\\r\nroachblunt: i&#039;m already feeding so i beat you to it\r\nroachblunt: lol\r\nroachblunt: i am 1/3 zed got his kills elsewhere\r\nroachblunt: lol\r\nroachblunt: nope\r\nroachblunt: lol\r\nroachblunt: and you take away cs\r\nroachblunt: yeah you suck ez\r\nroachblunt: blitz carried you\r\nroachblunt: LOL\r\nroachblunt: tthen you died to him more than i\r\nroachblunt: moron\r\nroachblunt: yeah 1 to zed, 2 to camille rretard\r\nroachblunt: ez toxic, because he fed zed\r\nroachblunt: maybe if you didn;t want to die to zed, learn to play the game and WARD\r\nroachblunt: retard\r\nroachblunt: lol\r\nroachblunt: why didn&#039;t you just hit the tower once?\r\nroachblunt: blitz\r\nroachblunt: had all day\r\nroachblunt: true\r\nroachblunt: yeah thats what happens when they get out of range\r\nroachblunt: and listen to you, jusmping in on a 3v2\r\nroachblunt: retard\r\nroachblunt: good job blitz\r\nroachblunt: learn to stop dying and feeding zed blitz\r\nroachblunt: you fairy %%%got\r\nroachblunt: and ez\r\nroachblunt: lol\r\nroachblunt: ahahaha\r\nroachblunt: report ez for trollinf\r\nroachblunt: i like playing\r\nroachblunt: i&#039;m having fun\r\nroachblunt: we got dis\r\nroachblunt: now that ez stopped his bitching\r\nroachblunt: report ez please\r\nroachblunt: he ragequit\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean really?

Riot's got a no tolerance policy for that kind of stuff.\n\nI'm the future, just mute the kid and play on. It's a lot more relaxing than you'd think.","replies":[{"poster":"roachblunt","date":"2017-03-20T05:44:23.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah you prolly might be right there. but we were still in the game even when he ran to the fountain to give up, untill he decided to take my cs and top lane's cs to further our gold deficit because he refused to fight on and was mad we wouldn't surrender. (and of course ksed to).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-16T05:33:12.814+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't make a troll stop by flaming them, you should just mute and continue playing as best you can, and report them when it's over. Using homophobic slurs is a huge no-no and not tolerated, and you can be escalated to an account ban very quickly for it so I'd say you got off easy. Even if you are directing that kind of language at a legitimate bot, other players that have to listen to it generally aren't ok with it anyway.\n\nWhile the slur is a major factor in the punishment, lobbying to report a player and insulting or harassing them isn't cool either. Mute them and just try to enjoy what's left of the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-03-16T08:03:29.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, it looks like you were taking jabs at Ezreal the entire time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-16T08:23:10.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">roachblunt: idiot\nroachblunt: moron\nroachblunt: yeah 1 to zed, 2 to camille rretard\nroachblunt: report ez for trollinf\nroachblunt: report ez please\n\nAny one of those things would be enough to get you into trouble.","replies":[]},{"poster":"roachblunt","date":"2017-03-20T05:39:41.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well unfortunately you guys only can read my side of the chat log. you should read ezrael's he started the flame war, i was defending myself against a troll that began raging 10 minutes in the game as soon as the zed wandered down and ganked him. and decided to mute the jungle because he pinged ez to stop the leash. So as far as i'm concerned you people are just jumping to some silly conclusion.","replies":[{"poster":"roachblunt","date":"2017-03-20T05:42:12.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and like I said before he began trolling when he lossed his lane, by taking cs while he sat in the fountain, and ksed. So yeah, I'm gonna be a bit pissed at him when the rest of us 4 are trying to win the game. This is the first ban i had sense i started this acct 3 years ago, so you people are gonna have to do a bit more to convince me this was a just ban.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-03-16T21:05:36.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really.
