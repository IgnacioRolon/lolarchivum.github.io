Also, he is auto-attack reliant; his W has a long cooldown anyway, and his ult already has a very small cooldown (when compared to other ultimates)\n\nI am just saying that Yasuo in fact benefits from CDR. Not that this benefit is relevant enough for him to make investing in CDR worth. Just like Kha'Zix benefits from building AP due to its passive and the healing on his W. But it is such a small benefit, and he benefits much more from AD due to his other abilities, so it is not worth to build AP on Kha'Zix.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LVL 5 PORO","date":"2015-10-30T21:54:02.456+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":10,"body":"Riot isnt going to nerf Yasuo, their balance team is completely inept.
