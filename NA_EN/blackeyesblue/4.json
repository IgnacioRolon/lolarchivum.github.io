This happens EVERY TIME a new champ is released, but I have NEVER seen it this bad! not even with EKKO! I&#039;ve dodged 3 games today to avoid troll comps and the 4 I have played have all had a this happen! Then they get offended and play the victim in all chat! \r\n\r\nCase and point? You want to paly the new champ SOOOOOOOO badly that you&#039;re willing to sabotage a game before it starts?

If you can't get through a normal game without raging at your team, then please never play ranked.  Better yet, please don't play this game at all.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackEyesBlue","date":"2017-01-27T02:03:39.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Again, bad players are bad. So what?
