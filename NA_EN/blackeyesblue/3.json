Including such words as \"Diversity director\" \"Meritocracy\" and \"anti-bias training\".\n\nRiot I BEG YOU!!!!\n\nDO NOT change any of the inner working of your company to cater to SJW's, Neo Liberals, or Feminazis!\n\nLiterally every company whos business is based on some degree of escapism has faced financial difficulties if not RUIN for conforming to extreme PC ideology! Despite all the tweets, and E-mails, and rallies... These people don't use the services they protest!\n\nMarvel Comics has lost nearly 50% of their reader base after 18 months of SJW inspired story lines that SJW's did not buy and true comic fans were repulsed by.\n\nMagic Mirror Comics in Washington, banned a customer for life for requesting a book put out by a publisher \"They didn't approve of\" And 4 months later they are closing their doors.\n\nCrunchy Roll sunk their profits into an original product that they have been marketing 100% by talking about \"how diverse their staff is\" while Saying NOTHING about the show and they are losing subscribers by the thousands!\n\nThese people don't play League. They don't buy RP. They will have moved on to some other \"offensive\" company by the time you make these changes. And NOTHING you do will ever please them! You could take Meddler out back and shoot him and they STILL would not be satisfied!\n\nRiot PLEASE Don't forget who your clientele really are! The market doesn't lie! If you GET WOKE you go broke...\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]}
