That's one problem. When anyone new becomes oppressive in early game - such a leona awhile back this season - they get nerfed into the ground. But you get a scaling champ - such as taric - doing NEARLY as well in lane an massively outscaling, and nobody complains about that, nobody nerfs that. So after the nerf to the early game snowball champ - because they're doing their job and being a bully early and winning WHEN they play properly and their opponents don't respect it and play safe - the scaling champ ends up equal to or stronger than the early game champ in lane and... still massively outscales. That's pretty cool. \n\nTeammates can ignore 4 pings telling them not to engage a fight, die 1v1 to your laner, then call you a coward, piece of shit, loser, fucking noob. They can spend the rest of game intentionally ignoring you (either to help or to grab easy kills that you can't quite get on your own 1v2) and get teammates to all harass you. They can die diving in 1v5 or forcing 4v5 or 3v5 for no reason and you know what? It's all you're fault because you didn't tp to save them. You're a selfish trash teammate for wanting to get some side lane pressure before rotating to defend a tower. But when you group... they'll go to side lane and do exactly what they flamed you for... only they don't have tp or ult to immediately join team like you did... making it far worse for them to split. When you've asked them to stop fighting because they're 0/3/0 and can't win the 1v1 or 2v2 and they aren't getting jg help or lose despite it... you're a toxic asshole. When you ask team to ward and ping to show you've placed all your wards... you're an asshole. When you make a good shotcall and clearly explain why, they understand but respond basically with \"fuck that\" \"this isn't challenger\" (I don't have to listen to you)... while basically admitting it's the most logical and best call. Even when they're winning, they play poorly. No objective focus, no teamwork, no towers... just see hero, kill hero... whether they actually succeed or not. That of course works especially great when your bot lane is combined 0/7/0 at 8 minutes. But hey, at least your opponents do the sa.... nope. Your opponents who can't win lane play smart. They only go agro when they've got backup. They give their team a CHANCE to win the game. A chance to get your opponent back to relevance or even a lead on you. They use teamwork... and not the kind that's just 5 people blindly mobbing anything they see move and probably taking a terrible engage and dying to the same bad play for the 5th time. But no matter how many afk, how many intentional feeders, how many people flame you, how many ignore the obvious good play to repeat one they KNOW will fail from the last 8x it's failed... you can't say anything back to them. \n\nIt's like that meme with the dog in the house that's burning down and he just sits there smiling and says \"everything's fine here\". Just pretend everything's okay as you lose half the games you could easily win if teammates showed any level of coordination and mental fortitude like the other team does. Just pretend you're fine with teammates never counter-ganking for you and camping for a feeding lane and getting nothing done as your whole team slowly loses the game... falling further and further behind in every role. Just pretend it's cool when team forces a 3v5 and then goes all toxic on you for not being there when you clearly couldn't win even if it were 5v5 and they didn't give you anything to tp to to join them anyways. Just pretend it's cool when nothing is done about these intentional feeders who lack even the most basic bronze 5 level intelligence in regards to what fights to take... while you're more than a full tier above bronze 5. That it's totally cool not a single one of these toxic AND/or intentional feeding teammates gets punished (not even a warning) while you say anything back to them and you're insta-punished cuz... multiple reports, flagged word as opposed to clearly implied or bad words NOT on ifs list, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"kczingx","date":"2018-04-01T11:38:29.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you my friend are tilted above normal levels\ntruth is matchmaking needs work and you need to just play normals to have a good time and play well and solo carry bc both sides don't have coordination and just be happy with your current rank, just wait until one of your mains becomes OP and spam!","replies":[]}]}]}
