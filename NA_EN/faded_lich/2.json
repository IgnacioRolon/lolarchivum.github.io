Champ select was rather awkward after I got mid and selected/locked in Mf. Some people had less than kind words to say about and I, for but a short time tried to convince them (and to a small extent, myself) that I wasn&#039;t trolling and was indeed deadly serious. Although none of them seemed happy about it, they allowed it with the kind warning of &quot;You feed, we report.&quot; With the unwavering support of my team firmly in-place, I got my doran&#039;s ring and went mid, being completely trash tier and forgetting to get a trinket (of course.)\r\n\r\nThe resulting game was surprising..to everyone involved, even the enemy who laughed and berated my choice every chance they got. The poor soul who laned against me was Orianna, an enemy where Mf&#039;s passive was surprisingly useful against. Although she was the only person on the enemy team who seemed nice at the time, sadly she was the first one to be crying in a small corner in the enemy base. Try to harass? Made it rain. Try to last hit? Made it rain harder. Tried to help a jungle gank me? Made that shit mother fuckin rain. Before it was all said and done, although I never actually got to kill her in lane due to her playing extremely safe, it was still to the point if I walked within 550 units of her, she flashed and just went full &quot;Nope.jpg&quot; for the rest of the game. I was satisfied. \r\n\r\nThe match went on for awhile, nothing too exciting honestly. Some kills happened in other lanes, Panth jungle tried to gank me and failed and I ended up at one point walking into a 4/0 urgot bottom (not sure how that happened) and tried to 1v1 him with just a sheen and tried to help bottom with a gank. I was sad...the things that Urgot did to my dear Mf in that moment are..well..I dare not type them out here.\r\n\r\nFew minutes later however, I had my first real items just in time for the first big team fights. Lich bane, CDR boots and a Needlessly Large Rod. That is where the beginning of the end started. Malph ulted into the entire enemy team. Made that shit rain. Made it rain even harder but with bullets. By the end of that fight, our team (and most namely Mf&#039;s ) dominance was well proven.  From there it was a pretty standard catch up and stomp game in all honesty. Only thing of real note that happened from that point on, in my opinion was when panth jumped on me at one point, killed me ( i was half hp from a previous team fight) and felt the  need to type &quot;Lol nice auto&#039;s Mf scrub.&quot;\r\n\r\nTo which I so elegentally responded by respawning, finishing morellos, find him, killed him by making that shit rain and said &quot;Nice spells Panth.&quot;..Sick burn Mf...Sick burn. Moral of this story? Mage Fortune is fun..and I now know why Make it rain does not scale with AD damage..That shit is scary when it does damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTl;dr: Fun story about making shit rain. Was bored.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-09-15T17:17:57.218+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":1,"body":"If someone threatens to report you just for picking something they don't like, report them (it is considered harassment).

Thank you. I am doing that next time.\n\n\n\n\nP.S: To everyone saying it's a troll build, it only worked cause I'm 24, etc, etc, etc, etc. You're full of shit. First off, I'm not unexperienced. My first level 30 account was back in 2011, I've been playing this game a rather long time so I have experience o_o I'm not new at this nor am i trash. Secondly, you can't call it a troll build when it works, both in theory and practice. You're right in saying it isn't currently optimal but considering our team line up which was, as follows:\n\nAnnie\nMalph\nYi\nMF\nRengar\n\nit was an excellent choice for the set up. Between annie AoE stuns, Malph ult and Rengars/yi burst, The Sheer power granted by AP Mf was actually an amazing choice. Over 800 damage per Make it rain, 900 on Double ups (without killing the target) and the devistating ult, not to mention the lich bane, it worked extremely well. Also, while you're not wrong in saying it would be hard to do against more experienced players, you are wrong in saying it's impossible. While it would be countered by mobility champions, against someone like Azir or Ori for example who is much easier to move around and catch out with the E, it's actually rather devastating. While both have limited mobility in there skills, it's not enough to constantly dodge the damage of make it rain and double up to apply lich bane procs, not to mention with proper double up harass you can out range the vast majority of mid heros currently.\n\nSo while you might say it's a troll build, when you actually look at the reality of the situations, the numbers and how the kit actually works, it a lot less outlandish than you would think. Besides, the other fact you're forgetting is IT WORKED, WE WON and in the end I was a huge part of that. So, please. Stop trolling and harassing me just because I did something the LCS pros don't do. You're right, it wouldn' work in LCS, but I'm not there.\n\nThanks for the support and I am glad everyone enjoyed this story :) It's honestly doing better than I thought it would. I'm glad to see the community can, in the majority, appreciate something fun. Thank you all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-09-15T17:48:10.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are more courageous than I in champ select.

I think in general that League needs to have a lot of off-meta things like AP Miss Fortune and stop pushing all champions into either AD or AP. A lot of older champions have the options to build two different ways, and while AD Miss Fortune is better than AP Miss Fortune, AP Miss Fortune by all means is playable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"III DNA III","date":"2015-09-15T21:30:20.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One day I tried AP MF myself. She's fun as hell if you use a bunch of the AP items that also grant move speed. (item move speed stacked with her passive move speed is zoom zoom.)\n\nI used to think champs like Yasuo and Zed were OP mid lane, but stacking AP/movespeed \"makes it rain\" tears from my eyes how easy it is to kite and deny them farm. Even with Yasuo's barrier passive, Make it Rain still does a good amount of damage since Yasuo's barrier only blocks 1 tic of the aoe.\n\nAfter playing SEVERAL ap mf mid matches, most of which were against orianna/yasuo/zed, I finally realize that even THEY have a viable counter pick.
