When you try to run it again, the process is still active so it won't let you launch it again.\n\nOpen your task manager, click on processes, and end all of the League processes to make sure none of them are still running. Then right click on your LoL shortcut, click on compatibility, and at the bottom turn on run as administrator. Once you've done that, go ahead and try running LoL again and let me know how it works!","replies":[]}]}
