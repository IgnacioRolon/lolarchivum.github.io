Gp is so bad in lane that he has to take exhuast due to the fact that he can lose lane to virtually anyone, and even then people can still kill him pretty easily, while with nasus after you get your first little armor item(shroud) he can free farm all he wants because you can barely touch him and he just regens all the dmg you do to him Gp has his oranges but he still gets dumpstered by the majority of laners.","replies":[]}]}
