Even though the patcher is mainly dependent on you connecting to our Patcher Servers, it still needs to properly render and appear on your screen.  If for whatever reason the patch cannot display itself, it may give the Bug Splat Error message.\n\nBecause of this, take a moment to complete the steps in our [Bug Splat Knowledge Base Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes).  It should help resolve this error and get you patched up!\n\nIf you are still experiencing these errors regardless of the steps, make sure to reply back to me and attach a copy of your DxDiag:\n\n- Dxdiag information: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq5","replies":[{"poster":"FloweyTheFlower","date":"2015-01-16T03:00:29.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just ended up uninstalling the game and re-installing  it worked","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rax Reformed","date":"2015-01-16T00:13:11.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting the same.
