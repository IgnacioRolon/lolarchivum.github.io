This is separate to what you brought up:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Mikey6018,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yIipB2E2,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-13T17:48:57.191+0000)\n>\n> minor stat changes honestly how does that *compensate* for her invisible spears? that means nothing against those.\n\nWhich, I take to mean you think there is *meant* to be some sort of connection between her balance changes and bugs, specifically when you mention the nerfs acting as some sort of *compensation* for the bug. My point is that the two are unrelated and should be treated as such, except in very extreme cases in which the bug is so consistently replicable or gamebreaking, and even in those cases it makes more sense for the champion to be *temporarily disabled*, not *nerfed* (see the Sivir glitch that had her disabled from competitive play for a few games, or the Shen bug that had him disabled from competitive play for like a year. Note that these were both *gameplay* bugs). Yes, IIRC there has been an instance or two where a champion received minor balance changes because of a persistent *gameplay* bug, but the bug in this instance is a rare, difficult to replicate (as I recall; one user figured a way to replicate it, though as I understand, that particular exploit has been fixed by Riot), and affects more than just Nidalee (Ezreal, Corki, and Mundo are just a few of the other reported incidents). Not to mention, the fact that Riot has fixed instances of the bug, but there are still invisible skillshots in the game leads me to believe there are many different bugs but just manifests itself in the same way (ie. invisible skillshots).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-04-13T07:04:41.016+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bug with skillshots in general.
