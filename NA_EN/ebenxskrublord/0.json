And I just pressed ok on all of them cause I didn't know what happened. Then when the launcher closed and league opened everybody showed but no-one was above 0% when it started so that was confusing. Then I heard the sound of everybody spawning exc... But league didn't open. it was on my taskbar but it had no \"window\" so to speak. I tried to close it after getting frustrated and it said it loaded wrong and I can just play a new game. so then opened talk manager and the normal launcher. so then my slow ass computer took a long time to start up again... I reconnect and mid loading it says: this game has ended. Go play another game. then I pressed ok. and then I got lower queue priority for 5 matches. please remove the lower queue priority and fix this bug please!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T00:18:45.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you were trying to choose your champion in that lobby, it's almost as if your client lost its connection with our servers and couldn't send your selection to the servers.
