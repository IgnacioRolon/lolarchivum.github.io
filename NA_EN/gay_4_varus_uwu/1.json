I log on play with a friend in normal (the usual when I don&#039;t wanna ranked) and everything goes swell.... Minus the fact I got camped in my first game back. Later in the game however I couldn&#039;t auto anything... The game.... refused to let me do it I was basically walking over the minions. So I thought it was a one time thing, next game it happens again at the 15 minutes mark. The cursor both times both had a blue outline to them and I thought that was strange. So i contact Riot Support and they put me through a bunch of steps to attempt to fix the issue, after following directions and even going into practice tool I assumed it was fixed (I was in Practice Tool just autoing for 14 minutes) So I go into my 4th game of the day (I just checked I played 4 games) and the ISSUE HAPPENED RIGHT AWAY the blue outline on the cursor but this time I could auto attack champions. I proceeded to get harassed by my team when I tried to explain my issue. I want to be able to play ranked and climb this weekend but this issue has me worried that I&#039;ll get flamed again PLEASE HELP ME\r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"RiotAaronMike","date":"2018-05-25T17:54:59.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!

You can find it at the bottom of the _Game_ options menu under the _Gameplay_ group. This new option makes it so that the already existing \"Target Champions Only\" keybinding is treated as a toggle instead of a press-and-hold.
