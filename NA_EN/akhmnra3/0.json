This was done because Shen's father, Zed's master, realized what the shadow techniques were that Zed was using, suggesting that he has intimate knowledge of the skills himself. This is while both Shen and Zed are children, before Shen became the Eye of Twilight and Zed became 'master ninja supreme'. Remember that for what comes later.\r\nSo, when Zed returned to the temple and saw his former master, not only did his master forgive him for his misdoings but pleaded for him to enter the temple and reclaim himself as a disciple of balance by destroying the box. This is the first mystery, why does Zed need to destroy the box? Why did his master NEVER destroy the box, let alone keep it in the temple? You may say \"Oh he needs to reclaim something in the box he left behind\" or \"He needs to make the decision himself to break it.\"\r\nBut moving on to the next point, when Zed enters the temple with his master; The second mystery: Why is Zed the one who screams, and I quote, \"In pain\" ? I will come back to this in a moment, let us move to Shen's lore for a moment.\r\nShen has trained his entire life to become the Eye of Twilight, so even when he knew Zed he was already training for this. His final test to become the Eye of Twilight was to attend the Takanu, the ceremony in which his father was tortured before his eyes. Obviously Shen passed this test without even blinking at his father's pain.\r\nSome of you may see what I'm getting at near this point.\r\nZed returned to the temple to claim his prize, many may think of this situation as the Temple being his prize as vengeance for his dishonor. But what if his prize was the praise and recognition he desired as a child? This idea is supported by how willing Zed was to accompany his old master into the old temple, it did not seem as though he was filled with hate, but willingness to forgive.\r\nAt this point, we move into theoretical situations. It is possible that Shen's father was disillusioned in the Kinkou's principals of balance when they forced his own son to watch him be brutally tortured. If Zed's master knew the shadow techniques as I mentioned earlier, this means that he could have been taken advantage of in this moment of weakness and been pulled into the belief that shadow is supreme, just as Zed believed.\r\nObviously, he would not be able to sway his students or the Kinkou in his current position as a master at the temple teaching the value of balance. But enter Zed and his army of Ninjas which his master appeared to be 'waiting for'.\r\nTo move on at this point, I would like to point out that in the game Zed NEVER dies, he uses a portal to escape from the situation at hand, leading me to believe that Zed cannot actually die unless he AND his shadow die at the same time. Furthermore it is possible that the shadow is the core of Zed's true consciousness and his body is merely a puppet that replicates the shadow instead of the opposite.\r\nTo continue, with his master intimately aware of the powers of shadow as I believe, he would know this while Zed may not. I then think that his master used a powerful shadow technique to trade shadows with Zed and proceeded to wrest control of his students' younger and more capable body from him, a painful moment that could cause a cry of pain. In order to prevent his student from realizing what had happened and revealing it, he then silenced his former student who was at the time controlling his master's body. His master would also be capable of ending his life completely by knowing that his shadow must die as well.\r\nAt this point, Shen's father would not only have the forces and students he needed to rise against the Kinkou. He would also have a younger and more powerful body compared to his old and aged one that he had just disposed of. He would then be free to teach the ways of shadow to his new disciples and with his old students and son as the very embodiment of what he became disillusioned and enraged at, he then called for their deaths. Zed's students, believing that they were being ordered by Zed, then followed as commanded.\r\n\"What I have done... Cannot be undone.\" \"No technique is forbidden.\" \"Brave the shadows, find the truth.\" \"The shadows have enlightened me.\" \"They follow the wrong master.\" \"Ignorance is fatal.\" \"Do not deny me.\"\r\n\"The truth lies in darkness.\"\r\n\r\nCredit: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1jeg3c/theory_about_what_really_happened_to_zed/","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-20T01:43:33.240+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What does this have to do with zed being unfair.

Indeed, although both Zed AND Naruto stole a forbidden technique, Naruto was tricked into doing so, while Zed did it of his own accord. A great idea for a Zed rework would for him to have a multiple shadow clone jutsu (as his ultimate), so there would be many Zeds attacking, but there is really only one real copy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hoes and bows","date":"2016-08-20T10:52:03.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/vader_didnt_read.gif","replies":[]}]}
