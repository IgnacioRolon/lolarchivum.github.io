Provoked agression / Not being offensive.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hi there people,\n\nI&#039;m here again because I got banned again for bad behaviour. This time, Permanently banned. At first, I&#039;ve learned of my 14-days ban and it is having it&#039;s process to be better and better, I am working on it. But, obviously it&#039;s too late! I&#039;ve got banned for offensive behaviour. My ban is concluded from 3 games. In my chatlog is one slightly offensive thing said. But for the rest, I am NOT offending anyone with my words in my chatlog in contrast to my teammates in those games! I&#039;m copying my chatlog and lets see what you guys think if this ban is deserved yes or no.\n\nIn these games I got hard provoked by some teammates to be agressive. But in my opinion i&#039;ve controlled myself pretty well. In my opinion i&#039;m not ban-worthy.\n\nI&#039;m pleasured to answer your (most of them) answers.\nGreets!\n\nGame 1\nPre-Game\nIm Like Yisus: teemo support\nIm Like Yisus: yikes..\nIn-Game\nIm Like Yisus: we&#039;re so fucked on bot\nIm Like Yisus: im done\nIm Like Yisus: WHy\nIm Like Yisus: Do\nIm Like Yisus: u\nIm Like Yisus: Damage\nIm Like Yisus: the wave\nIm Like Yisus: :o\nIm Like Yisus: can I leave pls\nIm Like Yisus: im fucked anyways\nIm Like Yisus: im done\nIm Like Yisus: u must\nIm Like Yisus: be\nIm Like Yisus: fucking\nIm Like Yisus: kidding\nIm Like Yisus: well gg wo\nIm Like Yisus: wp\nIm Like Yisus: 10y old\nIm Like Yisus: right\nIm Like Yisus: karma is just wandering around\nIm Like Yisus: np\nIm Like Yisus: I get no defence from karma so\nIm Like Yisus: its a free game for you\nIm Like Yisus: pla 4\nIm Like Yisus: u dont even play support\nIm Like Yisus: u just play second jungle\nIm Like Yisus: xD\nIm Like Yisus: sure u are reported after\nIm Like Yisus: toxic\nIm Like Yisus: and giving up\nIm Like Yisus: lol sure\nIm Like Yisus: lets see what riot is finding in chatlog\nIm Like Yisus: fun thing is I carried 3 times previous games\nIm Like Yisus: so\nIm Like Yisus: and I wonder how i cant now with u as support\nIm Like Yisus: lol right\nIm Like Yisus: can u report karma for being offensive thank you\nIm Like Yisus: appreciated\nIm Like Yisus: all I hear is: u suck bla bla u can&#039;t do anything\nIm Like Yisus: because I sucked\nIm Like Yisus: but that&#039;s not how league works I guess\nIm Like Yisus: there we go\nIm Like Yisus: thanks kha\nIm Like Yisus: thanks zed &lt;3\nIm Like Yisus: x)\nIm Like Yisus: Karma u didnt change\nIm Like Yisus: LOL RIGHT\nIm Like Yisus: well riot will see your chatlog I won&#039;t complain anymore cya\nIm Like Yisus: thats the support u like\nIm Like Yisus: no shield on your adc\nIm Like Yisus: no peel\nIm Like Yisus: kha he does nothing to help me\nIm Like Yisus: on purpose\nIm Like Yisus: im just speechless\nIm Like Yisus: why I always get supports who are actually playing with me but this one doesn&#039;t from minute 4\nIm Like Yisus: i will lol\nIm Like Yisus: :l what&#039;s not true about it\nIm Like Yisus: bg wp\nIm Like Yisus: dont forget to report karma pls\nPost-Game\nIm Like Yisus: gg guys\nIm Like Yisus: wp bot\n\n**Ps. ^^^ Here I am legit being sportmanlike to say gg wp to the enemy bot because that they&#039;ve played well together and they were just good.**\n\nGame 2\nPre-Game\nIm Like Yisus: adc\nIm Like Yisus: /vote Bluelive biggest gay Saudi Arabia #1\n\n**Ps. ^^^ Bluelive is my premade.

This chat log is pretty stark evidence _against_ your claims of having learned from the 14-day ban.\n\nI could certainly go over the rest of your chat logs - if you'd like me to, feel free to ask - but as it stands, the first is enough to validate the punishment. You spent way too much time flaming, harassing, and getting into detrimental arguments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2018-12-29T00:39:25.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah you need to focus on your own performance a little more.

That's why chat logs only show what was said by the player whose behavior is under review.\n\nSaying you're done, calling your teammate a 10-year-old as an insult, saying you'll report a teammate, arguing about who will get banned, calling for reports, telling your teammate that they suck, and calling for reports again are considered inappropriate behavior. Throwing in some sportsmanlike behavior in the last few seconds before people leave the lobby doesn't cancel out the things you said. If you knew you were on thin ice from a previous ban and this is your idea of appropriate behavior, it's no surprise you got banned. Riot bans based on what they think should be bannable, not based on what anyone else thinks.\n\nAnd that was just one game.\n\nIn the second game, first of all, the banter with your friend could've contributed to the ban, but the game was only included because you were reported for other things, like raging at Olaf for taking your farm, spamming the chat by putting one word on each line, insisting that Olaf will get banned for taking your farm, calling for people to report the Olaf, and harassing the Olaf about how he'll get banned.\n\nIn the third game, you spammed the chat by putting one word on each line, gave up before you could forfeit, and called for people to report your teammate. Telling your premade that he or she had no brain could've contributed to the ban, like your banter in the previous game, but, again, there were other issues with your behavior.\n\nYour behavior could've potentially been worse, but it was still pretty bad. Spamming the chat, harassing teammates, and giving up when you were on the edge of a permaban send a message to Riot that you'll never improve your behavior to the standards they expect. Once again, the key is what Riot thinks of your behavior, not what you or anyone else thinks of it.\n\nOh, and by the way, additional reports don't make a difference anyway. It's not some kind of vote; the game either gets reviewed or it doesn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jon Moxley","date":"2018-12-28T21:37:31.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mother of Christ you talk way too fucking much","replies":[]}]}
