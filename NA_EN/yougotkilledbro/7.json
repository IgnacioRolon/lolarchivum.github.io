I also want to go a bit more in depth. I am just going to hop into this.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGES:\r\nQ was completely reworked, this was actually a great change, and I love it.\r\nE: For some reason, riot lowered the time channeling before the spell canceled. This is small, but why? Base damage lowered by a bit. Ok... But really??? But the most bullshit thing was changing the stun from 1 second to .5. WHAT THE FUCK RIOT. You literally made a perfectly fine cc ability trash, and completely unrewarding to land. The damage is shit now too.\r\nR: Another wtf ability change. Does only 100 base damage more than E. Can literally kill your entire team, and you aren&#039;t even immune while casting it. This ability is a shitty gimmick that is somehow worse than his basic abilities.\r\n\r\n Pre-Rework, Zac was in quite a decent spot, a very fun one trick, and a very occasional competitive pick. His gameplay never got old. And his playmaking potential was awesome. He also had some decent damage for a tank. And yeah, he relied on his E for everything, but It was fine, cause he was fun.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the rework to give him more cc and not be totally E reliant. That is cool with me. The Q looked awesome from the beginning, and I have always been iffy on the ult. It looked way too gimmicky in the previews, and definitely was. What baffled me the most is why Zac was selected over champions like {{champion:72}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:54}}  etc being in worse states than him. He was healthy, and could use a little something, but all you had to do was q and get the fuck out. Not make him a walking shitty {{champion:13}} . Riot&#039;s execution on this rework was shitty, and dissapointed me.\r\n\r\nMe and Zac go a long way back, to about pre-season 6. I started playing him then. And it was nonstop fun from there. When I stopped playing for a bit around may 2016, and came back in April this year, I remembered zac, and how much fun I had playing him. I played some norms with Zac jg, and nostalgia kicked in right away and I dove into ranked. I placed in B5, and knew I could climb, and I did, all the way to b2, on almost specifically Zac. And now I am sitting in B3 because I lost my promos. Which I feel like I could have won if I was on old Zac.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the rework, I immediately went to the gameplay boards, and said &quot;wtf riot, zac is perfectly fine.&quot; And I predicted correctly, although being a bit optimistic, I played about 5 games with the rework and now I don&#039;t even want to play league again. I have been actually crying for about an hour now, not even because of my promos, just basically a funeral for Zac, who was ruined by a rework. I have noticed a drop in my performance on new zac, and I know he is reworked, and might need some adjustment to get things right, but I didn&#039;t play well in most of them, and I don&#039;t even feel like it was my fault. My E literally didn&#039;t do shit the whole game. That ability used to actually have damage, and I have made some insane outplays with it, but nope. Half the knock-up, destroy the damage.\r\n\r\nIf I could have the ammount of money riot games is worth, or old zac back. I would without a doubt take old zac. He brought me more fun than all that money and new zac have.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: What I want to say is, that Zac never needed changes, and It is really sad to see him go to the shitty rework pool (joining {{champion:107}} and {{champion:98}} ) And the changes don&#039;t help him at all, just make him more difficult. I would recommend reading  and (try to get this to riot lol)  so the can understand how me and others feel about this crappy rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Fed by Snu Snu","date":"2017-05-04T23:16:38.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One more in the {{champion:90}} pile.","replies":[]},{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-05-08T01:18:39.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac rework is a JOKE.
