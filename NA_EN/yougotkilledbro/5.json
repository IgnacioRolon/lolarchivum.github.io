And now it causes a remake 1 game away from promos and I lose LP. My computer runs fine for every game except yours, and it was not my internet or anything to do with it. It is really annoying to lose lp off of something that is out of my control. It feels very unfair. Is there a way we can work something out?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-04T19:39:02.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's going on when the game crashes?

Let's go ahead and run through the steps in this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974), but definitely hit me back up if that's not working and you have a little more info about what's happening.","replies":[{"poster":"YOUGOTKILLEDBRO","date":"2017-06-06T21:14:26.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my computer just kinda freezes and then turns off, I did some things where it is better but still crashes about once a game.
