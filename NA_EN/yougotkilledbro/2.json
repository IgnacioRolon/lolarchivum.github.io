It goes on to do a bugsplat and other stuff and it allows a remake. I now get leaverbuster because of something that is not my fault. That guy didnt trade me, and I couldn't connect to the game after that. Now I am demoted again after all the time it took to get back to silver 4. I am done with all of this bullshit and I want my rank back or I quit. I am getting punished for another persons mistake. I could have also played the game to not allow the remake, but that wouldn't be nice to my team. I am annoyed that taking one for the team and helping a remake because of an accident gets me this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-23T15:58:58.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry for the trouble you've been going through.  :(  Bugsplats happen if you have bad drivers or game files failing to render the game, not a failure to trade champions or lanes.  I know that you had a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) as a result, but the system will treat everyone equally because all leaves cause others a negative experience.\n\nYour best bet would be to stick to custom games for now in order to troubleshoot this towards a fix.  That's best done by going over each step in the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide.  That should help get this fixed up and back into game.

I have done nothing wrong here, infact took one for the team for remaking a lost game for everyone else. And now I get punished for going down to silver 5 again? I am already stuck in elo hell, and now helping other players gets me this? Really?","replies":[]}]}]}
