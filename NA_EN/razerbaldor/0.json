But i had stable 25ms in the cmd while i was running a costum league game with permanent drops up to a 1000ms. Also, noone from the Riot team seem to care about this and respond to me. \nEven if you guys donÂ´t know the problem yet, or whatever you are doing, it would be VERY nice to have an answer at least. I am unable to play ranks atm because of this issue, would loose tons of lp. \n\nIt is clearly a server Issue and none from my side of the connection. So please do something or tell me something i could try or do to stable the connection between me and your servers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-04T19:01:05.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with ethernet or a great network, you can still have unstable connection issues.  This could be caused by something local or even how your ISP is routing to the game server.  This could very well be packet loss, but let's find out for sure!
