But ever since this update hit, my elo (silver) is getting absolutely disgusting.\n\nEvery time a Nunu doesn&#039;t get the role they wanted, they keep spamming /all chat with the location of the actual jungler. At first I thought this was just one game... until I saw this happens with literally (no exaggeration) EVERY Nunu player so far that I see their role being contested by their own team, and proceed to solve their issue by throwing the game and start griefing (Deliberate counterproductivity).\n\nHow did this happen so fast already? This is just disgusting behavior to have your game thrown by. It&#039;s childish and doesn&#039;t solve anything at all. And we can't dodge games forever either.","replies":[{"poster":"TheKingOfBiches","date":"2018-08-29T16:15:55.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People act like toddlers *every time* there's a new champion/rework in the first few weeks.you just have to deal with it unfortunately,and make sure your reporting the troll behavior","replies":[{"poster":"Uriel","date":"2018-08-29T17:51:23.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair enough, but this didn't happen with other champs like Pyke or Akali.

Do you think W is a good engage? Literally throw any cc while he's doing it and he's done. I played Xerath supp against him and he was able to land only one W in the laning phase, and that was because I missed my stun. Even his E is bad because you need to hold them several seconds in your range, which is hard to do if your enemies are decent players (and by decent i mean they have hands)\nIt might be a good pick, but only in some matchups, and even then there are other supports who can do the same thing as him but better","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-08-30T13:44:28.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, you're claiming that CC is what's holding him back, when, as I stated above, _every single tank support_ gets their balls kicked into their teeth by being CC'd.
