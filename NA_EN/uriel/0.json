Just push out side lanes and farm jungle whenever you can, dont just follow your team around waiting for a skirmish, farm if their is nothing to do, better yet, farm mid for more mobility and utility when a teamfight happens nearby. I would reccomend taking 2 waves, then going into the jungle to take birds or krugs or wolves or gromp, then go top/bot and take 2 waves of cs from that.
