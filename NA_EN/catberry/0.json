Match this with paper m&acirc;ch&eacute; towers stuffed with first blood gold, and it is incredibly difficult to mount a comeback, not to mention usually quite unenjoyable to attempt to play from behind, as in all likeliness there will be very little chance for your team to achieve victory, unless of course all of the enemy team dced consecutively for a good 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHas anyone else been finding this an issue? I am by no means the most experienced player, as though I have been around since mid Season 5, I have been playing very inconsistently since then due to a myriad of reasons, however even as the low elo scrub that I am, I feel that this is quite a balancing flaw currently. I wanted to ask everyone else&#039;s opinion on the matter, and see if we can get a discussion going about this, since I do see it as an issue currently (maybe others will disagree, but I find is somewhat broken). \r\n\r\nWhat suggestions would you propose to fix this issue? Buffing towers? Nerfing Rift Herald and first blood tower gold? Let me know below, if you would care to.","replies":[{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-10-09T16:34:32.493+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"The length is fine\n\nIt's the snowball affect that is bad or feels too quick","replies":[{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-10-10T01:52:38.101+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This along with the fact that nearly every soloQ teammate I get wants to surrender and give up after a bad early.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2017-10-10T01:06:14.897+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":66,"body":"Oftentimes, the feeling that games are too snowbally is actually misdiagnosed as: won games are drawn out for too long.

Hour long games were long yet normal back in the day.\n\nAs have I. Hour long games were great if you were the losing team making a comeback. **_But hour long games sucked if you were the winning team and couldn't finish out a game_**.\n\nNow I'm not saying \"couldn't finish out a game\" as in \"lol our team just goofing around cuz we so far ahead xD lol we just died oh well xD oh noes they are getting gold and catching up, and our cockiness is making us not take them seriously anymore when we should\". Rather, I am saying that you couldn't finish out a game back then because the game simply didn't reward your good playstyle and good in-game choices enough.\n\nAnd this argument will apply even to today's state of the game: if my team plays a flawless early game, even if we don't have early-game champions, why should we lose/why should the enemy team be able to stall out the game and **_NEGATE_** all of our good plays and choices, just on the merit of a passive, non-interactive playstyle? \n\nThe Gameplay Boards has been up in arms about the non-interactive playstyle of Ancient Coin item line, and how Ancient Coin users earn more gold than Relic Shield and Spell Thief users, but without entertaining significant risks for that gold. While the game may reward non-interaction in the Ancient Coin line, that playstyle has been dropped in so many other facets of the game.\n\nI know there's an argument to be made for lategame scaling champs, and I think that's a valid argument. However, the style of the game has changed in the last few years, in such a way that good early game choices are not negated by non-interactive playstyles on a MACRO level. And I enjoy that. I like being rewarded for playing well and making good choices, and being offered options to take my lead to close out a game. Sure, I don't get to stall out the game when I'm losing much anymore, but that's part of the game being fair, as I wouldn't want my enemies to be able to do that. \n\n_**Nothing says \"fuck you for being better at the game\" like allowing non-interactive macro-level play to stifle any rewards for playing well. **_","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-10-10T14:11:59.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quite the post.

Especially the ones with siege.\n* **Lategame Team Comps:** They spike way to early, almost make them a midgame champion\n\n---\n\nThe fixes are rather simple:\n\n* Buff up splitpush/catch options so early champions can compeet in the lategame.\n* Slightly nerfs the midgame of lategame champions again or nerf their lategame to compensate for their stronger midgame.\n* Buff or introduce new support items that can compeet with {{item:3504}} that can push the meta in different directions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSingularity","date":"2017-10-10T03:01:28.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say, depending on your ELO and playstyle, you can still get longer games.  I recently had a 50 minute game, because the two teams were fairly even, and the lead kept going back and forth.  But other times, it's a 20-30 minute fiesta, because one team gets ahead immediately (the exception being when your team manages to hold the base and turn the game around later).  So I guess it depends on how and with whom you get queued.","replies":[]},{"poster":"i cant move wtf","date":"2017-10-09T14:18:22.176+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Better players should be able to close out games sooner.
