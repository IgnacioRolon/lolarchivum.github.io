I know it might seem fun to you knew kids but not worth getting into this game. If you are a competitive player and not just a casual btw. The games def not good when im playing and my gold 1 sona only is 0-4 to players that legit are new level 20's and lose every game LOL Its been 7 years and people arent good at this game and its not hard. Melee? Been around 15 years getting bigger every year AND people actually are skilled in the game unlike league where only top 50 challenger are decent.\r\n\r\nPlay super smash bros melee instead. It rewards you for being good and there is no developers making the game worse over the years! The better player mostly wins and there are doubles!!","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-18T06:05:30.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then how come you're not rank one?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO","date":"2017-07-18T12:17:30.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Melee is unbalanced","replies":[]}]}
