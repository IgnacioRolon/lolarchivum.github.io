The one thing that was characteristic of Akali was that she could stick super hard but once she was in she had almost no way out. Now that's gone, removing her one glaring weakness.\n\nOh and she got a fucking stun, because every AP assassin needs a stun.

And..... then they will learn how to reposition 3 times within 2 seconds, and use 2 of those to enable a kill, and still have some kit left.\n\nHer biggest gating feature is her Energy requiring her to cross that circle or just burn free energy on minions. Once players start to play her aggressively and E champs over and over, she will no longer find herself gated and people will purely hate her more than the old Akali.\n\nAnd then teams will begin to design themselves to fight her...... going aoe nuke after aoe nuke, and then the resulting teams breeding in dueling/mobility weakness will begin to get countered by more comprehensive champs, kind of like {{champion:11}} does.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-08-06T15:09:57.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has less mobility and her burst is severely delayed.
