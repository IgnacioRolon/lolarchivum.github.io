Realy enjoyable and awsome game.\r\n\r\nGame 2 : This one was a complete caos, fiora picked exauth top and lost into jayce realy hard, tresh was insulting\\flaming around and zigs was blaming everyone. It was a nightmare, luckly it was less than 20 mins.\r\n\r\nGame 3 :  In my optinion it was the perfect example how jungle feels like. My mid laner lost hard 1vs1 and decided to spent the intire game blaming me ( the jungler ). This is prob the one i was kinda toxic cause she was being realy anoying and frustrating to focus with.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Im not going to be arrogant and telling you that i was friendly and postive, but i can tell you that i tried till the end to win and tried to encourage the team. By teeling them to mute the person that was causing problems or just after bad calls . \r\n* In my perspective im far from being toxic and i have seen people that are insanely toxic. Keep in mind that these games were prob the most frustrating and tilting ones, so these are the worst in game chat behavior.\r\n*  I recognize that i need to improve in some aspects and when the suspensions ends i will try my best to polish them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to share your opinion and tell me what do you think about this entire situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-11T05:35:23.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you talk 90% too much inside a game\nkeep statements relevant to the game\nor say nothing","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-03-11T05:45:29.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"in game 1:\n\n>Hardstyle Family: im reporting you\nHardstyle Family: caith shut up and behave\nHardstyle Family: caith trolling, enjoy the bot side\n\nIf you're going to report someone, just report them.
