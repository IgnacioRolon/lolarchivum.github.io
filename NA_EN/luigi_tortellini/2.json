Let this cash grab freemium game die.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Literally every game I&#039;ve tried to jungle since then &quot;autofill btw since no one wants to play it&quot; I just get killed at my buff when I&#039;m still level 2 and my opponent level 3 because he memorized some gimmicky path.  I then just leave since the game is literally over, if i stay I just get to die in my jungle over and over again.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s 3 questions for Riot\r\n1. Who asked for these changes?\r\n2. Do you honestly think reducing the viable jungle champ pool to 4 made the game better?\r\n3. Does Tencent have a gun to your head?\r\n\r\nPlease stop giving these people money and let their game die.  Pick up a new hobby, you can do it.  They have clearly shown through power creep worse than ever and loot crates that they are no longer changing this game to make it better.  It does not take 8 years to balance a game.  If they cared about this game at all they would have stopped changing at Season 3 / 4 / 5.  Every new champion / balance change is meant to force players to relearn the wheel / make more money, none of it is to improve and players are finally starting to notice.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-02T19:47:27.083+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> cash grab freemium game\n\nYou have obviously never played a cash grab freemium game.. Or even figured out what that means.\n\nThe jungle changes are not reverted because riot does not do kneejerk overkill reactions like the boards trash. It will be adjusted or reverted after a patch cycle or two once enough data has been collected, just like everything is. Look at the time it took for the LB revert.","replies":[]},{"poster":"√ùisus","date":"2018-06-02T19:42:59.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to admit, I miss season 5.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-02T19:47:47.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Warwick","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SuperCosmicHobo","date":"2018-06-02T19:39:06.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is the role nobody usually wants to play unless it's like two friends playing supp and adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IS1a35739310e6470464399","date":"2018-06-02T19:37:13.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i would upvote you but i'm not yet level 30","replies":[]}]}
