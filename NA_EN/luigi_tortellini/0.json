There is nothing interesting about her or her kit.  She's just a generic adc with overtuned numbers and 5 million passives.  Riot hasn't released a champ/rework in the past 2 years that doesn't just piss me off.\n\nVayne was overpowered when she had 8% damage on W in season 3.  Now riot fucked the game so much they didn't wanna leave vayne behind so they gave her 14% and double stealth.  JUST DONT GET AUTOD 3 TIMES DURRRR.\n\nEvery single game if I ban Kai sa they pick Vayne.  If I ban Vayne they pick Kai Sa.  If both are banned they play Xayah","replies":[{"poster":"kda akali","date":"2019-06-01T03:09:53.469+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"kaisa and vayne dont have weeb skins","replies":[{"poster":"Luigi Tortellini","date":"2019-06-02T00:22:22.849+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"kda is the most weeb shit ive ever seen","replies":[{"poster":"kda akali","date":"2019-06-02T02:16:58.344+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"more koreabooish imo","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-06-02T01:19:26.816+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure.
