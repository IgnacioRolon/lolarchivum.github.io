I build a fucking merc treads, and a fucking spirit visage, and a fucking adaptive helm. and after all of that shit.

I end up with 63 god forsaken MR against the mage builds these days.\r\n\r\n\r\nsick and tired of losing 1500 HP to the enemy support that build Mpen boots and morellos before mid game. its fucking silly.  don't need ad carries when \"supports\" have access to ridiculous itemization that lets them vastly outdamage any ad carry. even late game. I'd take a mage over an adc.","replies":[{"poster":"xDelightifyx","date":"2018-12-20T06:36:47.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly every Tank is fking garbage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emo Twink","date":"2018-12-20T03:45:23.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"At least AP champs dont have the absurd amount of true damage that AD champs have, let alone sources of armor shredding all while having normal armor pen items and 35% on Lord Dominik's (less than void staff but auto attacks and abilities vs jst abilities with AP).","replies":[]},{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2018-12-20T03:42:02.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"At this point, damage just needs to go back a huge notch.
