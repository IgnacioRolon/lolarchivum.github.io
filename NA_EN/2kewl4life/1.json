We can view the situation from our own shoes. We play the same game. We encounter the same situations.\n\nIf you think we don't, then there must be something about your own behavior that is causing such a difference. If there is such a difference, then addressing the issue from our own perspective is again useful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-11-16T05:24:51.686+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Welcome to the place where people have a legitimate reason to be unbanned...\n\nI'd honestly like to see a couple cases that fit that description. Very rarely does it ever even _seem_ probable that someone who got banned would have a legitimate reason to be unbanned, and even in those rare few cases, it very often turns up that their ban was properly placed and that they should stay banned.\n\n> ...and are just downvoted to hell...\n\nComplaining about downvotes does nothing. People have their own reasons for downvoting, and it usually resolves to disagreement or the OP in question being disagreeable. Regardless, downvotes don't matter.\n\n> ...by [players] who use retrospect as a way of making their point.\n\nI don't understand what you mean by this. Are we just not supposed to judge the players actions that led to the punishment?\n\n> I mean, alot of the people here trying to get unbanned are actually toxic...\n\nThis seems to run completely counter to your opening statement. So people have a legitimate reason to be unbanned...But a lot of them actually don't?\n\n> ...but most the chat logs are from the typical regular league game.\n\nDefine \"typical\" and \"regular\".\n\n> trolls and feeders are everywhere...\n\nLegitimate trolls and intentional feeders are rare, despite what you may think. Unless you're running with a premade who go out of their way to troll and int-feed, that kind of behavior isn't actually typical.\n\nWhat _is_ typical, however, is people crying \"wolf\" over a pug. Consider, perhaps, that the people you're calling trolls and intentional feeders aren't actually that - and that they may well just be suffering an off-game. We all have them.\n\n> ...and when you are on a hard grind, of course you will be enfuriated.\n\nGetting angry is no excuse for breaking the rules. If you know you're getting angry, _take breaks_. People have ample tools to prevent themselves from going overboard and breaking the rules, if you don't use them, that's _your fault_.\n\n> ...its so undermining to say \"lol just report dont be mad\"...\n\nOnly a rare few people will be so unhelpful as to say \"don't be mad\". The majority of us _understand_ anger, and we know it's not something that can be readily controlled, but that still doesn't excuse breaking the rules.\n\n> ...because the game itself instigates toxicity by encouraging competitiveness...\n\nSeriously, this whole rigmarole? No, the game does not instigate or encourage toxicity in its design. If you're getting super frustrated in League, the odds are high that its _your own playing habits_ and _your own nature_ that's causing you to get frustrated, _not the game_. Trying to deflect the problem and blame the game isn't going to help you in any respect.\n\n> ...who are simply mad that their teammate is a chimpanzee.\n\nRemember what I said about \"players crying 'wolf' over pugs\"? This is pretty much exactly that. You're getting mad because a teammate is underperforming, so you'll do anything to vilify them, calling them a troll, an intentional feeder, acting like they're out to sabotage your game...\n\nI'm using \"you\" in the figurative sense, of course, but regardless, the point stands. And, I will repeat what I said earlier: **_If you're getting angry, take breaks._** Continuing to play while angry is only likely to make that anger build up, and then it'll reach that tipping point, and you'll explode and break the rules and get yourself punished.\n\n> its so easy to judge someone else for getting banned when you dont put yourself in their shoes and just look back in retrospect criticizing their every decision.\n\nIt's also easy to ignore that **we play the same game. We deal with the same situations, and we understand the frustration.** It's easy to ignore the fact that, despite being forum-goers and having this detached, unbiased perspective that fundamentally seems opposed to anyone who gets punished, _we don't have these fundamentally different experiences._\n\nWe deal with trolls, we deal with intentional feeders, we deal with bad games and players who are having bad games. We deal with unwinnable matches, frustrating match-ups, not getting our roles, our pick intents, everything. Don't act like we've never run into a troll or experienced the frustration of getting demoted straight after a hard climb up to a promo series.\n\nWe play the same freakin' game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-11-16T05:25:40.614+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're wondering why you don't gain honor?

If you cant do that, worry about what is wrong with yourself before blaming everyone else. It will help a lot in the long term.
