People find any ability they can to demote others or belittle them, just to feel superior.\r\n\r\nIf you make a post with an opinion and state your elo, people would consider you trash for your opinion just because your elo is not high enough. \r\nHeck, you don&#039;t even need to post your elo, just having an opinion is wrong here. Let alone state a wrong one ( didn&#039;t even know opinions could be wrong ).\r\n\r\nPeople overly criticize anything they don&#039;t agree with, but what makes it even worse, half of the time they wont even provide counter arguments, they just say &quot;your just bronze trash, what do you know&quot; or &quot;That&#039;s maybe cause your just bad&quot;.\r\n\r\nI sometimes come on the forums just to read what other people talk about, but majority of the posts I read are people just shitting on the original poster with negativity and downvotes. Its so bad sometimes I don&#039;t even wanna come here on the forums anymore. And if you say why your unsatisfied with the game, the usual response is too &quot;well you can just uninstall &quot;, like you cant be frustrated at something you love without giving up... And I haven&#039;t even gotten to the in-game aspect yet.\r\n\r\nNo matter what team you play on, if someone gets wrecked in lane, its never &quot;Oh wow that enemy Is really good&quot; its always &quot;my teammates are complete trash, why do I always get trashy teammates&quot; &gt;...&lt; Riot loves to pride itself over sportsmanship , but no one has any sportsmanship qualities. We rather trash our teammates, than learn from our enemies. Even if you win a lane vs an easy/hard matchup, the enemy will still &quot;Wow your so bad, how do I loose to you&quot;. AND DONT YOU DARE EVEN LOOSE A WINNING ONE. your team will never.... never.. never... let you live it down.\r\n\r\nHad a match recently where I was lux vs Oriana, and I died to a gragas gank ( wp to him ). and the first thing out of my jungler&#039;s mouth was &quot;How... she is bad early&quot; and I&#039;m like.. bro... did you not read who I died too? I cant be perfect 24/7. And that&#039;s not even considering the fact that Oriana might of just been a better player? These types of things seem lil at first but they breed arrogance.\r\n\r\nAgain, another matchup , lux vs yas. I killed yas cause he misplayed and immediately afterwards he goes ( your so  bad, how did I die to you? lol ).\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\nTL:DR\r\nI feel a lot of people in this community have a &quot;I&#039;m better than thou&quot; mentality. I mean sure its a competitive game, but it feels worse and worse\r\n- The flashing of masteries\r\n- The gg ez\r\n- The &quot;my teammates are bad&quot; speech\r\n- The &quot;dont play that, play what I want you to play&quot; criticism\r\nand this is only in champ select. Is slowly driving me insane. Perhaps I&#039;m the only one who does it, but I dont even bother talking to my teammates, I usually just hit /muteall soon as the game starts. I may occasionally type funny witty stuff to be comedic, but I usually remember by game 3 why I shouldn&#039;t ( people make you feel bad, doesn&#039;t improve teamwork at all )\r\n\r\n I dont know if I&#039;m overreacting ( probably going to get downvoted for this opinionated post ) but I honeslty fee that this is the type of mentality that has got to stop.","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2017-07-31T14:32:57.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dunno why people have problem with mastery flashing.

Maybe once or twice a game, but those people usually spam it, and half the time mean \"you suck\" as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-07-31T14:09:15.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">No matter what team you play on, if someone gets wrecked in lane, its never \"Oh wow that enemy Is really good\" its always \"my teammates are complete trash, why do I always get trashy teammates\"\n\nReminds me of when the matchmaking during the pre-season was completely screwed up and people in bronze would get matched up against challengers. Everyone knew it was unfair to expect them to not lose lane hard, but that never stopped the guy from being crucified like he was inting.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDangerousTaco","date":"2017-07-31T14:18:34.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol . . ah good times ~_~ (insert sarcasm here)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-07-31T13:18:51.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No different than the real world.  It's just that online, people have access to a lot more other people to belittle AND the safety of the all mighty monitor.  If people acted in real life like they do online, a lot of them would get physically shown what's up and end that arrogance real fast.
