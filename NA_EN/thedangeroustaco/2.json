For a while Teemo actually got extra vision range (the whole scout thing) and having a champion who can see you (without wards) before you can see them was problematic gameplay wise.  Think about how frustrating Kayn would be if there was no indicator that he was in a wall.","replies":[{"poster":"Pokemonred200","date":"2018-01-19T22:55:38.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't this also one of the reasons Feral Flare was broken in the past?

So if you were to made a solid case around that point, then by default, stealth champions shouldn't be allowed to do what they do.\n\nI can understand why it could become a frustrating mechanic, because I personally hate Evelynn ganks. My wards are irrelevant since they cant detect her, and if they know where my pink is they can walk around it. \n\nSo I don't disagree with it, it just doesn't seem as strong of a case not too imo. But I can also understand not wanting to lock supports into a meta rune page. Cause permanent extra power can change a game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDangerousTaco","date":"2018-01-19T20:19:21.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additional note.
