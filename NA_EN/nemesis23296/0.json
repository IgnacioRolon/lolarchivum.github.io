I reported it as a bug a lot of times but that's just it nothing else happens RIOT still didn't fix it. This happens only in the new client as I have never faced this in the Legacy client. Is there any fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-03T16:59:19.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you are waiting for the game to load, does anything show up on the screen like champion portraits?  Or is it just black?  Are you getting any errors?  For now I recommend sticking to custom games while we get this figured out.
