I received the Spirit Guard Udyr skin when Riot was dishing out the free random skins to players with good behavior. But as I recall upon his release, that there are Summoner profile icons that come with the skin, and while it's not *necessary* to have them, to have the option to get them would be cool.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if people who receive the skin through Mystery Gift run into the same problem, or if the icons are only awarded to those that forked out the RP for it, but I thought I should raise the question in any event.{{champion:77}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-05T06:38:16.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This appears to be a bug. \n\nThe icons are pretty sweet, so I can't say I blame you for wondering where they are! :] \n\nIn this case, the best thing you can to is submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to take a look at your account and take care of the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, we'll do some investigating to see why they're not automatically being gifted along with the skin!","replies":[]}]}
