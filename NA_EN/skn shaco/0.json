Some nice, others... Well, not so much.\r\nOf course, I was and still am, somewhat toxic, but every time I insult somebody it&#039;s in a way where it&#039;s not that offensive, or it makes sense why I&#039;m saying that to that person and I have a reason.\r\n(This kind of has something to do with the complaint I&#039;m about to file)\r\n\r\n-I was playing Blind Normals with a friend and typed &#039;mid&#039; in the chat when the champ select popped up, as a way to let everyone know that Midlane is taken.\r\nMy friend takes Ad Carry and locks Jhin in.\r\nI lock in Katarina, and then look at one of our teamates who picked Zed with Flash and Ignite, which suggests a midlane pick, most of the time.\r\nI freak out and ask him what&#039;s going on. He says he&#039;s playing midlane and I say that I picked midlane first. Nothing happens and I tell my friend I&#039;ll support him with Katarina, somehow and he agrees. I go into the game and ask people from my team to report him for Grieffing, and all of them agree to do so.\r\nHe starts writting about how it&#039;s not bannable, about how I&#039;m bad at the game and other, good stuff.\r\nI continue explaining to him how that stuff is bannable and how it got my account suspended one time.\r\nHe seems to not care and calls me dumb, or something. I get pissed and start insulting him.\r\nMy friend and I are not doing very well on botlane because the enemies picked Meta champions, but we&#039;re doing our best.\r\nThe enemy Zed, who&#039;s playing against our, before mentioned, Zed, comes botlane and kills me because we had no vision and nobody pinged us to warn us about him.\r\nZed gets upset and calls me a feeder (3/3, at that time), so I call him a &quot;f#cking degnerate&quot; and start pinging him because he died the third time.\r\nHe says we&#039;ll lose anyways and comes botlane and starts intentionally feeding our laners. He explains it as &quot;lagging&quot; and continues rushing bot and feeding the enemy team. At one point he was 1/6, and I was 3/6, or something and so he calls me an inter as well, because I told everbody to report him for intentionally feeding and trollpicking.\r\nWe continue arguing and the whole team starts flaming him because of how big of an a#shole he was.\r\nThe end of the game comes, I report him, thinking that&#039;s it, Riot&#039;s going to to their work and ban him.\r\nI accept a game invite from a friend and get notified that a person I&#039;ve reported has been banned, of course I was happy and proud, but, after I clicked a button to continue playing the game, a new notification pops up and tells me I&#039;ve been suspended.\r\nI log into that account and find that it was Permanently banned...\r\n\r\n*A reason it wasn&#039;t a 14 day suspention was because my friend got one before he game me the account*\r\n\r\nPlease, do something. I know the chat log is borderline, but so is the player&#039;s behaviour.\r\nI know he got a 14 day suspention, which is unfair.\r\nAt least make this a suspention, not a ban.\r\nThank you, anyways,\r\nDanilo.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-06-18T11:07:23.416+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"There isn't any rules in blind pick in regards to draft.

Account sharing is against the rules on its own, so that's 1 strike.\n\n2. The account had previous 14 day ban from original owner so it was already on this ice.\n\n3. flaming regardless of context is flaming and reportable, and since he accepted a thin ice account, he should accept the thin ice punishment.\n   (he flamed me first so i flamed back) is not, never has been, and never will be an acceptable excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Astorine","date":"2018-06-18T14:24:50.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: This i was unsure of, makes sense, thanks\n\n2: As i said, \"friend\" giving him a thin account is kinda bad tbh\n\n3: I did imply getting a thin ice account wasn't exactly smart.\n\nThe ban is justified if we are counting all of the summoners code, i do accept that.
