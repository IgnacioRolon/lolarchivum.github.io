Of the six known vastaya, five are terrestrial in domain and mammalian in form; Nami is aquatic but has breasts, indicative of a mammalian nature. Swain may have some link to the vastaya, and the Vastaya Field Journal does indicate the existence of avian vastaya.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m asking primarily in the case of insects, especially beetles. I&#039;m interested in devising a champion with beetle-like features, and I&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s any legitimacy behind giving that champ a vastayan heritage.\r\n\r\n(Also, is vastaya the singular as well as the plural?)","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-05-10T17:02:08.676+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well all the vastaya are related to humans,which is the reason why Nami has some human-like features.\nHowever as shown with Rengar,there are vastaya who only have a human-like bodyshape and look completely animalistic otherwise.\n\nSo in the end there is nothing that speaks against the existence of a humanoid bug-vastaya.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2017-05-10T16:38:38.824+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah vastaya can be any kind of animal, athropods, reptiles, birds, fish, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-05-10T18:31:03.612+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spareatick","date":"2017-05-10T16:46:26.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm very interested in the answer to this.  +1 friend hope it gets answered.  I am pretty sure the avian vastaya hinted at are xayah and Rakan btw, or at least their tribe.  Also Nami having breasts Doesn't necessarily mean the animals she shares attributes with have to be mammal.  Xayah has breasts but she takes on some avian attributes.  In fact if I remember correctly the vastaya are able to choose the forms they wish to take, so I very much believe beetle type vastaya are possible if the beetle is important to that tribe of vastaya.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-10T16:37:33.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you are doing a beetle it better suits the void","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-10T18:26:31.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar is the most animal-like Vastaya.\n\nBut the new air are birds and \"humans\" so not really mammas right?","replies":[]}]}
