However I forgot that the crippling amount of bots that have swarmed the map hasn&#039;t been fixed. I know you guys work hard on banning these accounts as their identified, and I thank you for that, but when me and the only other human on our team would rather surrender than keep playing it out and the enemy team is cruel enough to not shove into our base when asked it gets a little bothersome. Do you think you guys could change the vote system on TT, or maybe the surrender timer in general to 10 minutes? I&#039;m really just tossing out random suggestions, i suppose right now I&#039;m akin to a child who&#039;s having a bit of a temper tantrum, but the map is congested with these IP farming fiends. This problem has been going on for years now, and its really just saddening that a fun map has been corroded like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Swiftdeath2evil","date":"2016-07-03T12:30:21.146+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"And SR during low peak hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Devack The Holy","date":"2016-07-03T13:07:39.989+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's WORSE on TT.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2016-07-03T17:29:58.227+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just imagine how bad it is going to get when rito deletes twisted treeline (and let's be honest, we all know it is going to happen)","replies":[{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2016-07-04T15:35:49.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"'We are sorry but we didn't have the resources to maintain TT'- riot when they reach 3 billion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devack The Holy","date":"2016-07-05T13:20:03.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, I mean, they've literally broken stealth champs on the mode with the removal of items like Lightbringer and Oracle's Extract.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-07-03T21:47:19.013+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why hasn't riot implemented a Captcha?
