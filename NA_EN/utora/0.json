Was this intentional? Or a bug that needs to be fixed?\n* How long has Rek'Sai been in development?\n* It's been mentioned that Rek'sai is the queen of a special species of Voidspawn. Does this mean that our other Voidspawned friends are apart of their own special species?\n* How long has she been inhabiting Runeterra/Valoran?\n* Was it a conscious decision to not give her a slow? Correct me if I'm wrong, but her Q: Prey Seeker seems pretty useless as of now. Especially with it scaling off of Ability Power. Wouldn't it make this ability more impactful and encourage strategic play if we added a slow to the enemies hit by it? It also sounds like it fits well with her design as a hunter. Think of it this way, once she seeks out her prey, there is no escape from her. Not trying to tell you how to do your job, just brainstorming.\n* Why did you decide to give her Fury of all things? From her basic concept, you don't just perceive that she utilizes Fury, what inspired you to give a landshark a Fury bar?\n* ((Lightdragoon88's question:)) So, what made you decide to have it be a healing base fury like {{champion:23}}? Did you always have that healing passive since the beginning or was it a late choice?\n\nThanks for reading!

There are a number of cases where Rek'Sai ends up somewhere different than her tunnel entrance and that is not intended.\n* I started doing early prototypes about a year ago.\n* Prey Seeker is Rek'Sai's way to feel around in the dark. She has exceptional mobility and is most successful when utilizing flanking approaches towards enemies and has to rely on that rather than slowing a man and just running at them.\n* Her healing passive was something I gave her early on. Initially it was relegated to a buff stacking system that lacked the visceral feedback given by a resource bar. Fury felt like it made thematic sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fishbeard","date":"2014-12-02T19:43:54.085+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) Can you tell us anything about some of her scrapped ability ideas?\n\n~~2) What lead you guys to the Eternum skin decision?~~\n**Edit**: I see this was answered elsewhere.

I'll do my best to answer.\n\nIn short, launch skins are tricky. Think of it this way: when you first see the launch skin, you've got zero history playing that champ. It's like you're meeting the new kid at school for the first time, and what she's wearing (her 'skin') is the first thing you notice (unless she has claws, fangs, and a giant fin on her back). \n\nEasily recognizable skins help you identify with the champion immediately. We didn't make a conscious decision to strictly stick with established skin lines on launch skins. It just so happens they give a very clear first impression, and that's our goal.\n\nAs for Dino Gnar, the idea fits perfectly with who he is, and is immediately recognizable. Here, the skin matched our goals perfectly, established or not.

From the beginning of development we wanted to make her a \"True Beast\". In order to achieve this we decided early on that this meant not speaking a traditional language.  We knew it would be a challenge as she's the first Champion to not have a traditional language based VO package.  But even though she's not speaking words you can understand, she still has a language and a voice, a couple of them actually, and we think it fits her personality, motivations, and playstyle really well.\n\nWhen she's burrowed underground, she feels more \"at home\" and moves with ease and comfort. This is where she hunts and stalks her prey from a far distance. While she's burrowed she makes all sorts of void-y clicking sounds. You feel really smart when you're underground because you have a such an advantage with your Tremor Sense.  I wanted players to feel like they were hunting and stalking their prey and feeling smart while doing it.\n\nBeing Unburrowed on the other hand she sounds completely different. She's very vicious and savage sounding. Lots of grunts, hisses, and roars as she spins and swings her massive claws hitting everything in her reach. \n\nThe cooldown for Burrow/Unburrow is really short so you're going to be switching back and fourth between these two forms quite a bit so her VO style will also be changing.  It's really satisfying letting out some roars and hisses while clearing a jungle camp and then burrowing underground, hearing an enemy from from far away, and then emitting your void stalking clicks. This is a feeling and experience that I don't think we could have accomplished as well with a traditional English language package.\n\nHope this helps explain our thought process behind the VO decision!","replies":[]},{"poster":"KBingo","date":"2014-12-02T19:19:28.622+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":7,"body":"Additionally, why does Rek'Sai not have a human-like voice when the other Voidborn champs do?\n\nP.S.

She seems unique in the way that she jungles, so I think that something must have sparked the idea for this character.  Did you want a champ that could gank quicker, get to the jungle faster, or something else?  I think she's unique so therefore I think how you came up with her would also be.\n\n* What do you plan to do with Rek'Sai as a character on the Rift?  By this, I mean what do you want to see out of her?  Do you think the most interesting thing with her would be breaking the meta?  Rek'Sai's mechanics are interesting and knowing that you guys put a lot of thought into your champions, it would make sense to think about how would people proceed with your champions.\n\n* Does Rek'Sai have a connection with Shurima and/or Void champs such as Azir, Sivir, Vel'Koz, Cho'Gath, etc?  I ask this because she is depicted in the trailer in Shurima and is obviously from the Void.  Considering that the Void is something you seem to want to expand on and that Shurima was not too long ago an important topic, these two things from a view look sort of hand in hand on Rek'Sai.  You guys put a lot of care into your lore so I'm curious as to what that means for Rek'Sai.  Maybe she was from Shurima and the Void transformed her.  Maybe the Void created her on Shurima.  Maybe she has a connection with Azir.  I don't know, but that's precisely why I'm curious about it.\n\n* Does she like the puns of damage?\n\nThese are the main things that have been on my mind since her reveal.
