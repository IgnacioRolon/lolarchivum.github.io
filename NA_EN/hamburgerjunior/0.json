I don&#039;t understand why you needed to do anything to her. You already completely took away her passive. If you asked 100 people what karmas passive is, none of them would know. You know why? She doesn&#039;t matter. She wasn&#039;t out of control. But yeah, thanks for that shield damage nerf making her unplayable with 0 teamfight presence.
