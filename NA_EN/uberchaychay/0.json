It&#039;s really inhibiting my play, where I would be able to do more in fights if I was able to transform as intended. My main issue with this is that either it&#039;s a bug, a pretty major one, and needs to be fixed yesterday, or it&#039;s intentional, with no mention of it in the tooltip, which seems pretty important to mention. I spent a whole game trying so hard to deal damage to the lone melee champ to get the transformation, and if there was a hard cap on when I could transform, I&#039;d have done more in other lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"Vyntrius","date":"2018-09-30T05:00:25.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, there is no hard cap on how fast Kayn can transform. Keep in mind that Kayn has two separate transformation meters to fill up, but the meter will only show the progress of the orbs you collected the most. Because your Kayn game had 4 ranged champions in it, your meter was likely filled with only blue orbs initially. Hitting their melee champion was making progress towards the red meter that you couldn't see. If you want Rhaast vs a mostly ranged team, you're probably better off just filling up the blue meter asap and waiting the 4 minutes instead of desperately throwing yourself at their one melee champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-09-29T22:04:28.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes to an extent.
