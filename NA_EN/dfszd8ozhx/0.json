The fact that she thinks she has a sister when she doesn't only shows that she is crazy. She states, \"You think I'm crazy? You should see my sister.\" Two assumptions one could make about this statement from a crazy person is that she either has a sister or she doesn't. If she does have a sister, Jinx would be implying that her sister is crazier than she is, but that's completely against what Jinx is about. Jinx's lore and audio only show how much of a maniac she is. If a sister that was crazier than her did exist, that would make Jinx seem less crazy and would make whatever she says seem more sane contradicting what she stands for (a crazy person). If she doesn't have a sister, she would be trying to prove that she is crazy by telling people she has a sister when she doesn't. Even if she wasn't trying to prove that she is crazy but at the same time not having a sister but saying that she does have one but really thinking that she has a sister when she doesn't only shows that she is crazy. Also, nothing in anyone's lore definitively shows that she has a sister.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-05T06:11:27.196+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alternate theory, Vi, Ekko, and Jinx are all from some experiment/foster home/orphanage where they numbered the kids. Vi 6,  Jinx 10, Ekko 12. VI is roman numeral 6, Ekko's sword has roman number 12 on it, Jinx spraypaints \"X wuz here\", which X is 10 in roman numerals. It's possible Jhin had something to do with it as well, and could be why he's obsessed with the number 4 and why Vi was in his promotional teaser. (he also has IIII on his gun, which was a way to write 4)\nVi doesn't remember anything, but it's possible Jinx does, and how they act with each other could be seen as a ramped up version of sisters play fighting.\nOn the howling abyss, the shopkeeper says \"You look just like your sister. Wait,I'm not suppose to talk about that.\" to Vi. Vi has pink hair and blue eyes, jinx has blue hair and pink eyes. they're both (kind of) skinny with big weapons.\nAlso they both like to destroy things.\nGroovylord was the lead designer on all 4 of them, and they are all related in _some_ way.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-03-05T17:57:14.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you take off her bangs, Jinx and Vi also have the same hair style, with their right eye mostly covered.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-03-05T17:56:28.950+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the recent Lore updates seems to imply that Vi and Jinx ARE sisters, which is why there was space for 2 children in the tub Vi was found in, and that Warwick of all people might be their father, but Jinx was taken by Singed when he kidnapped Warwick,  when Warwick was in captivity, singed brought in a little girl, which can be assumed to be Jinx because Warwick has a quote \"You, you were there!\"  that he only says towards Jinx,  and the girl is implied to have been his daughter...
