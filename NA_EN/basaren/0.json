I mean there are tons of other champions who have had little to no skins since release or have been left alone with no skins in a very long time. (Zac, Jayce, kennen, Nocturne. and many more) so why not do something for them instead of the bastard rat I mean I do understand he has not had a skin in a while either but I mean it just seems like there were so many better candidates for one. Oh well I look forward to seeing how this turns out.  \n\nEdit: Got my first riot response ever :3 thanks agaIn for stopping by to clarify things KateyChaos, also saw the new skins up on pbe  and oh my goodness finally  new rammus, vayne, and xerath skins also happy skarner is getting skin love lately ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-24T23:20:09.131+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Tyrantking7,\n\nYou're right in that there are several champions who are in need of their next skin, and we're making our way to them! We can't release everything at once, but I can assure you, there's a lot more to come this year! \n\nIn regards to why another skin, his last skin was actually in 2012, which means it's been quite some time since the previous skin. Naturally, champions who have been around the longest e.g. Ashe, Annie or Warwick, will have more skins than newer champions. \n\nHope this clears things up a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"Basaren","date":"2015-03-25T02:46:57.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok :) thanks for the reply, cant wait to see how it turns out :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2015-03-24T23:24:10.996+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sigh, So it will have to all be done over again in a year or so...

They have even stated it multiple times. If you all want I can go back and directly quote them but to paraphrase. He has little in the therms of meaningful counterplay, he has little actual interaction that can be acted upon by his opponent, His kit causes frustration to both his opponent (cant do anything if he is winning) or frustration to his team (he loses and becomes a hindrance).\n\nTeemo is like many of the FAVORED few (Lee, Nid, Zed, Ori) who only receive love taps at best when they become a problem or their reworks don't even remotely solve the issues Riot states are the issues with the champion. Their actual reworks are put off repeatedly until people forget about them entirely or the champion becomes a menace once again. \n\nI know a lot of my down votes are because HAIL SATAN Teemo lovers but realistically he nor the game has changed to make his kit healthier for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Basaren","date":"2015-03-25T08:57:50.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he is still in need of some gameplay reworking  but again I doubt anything will come of it anytime soon as there are still heavy duty reworks (like Cho'gaths full model teardown VU and possible kit changes) taking up time for the respective teams working them.

After Astronaut Teemo was demoted to 1350, he no longer had a legendary skin.\n2.) Despite being the bane of player's existence, Teemo has NO SERIOUS SKIN to deliver on that.  They're all cutesy.\n3.) Skins are being worked on for many champions at once.  Just because it isn't being released right now doesn't mean it won't be.\n4.) The skin theme is actually kinda chilling.  This is a Teemo who's gone completely off the edge and has murdered / watched everyone he knew die.  It's a dark skin for a champion who's backstory flat-out says he's an unrepentant assassin.\n\nI'd be perfectly comfortable with this being Teemo's final skin.  He does have a lot of skins.  But this one fulfills an area that none of his other skins have delivered on: dark, gritty, creepy.  Basically the Satan Teemo skin that we've attributed to the rat for so long.","replies":[{"poster":"Basaren","date":"2015-03-24T21:30:43.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah like I said
