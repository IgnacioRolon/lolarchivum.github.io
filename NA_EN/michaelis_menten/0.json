Not even in this website page, which is why I am posting the discussion.\r\nHe tried to recover the password using email, he got the link send by riot, but when he clicked in it showed \"invalid request\".\r\nCan some one help us with the account issue?{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"CaptianBeetle","date":"2018-01-24T02:54:19.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny that I am seeing this post 4 months later.. I am the owner of this username. My account was hacked last year and some korean was playing on it without my knowledge. When I re-downloaded league to play with my friends again I found that, to my dismay, it was stolen. I promptly got my account back ( from your friend it seems ) . Either his step brother is the asshole who hacked my account, or he paid for my account from some person who did the hack. Sorry man. No, they can't steal my account again either. Cheers~ \n\n(sorry if I sound a bit salty here, but... you were using my stolen account so.. )","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-09T03:30:53.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straaaaange! I checked over the account's history and it looks like it had been compromised by someone who shouldn't have had access. The account has been repaired, and your friend might not be using the correct login information since the compromiser had them changed. Have your friend shoot us a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can verify and help him back into the account.","replies":[{"poster":"Michaelis Menten","date":"2017-10-09T03:37:56.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the reply, but there are some problem with verifying, cause my friends inherited this account from his step-brother, whose sign-up info he ppbly can't know.","replies":[]}]}]}
