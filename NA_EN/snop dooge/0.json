There're a lot of low economy jungle strategies that aren't super meta right now, but still can be effective.  Rammus goes through stages of this, and Nunu in my opinion always functions best this way.  There is definitely an amount of pressure you can create on the map that makes up for missing out on some of that income.  Most of that time, the pressure costs the enemy team an equal or greater amount of income (or at least a more valuable amount).  \n\nKeep doing what works for you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"HexaDecimel","date":"2016-08-17T00:53:13.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Sotere,\n\nI don't know if this would be your area, but I just played a warm up match in player vs AI. It honestly felt like the bots were broken. Their AI was way worse then usual and I have never seen them perform this badly. It seems like the AI for bot matches is seriously broken.\n\nI have played a lot of bot matches and never seen it this bad.\n\nWas something changed with the update today?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-08-17T01:24:49.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not intentionally.

Normally they are actually pretty good at landing abilities or running away when taking damage. One Ryze bot kept running into a group of enemy minions and dying. Several other players commented that they were acting really weird. Tristana kept using her rocket jump but wouldn't go anywhere. Just stuff like that.
