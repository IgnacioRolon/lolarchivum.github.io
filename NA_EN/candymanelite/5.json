Or do I have to redeem $20 and then $5?\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Phocets","date":"2017-09-23T01:04:20.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can do that option, but u won't get the same amount of rp as buying a $25 league game card. The league card gives u 3500 rp. However, using $20 subway would give u 2800 and $5 will be 650. If added correctly, it will be only 3450, or 50 rp short. So riot, PLEASE GIVE ME MY 50 RP THAT I SHOULD OF HAVE GOTTEN!!! IT'S NOT FAIR HOW WE PAID THE SAME PRICE BUT GOT LESS THAN WE DESERVED. WE ARE PAYING CUSTOMERS TOO!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T03:51:02.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeaaa it seems you'll need to make a charge for $20 and then a separate $5 if you're wanting to use up the total balance on that card.","replies":[{"poster":"candymanelite","date":"2017-08-30T03:52:03.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.
