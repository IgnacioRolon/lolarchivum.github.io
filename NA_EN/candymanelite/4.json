I was on the new client, already logged in, and then it said I had to reconnect for some reason when the internet was working fine. (FYI; I was not in a game, just at the home page). Ever since then, I couldn't login and this also happened when Camille came out so it may  or may not have a connection with it.\nBtw, the message it says is that \"An unexpected error occurred while logging in. Please try again. If this issue persists, contact support at support.riotgames.com\"\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"ajn1028","date":"2016-12-14T22:35:27.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah same I can't log into the new client either what is going on.
