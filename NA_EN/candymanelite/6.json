And even though I'm banned, I can still login and play so I was wondering if this was a bug of some sort. The message said:\n\nDue to the decision of the Player Behavior &amp; Justice, your account has been suspended for 2 weeks after this game.\n\nI really don't know why I got this ban cause I wasn't toxic and I have never been banned before. And if I did get banned can u tell me for what game(s) it's for.\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-30T04:40:10.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange, this account hasn't actually been banned or punished ever. It seems like a friend might have been playing a prank on you, and sent you some type of emote message. No worries though, this account is not banned/suspended, and you should be able to freely play games.","replies":[{"poster":"candymanelite","date":"2017-07-30T04:40:48.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.
