Honestly Juggeranuts shouldn't have mobility or much of it. That's the point of juggernauts of course. That aside, I will say that Darius was the best juggernaut rework of the 3 juggernauts. He doesn't have any gap closers in his kit so he pretty much has to walk up to everyone to get going but he now does a crap lot of damage even when building tank. This actually makes it very scary when he goes to flank and you're trying to back off but now Darius is behind you and his team in front of you. And now that Darius is actually a threat in teamfights people will be scared instead of just thinking \"eh Darius is too squishy, he'll just blow up\" or \"Darius does no damage, just ignore him\".

His Q's sustain is pretty equivalent to Trundle's Subjugate healing, only the sustain is increased when there are more enemies around. Also, he doesn't have the weakness of having to auto to get his sustain. I like to consider Trundle a balanced champion and in comparison Darius is not balanced right now.
