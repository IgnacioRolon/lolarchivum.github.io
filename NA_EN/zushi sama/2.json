Other games is fine.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing LOL since 2011 I'm not a 24/7 or 6-7hours of playing LOL. But this is the first time that this game for me is unplayable my normal ping is 250ms to 280ms the highest and the is 310+. But now I am at 290-310 ping and sudden 2k-5kms. Can't control my champ but everyone is moving I am just auto attacking. I think it's after the URF patch where is URF is removed or where they bring back URF mode. I can play other online games same ping but I don't hit 2k-5k. Even tho someone is watching or downloading I still can play LOL and other games fine but now the internet  all by myself 2k-5k ping. \n\nEven tho I have a lot of games I still and always play LOL but now it's totally unplayable for me. Or even if I'm stuck in Silver or Bronze LOL is life xD.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-12T22:05:00.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that ping is huge!  :(  It sounds like you might be having packet loss, but a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) can help us really know for sure.
