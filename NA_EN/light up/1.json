My ping is usually 19-30 but when I disconnect it just ends up at 500.  When this happens I make sure to exit out of my other tabs, and this usually happens a few times every game.  My computer does NOT do this normally, and only when I play league.  It's like as if my whole entire computer disconnects from the Wi-fi, but I feel like the issue is that League is causing it.  I can play other games (e.g _Overwatch_) fine without lag or d/c, just not league.  I feel like the new patch may have contributed to this, because it didn't happen prior to updating to 7.2 today.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-26T02:30:41.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since patches only change local files inside your League of Legends directory, they're *very unlikely* to affect your connection to our servers.
