Knowing match ups and rotations is huge.  And generally knowing the game is most beneficial. \n\nIf I was to chose, just being nice and not calling people out made the most impact. In my opinion whoever rages first has a higher chance of losing.  keep it cool is the best way to give yourself an advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-09-02T00:03:55.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see. thanks for stopping by and congrats :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-01T23:40:09.213+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who do you main/who did you play to climb?","replies":[{"poster":"Fluffie Muffins","date":"2015-09-01T23:41:39.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:60}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:56}}\n\nMostly - {{champion:56}} ","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-09-02T00:34:23.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure your muffins are fluffie?

And im still working on this today.\n\nPlaying a {{champion:64}}  specifically puts a time line on your game right away. What I have learned to adapt to is non stop ganking, and take full advantage of gank, either taking a dragon with it, a tower, or denying the other team a creep wave or so.  Everything gets your team ahead.\n\nAlso I try not to take all the kills for myself, even though I want to snowball to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shandrake","date":"2015-09-02T00:06:50.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pancakes or Waffles?","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-09-02T00:35:20.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waffles or Pancakes??","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-09-02T01:00:30.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not both?","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-09-09T02:39:36.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because that's too op.

When you think its best to take dragon now, and no one follows you and now you die and they get dragon ect ect....\n\nIf a team honestly doesnt respond to a call you want, typically you need to swallow a bit of your pride, and just dont do it.  Even though you  100% its the right call, if your team doesnt follow, it might not be the right call now.\n\nBeing a jungle main this is huge, and making sure people are on the same page as a gank, typically I will pre say something in chat ex. \"hey going top, follow me on this.\" of if im coming in really quickly, ill ping 2-3 times that im OMW (green ping) \n\nHope that helps, there is alot of situations were this occurs. and its one of the more frustrating problems.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DynasticMule","date":"2015-09-01T23:48:40.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is your play style/build with Nocturne?
