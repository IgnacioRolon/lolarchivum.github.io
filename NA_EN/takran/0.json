{"poster":"Takran","date":"2014-11-26T15:30:55.692+0000","title":"Have You Noticed the Pattern?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":328,"down_votes":44,"body":"I can't believe it took me until now to notice, but the last four champions added to the game have serious implications for League as we know it.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hoCDCW6.jpg\n\nGnar, Azir, Kalista, and now Rek'Sai each break some sort of design principal that developers have insisted we would ***never see under any circumstance, ever***.\n\nMechanics that we were told would break the game. Aesthetics that would drive away customers. Concepts that didn't belong in the game that league wanted to be. Look at this:\n\n**Gnar** - The champion's entire identity centers on a mechanic that is completely out of the player's control. Sure, they have input, and there is enough telegraph to call it random, but there is no direct control over his transformation. Getting poked while small, now you change. Taking CS for a while, now you change. Interacting with almost anything for some duration of time, you will change at some point, **willing or not**.  In the past, Riot has said that random chance, even with some mild influence is an unhealthy mechanic. Some people find this infuriating, but others love it. It adds an interesting new option for gameplay that is fun and refreshing that makes Gnar unique.\n\n**Azir** - Azir has to micro manage more than one unit and one pet. He can control the battlefield by simultaneously controlling himself and up to three soldiers. His entire kit rotates around this principal. Riot has stated that such a champion would be too confusing and too much like DotA to consider adding to the game. Azir is here now, and has a Shurima sized army of fans. \n\n**Kalista** - Riot has stated that they would never release a champion that could directly interact with another teammate's champion in a way that takes control from one player's hand. Kalista can grab an ally and take them with her at the push of a button, regardless of what that ally wants. There will be troll Kalistas out there, but the ones who take the champ seriously can make some of the most incredible plays I've ever seen. There is so much potential in this champion for greatness - just wait for competitive matches. Kalista will blow minds in the professional field, and be amazingly fun in the casual play when taken seriously.\n\n**Rek'Sai** - I'm sure everyone remembers Omen. This champ was scrapped before Riven's release for being too unrelatable, too generic, too strange, and overall too inhuman. The community at large *begged* Riot to reconsider scrapping Omen. The champion looked like the monster everyone wanted for so long, and was being deleted for being so. Fast forward to Zyra. Everyone was hyped for a female monster champion, and were greeted with a scantly clad women with a few leaves covering key points. While Zyra is a cool and interesting champion, people were outraged that male monsters could look as crazy as Cho'Gath, but female ones had to keep a human form. Riot placed the same argument as with Omen, and left it at that. Now though? Now we have a female monster that is as far as human as it can get. It doesn't speak...it growls. It doesn't have eyes. It's mouth can't make expressions. It's body looks so streamlined to kill, it can barely gesture. It is the most monster-y champion EVER, and it is a *she*. How cool is that!? It blows my mind, and I love every part of it.\n\nSo what does this all mean? Riot is finally becoming open minded to more interesting champion design. With well over 100 champions now that follow the \"easy to learn, hard to master\" gameplay, and \"relatable humanoid\" aesthetic, they are finally branching out and making more interesting characters. Characters that are hard to pick up on your first attempt. Characters that you don't understand their entirety at a glance. Characters that aren't typical shapes and sizes. \n\n***This is the best thing to happen to league in ages.***\n\nAlmost every fundamental design rule Riot has set up has been broken. The only one I can think of is \"no invoker style champions that fuze abilities\", and at the rate that rules are being broken, this could happen VERY soon. This means that old precedents are gone. The sky is the limit. ***anything is possible***. This has been what I have dreamed about for league since season one, and it is finally happening.\n\nRiot, I just have to say: Well done. Your champ designers have been on point lately. This is what the game needed, and I look forward to seeing where things go from here.\n\nEDIT: I've been away a while, and am surprised and happy to see this is still going. Tham Krench really impressed me with an ability that interacted directly with allies the way it does!  Plus all the wonderful shenanigans with Gangplank's rework were phenomenal. Riot is still rocking, and I am still thoroughly impressed!","replies":[{"poster":"Visys","date":"2014-11-26T15:40:30.302+0000","up_votes":203,"down_votes":6,"body":"For some reason I expected this to be a complaint thread..\n\nGlad I was wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"The Epicer ONe","date":"2014-11-26T16:57:51.669+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":1,"body":"not for some reason, ***EVERY*** thread is a complaint thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FluxBound","date":"2014-11-26T18:36:26.696+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"I expected it to be iluminati {{champion:161}} {{item:3078}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Takran","date":"2014-11-26T22:08:23.531+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh, you \"expected\", did you?\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UVNcrGx.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlÃ«k","date":"2014-11-26T20:00:47.712+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> For some reason I expected this to be a complaint thread..\n> \n> Glad I was wrong.\n\n^^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Slime Appears","date":"2014-11-26T23:14:44.991+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":91,"body":"Everyone jizzing their pants over a female monster make me sick.

I've been playing since barely post beta '09 with the new champs on the block was Ezreal{{champion:81}}  and Shen{{champion:98}} . I've seen the release of nearly 80 champions now. In the beginning I was able to somehow relate each champ{{champion:114}}  to being sort of like x champ{{champion:11}}  while having y in common with z champ{{champion:5}}  as well.  While not all champions were directly relate-able not many brought much more depth. Over the last 2 years the quality of champions has grown exponentially.  With the most recent champions all having game changing mechanics makes them both strong in their own unique way and extremely fun or a challenge to face. I love Azir{{champion:268}}  and Gnar{{champion:150}}  I will be trying Rek'sai much more shortly on my pbe account. As for Kalista, while she is really awesome I've never been the biggest fan of adc's. Although I love the ability to make plays with her ult and the fun little things in her kit i like sending out the little mobile ward ghosts. However I can not compliment the champ design team enough on these recent champs ( Jayce till now being recent in my book for this anology) .","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-11-26T16:24:16.608+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":14,"body":"> Azir - Azir has to micro manage more than one unit and one pet.\n\nYou sir, have no idea what micromanaging is.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2014-11-26T17:45:40.488+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":2,"body":"> > Azir - Azir has to micro manage more than one unit and one pet.\n> \n> You sir, have no idea what micromanaging is.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n> In business management, micromanagement is a management style whereby a manager closely observes or controls the work of subordinates or employees  \n\n\nYou know what this means...\n\nCORPORATE AZIR WHERe?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2014-11-26T21:00:20.319+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Azir's the closest thing we really have to true micro in League at this point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2014-11-27T01:59:27.896+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also speaks to the fact that Riot is becoming more creative.

At all.\n\nCass's new passive goes against her characterization (even in the new lore). It breeds a bad play pattern for a mid-laner (going to help bot in a gank could easily be worth less to her overall power compared to staying and farming, even though it could help her team immensely). \n\nAnd to top it all off, Stashu himself said her playstyle was better served by Brand, which is laughable to the point were I suspect some players want to see his credentials. Brand may have DoT, but his kit and optimal use paradigm is a burst mage. Cass however WAS a DoT mage.\n\nStashu and Riot changed her because she is much easier to balance this way. With so many \"levers\" in place, they can easily tell how powerful she'll be at any point in the game, which by and large can be answered with \"about as threatening as an outer turret is lategame\" for most of play.\n\nHe wants her to be a lategame hyper carry, but fails to realzie the one thing all the hyper carries have: mobility. Ryze is the only odd man out in the group without a jump, stealth, teleport, or dash, and he at least has his MS boost on a click AND has targeted hard CC. Cass has to hit with her Q (a delayed 75 unit AoE) to move faster, place a miasma pool and wish she was facing someone who didn't have a jump, or land an ult with the enemy facing her.\n\nShe doesn't have the invulnerable, heal, and dash of Trynd.\nShe doesn't have the untargetable and dash of Fiora.\nShe doesn't have the untargetable, heal, and Slow immunity of Yi.\nShe doesn't have the range and safety of Trist.\nShe doesn't have the tank shredding, invisibility, and reliable knockback of Vayne.\nShe doesn't have the stealth, range, and multitarget kill potential of Twitch.\nShe doesn't have the safety and self peel of Jinx.\nShe doesn't have the Dodge, jump, and bonus stats of Jax (hyper carry is iffy on him these days).\nShe doesn't have the insane mobility, safety, and teamfight potential of Yasuo (safety is shield and windwall).\nShe doesn't have the tank and reliable CC of Ryze (tank from item buys).\n\nAll Stashu has given her to claim she's a hyper carry is a scaling passive that eventually makes her a little stronger than she was earlier in the match, and gives her a decent heal on her most hated power. He took the DoT mage people loved, and turned her into a wanna-be Marksman without the target agnosticty that comes with them.\n\nYou know who wants to keep hitting their target until they're dead because they're worried about ability resets?\n\nAssassins (and Trist, though she works off assists as well).\n\nThat's her problem.

We don't *want* to be OOM, so we'll take the E mana return, but it's not something we wanted to have to rely on. We want *less* focus to be on her E, not more. \n\nWe tried to tell him that stacking is not what we want. We even offered suggestions to make the stacking less about reaching thresholds and more about gradual progression--humoring him--and he ignored them entirely and made the stacking even *less* fun and *more* about tedious waiting. \n\nWe tried to tell him a lot of things and he has spat in our faces. He does not deserve to work on Cass any longer. He failed, he continues to fail and he does not deserve a fourth chance.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2014-11-27T04:54:21.489+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Perhaps if you put someone on the rework team who actually cared about the champion they reworked and didn't just have a fetish for needless complexity and pitiful ratios, and who actually talked with the people, I dunno, playing this game, there wouldn't be a festering resentment against him.\n\nJust a thought.","replies":[]},{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2014-11-27T03:48:43.037+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main issue being ignored is what is frustrating people.
