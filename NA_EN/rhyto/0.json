This message appears when your connection to PvP.net becomes unstable.  This can either be due to problems with the connection itself, or possibly even Packet Loss.  Most commonly, I have seen players with active IPv6 connections cause this error to occur.  To that end, I strongly recommend that you disable your IPv6 connection (which is automatically enabled with most Windows Operating Systems) which you can do here:\n\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852 \n\nIf you are still experiencing issues, even after disabling your IPv6, make sure to try all of the steps in the following Knowledge Base Article, which is common solutions to connection issues and League of Legends:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/21696815\n\nIf you are still slamming your head against your desk and are unable to resolve this issue, then do not give up hope quite yet, and make sure that you submit a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to us here in Player Support so that we can continue to assist you!

I have concerns about the IPv6 being disabled as it is a protocol will it affect my computer in anyway other than just resolving the connection to LoL?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-02-06T19:12:05.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cannot say with 100% certainty that it will resolve your issue, but it has been a common trend in resolutions with this type of issue.  Beyond that however, disabling your IPv6 connection will not negatively affect your connection in any way. Let me try to explain this connection further:\n\nThere are two primary types of connections used in order to access servers or websites:  IPv4 and IPv6 connections.  The overwhelming majority of these websites and servers use IPv4 connections as their primary type of connection.  However, since IPv6 is a relatively \"new\" connection, not too many places use this connection as its primary connection.  However, even if they do, they also allow IPv4 connections as well, and therefore there is no risk in not having an IPv6 connection active.  \n\nBy disabling this connection, you are not permanently disabling this connection, but simply turning it off to see if it resolves your issue with League of Legends.  I hope this helps explains things a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"Rhyto","date":"2014-02-07T16:44:50.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It certainly does I did some research and that IPv4 runs on a 32 character system for IP Addresses in which plenty of IP Addresses around the world could take a slot and fill in. But with the rise of millions of PCs Microsoft and other computer companies were forced to make sub IPv4s until now with the new IPv6 to relieve the stress of making space for new IP Addresses. I got the gist of it thank you and I'll check it out and reply back ASAP.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
