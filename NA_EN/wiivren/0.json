It can make the world feel small (and too modern if everywhere is 'explored'), it can limit options for dramatically new additions (like a new continent or four - see Warcraft's ever-expanding world map), it implies that the majority of characters have access to that information too - and lessens the impact of well traveled characters like Gangplank, Ryze, or Taliyah.\n\nYou could argue (and several have) that all of those are manageable issues, or perception problems rather than unfixable issues, but even so they're just a couple more grains on the side of the scale _against_ throwing lots of resources into a player facing world map just now.\n\nSmaller, more personalized maps, are an easier route - they don't suffer many of the issues listed, as well as helping  to deepen our understanding of the character or society that created the map.  The scales more easily tip in our favor :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-02-06T20:26:50.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We already know way more about the world than anyone else does by virtue of knowing that Bard, Asol, Kindred, and Tahm all actually exist.

This is a really bad thing for fiction; how are we supposed to hold an informed opinion on a fictional subject if all we get is designed to make one side look better?\n\nI _could_ argue that every piece of information (except perhaps mathematics) contains bias - even if that bias is often unintentional, innocent, or harmless.  You've seen that even Google Maps has [different country borders](https://qz.com/224821/see-how-borders-change-on-google-maps-depending-on-where-you-view-them/) depending on where in the world you access it from?  Because even the edge of a border, or the ownership of an island, is fraught with political meaning and bias.\n\nHowever, I concede that it's a weak argument.  A photograph of the planet, unmodified and raw, is very hard to find the bias in - and we could indeed release something like that - but it would fall prey to the other issues of restricting our future options, making the world feel small (blue marble like) etc.\n\nPersonally - and you're _very_ free to disagree with me here - I find the biases to be highly informative.  That Jago didn't bother to label some of the ports doesn't help us acquire perfect knowledge of the geography of the planet - but it does tell us how important those places are to him and his business.  That the Shuriman tablet doesn't conform to a linear scale is a pain in the ass for people who want to know its square kilometer area in comparison to Noxus, but suggests that they thought in more relativistic terms than absolute - which could be insight to their thought processes.\n\nYou'd not get either of those things from a satellite photograph, instead getting cold hard facts.  To be clear - I totally get it if this pisses you off.  They're both valid directions and at the moment, we're going with the cultural bias one.\n\nAs for your last question - \n\n> how are we supposed to hold an informed opinion on a fictional subject if all we get is designed to make one side look better?\n\nThe same way any historian does - by reading between the lines, by applying what you know of the culture and biases, and by finding multiple (equally biased) sources to compare and dig the truth out of.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-02-06T21:34:35.510+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the biases too.

But because of it being only a sketch which Gangplank draw or plundered it from someone at some point, we don´t know if everything on it is true and if there aren´t regions which they didn´t explore yet.\n\n For Gangplank I could think of that he has a map which is more accurate at coast regions near Bilgewater and gets less accurate the more it goes away from it. To a point where it´s unfinished and doesn´t have regions like Demacia or Noxus in it, but more of Isles like the Shadow Islands or Ionia.\n\nIt would give us as players more insight but doesn´t tell us to much. And if there would be a chance in the future it would be good to see it. (Maybe the Piltover/Zaun map tried to accomplish this goal, but for me it was to much zoomed in or confusing, because me trying to compare the old map with this map).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-02-06T21:32:46.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">A photograph of the planet, unmodified and raw, is very hard to find the bias in - and we could indeed release something like that - but it would fall prey to the other issues of restricting our future options, making the world feel small (blue marble like) etc.\n\nRiot hasn't exactly had any problems with changing things because it restricted their future options, and I feel that the current state of lore has made the world feel very small. I don't see how either of these would preclude releasing a 'bird's eye view' map. \n\n>Personally - and you're very free to disagree with me here - I find the biases to be highly informative.

(Plus, the second one could just be a shitty mapmaker.) We don't know if Jago is typical of his nation or business in terms of biases, so all we know from the first map is 'this is what this one particular person cares about'.\n\n>The same way any historian does - by reading between the lines, by applying what you know of the culture and biases, and by finding multiple (equally biased) sources to compare and dig the truth out of.\n\nAnd if we had multiple, equally biased sources, or if we knew a lot about every culture, that'd probably make me feel better.\n\nYes, I understand that we're still in the early stages of new lore. Those future equally biased sources and cultural information will probably come in time. But we don't have them now. And I'm really tired of waiting for lore.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-02-06T19:17:59.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bio! What have you been up to?
