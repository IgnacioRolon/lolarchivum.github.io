I played on a 3yr old pc until about 2 months ago when i decided to go out and buy a new one ( since the one i was using had next to no life left in it), and after i got league on the new one I got to run the game much better than i was used to. After the 7.4 patch however, the game quality has sunk. My usual 160+ fps has shot down to 20-30. The ping is not affected, it maintains a solid 50 so i do not think the issue is there. I have also adjusted settings several different ways both in game and on my pc in order to remedy the issue, but nothing gives. I notice that others have posted on similar issues, and just wanted to throw my voice into the fray too. Fix this as soon as possible, the elo grind waits for no one :){{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}  Thanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Laximov","date":"2017-03-04T23:31:15.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same thing yet I reinstalled by OS followed there trouble shot guide still getting bad frames.

Most framerate issues happen as a result of display driver problems or a bad windows power setting configuration. We've consolidated the most common resolutions for this in our [**framerate troubleshooting guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting), so I strongly recommend working through those steps.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
