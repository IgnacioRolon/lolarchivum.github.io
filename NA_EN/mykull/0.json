This, in concordance with her personality make her seem very classy and high tech, which as a sniper I feel is very important. The hat is fantastic though, and also quite defining.\n\nB) I feel that a woman of her position should be more... modestly dressed. I do not particularly object to more skin showing on most females, admittedly, but Caitlyn lends herself an air of officiality, poise, and class, which her outfit doesn't accurately portray. \n\nC)A good example of something more to this ideal is this.\n\nhttp://xelandra.deviantart.com/art/LoL-Caitlyn-Redesign-391316429\n\nHowever I would also very much like to see her keep her hat.\n\nD) I would dislike seeing her remain the same, or going along the lines of her 'Officer' skin, which is just completely out of character to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Risurin","date":"2014-02-17T15:27:41.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[](http://i.imgur.com/PSwiRhL.jpg)\n\nhere the version with a tophat. might like it better :) {{champion:51}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maerala","date":"2014-02-17T11:47:06.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you read her lore, you learn that Caitlyn's mother was a scientist in Piltover who apparently decked her out in awesome hextech gear so she'd be safe while crimefighting. We see none of that in current Caitlyn, and it's probably something that her VU should cover.\n\nI echo the sentiment that she's definitely not dressed in a way that reflects her position/lore. Revealing outfits make sense for certain champions, like Miss Fortune and maybe Janna, but they're very forced on women like Caitlyn and Akali and Ashe.\n\nI personally don't care for the hat, but her fanbase seems to be very attached to it so it's likely to stay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-02-17T07:31:18.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Copy pasta from the other thread, but oh well.\n\n\nMy thoughts are generally along the lines of http://xelandra.deviantart.com/art/LoL-Caitlyn-Redesign-391316429, but the hat and current weapon, stupid as they are, are non-negotiable. I still miss Karma's fans, I will not lose Cait's hat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thanotos Omega","date":"2014-02-17T12:21:14.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**♦ What makes Caitlyn... Caitlyn?**\n\nFor me she is defined as a Woman of strength elegance and Class, \n\n**♦ What seems unnecessary?**\n\nFor me it's her overly revealing outfit, Caitlyn is with out a doubt one of the most mature woman in the game, but she looks like a teenager at a cosplay convention, Her hair is also an issue, a sniper would never have so much loose hai that could get in the way.\n\n**♦ What direction would you like to see Caitlyn go?**\n\nA more Suit like appearance that better reflects her no nonsense personality, Like a combination of Sherlock Homes and a Victorian era Military uniform,\n\nI would also like her hat to be more realistically proportioned, and for the lenses, To be shrunk as well, and stored in a less clumsy manner, Maybe folding down along her jaw line instead of off to the side  \n\nAnd lastly, Her hair needs to be restrained somehow, Maybe a pony tail, Or some nifty straps on one side of her out fit she can use to hold it down,\n\n**♦ What would you like to avoid?**\n\nWhile i am not a huge fan, her hat is to ingrained to be removed,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limakoko808","date":"2014-02-17T07:39:46.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man if the parrot posts here but not mines here http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/c/miscellaneous/ZiNiHLGK-ironstylus-regarding-caitlyn-vu\nThat would be the ultimate disrespect lol","replies":[]}]}
