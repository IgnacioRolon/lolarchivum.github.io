It's not entirely uncommon for someone's network to be able to contact Google just fine but have issues contacting other specific servers. \n\nIf you're still having problems getting logged in or playing games, troubleshoot your current network settings to see if anything might be out of place by following this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). I know you said your network is fine, but it's hard to know where the problem lies without doing some general troubleshooting first. Run through those steps, and let me know how it goes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ihtisham","date":"2017-10-01T20:45:16.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me :(, Except I was in my promos for silver.","replies":[]}]}
