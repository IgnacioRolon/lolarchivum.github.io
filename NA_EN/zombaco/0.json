It froze. I thought, my it is taking a while, only to realize that it was my client that was frozen. It is not my computer's fault, as this has only happened on league. I tried to close the client, but it would not allow me to minimize or alt + f4 the screen, so I had to log off, then log back in to my computer. Once I logged back into league, I lost 16 lp because within that time, my team remade the game.\n\nTlDr; The client froze and I'm salty that I lost 16 lp because the game has bugs. Please fix.","replies":[{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2019-09-20T19:57:11.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I love the new client, and so far I  have not encountered any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombaco","date":"2019-09-21T15:18:48.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't get me wrong, I love the new design, just hate the bugs it currently has.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-20T19:45:43.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens to me sometimes on one of the computers I use to play LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Belle Sauvage","date":"2019-09-20T19:58:15.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also sorry that happened to you and you lost LP, that sucks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2019-09-20T19:08:53.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"old news","replies":[]}]}
