Why does it need to be avoided like this? What makes infinite scrolling so superior?\n\nAlso, how are you going to address really old topics? Let's say I read a topic(or even worse, only noticed a topic title) and later wished to find it again, but to my dismay it has moved off of the front page. Now depending on the speed of the board and/or the length of time since I last saw the topic, I could be scrolling for a long time till I find it. But with paging, I can roughly guesstimate the approximate speed to time ratio and select a page to jump to to begin my search for the topic (yes, I have actually done this many times)\n\nAnd before you bring up the search engine, either A) I don't remember enough of the topic for an adequate search (my memory is very visual centric, even if I don't remember the words themselves, the moment I see them I can remember it) or B) I have already used the search engine and there are a ton of results I need to sift through. Either way, being able to jump to a mid-point really helps save time by cutting out a large chunk of content I don't need to sift through to find what I need. But with infinite scrolling, it's just tedious and inefficient.\n\nTho, I will say, I appreciate that you chose not to automate the infinite scrolling, that's the type I hate the most (I like being able to actually scroll to the bottom of my screen)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-10-08T00:01:23.481+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"Infinite scrolling solves a lot of problems that existed with pagination but introduced new issues at the same time. \n\nInfinite scroll as implemented across most of the web is less than desirable and often leads to a lack of 'anchoring' (feeling and knowing your current location within the page).
