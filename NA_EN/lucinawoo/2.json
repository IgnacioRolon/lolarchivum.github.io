Then it exited me out of my client and now i cannot even log into my league account because it is taking a super long time to authenticating my login.I have no idea why this happen or why it is taking a long time to login, but i am sad that i will probably be reported for leaving afk even though it was out of my control","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T15:39:10.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may have been due to ISP issues last night.
