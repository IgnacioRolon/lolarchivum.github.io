I bet that double didn't help either. I would take I feeding janna over him anyday, amiright?\n\nSeems like typical meta thumping elitism to me. No shit people are going to make bad plays, and miss hooks. Everyone does. Don't tell me you have never missed an ezreal or Jinx ulti? You never missed that Q?\n\nJust because it is diamond doesn't mean people are going to make mistakes.\n\nI don't really understand the message of this video? All I saw was \"hurr I still have to carry some games even in diamond! look at all these missed hooks! look at this off meta pick!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-03-19T08:21:50.913+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Look, a prick.","replies":[]}]}
