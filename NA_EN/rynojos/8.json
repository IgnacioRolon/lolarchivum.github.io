I got released from honor lock about 2 weeks after I got released from the ban. In the meantime, I've played maybe 300 games since, and I haven't even shown signs of progression. And, its been about 2 months since I got released from the honor lock. Why aren't I progressing my honor AT ALL? I've seen other people get a 2 week ban and drop to honor 0 and get back in 100 games and 20 days to honor 1. PLZ HELP ME RITO! Am I even progressing? I've been positive this whole time... I've even been reporting the toxic people and sometimes getting the \"the person you reported...gotten punishment...\" thing.. Plz help.\r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T03:08:23.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While your honor is currently unlocked and you *are* progressing at the normal rate, there are still a few instances where you've toed the line towards being toxic.
