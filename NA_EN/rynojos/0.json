About a week ago, my honor was unlocked. After, ive been pumping out tons of games, and ive been getting a few honors from them. I haven't been toxic and I have been encouraging to keep trying and go for the win. But, i feel my honor level isnt progressing. Is it?\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-25T17:56:04.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your honor will continue to grow, even if you don't receive any for that match.
