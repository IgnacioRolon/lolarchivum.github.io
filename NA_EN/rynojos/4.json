About a month and 2 weeks ago (roughly), I got a 14 day suspension. After, I feel I learned my lesson. So, I have been jus pumping out games. After about 2 weeks of the suspension being over, my honor got unlocked. I have been playing as many games as possible and getting some honors (not a crazy amount). Is pumping out games the only way to level honor up, or is there an algorithm like 1 honor per game for 10 games in a row or something? I'm hoping I can at least level up to honor one by the end of the season. And, if I do get to honor 3, would I get the end of season rewards? Thanks for reading this! Reply if you know anything (plz rito notice me and reply)! Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-25T15:30:18.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't any algorithm that I\"m aware of to increase your honor level faster, other than simply receiving honors.  Just keep playing normally and honorably, and the level ups will come in time!  We do have a[ rewards article ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011781068)regarding this season's ranked eligibility, and it doesn't look like Honor level is a requirement.
