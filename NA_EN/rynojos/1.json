I've played close to 200 games since I got unbanned, and 175 games (more or less) since my honor got unlocked. Why haven't I leveled up my honor? I've been getting lots of honors and I haven't been toxic. So..... why haven't I leveled up?\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"49247830DEL1","date":"2017-09-11T00:58:02.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a lie. We've been abandoned. I'm pretty sure we're locked out of honor until s8. We'll have to lick 3-mans' boots to not get reported 3 times and auto restricted. I've stopped trusting rioters' word because they give us nothing but inspirational mottos while we sit and wait for season to end and be locked out of the rewards we earned for being better at the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leyin","date":"2017-09-09T16:48:14.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it will take time to get back to your old honor level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-09T22:10:18.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, it's just a matter of time!
