I played a decent amount of games in the past month after my 2 week ban (around 66 since my honor got unlocked), and Broporo told me this:\r\n\r\nI've checked over your match history and recent honor changes, and it does look like it's taking a bit longer than usual but you ARE getting that honor exp. It might be a little slow if you've been getting honored by premades, which don't give you quite as much as being honored by a random teammate.\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering a few things: \r\n**1. If I honor randoms over premades would I be getting more honor (regardless if they honor me back or not)\r\n2. Is there any way I can be told if I am close to honor 1 :3\r\n3. What are methods to regain the regular speed of honor xp gain?**\r\n\r\nThank you soooo much for responding to this (if you do at least :P)! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T03:46:40.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyyy look who it is! Good to see ya again. I'll go through these one by one for ya...\n\n- **1**: Honoring other people doesn't get you more honor I don't believe, but you *do* get a little boost if everyone honors someone\n- **2**: Unfortunately I don't have this info tbh\n- **3**: The best ways to rank up quicker is to make sure everyone is honoring someone to get that extra little boost, and remember that random teammate honors should be giving more than if someone on your premade honored you.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-08-30T15:02:12.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3.Is the same thing applied to random teamates i met more times?
