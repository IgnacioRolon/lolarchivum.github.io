Do reports against you drop your honor and if so, does it if you do nothing wrong and if is a false accusation?\r\n\r\n2.  Does reporting others drop your honor? Lately there have been more toxic people than normal.\r\n\r\n3. Does successfully reporting someone and getting the \"thank you for helping keep the community clean\" message give any reward like extra honor? I've been getting more lately :)\r\n\r\n4. Has my account been reported? Lately I've seen an influx in toxicity, and some people report teams for \"being bad.\"\r\n\r\nThank you VERY MUCH for responding!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T15:23:31.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!  Reports don't impact your honor.  A behavioral incident provided by the[ instant feedback system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) would drop your honor level, though.  The act of reporting itself or being reported won't do anything with your honor, unless it leads to a penalty.\n\nReceiving a prompt that someone you reported received a penalty also does not impact your honor.  We wouldn't be able to offer your report history, but you should be able to grab it on the [privacy page ](https://privacy.riotgames.com/en_US/)for a small fee.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
