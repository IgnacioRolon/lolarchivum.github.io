This may give more insight as to what could be going wrong. As for the message you're seeing, can you go into more detail about what it says?

Typically when the client suddenly disappears, it's because there was a sudden and complete disconnection from PvP.net or the Maestro service. When this happens, it can cause connection error messages or even crash your client entirely. Disconnections are most often caused by an unstable or poor connection to the servers, so I recommend taking a look at our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to resolve this.\n\nLet me know if that caused any change for you.","replies":[{"poster":"OldEnderCookie","date":"2016-08-03T18:37:03.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the help it was finally fixed i think it might of been a firewall problem since when i updated my firewall even though it said it was up to date it started working, but still thank you so much for the help {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
