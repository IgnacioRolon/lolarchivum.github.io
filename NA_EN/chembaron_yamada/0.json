Consider that skins are supposed to be parallel universes.\nYes, Bewitching Tristana summoned Little Devil Teemo. And maybe (we don't know yet), Little Devil Teemo and Little Demon Tristana live in the same universe.\n\nHere is the thing now: They are summoned and we never got a statement how this works. Maybe the demons which the witches summon are beings from another dimension? It is entirely possible that Tristana could then summon her demonic self from another dimension. Easy to explain.\n\nI just thought that Little Demon looked the best of these and being an impish demon fits Tristana both visually and personality-wise.","replies":[{"poster":"Jackin ur lawn","date":"2019-03-20T13:19:36.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the majority of people wanted it because they presented the idea, they could have easily put something else there instead.
