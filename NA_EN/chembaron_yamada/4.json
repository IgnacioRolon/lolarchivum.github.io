However Mundo makes a decent Muscle or OG Nomu. But back to Galio then you also give Sylas an All for One skin since he his main power is to steal other people's abilities,he hates Galio because he sees him as this symbol/monument of ignorance,plus Riot can make fun of all the people who criticized Sylas' healthy look for a prisoner as \"Oh he has a quirk for that which makes him look good.\" and they both have a connection to Lux who in this timeline can be Galio's mentor who Sylas kills plus she has a quote about about smiling so you can be the light. Then you give Poppy a Deku/Trainee skin since parts of her thing is she's destined to be the greatest Hero of Demacia and her kit is similar to Galio's plus they both have the word smash in either most of quotes,their moves, or (I checked for Poppy) their move descriptions plus Poppy gushes about heroes in most of her quotes and they can bring back the buddy thing between her and Galio who in their old lore sees this small thing not giving up and gets inspired to act.

But the teaser said \"Battle **Club**, Engineer **Club**\" which sounds more like they are all members of the same school, but representing different clubs with different foci there. I think they will all share the name \"Battle Academy\", since they go to the same school, but still represent different clubs.
