They own the title of the safest bank in whole Runeterra, almost never someone managed to break in here.\n\nAlmost never? Well, there is a well known lunatic who managed to do the unbelievable.\n{{champion:222}} \n\nLike many of us may know, Jinx managed to intrude the vaults and caused mayhem. She was playing tag with the Piltover enforcer, but Vi was not able to catch her. To add insult, Jinx didn&#039;t even steal anything. Breaking in the best secured bank of the world was just a fun challenge for her.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nAfter this accident, Piltover probably rebuilt the Ecliptic Vaults. And this is the major point I want to talk about: which consequences did this event have?\nThey have a title to defend, this bank is claiming to be practically unbreakable, yet a crazy girl (with, admitted, impressive weapon arsenal) managed to bring disgrace to them.\n\nThey should increase their security standards and keep in mind that we talk about a society which heavily relies on hextech.\n\nI want to know more about this place. How are people working there to protect the bank after Jinx&#039; attack?\nMaybe it gives opportunity for another champion from Piltover, someone with an hextech device trained to protect the treasury?\n\nEkko built a device controlling time.\nHow about hextech devices able to control space?\nImagine a vault with no openings whatsoever. The only way to get into it is using that specific hextech device which is able to create special doors at any given place?\n\n______________________________________\n\nAm I the only one fascinated by this place?\nWould the community like to know more about the vaults?\nPlease tell me in the comments.\n\nBut if there are other special places you would like to discover in Runeterra, please tell me in the comments as well.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2017-11-27T11:37:15.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not sure if I'm remembering correctly or not but didn't both Graves and TF once break into the same bank?","replies":[{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2017-11-27T11:39:18.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think so.

It might&#x27;ve been another Piltover bank though.\n\nThat was the Clockwork Vault, not the Ecliptic Vault.  Probably a less prestigious vault/bank seeing as it's not as famous :)\n\n>In Piltover, they hold the distinction of being the only thieves ever to crack the supposedly impenetrable Clockwork Vault. Not only did the two empty the vault of its treasures, but they tricked its guards into loading it onto their hijacked cargo ship. Only once the pair were over the horizon was the theft discovered, along with Fate’s trademark playing card.\n\nAlso, that was quite a few years ago, before Graves went in the slammer.  It's possible that while they cracked the 'supposedly impenetrable' Clockwork Vault, other criminals have done so since once Graves and TF proved it could be done.","replies":[{"poster":"JooshBox","date":"2017-11-27T16:56:56.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey quick question, are Graves and TF still on their way to Piltover?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-11-27T17:00:55.777+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AutumnLeafJoshua,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=NdLEU9Fw,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2017-11-27T16:56:56.490+0000)\n>\n> Hey quick question, are Graves and TF still on their way to Piltover?\n\nI'd say yes, unless something unexpected happens!","replies":[{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2017-11-27T21:20:46.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=NdLEU9Fw,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2017-11-27T17:00:55.777+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d say yes, unless something unexpected happens!\n\nNoxus {{sticker:katarina-love}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-11-27T22:05:04.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreatDevouer,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=NdLEU9Fw,comment-id=000000000001000000000002,timestamp=2017-11-27T21:20:46.522+0000)\n>\n> Noxus {{sticker:katarina-love}}\n\nCan you reeeeeeeeally say it's _unexpected_, if it's Noxus?
