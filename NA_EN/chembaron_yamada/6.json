That's like half an AA, if anything. And it doesn't get much better later in the game. You invest heavily in bonus health and the shield still just represents a really small part of your health. As defense, it is absolutely meaningless and its only purpose now is offensively using it to trigger your passive.\nUnfortunately, we got told that they won't put power back into his shield... But I think he could use some more defense again, since he is supposed to be a juggernaut.\n\nIn my opinion, the problem is reliability. Juggernauts are supposed to be beefy and deal huge, yet unreliable damage. With the changes to his Q and R in the past, making them way more reliable, I think this didn't hold true anymore. They could have put a higher delay on Q again and take away some of the prjectile speed from the R.\n{{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-02-25T02:32:48.798+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is what happens when people cry for Urgot nerfs just because a few pros did decently with him.
