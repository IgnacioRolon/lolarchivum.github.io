AoE rockets would of been a BLAST to watch.\r\n\r\nand definitely great job on Dyrus for defending waves and waves of super minions on top. the pressure on landing that perfect rumble ult into Cass/J4 locks just couldnt happen as they had planned. but great job TSM. definitely a great game.\r\n\r\nand congrats to Team Liquid !\r\nwhat a day to defeat the top NA team. great job stalling and taking it slow.\r\ni can tell TL was working cautiously towards the last 15mins of the game. that PENTA on Turtle definitely left its mark.\r\n\r\nwhew. what a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-02-24T20:53:58.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First 30 minutes. TSM gets stomped. Dyrus played horribly and Turtle/Lust were pushed around.\nLast 15-25 minutes. TSM got their shit together and Liquid played like SoloQ.\n\nThe game was entertaining to say the least, technical/skillwise it could have been way better.","replies":[]}]}
