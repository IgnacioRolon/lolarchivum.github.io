The community should not have to wait for months and or a year to rid themselves of these types of players. Chat bans do nothing why are we chat banning players who infraction is not abusing chat, but simply refusing to play and purposefully trying to lose people games?\r\n\r\nWhy is there not a special report system for these cases to be escalated to for priority review and this player banned from playing ranked for season 5?","replies":[]}
