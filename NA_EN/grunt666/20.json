New players have no chance to learn the game, I have played with many new people this year and every game it was pretty obvious they were the only &quot;truly&quot; new players in every match, was very rare to see an actual new player besides my friends.\r\n\r\nWeakest player decides the match - Yup and re enforcing the carry role only makes it worse, what your team fails to understand is that the weaker player on your team ENABLES the carry role on the other team. You dont need to strengthen the carry role, you need to lessen the &quot;feeder&quot; role. Look you might be much better than me, but if i am smart enough to play safe you simply wont pop off to carry a game meanwhile on my team another player just as good as you is laning against some careless feeder who empowers them to carry the game, the only difference is the fact player A laned against someone who did not enable them, meanwhile player B was turned into a monster because he laned against feeder, aka the carry role is created and a function of the team with the worst player making the carry strong only doubles down on the weakest player having the most impact.\r\n\r\nRanked fix - We dont need icons, and rewards. We need  a reliable rankin g system that might actually place players in their proper skill range. Rank per role is a step forward i&#039;ll agree, but if the core ranking mechanics are bad nothing will change, you will just have meaningless invalid role ranks as well. What needs to change is rewarding everyone (individuals) equally based on a simply metric of win or lost as a team. The net result is a fairly meaningless ranking system the rule of large numbers rarely comes into effect unless the skill gap is huge yet eventually the challengers will rise, but the gold 1 might never rise from gold 5. What needs to change is that your individual performance determines the LP gain or loss for each match to some degree. We already have the grading system to indicate which players performed as what level relative to the teams. Refine it use it.  \r\n\r\nIf I got 0/12/2 but happen to be on the better team and all my teammates go 12/2/12 why should I receive the same reward for the win when clearly I did the least and most likely do not deserve to climb eqwually with the more skilled players on my team? Making a change like this might also have a benificial side effect to all the passive agresssive quitters that ruin every match. I lost my lane WE LOSE THE GAME TEAM doesnt matter that every other lane won even hardere than that player lost.... Now with this you can incentive players to keep trying the entire match. &quot;Hey look i dont want to lose more LP than necessary i will try my best to turn this game to a win. I cant tell you how many times I play a match and someone stops playing after they die 1-3 times. They dont afk because that is reportable they literally just stop playing those sit alone somewhere hitting creeps until the game is over, and the silly reporting system will never do a thing to punish that player. But if we can atleast penalize those players harder for the loss they will either sink faster or suck it up and play it out.","replies":[]}
