That somehow what a person types will impact their gameplay. This i am fairly certain is a 100% fallacy and what riot does is run some poorly thought out metrics suggesting &quot;toxic&quot; chat makes you lose more, when it actually doesn&#039;t because you see riot never filters out the fact that 99% of toxic chat occurs because YOU ARE LOSING, therefore you were already on the losing team the chat has nothing to do with it. It is the latest flavor of the moth for excusing yourself of self responsibility, it not me playing poorly it is YOU making me play poorly. Most everyone with common sense knows this is absolute garbage but fragile egos want to believe it. You will never get better at anything if people do not inform you what you are doing is incorrect or that you are performing poorly. &quot;Hey little timmy you missed 45 shots in a row, you are a great shot though keep taking every shot for your team!&quot; that is what riot wants you to believe and we all know this is patently wrong. The proper thing to say would be hey timmy, I am pretty sure you are not ready to shot from that far so you need to stop and start passing the ball to your teammates you are ruining the game for them.\r\n\r\nbut go ahead gobble it up and pretend someone typing &quot;hey you missed every skill shot so far this game&quot; is why you missed them (even though they typed it after you already missed) and that now your aim will get even worse. #kidswhoareeasilybrainwashed,","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-10-21T17:47:07.484+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"It has nothing to do with short term hand eye coordination.

Their job is to make your basic training a living hell.  Why?  You may say because all that adversity makes you stronger and try harder, but in reality it is there to make you hate the Drill Sargent and not the Training regiment you are put through.  After training, when you are in a real combat situation a good commander won't berate his squad for their mistakes [like the Drill Sargent would in training], especially not in the middle of a fire fight.\n\nBasically, by berating your teammates and flaming them in the chat, you are trying to be a Drill Sargent in a fire fight, when your team really needs a Commander.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2015-10-21T18:19:42.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you're kidding OP","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-10-21T22:41:44.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kissing ass won't make people play better, but if you flame them, they're going to do worse than they're already doing.
