Well you surpassed anything i could have imagined hahaha.  The ironic part is that of all the absurdly broken stuff you showed you still managed to ensure Miss Fortune was pedestrian at best as you see 2 people eat almsot a full channel of new improved ult and not even lose 1/4 of their hp.....meanwhile kog can 1 round anyone in under a second with 5 autos lol. Graves can delete anyone with 1 Q, quinn well she will have like noc ult on 15 second cool down... HO HO HO Caitlyn gets a free ult every time she manages to net someone cuz well THAT is hard to do lol.\n\nGrats you broke the game well done.\n\nPS hey guys we cant seem to figure out a way to make turret last for more than a few seconds, so we will add an AD item that kills them even faster ho ho ho.","replies":[{"poster":"Gigahappytown","date":"2015-11-10T03:22:35.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mf ult deals 5760 damage at full build","replies":[]}]}
