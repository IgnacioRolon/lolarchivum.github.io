The real problem with ranked play is that everyone on both the winning team and losing team are either rewarded or punished equally which creates a big meaningless pile of chaos of players with their skill of play rarely objectively measuring their skill at the game. I can go 0/20/0 and win a game where the rest of my team went 20/0/20 and I will walk away from that ranked match with the EXACT SAME REWARD as my teammates who clearly are superior players who deserve a far larger reward than I do for that win, this isn&#039;t fair and it only ensures a longer number of games will be required to sift players to their true rank. The current system also leads to immense passive toxicity, you all seen it, player x is angry and sabotage&#039;s the match in a way that isn&#039;t intentional feeding, and they don&#039;t type mean things and thus they will never been punished. I am talking about that silent player who QQ&#039;s they didn&#039;t get a gank and then sits alone in the lane or jungle never participating in the game for example turning the game essentially into a 4 v 5.\r\n\r\nRiot already implemented a system that gauges a players relative contribution based on performance metrics That grading you get a the end of the game... All riot has to do is implement a scaling LP reward or penalty that is augmented by that scale. So when that person goes 1/12/4  and gets a C is lucky enough to be on the winning team they get a very small reward of LP, and vice verse that person who goes 20/2/12 gets and S+ on the losing team with everyone else being 1/12/5 C rating they get a very mild penalty for that loss. Suddenly the system will start to sift people faster and more accurately to their proper rank and reduce the noise created by all the people who are carried or feed hard.\r\n\r\nIt will also help curb a lot of the passive toxicity which many of us find far more frustrating than a player who types omg jungle sux.\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR Use the current grading system to tailor lp gains and loses to the players contribution or lack thereof. Average performance would get typical lp gains or losses, below average will get lower lp gains or larger losses, and a higher performance would get greater gains or lesser losses all relative to their teams average performance.","replies":[{"poster":"xPhantomDancerX","date":"2018-04-03T06:16:28.496+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg this! This would make all our ranked games so much less toxic! If people actually know that they get rewarded and punished depending on how THEY do and not how their TEAM do, people will be a lot less toxic, and the ranking system would be a lot more fair. I just had a 18/3 game but still couldn't carry because top lane decided to play an adc champ top, and I lost 20lp in that game despite doing good. Things like this just makes people want to be toxic when you get punish this harshly for playing good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morticianjohn","date":"2018-04-03T14:40:00.932+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The grading system does not encourage us to optimize for winning the game.","replies":[{"poster":"130x","date":"2018-04-03T14:41:33.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Morticianjohn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q7mBpecO,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-04-03T14:40:00.932+0000)\n>\n> The grading system does not encourage us to optimize for winning the game.\n\nNeither does the win/loss system. \n\nEdit - you know what, I am calling out this comment.

If I EVER make a mistake it is an insta loss for me in these 9/10 games. The 1/10th game I am still not running anywhere close to a 040...

KDA, CS, warding, objectives would all be taken into consideration. I'm not wholly opposed to a new system but just want to point out that any formula is abuseable. Fighting over CS would become toxic and other such situations that arise from the priorities outlined in whatever formula we come up with. \n\nMaintain your 60% win rate and you'll climb to where you should be really quickly no matter what system is used.","replies":[{"poster":"130x","date":"2018-04-03T17:53:07.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Morticianjohn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q7mBpecO,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-03T17:27:19.222+0000)\n>\n> There would have to be some kind of formula to determine what a high grade is.

Even start checking out in game end stats and letter grades of people. It takes into account everything and works pretty well already. Think about why you or others got the grade or rating you did and accuracy check it. I rarely get a grade I didnt feel I deserved. You will begin to see how much the game can be changed already. The information they have and already collect is plenty for a smooth switchover. \n\nI have been studying the data for years to help improve my own performance.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2018-04-03T17:05:06.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've gotta ask how the win/loss system doesn't encourage you to try and win the game.

Lol. Please expand on that.\n\nGlad you asked. Every person is different. Every person has their own ideas or reasons for doing what they do. This includes playing a game, in this case League of Legends. As morticianjohn explained in his video, that could be simply having a top kda, maybe you want to play bard adc, maybe you play for fun, maybe you are serious, maybe you are a smurf and get paid to play, maybe you want to stay in silver elo because you like the difficulty(as in throw games to stay), or maybe you play to troll and cause misery. As you can see, everyone has their own reasons. You can not say \"everyone is always playing to win.\" And that is not a big deal, this is a game and fun should not be a problem. \n\nThe problem is that the current system does not take any of these different ideals, factors, personalities, or agendas into play. Win/loss is just a bad system period. I am not saying that winning and losing is not a key factor, I am just saying it for sure shouldn't be the only factor. Especially with all the data we have available today. I feel a more versatile system would make climbing harder, as well as easier, and most importantly you will walk away knowing you earned or didn't earn what you got.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2018-04-03T16:10:01.239+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They had that in Overwatch and had to remove it for higher ranks because it ruined match quality. Instead of trying to win people would pick certain heroes and pad a certain stat and they'd still end up top 500 on the server with something crazy like a 30% win rate.\nYou can't quantify everything that goes into a win anyway, so it's only gonna benefit people who gets lots of kills or CS. People already complain on the boards that in order to get an S on supports you have to steal CS and kills.
