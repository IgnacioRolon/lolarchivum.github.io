You say it isn't pleasant for a diamond to get dropped to silver and then stomp, but then you freely allow people to stream doing just that over and over and over many on your pro roster.\r\n\r\nSo essentially everyone will be where they are right now, and thus unless there is a huge skill gap you will stay there because in the end this game is far more about your team than your individual play again unless the skill gap is MASSIVE. I have done many tests on this and they all suggest just that, I win games i purposefully try to throw because my team is just better, then i got  off HUGE carry but i cannot overcome the match maker giving me 4 baddies who the system never filters out to their proper rank because YOU DONT RESET EACH SEASON.\r\n\r\nso just dont waste time resetting.","replies":[{"poster":"Demonsolder21","date":"2015-01-14T00:52:09.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can anyone give any clarification as to why season resets tend to hit low elo players harder than higher elo player.","replies":[{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-01-14T01:10:31.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Demonsolder21,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EElEPr2b,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-14T00:52:09.936+0000)\n>\n> Can anyone give any clarification as to why season resets tend to hit low elo players harder than higher elo player.\n\nIt does? Saint went from challenger to Gold 5 last reset. I think it's just low elo players have less confidence in themselves and feel anxiety that they'll never get the rank they once had.","replies":[{"poster":"Demonsolder21","date":"2015-01-14T01:28:28.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well idk :/","replies":[]}]}]}]}
