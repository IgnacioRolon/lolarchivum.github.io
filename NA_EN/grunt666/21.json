The community should not have to wait for months and or a year to rid themselves of these types of players. Chat bans do nothing why are we chat banning players who infraction is not abusing chat, but simply refusing to play and purposefully trying to lose people games?\r\n\r\nWhy is there not a special report system for these cases to be escalated to for priority review and this player banned from playing ranked for season 5?\r\n\r\nPS this is also what is wrong with the current ranking system, that player received the same reward for winning as the other 4 teammates. That is why the system is broken for most of us. There was no seperation from me and that bad ADC who both stayed the exact same because  that player gets the same reward for trying to sabatoge the game as i did for playing my arse off.","replies":[]}
