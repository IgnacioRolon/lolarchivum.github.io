We are both level 10. I mean shouldnt a kit like her have LOW dmg  and force her to look for targets of opportunity aka champs with 75% or less hp? and even then shouldnt she have to blow it all to take them down so fast? \r\n\r\nI really don't get it what is the point of playing this game, or the game itself if a certain segment of champs literalyl press 3 buttons and kill others? Like that isnt even gameplay, I dont care if your \"archtype\" is assasin, because i dont pick an archtype called \"victim. Don't tell me to build defensive items because the assassin dont either. If we are same level have same gold and stand off and land everything shouldnt it essentially both die at the same time? why is it not that way? Instead talon or zed or akali  or fishboy just press a few buttons you vaporize and they are almost untouched...while you are dead. Yet everything else at that point was dead even level gold etc...","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-01-15T05:21:13.025+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"This isn't even mathematically possible.\n\nAt level 10 the lowest base HP any champ has is Anivia with 1009, she has 52 armour and 30 MR.\n\nAt level 10 Akali's spell rotation deals 440+(170% AP)+(60% AD) mixed damage\n\nWith 92 AP, base AD and sorc shoes while you are running **0 defence** she will deal \n\n* 360+129=489 Raw magic damage\n* 489*0.8696(damage multiplier for 15 MR)=425 magic damage\n* 80+50+28=158 raw physical damage\n* 158*0.6579=104 physical damage\n* 425+104=529 total damage, or around 50% of your HP as the squishiest champ in the game.\n\nSo no, she didn't insta-gib you.

Or alternatively she landed a Q on you and you didn't give her respect and back off a few seconds after she landed it and she double proced a Q on you, leaving you at around 25% from full and allowing her to easily chase you down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lron IV Carry","date":"2015-01-15T05:33:39.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"WhereTheNamesAt","date":"2015-01-15T05:43:18.610+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"JESUS CHRIST!!!!

You do not have to build any cooldown reduction while on other assassins you do.  This opens up full offensive or defensive build such as rylais or hextech gunblade which has built in sustain.  I called that I would get a quadra kill with her before the match even started and what do you know, It happened.  It happens all the time with Akali.  Another problem with her is that she beats OTHER assassins while she isn't even fed and the other assassin is.  Her jump range is too long you can't even safely sit behind your own minions even at a great distance because she can jump to it (doesn't have to kill it like irelia) and jump to you.\nHer Q is on such a low cooldown even with 0% cooldown you can literally Q wait for Q to cooldown, walk up proc it and proc a second one instantly.. WITH 0% COOLDOWN.  That is a massive problem.\nHer stealth is honestly fine.  It is just hiding within a circle.  The problem lies with the base damage and low cooldowns for no reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninpire","date":"2015-01-15T14:09:31.265+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah anyone who plays akali knows that didn't actually happen\n\nAkali has pretty low burst in one rotation of spells compared to other assassins.

Apply this to how people feel about Akali. \n\nYou know that she will get to the point of chain deleting enemies one after the other. Her damage will be so overwhelming that ADC's will buy Zhonya's just to stay alive for that one second longer. This is a plainly known fact but people just let it happen then complain after the fact instead of actively delaying the function Akali was designed to fill. \n\nYou watch that LCK game Faker played in just recently? Support ganks at 3.30, Jungler 4.10, comes back 4.30 takes flash and kills him. Supp/Jungler return at 6m before he even get's his ult and kill him again. This is a strategy that says we know what can happen if we do anything other than this. One kill isn't a shut down and a one time effort isn't enough. These are the things you need to do shut down Akali so that your mid laner can consistently fight her or so that she's too weak to roam elsewhere. \n\nUnless effort on this scale is put forth no one deserves to complain about a champion working in the way it was designed.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-01-15T12:33:30.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">ADC's will buy Zhonya's just to stay alive for that one second longer.\n\nJust a point on that, you know when everyone spams \"buy QSS against Zed to survive\"? While it doesn't work against Zed it's actually incredibly effective against Akali as you can cleanse her Q with it, and unlike Zed she actually deals magic damage. So if you're an ADC and you want to survive an Akali just build a QSS, it's much stronger at shutting her damage down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2 much sauuuce","date":"2015-01-15T08:18:44.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"More players complaining about a damage dealer dealing... damage?  \n\nSMH\n\nSeriously.
