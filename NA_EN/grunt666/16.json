Literally the warding system needs an massive retool it is sooo broken.\r\n\r\na)Max 1 ward per player on the map any time any type. So tired of the map being polluted with so many  wards there is no fog of war.\r\n\r\nb)The actual act of placing a ward is seriously the most broken abiltity in the game. Right now you get range to place it and it is instant cast? MEaning you can pretty much go where ever you want leaving your leading trail of wards quickly safely with little to zero risk for massive rewards.\r\n\r\nWards should not have a range to be dropped, they should  have like teemo shroom placement type of range to be placed. Secondly the act of placing a ward should be a short channel, not instant.\r\n\r\nMaybe that is too much change, honestly i dont think so though. Fog of war is there for a reason, and the easy abuse of warding literally removes that reason, and take all risk out of everything in this game if one team either gets ahead to abuse the vision system.  There is literally no counter play to prevent someone from warding either. due to the range and it being instant cast. all you can do is either have a sweeper (gg sight stones they j7ust drop another instantly lol), or you buy a pink, which often is not viable because it means taking the time to go back and get a pink which often is a larger penality than the cost of the pink. So you just have to leave the ward there.","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2014-10-20T18:27:00.286+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"a) It's already limited to 4 wards per player, 3 normal and 1 pink.

Why should it not have a range?

Feral flare wards are different (MUCH larger range) but then again you only get 1 of those and it has a reasonable cooldown. \n\nIt's always weird to think you're playing safe going to drop a ward in a Bush and get ambushed while dropping the ward (the thought \"I'd have been safer not warding\" literally goes through my head) and that's counterintuitive. Not to mention wards night only cost 75g but if you're doing 3 per 90 seconds that's 150g per minute or 3k at 20 min,  which is basically a full item at 20 min. Even if we assume 1/3 are free and slightly less often you're still looking at 1500g (close to a bf sword or needlessly large rod). If they buy a sightstone they need to base every few minutes to reload and they needed to buy the sightstone. In any instance wards are costly,  and while worth it at all levels of play I think they're relatively well balanced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"48983507DEL1","date":"2014-10-20T18:31:31.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wards are meant for tacitical vision at the cost of gold. With the current system of 3 wards per player, it is absolutely impossible to have every part of the map revealed at all times, making tactical ward placing seriously important. It means choosing to either light up your entire jungle for protection while sacrificing vision on their jungle or vice versa, or place wards in key locations in both jungles as well as places like baron/dragon pits, commonly passed places in lane or outside bases, or areas of brush during the laning phase. The risk comes from not getting caught when going to place the wards, as they enemy may notice you and kill you as well as kill your ward if you even placed it. The wards also cost gold, as I mentioned, and a lot of it if wards are bought in the appropriate amount, so getting caught and losing vison is a big risk to take for 75-300+ gold.","replies":[]}]}
