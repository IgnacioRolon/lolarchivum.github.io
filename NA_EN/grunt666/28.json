Look at swain, forgotten about for years but then suddenly without buffs becomes broken af. This wasn't due to a meta, he had just stayed the same while his counters had gone down in strength. taliyah will get toned down and will become average and will have a niche fan base who plays her, same with ryze he takes a lot of skill to play so in a few patches he will probably be good again, then rito will nerf him and he will be fine. got it? good.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kebslol","date":"2016-07-14T08:19:56.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I absolutely concur.
