Yet at all phases of the game ignite does more dmg than heal heals, and to make it worse heal is cut in half by ignite as well. So literally in an even match up there currently is never a point in the game that heal out classes ignite.","replies":[{"poster":"Altiverse","date":"2018-03-21T08:04:31.888+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Heal can be, and ideally should be used on two targets, as opposed to single-target ignite. If you want a defensive spell for yourself alone, that's what Barrier exists for.\nThe total healing granted by Heal to 2 targets is still more than Ignite, not to mention the movement speed buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-03-21T09:09:49.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except it heals two people and grants a movement speed buff.\n\nYou see how silly your point sounds if you actually know the basics of how things work?","replies":[]},{"poster":"P4ppino","date":"2018-03-21T08:16:52.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heal is overall stronger.
