LOL. RIP league. Never seen a company fail so hard at understanding thier own game. Been 4 months of perma ban juggernauts the solution? Turn 6 ADC&#039;s into the next perma bans (ok 5 MF is still poop and realyl didnt get any real actual buff) replace MF with one of the melee adc who will be redonkulous with the new items like yasuo who has been broken since his release anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2015-11-10T21:46:24.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This post is so blissfully unaware it hurts..\n\n130% movespeed out of combat. Taking damage from anything removes the MS bonus. Taking damage from champions or baron/dragon disables the ult completely in which a 2 second channel is needed to get it back.\n\nNone of the juggernauts are actually worth banning anymore except maybe{{champion:82}}.\n{{champion:114}} and {{champion:41}} are way more common now.\n\nThe MF comment just shows how ignorant you are. She got an incredible buff and is going to be a monster in lane with her new passive. Her ult is going to do over 4000 damage in lategame fights. Her E got a range buff so it's kind of not useless anymore (mostly still is)\n\nYasuo had a period where he was considered underpowered, and even now he's just average. He also doesn't get that much from the new items because he caps his crit chance out right away and things like Essence Reaver and Death's Dance aren't really that good on him compared to other options. He mainly benefits from Scimitar getting lifesteal.\n\nI don't see any reason whatsoever why {{champion:51}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:96}} are going to be permaban. The only one likely to be permaban status is {{champion:104}} because Riot is ignoring everyone on the PBE saying he's too powerful.","replies":[]}]}
