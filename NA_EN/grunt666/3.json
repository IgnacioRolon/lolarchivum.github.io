So please stop taking the role literally and demanding to be able to roam the map carefree to \"assassinate\" anyone who happens to think they are allowed to play the game as well and lets you get  with in range of your gap closer instant death faceroll combo.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why such liberties are given to \"assassin\" roles but when it comes to say the \"tank\" role we need massive amount of AR/MR pen to ensure the tank isnt actually all that tanky. This ia a pvp game at heart and that should mean me and you play against each other not \"cat vs mouse\" where you hunt me down all game and i do my best to run from you simply because of the champions we picked.\r\n\r\n Don't tell me what i need to build and how i need defensive items when you the assassin does build a single one.\r\nDon't tell me how i should not be alone in lane when you just roamed half a map by yourself to reach me by yourself in my lane.\r\nDon't tell me lol \"you should know better i am an assassin\" no your not your just another player who is playing an ez mode broken champion.\r\n\r\nIt is really time for this \"role\" to be put into place like any other dmg role.","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-01-15T21:35:39.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you are a squishy and face-checking brushes by yourself, literally any champion that does damage will assassinate you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epilogue of Life","date":"2015-01-15T21:32:29.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Assassins are supposed to counter all squishies, only natural that you have to run.
