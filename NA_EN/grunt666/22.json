I MEAN EXACTLY, a few players just as good as me, a few  a bit better, a good portion worse, and some that are simply TERRIBLE, but not like a true noob terrible just terrible EXACTLY like the terrible players i get in plat on my team.\r\n\r\nSo there you go my level 23 summoner normal matches feel EXACTLY like  my matches do when playing a plat ranked game. Meaning platinum 3 is meaningless as far as rank goes or quality of opponents and teammates, the system literally does nothing to sort players. aka system is useless.","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2014-12-12T03:17:12.980+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"maybe cuz your mmr is ridiculoulsy high in normal games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Uperior","date":"2014-12-12T04:26:53.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I struggled to get to level 26 (First time playing the game) and I constantly am getting put into games with people with 700+ wins, where I have JUST gotten to 60.\n\nI'm not good, and trying my best to learn, but it is impossible to know what I did wrong, or learn, when I get stuck against players who are literally 100 times better than I am. \n\nThe only thing I've learned today is how to count down respawn timers. \n\nIt's very frustrating to be playing a game casually only to be thrown up with people who spend hours playing. The only time I can enjoy a game is between 2:00 am and 6:00 am EST because there are less people awake. Seems kinda depressing that I have to watch what time of the day I play at to be in games with people around my skill level who aren't smurfs, or are ranked with 700+ wins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2014-12-12T04:21:00.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My level 26 smurf goes against plats/ golds typically in normals.\nBecause my normal mmr is high as fuck on that account","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-12-12T03:21:43.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably because you're Plat duoing with a level 23? It really doesn't know how to sort out a team where 2 players have a very different MMR.\n\nbeing forced to level up a summoner isn't terrible, imo. It keeps bronze from being even more trash than low elo bronze already is. Like if somebody could just buy the starter pack play for a week and have 16 champions and then jump right into ranked? That would suck. Those 30 levels mean that somebody will at least have had a chance to try out many champions, see many of them in games, learn all the roles, and buy a small pool of champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Steinick","date":"2014-12-12T03:24:10.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems about right.","replies":[]}]}
