Once again we have another patch that pretty much confirms most changes are simply aimed to try to make pro play watchable.\r\n\r\nWave clear mages...yet another circle of mana changes in this never ending hamster wheel of which almost always is caused by stagnant pro level play because a couple mages just have silly kits that riot refuses to alter. In the future stop screwing with mana and start addressing the problems we get it taliyah azir ryze cass dominate pro play with their mindless wave clear... So fix those champs make their wave clear abilties so do 50% to minions, fix your minion AI to create a more challenging last hitting experience, fix the gold values of minions so that mindless afk minion farming isnt the most effective form of generating gold. Make it so the blue buff only gives mana/cdr if you have the jungle item/smite.\r\n\r\nI dont want to get into all the other silly changes that we go back and forth on over and over as riot struggles to make their pro play entertaining, &quot;objectives guys&quot; sorry objectives are boring its a scapegoat for failure to motivate players to engage each other because its not rewarding. Objectives is riot saying we have no idea how to get people to engage each other so lets put 1 objective every 5 minutes out there they have to fight over because otherwise they will never fight!\r\n\r\nGee how fun @syndra wasnt bad enough she was a press R delete you type now its even easier...because you know we have to find a way to get another mage into the pro scene as everyone is tired of taliyah/ryze/azir/cass circle jerk because riot cant balance their game. Up next jayce buffs cause tanks top, then jayce nerfs, then jayce buffs, then jayce nerfs, then jayce buffs, then jayce nerfs, then jayce buffs, then jayce nerfs rinse repeat for the same stable of &quot;pro champ pool&quot; they recycle over and over, meanwhile the other 120 champs literallyremain so subpar they will almost NEVER see regular pro play and the day they do? NERF TIME! wut? MF played in pros? time to nerf that, must be caitlyn/trist all this year because well who in their right mind would play an ADC that doesnt have a kit with built in flashes on a 15 sec cd right? Next cycle back to luc/ez, oh dam stale need hyper carry buff kog/varus, meanwhile sivir cast q 3 times she is oom for the next 5 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-02T04:05:36.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> taliyah azir ryze cass \n\nAll getting changes or recently changed.","replies":[]}]}
