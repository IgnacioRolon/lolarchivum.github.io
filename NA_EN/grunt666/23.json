The health damage is one opponent every 12 seconds as opposed to the true damage of Vayne's passive W, and she has one dash that has a fairly decent CD, only advantage she with it is she can spam it, but no more then just about any dash and only in the circle. As for her ultimate, I hated it too, until I realized that I can sit in it, and also be unkillable, she really isn't that bad and I would rather fight against her then Vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-10-22T05:34:11.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"her passive is infinitely scaling %current health on autos. her E damage is high but not enough on its own for me to be annoyed with\n\ntbh i wouldnt outright nerf her yet tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2015-10-22T12:53:25.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'll agree they're really annoying but that's it really. They're easily shut down any form of point and click damage and the ult is easily a dua edged blade, as long you remember to stay in it with them as well.

Maybe a few tweaks here and there, but overall there really isn't any aspect of the kit that's too overbearing or underwhelming and with that, I think Riot did a great job with them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-10-22T04:32:08.090+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to type out the myriad of reasons you are wrong but I am betting it's not worth my time having you ignore thought out feedback, so I'll just down vote.","replies":[{"poster":"Brockinroll","date":"2015-10-22T04:34:18.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you.
