I mean who sits on thier ult as hecarim waiting to use it to kill zac blobs while 2 enemy players stand there out numbered hoping to guard zac? If huni just ults onto them, team moves in kills zac wins fight and gets out, but naaaa i&#039;ll sit here watching the blobs and use my ult to get the kill on zac blobs causing my team to over stay and get collapsed on after i waste my ult.","replies":[{"poster":"EPIKON","date":"2015-10-26T04:20:00.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's his interview prior to MSI where he literally said he was the best Top Laner in the world that got Korean players' attention.\n\nMarin, Ssumday and Smeb have all said they couldn't wait to face Huni and FNC.\n\nAnybody else enjoy Smeb manhandling Huni in the semi-finals?\n\nI sure as hell did.\n\n\nI mean this is the guy that jumped to FNC because he knew he couldn't beat out Marin for SKT T1 S's top position, he said it himself.\n\nHe's lucky he didn't face KT's Ssumday because Smeb's probably the nicest of the three LCK Top Laners in this tournament.\n\nIt was ugly but it would have been a lot worse.","replies":[{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2015-10-26T10:19:57.408+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think we can lambaste FNCs losses in the semi-finals on Huni alone. Let's be honest they all played like shit compared to the rest of this season. \nPoor drafts. Poor plays. They just decided to not bring their A game and look what it got them. A double Korean final.","replies":[{"poster":"Yvaelle","date":"2015-10-26T22:48:24.587+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I generally agree, but would add that Febiven has proven to be an incredibly consistent mid laner - he's almost always doing the right thing at the right time. He never tilts - and he's incredibly calm and measured in teamfights. \n\nThe big collapse I saw in FNC vs. KOO wasn't exactly Huni though - as Smeb pointed out - Huni is FNC's weak link (always has been) - he's too aggressive, too ego-driven - and sometimes that leads to big plays that the crowd loves to cheer for - but sometimes it leads to massive game-losing mistakes. With that said, that's how Huni always plays. \n\nWhat really disappointed me in the semifinals was the way Reignover's performance vanished. He essentially feeds Huni every single game with perfect early ganks, perfect counter-gank presence to protect Huni's overextension - really the entire Huni-chanting crowd - if they really understood what they are watching - should be chanting for Reignover: because he carries Huni so hard - then leaves it to a fed Huni to show up late game and make a gory mess (which Huni is an expert at, to his credit) - but Huni without Reignover is nothing. \n\nThen in FNC vs. KOO, Reignover seemed to just fall apart - in Game 1 as Reksai he spotted multiple enemy ganks but didn't warn his team, and like 3 times in one game he got caught... in the enemy jungle... unwarded... with tremorsense: a) seemed surprised each time, b) never escaped as Reksai. It was baffling - and losing Reignover meant Huni was left to flop about top lane and feed Smeb, rather than get spoon-fed kills by Reignover. \n\nSo I don't at all want to say that Reignover is to blame for FNC's performance vs KOO - but when Reignover falls off, and he's the one who usually carries Huni - then Huni is useless too: suddenly FNC comes apart at the seams. Rekkles Yellowstar are an awesome bot lane passive team - they basically never lose their lane, but never make big plays either - but then you get to late game where they are always relevant, always  a threat, and usually build for late-game teamfights: they consistently arrive into mid/late game as a real threat. Febiven is a very consistent mid laner - and he still really impresses me. But if Reignover isn't on his game, and doesn't spoon-feed Huni in the early game - then Huni morphs into some sort of Bronze feeder - who responds to dying by dying again, then again. \n\nNot Reignover's fault at all, but man does it put pressure on Reignover having a perfect day.","replies":[{"poster":"MrWasjig","date":"2015-10-27T13:06:25.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you hit the nail on the head Sir.

I think the drafts went pretty wrong and just set them up for failure. Huni stands out as having the biggest mistakes for me, and Smeb even said in his interview after they won that he knew if they got to Huni that he would tilt and make mistakes. That's his playstyle. He takes risks and if they don't pay off then the other team will heavily punish them. I think I was also disappointed with Rekkles still playing Kennen ADC. I would have liked to see him playing carry/siege champs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2015-10-26T17:35:29.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't place the blame all on Huni. their bot lane went 5/32 and never had a real impact. The only thing Febiven did note worthy after game one was pick poor summoners, get caught out of position, Randomly waste showkwave on LuLu for no reason, and flash into an Ashe Arrow. Also Reignover got caught out of position alot through out the series. Huni may have gotten beat bad by Smeb but they lost as a team.","replies":[{"poster":"Death Vizier","date":"2015-10-27T14:40:26.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Huni tbh was expected to lose to Smeb.

Even the drafts had been full of mistakes not even a Bronze would have made (firstpicking rekÂ´sai instead of Lulu, giving away Tahm...), and for the ingame calls it had just been miserable unjustified high risk low reward plays all over the place (invading blue when your toplaner is back in base, turretdiving when you can have a free drake instead...)\n\nit had just been really sad to watch them fall apart, pretty much like LGD in the first week. But well, they also have shown a lot of promise this season...lets just hope they can bring the consistency they had all summer long to the international stage aswell next year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lucky Iccy","date":"2015-10-27T20:37:40.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say yes, Huni's need to prove himself and hard carry every game led to a lot of over-compensation that turned small disadvantages into large ones. BUT Fnatic also had god awful pick/ban phases in the semi's and it became clear the Reignover as weak champion pool that can be exploited and overall he really dropped the ball. In addition Yellowstar got caught out A LOT in that series either by poor positioning or going in blind for some warding, especially as Nautilius. \n\nOverall Fnatic is a really solid team but I think they just need a little bit of polish and would love to see how they do if they stay together next year. Goals would be 1.Temper Huni to be more team-focused and less tilt prone 2.Expand Reignoves champ pool and 3.Get Febiven to realize is one of the best mid-laners int he world, the kid is amazing and has even stood toe-to-toe with the likes of Faker and Bjergsen in the last year...but I dont think he knows just how good he is.","replies":[]}]}
