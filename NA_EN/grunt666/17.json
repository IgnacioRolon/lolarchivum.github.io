Do something sensible for once and disable new champs in ranked que for the first week. Not only does is ruin ranked matches for everyone else, it always seems to screw up any evaluation of the balance of the new champions as 9/10 everyone cries they are weak and undertuned because they have ZERO idea how to build, play , or manage the myriad of situations and match ups the new character will encounter.\r\n\r\nfor the record yes i always ban the new champs but i am not always in control, and yes i have lost 4 matches today to people picking illioa on my team and having no clue how to play it feeding being useless etc.. yet to have the enemy team pick it.","replies":[]}
