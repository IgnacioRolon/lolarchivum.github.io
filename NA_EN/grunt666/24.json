Hear me out. play ranked matches, after you lose look up your teamates all wager in a large majority of cases the people on your team who did poorly \r\na)never played the champion hardly at all if ever.\r\nb) almost never play that role\r\nc) more than likely both a and b\r\n\r\nthe sad part is these are all 100% under riots control and extremely simple to fix.\r\n\r\na) require a proficiency in normals to use xxxx champion in ranked.\r\nb) allow people to click a box allowing them to accept a longer que to ensure no one is auto filled on their team.\r\n\r\nBoom done those just came off the top of my head and im not even very bright. You know what happens when you keep letting people who cant play their champs well into ranked? They do poorly ruin the game for others which leads to people getting angry, you allow this to happen its actually riot who is at fault for this. Same goes for autofilled many people get angry the moment they get auto filled to support pick garbage champs they dont know how to play they dont care about trying and  again it ruins the game for everyone thus everyone gets frustrated and angry and again 100% under riot games control its on them.","replies":[{"poster":"DearPear","date":"2018-08-12T12:30:11.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're so delusional...

In there you had ranked games where you were Pyke 0/7/1, Jhin,  1/7/7, Jihn 0/7/3.  There were other games where you did poorly, but in these games you did exceptionally poorly.  Did you deserve to be flamed in these games?  Did you deserve to get harassed?\n\nThe answer is no.  Regardless of how poor you play, every player is responsible for their own actions.  Every player _chooses_ whether to rage, or not.  Every player _chooses_ whether to flame, or not.  Every player _chooses_ whether to be toxic, or not.\n\nTakes responsibility for your own actions and learn some god damn self control.","replies":[{"poster":"Grunt666","date":"2018-08-12T19:11:59.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Subdue,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=400AoaKg,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2018-08-12T15:08:59.543+0000)\n>\n> Okay, I took your advice and looked at your match history.

Look at ALL of them don;t scout out my worst games and try to make a leap. Yet you prove my point. The pyke game? I never played pyke before was made i got shuffled to support so I say screw it ill try pyke. I was terrible at it ,however my entire team was bad. \n\nAs for the jihn games when you get really bad teams you get really bad scores. Really man you cherry pick a few of my worst games ( you literally had to dig back over 20 matches lol) one of which i did try a new champ and was bad and try to suggest somehow i was ever toxic and i need self control lol?\n\nStop trying to be a DB and pick ME apart...look at the games I WIN therefore i must be  happy camper and look at the enemy team players....and yup sure enough when I win via a pretty big stomp enemy team is filled with autofilled and first time champ picks. I'm not the problem its riot poorly designed system that frustrates players and creates animosity worst part is they are really simple fixes.","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2018-08-12T19:18:01.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grunt666,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=400AoaKg,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-12T19:11:59.567+0000)\n>\n> Ahh selective cherry picking i see.

If EVERY player were like you and has a bad game in 10% of their games, that's on average 1 player having a bad game EVERY game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DearPear","date":"2018-08-12T13:10:24.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grunt666,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=400AoaKg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-08-12T12:54:17.330+0000)\n>\n> Before you make such a claim go browse some random people&#x27;s ranked match history, you will be quite suprised to discover i&#x27;m actually right and there is this very strong correlation between people being autofilled/using champs they almost never play and being on the losing team and doing disproportionately poor compared to their teammates.\n> \n> Im not sure why you would think otherwise league is a very simple yet devilishly complex game due to the incredible amount of interactions between the 130+ champions and their abilities and play styles.\n> \n> and yes riot can chang ethe things i pointed out extremely easily its on them.\n\nThis is all unrelated to toxicity.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Trailsmix","date":"2018-08-13T08:11:38.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Autofill is just a shit mechanic that should have players able to opt out of them...
