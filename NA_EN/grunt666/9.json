Epic fail and WW is ruined.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"That riot knee jerked Warwick, as even at the pro rank he cant win and they played on pre nerf WW patch.\r\n\r\nLee sin, j4 still broke as fuk in jungle, but it is okay because they are also safe beyond safe as well, meanwhile warwick is not safe at all in anyway beyond being able to stay relatively healthy during his first 2 clears.\r\n\r\nSo WW is now trash in the jungle, 100% unplayable in lane. Meanwhile lee sin still dominates, after being tickled while also being pick or ban for 3 straight pro seasons.....ww pub stomps after new jungle changes for 2 weeks received 3 major nerfs LOL.\r\n\r\nHis W took a 40% reduction. Ult CD was like another 25% cd increase and lopped like 20% of its dmg. So somehow WW is supposed to ult a squishy take them to maybe 75% after his ult and then auto 10 times and q 3 times to get a kill? LOL this is balanced? Oh that is if they dont have sommoners , peel , qss etc... then WW ults into squishy and just dies lol.","replies":[]}
