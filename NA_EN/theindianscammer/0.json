You can do this by Opening the menu while in game with Escape, Navigate to Interface, Find the Chat section and uncheck the All Chat option. \n\nYou won't see Enemy chat in game any more, but you won't be able to talk over all chat anymore either.","replies":[{"poster":"TheIndianScammer","date":"2014-11-29T19:22:23.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, i found it!!

How about getting rude of the monumentally stupid idea of unmuting people at the end of game's. Those people were muted for a reason.","replies":[]}]}
