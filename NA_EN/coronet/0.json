Top laners have fun, trying to TP bot only to arrive when the bot is dead. I have fun, when I spam ping my bot lane maniacally anytime Fizz one shots the wave and leaves, while I scrable to farm with my mana, only to see him 8 seconds later killing my other laners.\r\n\r\nThe game is perfect now. You try to ward, pay attention to your surroundings, hit every cs, harras the Assasin against you, build a 15 cs lead, you feel good about yourself... and then you recall, your bot lane doesnt reacts to pings and the Fizz has two kills now.\r\n\r\nSo much fun!","replies":[{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-05-07T14:48:33.471+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":10,"body":"Yes i love playing against overbuffed zed, fizz with DODGE E, katarina with milion dashes, kassadin with flash per 1 sec late game, random rengar oneshoting me from the bush, buffed talon that his dash has now higher range than most mages AA, random kayn from the wall oneshoting me, invisible shaco with his stupid passive dealing 3/4 of my hp, and invisible kha XD","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2018-05-08T12:54:02.933+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{summoner:21}} {{summoner:3}} {{summoner:7}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3361}} {{item:2055}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3027}} are not an option for you?","replies":[{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-05-08T13:14:13.582+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"So lets start this\nBarier is already nerfed and ignite deals more dmg than barier covers\nExhaust, Im glad i CAN SEE talon kha or shaco and CLICK exhaust on them before they oneshot me\nIgnite is counter to heal\nBanshee what?

I was going for general classes. Supports generally fall under mage or tanks, which is why I didn't bother.\n\nThat is true. Keep in mind, mages have, historically, been the most dominant class next to ADCs, and yet they've been whining with each change this season. They weren't whining as much last season. However, when assassins had been in their worst state, they were throwing around \"OP NO COUNTERPLAY\", and when assassins were buffed (AD), they continued bitching. I have no respect for mages at this point. Maybe if they weren't bitching so hard during Pre-Season and literally EVERY fucking major change aside from reasonable ones like the Duskblade Comp Buffs and Mage Changes, I'd have a bit more respect for the class and its players. \n\nThey don't know what it's like to be a gutter class. Mage players are fucking spoiled. When things don't go their way, they whine and bitch in hopes that Riot will bend over for them. They don't have to deal with the shit assassins have for the past two years.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-05-09T07:19:15.870+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a high quality post","replies":[{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2018-05-09T11:34:07.551+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why thank you.

It's a proven fact that playing an assassin in a game means you're more likely to lose that game than if you played a mage.\n\nAssassins have been dominant only once-- during S3, when they dominated both the comp and pro play scene.\n\nAssassins have been in the gutter for all of S7 and for a bit of S8.\n\nAssassins have been troll picks for the entire time that they've been in the gutter.\n\nAssassins all experienced THIS. Where the fuck is your \"try playing X\" now? I heard no non-assassins defending them. You mages have already been dominant for so fucking long.

Every single major change thus far has seen mages whining and bitching about one thing or another on these here Boards. Be it about assassins or ADCs. They were bitching during the AP changes, saying they&#x27;re not good enough. They were bitching when assassins were compensated, saying they&#x27;ll be too oppressive. They were bitching when Conqueror started to become popular on Yasuo, spewing the same shit they always do of &quot;no counterplay&quot;. They were bitching during the Mana Changes, saying they&#x27;ll get pushed in too easily by assassins. Finally, now during the Marksmen Changes. They&#x27;re not bitching about the actual Marksmen. Nonononononono, they&#x27;re bitching about the assassins.\n> \n> Never once have mages been an actual gutter class for the past season or so, LIKE ASSASSINS.\n> \n> Never once have mages been so genuinely bad and useless that playing them in a game would increase the chances of losing that game, like ASSASSINS.\n> \n> Never once have mages NOT been dominant in pro play, LIKE ASSASSINS.\n> \n> Never once have mages NOT been overall decent picks in both SoloQ and Pro Play, LIKE ASSASSINS.\n\nneat effect bro","replies":[{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2018-05-09T19:33:49.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysteriousBootie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Q72Xu0OG,comment-id=00070008,timestamp=2018-05-09T18:46:37.143+0000)\n>\n> neat effect bro\n\nMany thanks, my good fellow.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2018-05-07T15:35:16.849+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Don't forget that even if your other laners hide under tower, they'll die from a dive anyway because towers don't react fast enough to even be a threat, let alone do enough damage to endanger anyone except the support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FilDaFunk","date":"2018-05-08T09:43:42.316+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's OK!

An all in with R and Ignite will absolutely 100-0 even with those items.\n\nYes, if you stand completely still and get hit by a full combo from outside your wave (and let him walk into range for a double Q) it will hurt a bit. Here's a fun fact:\n\n60+76+108+100=344+1.7 AP \n50% = 172+0.85 AP\n90+.35 AP True damage \n\n262+1.2 AP, and you can easily have 60 AP by level 6 even building armor for 334 total.\n\nLet's assume you do stand completely still outside your wave and are hit by both, with 40 bonus AD by 6\n\n150+150+70+100=470+3.1 AD\n50% = 235 + 1.55 AD\n297 damage...oh, that's lower than Ahri's, isn't it? Weird. That's also 1/3rd of a character's health at this level, so you mathemetically couldn't do the other 60% of someone's health off a 25% increase...hm...\n\nOkay well lets move the goal posts, Lux doesn't have any true damage!\n\n70+150+51+70=341+1.7 AP\n50% = 170+0.85 AP\n221 magic damage with 60 AP, +40 or so physical from the autoattack.\n\nSo as you can see, doing 70 more damage than Lux in a trade clearly means Zed can kill you in 1 hit at level 6. Thanks for sharing.\n\nOh, and level 9 is 440+95+130=332+1.55 AD, you need at least 100 bonus AD to do half of Lux's unshielded health with a combo. Let's not forget that this combo does 128 less total damage if you're standing in a minion wave, or have someone in front of you, and has 600 range.\n\nHyperbole is fun, huh?","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2018-05-08T20:36:48.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not seeing electrocute anywhere in the calcs, which adds 100 + .5 bAD + .3 AP, which gives Zed an additional 120 damage?

The .5 AD bumps his scaling from 2.6 to 3.1. Did you read the post?\n\nAhri or Lux would also have ignite, so it doesn't matter, and his passive requires committing to a blink for autoattacks. This was a simple comparison of combos, without regard for lane sustain/minion aggro/multiple ranged autoattacks and other minor runes for boosts to hp/damage/pen/etc\n\nNot to mention that he can't even proc his passive in this instance, because the combo doesn't drop you below 50%","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2018-05-09T02:35:35.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I didn't notice.
