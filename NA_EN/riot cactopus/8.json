Normally when I write something to the community it's to tell you good news about League, or to post memes, or maybe to say some dumb shit about blue essence. (I've done a lot of that recently, lol.) \r\n\r\nToday's different. I'm leaving Riot, and I just want to say how much I've loved being a part of this community. Nothing bad has happened between me and Riotâ€”I basically just found another opportunity that was too good to pass up. I hope you guys keep being real with other Rioters, just like you always have with me. \r\n\r\nI'm still going to play Garen jungle. So if you see somebody lock that in while you're in ranked, pls don't dodge. \r\n\r\nSEE YA,\r\nCactopus","replies":[]}
