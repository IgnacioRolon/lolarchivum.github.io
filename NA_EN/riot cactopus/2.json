After seeing the first animations for his basic attacks, we knew his voice delivery had to match the light-hearted fun slappiness. He even says \"oops!\" sometimes!\n\nAlso, we have a good idea of who we think the character is going to be before we record the voice actor, but our super talented voice actors always interpret characters in ways we never thought, and Ivern was no different!

To do that, it felt right to give him a cruel and iron-resolved past, one where he didn't see the journey, but only had eyes for the destination.
