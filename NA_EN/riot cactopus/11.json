I wrote the champ reveal, so I'll take this one! I focused on the problems with his theme (creepy old gravedigger) in his reveal because I think theme is a really powerful factor in whether or not champions are popular. Obviously Yorick had other problems, and we didn't give him the attention he deserved. I think we feel pretty confident saying that we screwed up with the original design—his play pattern was flawed at its very core, and so we found ourself just making sure he sat close to a 50% winrate rather than trying to fix it with a torrent of changes. \n\nThat, honestly, is not a good way to keep League healthy. We realized that—this is one of the big reasons we started pouring serious resources into the Champion Update team(s). Sometimes changes to one or two abilities isn't enough to make a champ healthy, and we've gotta put more resources into it. You guys are right to hold us accountable when we let champs languish in an unhealthy state. Champ Update exists to make those champs better. Sometimes it takes us a while, but I think we're getting better at it.\n\nGonna have to leave for a bit.
