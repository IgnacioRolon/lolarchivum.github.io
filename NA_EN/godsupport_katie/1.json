How is it possible that someone whos meant to kill single targets and is almost full build supposed to kill me when i have so much armor. Its ok when ADcs do it because they aren't in my face and are safely killing me from a distance. So yeah riot pls nerf zed hes so OP because he can kill me and i never want to die in this game.","replies":[]}
