Let me break it down to exactly what is happening.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Character Selection is completed and the process to go into the new window screen of the Character loading screen, it takes about 10-12 seconds longer before that window is opened. Once its opened it remains a black screen for 30 seconds then turns into a Blank character loading screen. After 2-3 minutes passing it will finally load in but it takes forever for it to load to 100%. Once I even get in I notice my MS has gone from my normal rate of 40-60 to 90-120. Not sure why this is happening and riot support takes forever to answer.\r\n\r\nThe steps that I have taken to fix this was the xbox DVR, updating drivers and even using the client repair. I just downloaded the hextech tool to see if that will help. If anyone has any comments on how to fix this that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T23:30:41.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This black screen and delay can be caused by a weak or unstable connection that can't load assets or share information to you.  The steps that you've taken can certainly help with bad game files and hardware, but not your connection.

I've never had an issue with my connection ever. Everything else works fine. I've tried other games and I receive no issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-09T00:08:53.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope- at least not yet.  You should go over the steps in the connection guide.  Regardless of how good your connection works elsewhere, you can still have an issue reaching specific servers like the game servers.  Hope that helps clear things up.","replies":[{"poster":"x Aries x","date":"2017-03-09T00:49:23.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went through everything and still having the same problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-09T00:53:11.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sucks to hear, but I appreciate you trying.
