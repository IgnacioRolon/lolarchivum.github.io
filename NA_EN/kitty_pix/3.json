It was gifted to me by a friend on the 24th of March and I was able to used it up until this morning after I logged on. Any help figuring this out would be much appreciated, I really loved that skin!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-31T20:16:40.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pulled up your account to see if I could find out what exactly happened with your Forecast Janna skin.
