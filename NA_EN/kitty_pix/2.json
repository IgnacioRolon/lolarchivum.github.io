Here's a photo of just one Reader Log example http://imgur.com/a/dWxMu And that's not even the worst of it, I was unable to find the game where my ping reached heights of 3k. It's beginning to make supporting in high graphics teamfights a lot more difficult and I'm not a fan.\r\n\r\n I've even used the Hextech repair tool recently (for unrelated reasons, but it was used). I'm playing on a Mac laptop, so I know I'm not on the highest standard of gaming device but I used to be able to hover at around at least 75, 80 ping consistently. I'd love it if I could get it to 30 some day, but that's dreaming a little big considering I live so far from the NA server. #WestCoastProbs \r\n\r\nAnyways, any help would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-12T17:54:31.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy moly that packet lot is pretty extreme!  Being in the west coast should not do this, but a degrading connection can.  As far as network issues go, the HRT can help with auto-configuring firewall settings.
