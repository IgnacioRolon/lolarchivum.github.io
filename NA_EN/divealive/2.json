If we look at without any context for who is in the lane, my priority goes: Bottom lane then mid or top lane (both equal priorities.). Bottom lane largely because if you gank successfully, you suddenly have 3 players ahead in gold as oppose to the solo laners with just 2 people. \n\nBut that being said, its not so black and white. \n\nCase in point:\n\nIf I have a Miss Fortune in bottom lane, but an Irelia in the top lane, chances are my top priority is going to be ganking for the Irelia since that means she can get ahead then carry the rest of team. \n\nOr if I have a mid Kat, I'll be camping the mid lane to get her snowballing.\n\nOr on the flipside, if I see the enemy team has a Vayne or a Kalista or an AD Carry that can easily get out of control if left unchecked, then I'll shift my priority to keep them down. \n\nFor me the rule of thumb is the lane with the highest snowball potential is priority lane, whether its on my team or their team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alleo","date":"2015-10-04T22:32:58.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always assist your friendly neighborhood jungler.....unless he doesn't give any presence in your lane for the first 15 minutes of the game and lets you get ganked 4 times by the other team...then just build up your farm.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2015-10-05T22:28:30.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You jungler is not capable of \"letting you get ganked\".\nWarding your lane and playing around your wards is **part of laning** and if you cannot do that, then you **need to work on your laning**\n\n\"But I am mid, I have 2 sides to ward!\"\nThen ward **one side** and hug it [or ward both bc the shop has wards beyond trinket and sightstone y'know ], the only champion who can threaten you across the lane without stealth or leaving brush is Zac.\nIn that SOLE circumstance, pray to god Zac doesn't camp you cos u dun bbgurl","replies":[{"poster":"Alleo","date":"2015-10-06T02:24:00.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He can \"let you get ganked\" if you're in the process of getting ganked top lane and he decides its better to kill scuttle than come assist you too.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2015-10-06T05:58:18.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alleo,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=oEJ38Jyj,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2015-10-06T02:24:00.557+0000)\n>\n> He can \"let you get ganked\" if you're in the process of getting ganked top lane and he decides its better to kill scuttle than come assist you too.\n\nYou literally **EMBODY** the cancer attitude that this whole thread is here to complain about. \"oh the jungler better drop EVERYTHING he is doing to help me!\" and the classic \"even though i didnt ward for the gank, and not shove when my ward is on cd since im too greedy to buy extra wards, it is the junglers fault i died to the gank.
