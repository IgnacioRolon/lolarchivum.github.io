I'm not joking. Try it and see for yourself.\n\nWonâ€™t stop your baby bitch top laner from rage quitting out because he didnâ€™t get a gank at minute 2","replies":[{"poster":"FeedKaylePlease","date":"2020-01-27T19:57:35.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let him rage quit. If he is willing to quit because he is not getting ganks, it's more than reasonable to assume that he is a shit player anyway. \n\nI used to give in to the pressure and gank my team mates who beg but what usually happens is I have to literally baby sit them and when I finally get them ahead, if I don't sit on them, they will still fuckin lose despite the lead. Another thing that happens is that they can actually bait you into giving up a double kill. They get you so scared that they'll leave that you throw common sense out the window to gank for them when you should be completely ignoring them.\n\nEven if he rage quits, you still have a much higher chance of winning by ganking your winning lanes. You can get a winning lane so far ahead they can 4v5 the match. \n\nNEVER EVER give in to the pressure. Trust me. Ignore shit laners, mute them if you must. Let them fuckin leave if they don't like it, they are shit anyway. You don't need shit stains like them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sirus otter","date":"2020-01-28T13:37:12.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah as a jngler all you need to do is /muteall get one lane stupid ahead, ignore the lane thats loosing the most and the third lane just kinda show up occasionally and keep preasure but primarily just farm if your loosing the game overall. getting even 1 item up or a few lvls on the enemy jngler could really change alot.\nif your playing jng champs like ww who can easily solo drag after lvl 4, try and keep the enemy jng warded and put a pink on drag and solo it, who knows maybe the extra health regen from ocean will turn around a loosing lane. \nthe only thing you HAVE to do on jng if you wanna win is scuttle, drag, herald, and baron control.\nthat is your main job. you are the jngler and all of those things are in the jungle.\nim mediocre in the jng at best but even i can pick up a few easy wins keeping all this in mind, trying to do everything yourself especially when even just 1 lane is loosing really bad can be very stressful and you'll just lose if you try to hard to do everything.\ni reccomend trying to get bot lane ahead because then you get drag control always, and mid lane is a very easy gank spot if you always make sure one side isnt warded.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ablackrift","date":"2020-01-28T06:43:55.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is why i wont jungle anymore.{{champion:28}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2020-01-28T05:53:31.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a massive undertaking that would need a lot of xp changes, and we all know how riot is at xp changes lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProphetOfDraven","date":"2020-01-27T08:10:36.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clash is the only way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DONT NEEEED TEAM","date":"2020-01-27T16:53:44.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ur just  bad get good good jubglers continue to climb and win","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2020-01-27T11:16:49.119+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> -Im supposed to:\n> -gank all 3 lanes simultaneously by 3:00,\n> -never fall behind their jg in exp,\n> -always control both scuttles, drakes, heralds and barons\n> -match each of their jungler appearances per lane\n\nThat's fine, the other jungler is supposed to do that as well.","replies":[]}]}
