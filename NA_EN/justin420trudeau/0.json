I just have to make fun out of something as my own way of keeping myself away from anxiety, but try to make sure that you are someone who is doing well. I just gotta handle somehow the foolish things of society. It is still one of the  better attitudes to have rather than being constantly upset and giving the voice about it and identifying yourself with it.\nA somewhat more acceptable attitude is what you are looking for I guess and this could be a fine example, if not more. Maybe think about it yourself that what kind of attitude could be better than your own with the toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2015-06-26T21:02:23.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my record is 714 game chat ban.
