The word filter for Ranked Team names wont let me use &quot;Jurassic&quot; as part of my team name because it contains the word &quot;ass-&quot; \r\n\r\nI realize this isn&#039;t game-breaking, and yes I will most likely move onto a different name if this receives no attention but I had so wanted to call my team &quot;Jurassic 5&quot; as a homage to the band and because it fits so perfectly for 5 long time players banding together to play ranked 5&#039;s.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-09T17:54:45.862+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey DrJewFace, \n\n*(Sorry for the late reply, was talking to Competitive about this issue.)*\n\nUnfortunately, the naming system works by pattern matching off a blacklisted block of words, and 'ass' in included in this one, which is why it's not allowing you to use 'Jurassic' in your ranked team name.

Just got silly and frustrating and probably had a lot to do with why I quit playing it. Though their word filter was always active.
