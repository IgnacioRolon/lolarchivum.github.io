The reason i did this was because i wanted to play ranked solo queue but i was constantly being annoyed by friends who wanted to either duo or play normals, which i didn't want either. Anyways, it worked fine for quite a bit but now upon upgrading to the new client, there is absolutely no way for me to turn the chat servers on. Usually, on the old client all i had to do was undo the changes of the text file i modified, but now with Riot's new code, i can't find the same file and now i am permanently dc'd from chat. I have reinstalled the game, done full repair and none of that helped...  I know i fucked up by changing the file in the first place, but its almost like Riot's new client has caused a bug where i can never connect back to chat servers ever again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T22:16:30.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you are correct about modifying the game files! We don't support any kind of modifications since it could cause further corruption in other files, like this.\n\nIn order to use the chat features, you need to have a stable connection to our chat servers. This could be a simple issue of a closed port, which can be fixed by following our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Be sure to go over everything, but especially the Port Forwarding section.\n\nLet me know if this gets you back to chatting!","replies":[{"poster":"flying dildo","date":"2017-03-19T03:01:31.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it really a port forwarding issue though? I never had network issues connecting to the old client chat servers. Also im skeptical about port forwarding because it is a tedious process and i dont want to do it for nothing. if there is no other solution, i'll give it a shot though","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-19T03:20:12.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could definitely be a port forwarding issue! Since you mentioned you had altered the game files, there's no way for me to know _exactly_ what was done, but this is a solution that _has_ fixed this issue in the past. \n\nIt's due to the fact that our chat client has certain connections it has to make, and if you're able to connect to the client fine, it may be a certain port is being blocked as opposed to a bad connection.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
