But that's when it's supposed to be strong. Perhaps that with a slight boost to the finished product would make the most sense. Otherwise neither will get bought to be completely honest lol. ADCs would always go mercurial and AD casters would just be better off skipping on it. The completed Maw itself kinda seems to underwhelm as OK as it is.\n\nI'm still wobbling back and forth though between the above and just tapping the initial effectiveness. The immediate moment they rush it with fair farm it's strong then. As it should be though. Depends how much room the entire Maw has to grow to be an effective magic damage block before being OP itself. I feel like without hexdrinker having its current strength Maw would falter to make an appearance.\n\nWith a small hexdrinker nerf I'd probably buff maw to focus on its active properties (IMO hybrid offense defense items should have mediocre defensive stats but really strong active properties otherwise the actives just don't stand out too much)\n\n> MR 45 -> 40 or 35\n> AD 50 -> 55 or..?\n> upon taking magic damagethat would reduce below 30% life grants lifeline & grip (90s cd)\n> lifeline: grants magic dmg shield of 300 (+ 100% bonus MR) for 5 seconds -> increase the active shield so it's BIG at expense of 5 or 10 passive MR of the item\n> lifegrip: grants 20 AD & 10% spellvamp/lifesteal (stays same, would consider more sustain buff but keeping it subtle is probably wiser)\n\nThere should be tradeoffs between items but I feel like maw is trade offing itself too much out as a frequent choice with its low dmg. Lower passive MR means greater shield/active making it a good anti burst item but increases vulnerability to poking and something like a tank whittling them down.\n\nI guess I'm moving the item more towards ADC/Assassin rather than fighter. But honestly other than maybe Jarvan they seem to be the only one to use it much. I guess Edge of Night is supposed to be in that spot and I too for a while thought it could use less MR for more AD but now Edge of Night is a weird HP lite item","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2017-07-31T16:06:14.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fear the Sphere,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0Iwl8htg,comment-id=00030007,timestamp=2017-07-31T15:28:41.778+0000)\n>\n> The shield doesn&#x27;t even have to be removed entirely from Hexdrinker IMO, all that would be needed to put Hexdrinker in it&#x27;s place would be the removal of the shield scaling with level.

A 160 shield with 35 MR is unlikely to tank an Orianna ult, which is still one of the least damaging AP nuke abilities in the game. Syndra's ult for example (when optimally executed) has 450 base damage + 100% scaling. Ori has 170 base damage and 70% scaling with her ult, but a lot of cc with it.\n\nOri is not a nuke champion. She never has been. She can get ahead and nuke people but so can *any* mage, she's more about utility and aoe cc/damage instead of bursting a priority target. But **even Ori** can break the shield with her ult, as the damage that hexdrinker blocks is around 200, and she does well over 200 at lvl 6+ because of AP scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-08-01T14:44:03.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we are going technical, then fine.\n\nAt level 6 Orianna without Sorcs against a target with no bonus MR except Hexdrinker will need 157 AP to break the shield with the ult.\n\nAs for Hexdrinker's strength, at level 6, taking into the account the base MR, item MR, Ori's runes and masteries, the shield has 260 EHP.","replies":[{"poster":"Theorchero","date":"2017-08-01T23:52:23.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sraeg2013,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0Iwl8htg,comment-id=00030001000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-08-01T14:44:03.064+0000)\n>\n> If we are going technical, then fine.\n> \n> At level 6 Orianna without Sorcs against a target with no bonus MR except Hexdrinker will need 146 AP to break the shield with the ult.\n> \n> As for Hexdrinker&#x27;s strength, at level 6, taking into the account the base MR, item MR, Ori&#x27;s runes and masteries, the shield has 252 EHP.\n\nOri ult: 150 + 70% AP. \n\nHexdrinker shield: 160 at level 6.\n\n8 magic pen from runes, 15 from sorc shoes. 23 magic pen so 7 + 35 mr = 42 mr.
