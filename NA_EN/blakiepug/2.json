What I mean is he looks like the statue of a soldier/man now whereas before he was more imp-like. Usually when you think of gargoyles you think of that impish shape or of some sort of animal at the least. Nobody walks up to a statue of a historical figure and thinks \"that's a gargoyle.\"\n:/ Needless to say, I think he looks too different. Changing his colors would be one thing, but on top of that he gets a complete facial overhaul.","replies":[{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2017-03-06T22:33:40.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I doubt Demacia has the same concept of a gargoyle as we do.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2017-03-06T20:07:47.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blakiepug,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uNEnzmQw,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-03-06T19:59:14.988+0000)\n>\n> He doesn&#x27;t really look like a gargoyle though, just a statue of a buff man. :/\n\nI mean, WW looked like WW because he is still a beast character that seems kind werewolf like.\n\nPoppy looked like Poppy because she's still a Yordle with twintails.\n\nThe problem with Galio is that he's a statue. Lol.  So in order for him to look the same, he had to be the same kind of statue or else he just won't fit period.  While his silhouette isn't 1:1, they kept the fact he has wings and he has a tail.  Hell, they could have just said no to the tail.  Then there would be a REAL problem on him not being Galio.  Right now, he has a more Demacian look and architecture to him.  I imagine if they made Galio a Noxian, his rework would have given him a different color palette AND he'd be more gnarled in appearance.  It wouldn't be as \"smoothly\" chiseled. He would have been made with more edges and possibly fangs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Janna mìd","date":"2017-03-06T20:58:14.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valaran Nara,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uNEnzmQw,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-03-06T19:55:34.795+0000)\n>\n> I feel what happened to Galio is that he now looks Demacian.

Regardless of that, I feel that there probably would be less talk of his look if he had the same color palette as before.

It's true that having the same color palette would be pretty cool, but the real problem to me is his voice (and kinda his lines even if i heard like 3 of them, the \"i'm here you're welcome\" that's definitely something the old galio would never say (so his personality is a problem too))\n\nHonestly if they do an exception with him and make him a traditional skin, i wouldn't be too disappointed by that rework but if they don't well i'm gonna be salty about that for like 5 years seriously, I mean he got nothing in common with the old Galio we all know that","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-03-06T19:53:17.090+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eh.
