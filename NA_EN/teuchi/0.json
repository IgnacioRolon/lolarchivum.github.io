Your patcher is trying to access files and launch, but a setting in your OS might be blocking that from happening.  Running as administrator could be a quick workaround, but you may resolve this issue for good by following the instructions in our [Permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)guide.  That should get you fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"Teuchi","date":"2016-07-31T00:53:36.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did everything on this list and it worked for around 24 hours.
