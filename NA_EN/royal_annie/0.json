After which i'd dc, and when i try to restart the game, all i see is me getting to 100% and just saying my internet is disconnected. My ping is perfect I can watch youtube videos and go to websites but for some god forsaken reason cant rejoin the game. This has been happening on 3 occasions in the past 5-6 games I've played. Can someone please tell me if this is a problem on my end or not?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T23:24:34.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The gliding and weird animation can be an indicator that you've lost connection to the game, and ultimately leads to a disconnection if your network can no longer communicate with the server.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this resolved for good.  It would be best to test it out in custom games to make sure everything is all set, to prevent any leaver penalties.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
