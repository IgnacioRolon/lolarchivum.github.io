The skin looks REALLLY cool and I love it even though Im not a thresh player myself but anyways, everytime enemy thresh pops up on the minimap or you see him at all while laning the game freezes for a split second. My friend was also experiencing this same issue and we know it isn&#039;t our computers because we never had a problem up until we encountered Dark Star Thresh. Just wanted to inform you and hopefully this can be sorted out soon.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-17T18:55:56.515+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey CG AhriWaifu -\n\nThanks for taking the time to report this!

Will there be some sort of compensation? I mean, I bought the skin after a few hours it got released, played with it for a few matches and now it's turned off for days. :| feels kinda bad...

Before it was disabled, I had a Dark Star Thresh in my ranked game. It made League crash for him, and then bot lane had a 2v1, and gave up multiple kills, which made the top laner flame and afk too, and it was just a disaster. By the time Thresh had reconnected, it was too late. Though the top laner flaming and afking wasn't your fault, will there still be some compensation for something like this, or is it to hard to define whether a ranked game was lost because of this?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-21T16:47:01.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't something we're able to track, similarly to when we have ranked queue issues and Loss Prevention hasn't been turned on.
