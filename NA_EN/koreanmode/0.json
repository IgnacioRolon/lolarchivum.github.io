You just lost flash. There goes a good escape tool, a good killing tool and a bit more. At least for 6 minutes. The point is to make it so that  you can't screw up a input and lose a important thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-01-05T22:41:49.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah lets give me my ult back too.\n\nand redemption, and locket, and heal, ghost and clarity","replies":[]},{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2017-01-05T21:45:00.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just be more careful is all i can say. it happens, and you shouldn't get a freebie because you made a mistake. its not like flash is randomly going off without input.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Faie","date":"2017-01-05T21:58:55.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you saying that in the first 15 seconds when you can't use flash, for it instead to just not have a cooldown?
