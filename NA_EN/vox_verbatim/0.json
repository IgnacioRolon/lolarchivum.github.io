Instead, it will repeat the 2nd speed arrow (the double yellow arrow) or stop all together. I&#039;m not sure, but I believe the full force of the ability upon impact, is also being limited to the 2nd speed. I haven&#039;t notably seen this in the other skins, but the same problem may be present. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried running in circles, a single direction, back and forth in one line, and the Devastating Charge will either stop my character model from moving when it should go on to the 3rd speed, or just repeat the 2nd speed. \r\n\r\nAgain, I&#039;ve only really noticed this in the Arcade Hecarim skin, so it&#039;s possible it&#039;s just related to this skin.\r\n\r\nThis is really a problem when I&#039;m trying to chase an enemy champ down, and I can&#039;t reach my max speed. Speed is the key to the ponycopter, as we all know.","replies":[{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2016-04-01T00:39:46.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It hasn't been his day, his week, his month, or even his year :(\n\nEDIT: What, nobody's seen Friends? ...Arcade Hecarim is always stuck in second gear?","replies":[{"poster":"But Im Nunu","date":"2016-04-01T02:46:54.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess he's not the centaur of attention at Riot's HQ.
