Because the only \"fresh\" thing is the ammo mechanism use by for instance Jhin, which is said to have been prototyped by him, otherwise if you do even the slightest observation you'll see they're mostly just copying and ripping off other existing champ core designs and identities and then make nightmarish versions out of those existing designs who then are barely possible or straight up impossible to balance.

And that is truly pathetic.\n\nRead my other post on this.\n\nAlso, Zyra was co-work project from 3 designers so it's hard to trace the idea, Warwick's \"smell\" is from his original design (in fact, the only noteworthy addition that isn't mere extension from the things present in WW's original kit added by CertainlyT was ripped off from Volibear).\n\nThe rest of it are not new mechanics in the game, they are just ways of utilising other existing ideas. And double-crit or infinite free dashes is nothing groundbreaking, if that's the case then me playing with fire that accidentally set my house on fire should be labelled as an act of extreme intellect and not an act of stupidity; obviously not. \n\nAnd the others like soul-collecting are just typical designer work, I mean there were at least 3 infinite scaling champs before Thresh iirc, so remind me why they are praised on that basis again? In fact, Thresh's infinite stacking is the most contrived, because there is 0 intuitive and organic reason why he gets stacking armour from fucking souls (at least HP or MR would've made far more sense, but no, it's armour. It's clear they design not the champ as who they are, but merely someone to be fit into a part of the meta, that's not at all a mark of a good designer). Hell, why is Thresh even a support to begin with, was there EVER any part where Thresh is a good character or even a teamplayer at all, given they just kill people and then hide somewhere to play with their souls so why the hell is he a support? And why the hell does Thresh have almost the exact same kit as Blitzcrank?\n\nI also called him a rip-off artist because many of his designs overlap with other existing champs on a dangerous similarity, and you can see this because many of the rip-offs are poorly cobbled together messes from with well known identities on other champions with little cohesion or reason in general; it's like the guy literally do not know the logic of design and use things like pre-made packages instead of organically developing a cohesive champion kit that make sense.\n\nYeah, I'm not gonna be kind, but he to me very much designs like a fake \"game developers\" on Steam early access programs (good o' shitty Steam Greenlight or the even shittier Steam Direct). The only difference is that his pre-bought assets are shinier.\n\n**EDIT:** If you use FEK or whatever it's called, I think you might see that I downvoted you. I only downvoted you on the basis that you get upvoted despite some of the poor assertions and couple flat out incorrect claims (such as falsely attributing WW's \"smell\" to CertainlyT when it's there before the rework and designed by his original designer), which annoys me.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGoomyGamer","date":"2018-03-25T16:49:25.261+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"Now you're changing your stance from 'Everything is copied' to 'Nothing is completely groundbreaking', and in this scenario the two are very different.\n\nSome of your points are ridiculous.\nThresh and Blitz do not have almost the exact same kit - the main similarity between them is that they have a pull ability, but they work in vary different ways, and their other abilities are very different.\nIt is possible to be creative without coding entirely new mechanics into the game. Other champs having dashes doesn't make Kalista's dash and less creative, and double crit is a unique mechanic.\n\nI also fail to see how Yasuo is a carbon-copy of Riven. Their similarities are limited to having shields and being mobile (kit-wise), and having a three-stack knockup.\nYasuo has a resource that grants a shield (completely different to riven's shield, which is an ability with a dash)\nYasuo has his windwall, which is completely different from Riven's stun.\nYasuo's E works in a very different way compared to riven's mobility.\nYasuo's Q works as an AA, has a very short cooldown, can be used in multiple different ways (EQ for the circle) and doesn't grant him a dash/mobility.\n\nAlso, I fail to see how darius was a carbon-copy of garen.

It's filler.\n\n>The rest of it are not new mechanics in the game, they are just ways of utilising other existing ideas\n\nAgain, no provided proof or example. This sentence also does not carry a point nor does it need to exist. Making empty claims doesn't get anyone anywhere.\n\n>And double-crit\n\nNote that Yasuo was a 2 part reasoning, saying just 1 part of it makes it less effective thus you are taking it out of context. Also, double crit isn't groundbreaking but STILL unique, which is what my point what. He brought unique things to the table.\n\n>or infinite free dashes\n\nSo much wrong with this.\n\n1. Every dash is infinite. It just has a CD. Saying his dash is infinite due to its CD is very malicious in nature, because you don't list the fact that its one of the smallest dashes in the game, only able to dahs to enemies, and if not planned correctly can easily put you out of position.\n\n2. \"free\"? Because it doesn't cost mana or a resource means its free? A dash being free isn't just gonna be a Yasuo issue, this includes Tryndamere as well and more like Riven, who has more effective dashes than Yasuo in general.\n\n>accidentally set my house on fire should be labelled as an act of extreme intellect and not an act of stupidity; obviously not. \n\nThis analogy is so vague and unrelated that I honestly have no comment, other than I got the point that you think CertainlyT does stupid things and gets rewarded for them. In which case, is wrong.\n\n>And the others like soul-collecting are just typical designer work, I mean there were at least 3 infinite scaling champs before Thresh iirc, so remind me why they are praised on that basis again?\n\nSure I will. \n\nThresh soul collecting mechanic is NOT PRAISED FOR ITS INFINITE SCALING (like you think, which makes sense why you were downvoted because you take so much out of context its revolting) but because of its new way to introduce infinite DEFENSE scaling on a champion, which causes him to be better balanced to stay IN the support role by requiring killed creatures around him to drop them. Which BTW is a healthy RNG in the case of laning in bot lane because of minions having a 1/3 chance of dropping a soul. Comparing critical strike to Thresh soul mechanic is Good to Better and None to Good. Basically, Thresh only gets his passive to be useful by being dependable on the chance, while also having ways to ensure he gets a soul without gambling. \n\nTL;DR It's praised for healthy RNG, a new way to introduce infinite scaling on DEFENSE while also being balanced, and able to shove Thresh into bot lane. It's a genius passive, it really is.\n\n>because there is 0 intuitive and organic reason why he gets stacking armour from fucking souls (at least HP or MR would've made far more sense, but no, it's armour. It's clear they design not the champ as who they are, but merely someone to be fit into a part of the meta, that's not at all a mark of a good designer)\n\nRiot has shown that they will sacrifice balance for many things, such as diversity. This applies badly in most scenarios, but in this one it shows that even if it conflicts with your \"logic\" that it's for the greater good. Saying a good designer wouldn't do so is false, as a good designer wouldn't make the design broken or strong for such a reason. \n\nA good designer is someone who balances creativity and balance, not someone who forces his reality of things into the champion. Taking your logic and using it on champions, would mean Malphite has an insane character size, Naut will one shot people like Jinx (huge anchor being smashed onto a person by a giant titan? have fun dying) and A. Sol will be overpowered.\n\n>It's clear they design not the champ as who they are, but merely someone to be fit into a part of the meta\n\nRemember when I said your actions show who you are? I could tell you'd say something like this, as once again you over generalized very badly. You took one \"issue\" that supposedly showed him as a bad designer and managed to warp it into making it clear from (keep in mind, ONE thing) this \"issue\" that he is a bad designer. \n\n>Hell, why is Thresh even a support to begin with, was there EVER any part where Thresh is a good character or even a teamplayer at all\n\nThresh is a lock-down Warden with the ability to peel and go in for his support while also having to devote either going in/running out with his kit, making it so he has to have good decision making.\n\nAsking why he is a support is questioning his concept, which doesn't really make sense in this argument. He is a good teamplayer, able to peel his allies while stopping the enemies from going in too far. He can make much better saves, yet have much bigger failures and a large skill floor able to make the champion all around a good champion.\n\n>given they just kill people and then hide somewhere to play with their souls so why the hell is he a support\n\nThresh does not have goal of killing people then running away. You are describing a nonexistent playstyle which in no way helps your argument.\n\n>I also called him a rip-off artist because many of his designs overlap with other existing champs on a dangerous similarity, and you can see this because many of the rip-offs are poorly cobbled together messes from with well known identities on other champions with little cohesion or reason in general\n\nIt's sad you don't use proof to back up anything you say because I can literally say \"no proof, empty claim NEXT STATEMENT\" but that's mean, and I don't go that low like you have, talking shit about him with no restraint whatsoever. I do bad too but I don't do it knowingly and maliciously like this.\n\n>it's like the guy literally do not know the logic of design and use things like pre-made packages instead of organically developing a cohesive champion kit that make sense\n\nEkko, and Kled are likely one of the only champions to be on CertainlyT levels of unique, yet they do have glaring generic abilities tacked on. Making the claim that he uses \"pre-made packages\" then acting like it is fact is again, a bad look. All you're doing is saying \"he does this bad why doesn't he do this, etc.\" and while I don't mean to pull the \"why don't u try it\" card but WHY DONT YOU TRY DOING HIS JOB? He gets enough shit as is but when people like you downplay it and dumb it down with a tone that acts as if it's an easy job is justifying the playing of said card.\n\n >Yeah, I'm not gonna be kind, but he to me very much designs like a fake \"game developers\" on Steam. The only difference is that his pre-bought assets are shinier\n\nComparing him to infamous people does not do justice to anyone, and just saying his \"pre-bought assets are shinier\" is just again, rude and hurtful. He is a person too, it's like you people don't understand that behind the name \"CertainlyT\" is an actual person. \n\n>If you use FEK or whatever it's called, I think you might see that I downvoted you.

I did not think you would not only downvote me from you taking something out of context, but out of one thing? And bothering to rub it in my face?
