You can do some pretty neat stuff with his boxes. (Like Say, AFK farm spirits) And with his clone, he has a better time soloing the demon herald. \n\nGenerally, I don't care what champs you pick. But I usually hate the people who insist on grouping. (Unless it's to contest Herald) Since I don't find Shaco to be a particularly good teamfighter or duelist, I generally choose hit and run tactics. (sneak into jungle, farm spirits, get out, Get kill using bloodmoon buff, rinse and repeat.) I also hate it when my peeps don't make use of my boxes.
