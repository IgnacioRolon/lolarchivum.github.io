I made this thread in hopes that we could have friendly discussion about LuLu. I know that not the way her name is spelled,but I like it that way.\r\n\r\nLuLu is a champion getting love and hate from the community in any lane she plays. She&#039;s really frustrating when played top,but in higher ELO a really good support to play.\r\nI would like to hear from people who:\r\nA) Play as LuLu\r\n- What do you like in her kit? What ability do you think is the core for her? Which one is your favorite ability? Would you change anything?Does she fulfill her fantasy as whimsical sorceress?\r\n\r\nB) Play with LuLu ( as an adc,mid,top laner or jng)\r\n- What do you like about her? Do you think she&#039;s efficient? Do like her on your team?\r\n\r\nC) Play against LuLu\r\n- What&#039;s the most frustrating thing when play against her? Do you feel like she&#039;s fair or that you have enough opportunities to act?\r\n\r\n\r\nI know our opinions may differ,but please keep it civilized.","replies":[{"poster":"Otherworldz","date":"2017-08-21T12:18:44.190+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like Lulu as a champion like her lore and voice and stuff really appeals to me.\n\nThe issue with Lulu was the same thing with Thresh and current Janna.  Whenever Lulu is viable she is too much of a generalist who has an answer for every situation. Lulu is still really good but I am glad that she is not being abused with ardent censer the way that Janna/Taric/Sona/Soraka are. Janna has basically taken her place as the top tier generalist mage support but I think Janna is about to get nerfed to so we will see what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-21T13:44:03.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They were testing nerfs, but decided not to this patch because they are nerfing ardent censor.\n\n---\n\nA) I enjoy playing as Lulu a lot. My favorite thing playing as her is her E -> Q combo, where you E them and then aim from pix so that you can either snipe them from far away or try to hit two people. I also like using E on minions to extend the range on Q. Hugifying and turning people into little critters is also fun.\n\nB) I like that she has a lot of potential to catch people out or save people that have been caught out.\n\nC) When I am playing as a melee character it can feel hard to approach the carry when she is around because of her ult and W. It usually isn't the biggest deal to get her to blow her cooldowns, but it can be oppressive if you are the only one trying to go in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2017-08-21T15:44:26.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sums it up pretty much.One of the mains issues with her might also be that most of her skills are point and click.\n\nDo you think it's possible to make her more healthy without a rework or is it necessary?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Strawberries","date":"2017-08-21T18:34:00.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i love lulu! her kit is really unique and interesting.\n\ni havent been playing her much though, been abusing janna, lul. \n\nShe has a lot of early game power in a solo lane, just from her flexible kit. \nHer point and click damage with her e is really stupid though.. like a full ap lulu can basically just e someone and they die, lol. \n\npeople don't give shield supports enough credit. \"shield bot\" \"afk shield\" bla bla bla but dude, you wouldve died if i didn't flash ulti u, and chain cc whoever was on you. gosh. \n\nher polymorph is weird to me though, its not as point and click as her e, as the little spell particle has to reach the target to polymorph, and usually theyve already walked a little bit aways from me when i had casted my polymorph. \n\nshe's kind of a jack of all trades i suppose. shield, hard cc, heal, steroid, she got it. \nThey should make casting her e on enemy champions a little more skill based rather than point and click. or just nerf the range of it.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2017-08-22T08:01:52.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She could really use some skill expression in her kit.

We turn into a chargeable ability and at the end of the duration she throws it at a target location (similar to Ziggs R ,but with smaller range).It explodes in AoE and anyone hit is turnef into a critter. Duration  varies  from 0.75 -1.5  sec depending on how long you have charged it.
