It would be honestly really good on Soraka,as it could her allow her to play pro-actively instead of just passively.Tho with the new rune system (especially Aery) she&#039;s doing fairly well with maxing Q.\r\n\r\nGood or bad idea?","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-11-14T19:42:23.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As it stands Overheal looks like a good defensive rune for duo laners or junglers.

And the times you would want that instant shield from smite would be so rare that you would be better off with that 15% healing upon kills.\n\n I haven't had a chance to use it with a support who can heal, but with one it seems like it would be really strong at all points of the game.  Especially if the shield doesn't decay.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-11-14T21:25:02.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking more along the lines of the junglers taking the time for a lane that could heal him.  I actually forgot that the rune also helped heal the champ using it, even if only a little.  \n\nSame here, been wanting to play something other than a marksman I'm not lane and this rune looks like it will help that in spades but I haven't been able to get into a game in a few days to test it.  Seems stupid good for a bruiser + support.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-11-14T19:45:12.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably but if riot did that, they'd also have to find something to remove from inspiration and add to precision.","replies":[{"poster":"PokladnicaZla","date":"2017-11-14T20:16:20.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rune trees are mixed tbh.There's \nalready utility in offensive trees,what's one more?\n\nNot many supports even go into inspiration with curremt Aery's power.","replies":[]}]}]}
