People said it was to stop burst from the damage per hit mastery. \n\n\nWhy is this an issue? Renektons not exactly in a super strong place atm and he isn't autoattack focused either. Its jist that extra bit of burst.\n\n\nAlso why does shyvanna get to keep it? Her q hits multiple times at once too. And shes actually autoattack based","replies":[]},{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2016-09-06T08:59:21.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=OAf2RoXz,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-06T06:27:12.917+0000)\n>\n> We made this change intentionally in 6.14 .
