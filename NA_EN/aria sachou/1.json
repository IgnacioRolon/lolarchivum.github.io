It is near Season end, and the servers as well as connection issues are horrid.**\r\n\r\n**2. A lot of them often have problems where they suddenly spike in ping, and can't reconnect for a long time in games randomly. **Costing them the match. They have never in the last 2 years of playing league, experianced this type of lag, they all have very good internets\r\n\r\n**3. Massive lag spikes** despite them having 30-40 ping for the past 2 years, which can sometimes lead to #2\r\n\r\n4. **And entire teams dropping on one side while the enemy team never drops** just massive ping spikes distributed once sidedly, sometimes to both teams throughout the entire game. (blue would all lag, then purple, then blue again)\r\n\r\n\r\n**When Veteran players are scared and refuse to play your game after they hit a certain point, there is an obvious issue with the game**","replies":[]}
