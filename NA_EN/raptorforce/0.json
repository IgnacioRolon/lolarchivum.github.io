I play in my room, which is right next to the internet router (not in my room though). I can play League just fine, stream music from Pandora, and do a ton of other stuff to, with 0 lag. I play on a really expensive gaming laptop so naturally it should be able to handle this. When I stream to Twitch though, and have my music on, and League open, plus my Twitch chat (that's all!) I lag at 500+ ping, and so does my Twitch stream. This is really bad for me and I need a remedy, and fast. I have been considering using a wifi booster, or wifi extender to try and get a lower ping, but I don't know what to do. If I could  get any help on what to do I would really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRaptorforce9\r\n\r\nTwitch Channel: twitch.tv/raptorforce9","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-01-23T02:01:21.177+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Storming Plasma!\n\nI think that there might be some confusion here I could help clean up.  While the overall power of your computer determines how well League of Legends and other applications run, it has little impact when you are talking about streaming and your ping.  You only have a set amount of bandwidth with your internet connection that you can use.  Streaming music is perfectly fine when just browsing the web, as there are no other applications using a ton of bandwidth.  However, this coupled with League and streaming has exhausted your bandwidth to the point you are getting crazy intense ping.  Remember, streaming is a HUGE bandwidth hog.\n\nBecause of this, there is very little assistance or suggestions I can give you :(  It does seem you are using a wireless connection, which is inherently unstable.  You may want to try directly connecting to your Router/Modem with a wired Ethernet cord to see if that helps.  Beyond that, if you want to stream, you may need to upgrade your internet plan from your ISP to get more overall bandwidth.  \n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Raptorforce","date":"2015-01-23T17:37:11.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=U1B4sE2e,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-23T02:01:21.177+0000)\n>\n> Hey Storming Plasma!\n> \n> I think that there might be some confusion here I could help clean up.

Ill try to run an ethernet cable to my computer and see if that helps, or I'll just have to upgrade my internet. :)\n\n@Colgate Minuette\n\nI understand what you are saying, and believe me I have gotten a lot of hate already, but haters gonna hate, and I'm just trying to have some fun. I am trying to get better.

Don't complain on the forums about not having good enough internet to stream. \n\nEspecially since you're in silver, no one wants to watch a silver stream I'm sorry. I'm gana go back to watching diamond/master/challenger streams where I can actually learn from their play instead of watching someone who barely knows how to CS. \n\nNo offense but your win rate isn't that good, don't stream until you're WAY higher elo. Your lolking score is -62 that's far too low to even think about streaming.","replies":[]}]}
