You will never actually get to play him.\n\nBuuuuut yeah. I have AP Glyphs, armor seals, AD Marks, and MS quints for my Morde and start with the usual Relic, go into a TrinityPhreak from there, then a Rylai's, then either a Void staff or a Sterakk's, depending on if I need beef or damage, then usually the other, then a beefy item like a Spirit Visage for MR or a Dead Man's Plate for armor. Heavy AD means DMP, Heavy AP is SV. If it's about equal, go Visage if you need more sustain while DMP if you need more movement speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ace Access ","date":"2015-10-28T12:54:05.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why relic shield ?","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-10-28T13:41:21.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"relic shield bc he's a duo-lane champ, and if you're with a support who also takes relic shield it gives you lots of gold + sustain.\n\nZair's build seems legit, but i feel like Rylais is more essential than triforce.

Pick any item in the game to go into lane with.~~\n~~2. Go into any lane, as any role.~~\n~~3. Pick Q as your first ability.~~\n~~4. Hit someone with Q 3 times to kill them.~~\n~~5a. Laugh when your opponent dies so easily.~~\n~~5b. Get First Blood~~\n~~6. Repeat step 4 and 5a as needed.~~\n\n\nNo, on a serious note, Mordekaiser is a very fun and rewarding champion. When I play him (which isn't as often as I should), I have a couple of ways to play as him, depending upon the enemy team build. \n\nMost of the time, I like to go with a pretty standard Magic Pen / Scaling AP runeset, pick either Q or E first level (depending upon enemy champ), and harass as much as possible (that shield ensures you'll be relatively safe at early levels for quick harass). Also, for masteries, I like to go 21 - 9 - 0. Gotta' get the 3% increased damage from the Offense line, and the 3% increased HP from defense. Make sure you max Q first if you're in a solo lane, and be absolutely sure to get all three of those hits in, but don't waste that last hit on a minion at half or less health. Always prioritize champs with that third Q hit, but if there aren't any around, attack the healthiest minion nearby (that last hit will kill it usually, no prob. No point in wasting on a low health target). Also, I should note that you ABSOLUTELY NEED to buy Will of the Ancients. The health it gives you for the absurd damage you'll be dealing is wonderful.\n\nThe other way I build Mord (on occasion) is hybrid AD/AP. go 27 - 0 - 3 on Masteries (Movement speed in Utility, go down both AD and AP lines of Offense. Get Havoc at the end - obviously). For that one, I'll usually go with standard AD bruiser runes for AD (since the items are more AP based). Buy Gunblade AND Will of the Ancients for this line (Will of the Ancients doesn't give Spell Vamp, it just heals based off of a percentage of damage that you do with abilities). This Mord build has a higher damage output but it's riskier since you'll be innately less healthy. I also tend to only build damage focused items with this build. Of course, items like Rylai's or Bloodthirster/Trinity will still be good and help increase your survivability (Also, a note. If you build Trinity, Proc it on the first Q hit, then hit the second time. Before you hit with third Q, use your E to proc the bonus damage from Trinity again. You won't regret it).\n\nAnyway, I know that neither of these are too in depth of guides... but honestly, it's hard to build Mord wrong. He does so much damage with his Q, and with his ult doing % max health damage, you'll not have to worry about doing the most damage to enemy champs on your team. Anyway, have fun. Sorry I couldn't help more. (Also, Mordekaiser is my favorite champion :D)\n\n{{champion:82}}","replies":[]}]}
