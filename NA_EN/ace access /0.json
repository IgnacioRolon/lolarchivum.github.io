If you do not, he'll have a Visage and will be healing at 6% per sec (Base is 5%, 20% boost is 1% more) and will have about 4-5k health. That's 240-300 healing per second. You'll cut that by 40%, bring him down to a much more reasonable amount of 144-180 per sec. Quite a big decrease, though you can't even get that until your IE, PD, and BotRK are finished.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-11-18T19:13:16.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if your really haf problems with mundo, you can easily delay pd/ie by 800g for executioners...","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-18T23:06:44.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IE is usually your first item.
