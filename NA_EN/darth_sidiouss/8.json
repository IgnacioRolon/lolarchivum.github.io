Just remember to walk towards him if he starts q and charges you.  \n\nLevel 2 you will have jump. Now is when you try and kill him, back off a little or bait him to go for some minions. Repeat lvl 1 and then jump on him with q before he gets away.\n\nLvl 3 till triforce.  You cant fight him anymore, his pull will fuck you up if you try to go in.  If you ever see him blow pull then you have 18 seconds to harras him. q onto him, e hit him a couple of times and stun and get out.  Otherwise try and farm and call for jungle ganks, darius is actually stupidly easy to gank and kill.\n\nOther good champs are the standard top bullies like jayce and kennen.  Gnar is good but you need to be good with him or else he will catch you. \n\nalso obv dont fight him 6 unless you can stop him from getting 5 stacks, (jax with e (again be care), kennen with stuns, jayce with knockback etc)","replies":[]}]}
