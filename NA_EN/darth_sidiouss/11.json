You could have a perma 5v5 where you and your friends can just kill each other over and over while testing fun builds and never having to worry about minions auto ending the game etc.\n\nPractice tool is fun,  very useful and holds much potential :D","replies":[{"poster":"Palancar","date":"2017-02-15T19:50:58.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with everything here, but I would also like the ability to increase the level and revive the bots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-15T19:34:47.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking in your level should lock in the scaling of everything else.

Been practicing {{champion:98}} taunt flashes and would love to be able make it a bit harder. Right now the only way to get a moving target is by bullying the {{champion:51}} bot I almost always use.\n\nI would also like skins for the dummies. There are no Yasuo, Vayne, Jayce etc bots so i can't beat them up :( The closest i can get to destroying a champion i hate is Caitlyn bot but shes stupid as hell and piles all her traps on top of each other. Not very satisfying","replies":[]}]}
