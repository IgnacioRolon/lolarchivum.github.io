What about all this intentonal feeding ??","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its never the entire team as whole its ALWAYS this ONE guy who just decides to give up completely and int feed. Its so bad i rather have the AFK instead. Can we please like put these people in time out ? like such childish shit in this game i think its time you punish these players like children ! Lock em in the base if they wanna troll and int feed and piss off 4 other people who wanna win the game. There is currently no form of punishment within the game itself that punishes players in ANY way until after the match. And speaking of after the match anyone else feeling how unreliable the tribunal system is towards this behavior ?? i would post this crap in the moderation section but this shit influences the match so much its basically effecting overall gameplay.\n\nIn the two seasons i have played i received a notification from Riot only TWICE, that the player has been dealt in some form of matter. Mind you i report every single time something is wrong for actual legit reasons. Recent match this thresh dies 13 times absolutely for no reason and openly admitted it in chat ! he clearly states hes inting to force the game over faster and for us to surrender. But no. No action is taken oh i am on a losing streak ? oh i don&#039;t like the way lux commented on my 1v4 so i will int because the tribunal wont catch me ! seriously if more action was taken i STRONGLY believe this behavior would be reduced. If someone kills someone in rl and is found guilty that person is sentenced for YEARS we don&#039;t ignore it and say oh maybe lets wait for this guy to kill another person before we take action .. NO we deal with his ass right away cause hes clearly a problem and will be if not dealt with.\n\nI am not saying to just ban the player but put a time restriction like if hes been afking a much longer one than the afk to be exact so that the player can THINK and REFLECT upon his / her actions. And i would like to see a &quot;time out&quot; system implemented in the game itself. If they wanna act like children treat them like children. I assume some of the employees at riot games have kids yes ?","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2017-01-25T01:33:58.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to consider the fact that people have bad games. Sounds like to me, anything above 5 deaths in a 15 minute time frame is feeding. You did not state it but you somewhat imply that (not the specific numbers, just the overall feel)\n\nThere are times people have bad games and preform poorly in it. There are times I could either go too aggressive as Thresh and my marksmen and or jungler did not follow up and I ended up dead, I got caught out and died a few times, or sacrificed myself to save an ally. I have over 10 deaths, but it does not mean it was intentional. Riot does account for bad games and bad day(s) when they get reported for anything aside summoner name content. That is why most people do not get punished immediately.\n\nOn that note, you only get notified IF that report actually punished the player. If that player had played one more game and did get punished, you will not be notified. Your report has to be the deciding factor for the player to be punished, so that is why you only have gotten that twice for two seasons. \n\nAs for the in game punishment, that is not fair for anyone aside for the enemy team. A player: could be camped (when the jungler ganks a lane over and over again to feed their respectively laner); was just outplayed/outmatched/just barely lost that fight; may have spiking or poor connection that causes them to get killed in a short time frame; in just not as good as their respectively laner. Diamonds could probably get fed off of a bronze player in a match. Dies to him 4 times in 7 minutes. There is no way to tell if that is intentionally cheating. As such, in game punishment is not a viable solution.\n\nImagine if a player got punished for swearing. In a censorship, in sounds fine; in practice it is dumb because there is too many contexts where the swear could be deteriorating, uplifting or neutral. Example of uplifting- A Thresh lands a hook that allows one to shut down that somewhat fed Irelia, or maybe Sejuani used her ult to barely save you from that Talon. You express your gratitude that contains a swear. That player gets punished for the swear present. Context is needed in order to have effectively make decisions and that cannot be done with any system implemented for in game. \n\nEven with phrases like kys. It is possible for two friends to join up and one was addressing the other. They are friends so... it is okay? That depends on the recipient of the swear to make that call. Context is needed and as such, a in game system cannot work.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Sidiouss","date":"2017-01-25T01:47:43.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your right. The only possible solution i can see towards this myself is giving some sort of moderation power to players who have no history of toxic behavior which could lead to faster action from riots current system. I used to play Runescape years ago and they had these players who were called \"mods\" they had mod players and then actual employee mods and there was a sliver / gold symbol to differentiate them i believe.. but overall it was a healthy approach towards overall toxicity in the game and the mods were very very carefully chosen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-25T01:20:59.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no tribunal system, it was closed about 4 years ago.
