Im not using graphs or data im using mostly common sense and base observation. **\n\n{{champion:29}} {{champion:18}} &lt;---- Too the point these two first..  now before you get your panties ina bunch i personally won several matches today i haven&#039;t loss any matches due these two champions so you know im not complaining directly about them. This is to open the eyes of the community simply. Anyhow we all know that these 2 champions received skins in a omega squad theme along with other champions.\n\nNow if you were paying attention to the boards recently these two specifically along with draven here and there have been complained about on the boards note this is one patch after the released skins there was even a thread with a title of &quot;wasn&#039;t Tristana trash like a while back?&quot; something along those lines and the answer to that is yes and no. \n\nYES because nobody knew she was meta the people that are playing her right now AKA the sheep that follow every meta change or the people that strictly copy LCS players / High ELO streamers are now playing her obviously this is why she has traction right now in pick rate.    \n\nNO because from the tank update specifically there were several item changes and when items change champions perform differently as well and unless you know the champion thoroughly enough you wont exactly know how item adjustments change the interaction with the said champion. \n\nBut you know who knows these little bitty item interactions? Riot games so the question you ask here is :\n\n**&quot;Why didn&#039;t any marksmen receive changes during the mid season tank update despite all the item changes?&quot; **\n\nill tell you why because they know whats already over-tuned post changes. How the fuck do i know? because its all part of their little marketing strategy. Basically in layman&#039;s terms its like me making a cell phone that is built to last 2 years at best but in reality i am giving you an imperfection really because in reality as well i have the ability to come out with a phone that lasts perhaps 10 years.. and how do i look making money per 10 years rather than 2?? so what Riot does is they leave the champion over tuned purposely at first barely anyone notices unless its a very popular champ but come the skin promotion naturally the playrate alone im assuming would go higher than average. At this time people then see the champion is strong and the play rate gains traction and when things do get out of control Riot rushes in to the safe the day naturally the usual shit. Nerfs happen and rinse , repeat. $$$$\n\n{{champion:51}} &lt;--- No brainer receives an ultimate skin and around the same time was well over tuned and even had complaints before occasionally on the boards i personally remember reading almost every single one of them.  Now why did Riot step in AFTER the sales and AFTER the playrate boomed despite having no buffs prior to the tank update or post. Because they knew exactly at what position she was at to begin with that information that me or you regularly would not know they have already. It is a pattern that does not stop.\n\n{{champion:202}} {{champion:91}} &lt;---- My personal favorite example they buff lethality and drop a blood moon skin line that has 2 champions in it that were also directly benefiting off the lethality changes themselves.\n\n{{champion:154}} &lt;---- Gets an SKT skin around the time frame of being OP.\n\nNow not every champion that gets a skin is associated in the marketing behavior. I am assuming here it is because it would then become too _obvious_ in pattern. I believe they plan this MONTHS before like farmers planning to reap a harvest. At heart i love playing this game but seeing these patterns over and over season 7 specifically (i didn&#039;t pay much attention to season 5 or 6 to this crap) is just revolting to say the least but as a community you need to tell this company to stop this non sense keep game balance NOT associated with skins at ALL.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2017-08-19T21:12:16.132+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"yet Ezreal is getting a new skin while being one of the worst champions in the game and many other champions get skins are they don't get buffs or are in any way meta or broken.

This is a genre in which even comparatively small things can snowball into winning games, so if a champion or build are slightly too strong it can have a net positive effect on winrate even if we assume equal skill of two players on different champions. There can be a psychological aspect wherein you perform better on someone you're comfortable with, but since they're not a majority they can't explain why it is when many champions become popular they maintain an overall 50%+ winrate, which can only happen if they're above the curve in terms of strength when you're less experienced. \n\nChampion strength and the strength of builds can influence a game as much as people can, no matter how contrarian you want to attempt to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Cowseed","date":"2017-08-19T19:58:12.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personal skill, knowledge and confidence can impact your performance though.
