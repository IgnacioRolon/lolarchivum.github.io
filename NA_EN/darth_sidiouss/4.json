HOWEVER the damage is ridiculous and it was very hard to kill him but i think riot games has gotten the scarecrow wrong all along perhaps he was never a jungler like the way his kit is set up and everything he is more of a mid laner and im willing to bet $$$$$$ that the people who originally asked for fiddle buffs only play him mid or know the history of the champion well enough to abuse his current foundation in the mid lane rather than the jungle. But seeing the effectiveness of him being mid than jungle REALLY makes me question the balance team..\n\nDoes the balance team really question OTHER lanes the champion can abuse when being buffed? \n\nIm going to say NOPE because of what i experienced and looking at OP.GG anything with 60% is just beyond cancerous and those are only the nerds who acquired the play style first..

He has no escapes he is too slow.\nHe won't make it to korea nor the LCS because he would get stomped. \nLike others said, his playrate is so low, it's only OTP playing him. He is not easy to play right and thus I doubt he will pop off like lulu. Besides that, Lulu is strong in synergy with on-hit adcs that's part of the reason she came back. Fiddlesticks doesn't really have such synergy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GankedByWindows","date":"2017-03-25T00:24:52.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people were.
