The contract is most likely 100% with no room for \"working around boundaries\".\nEA expects to make billions off of that deal, which is precisely as much as Disney would have to pay them if they were to break the contact.\nI'm sure Riot already tried talking to them, as much as I am sure that they got shut down or confronted with an unreasonable offer.\nThese companies don't fool around when there's literally billions on the field, so unless Riot hands over a fortune of the revenue (and probably a lot upfront as well) it won't happen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2017-02-19T02:47:12.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm hoping Irelia will get one when she finally gets her VGU.\n\nWeilding multiple lightsabers with the force?
