Luckily, we’ve broken a few systems in our day, too. So we specifically built Honor so potential exploits like this give you (and your friend) literally no benefit.\" \n\nI understand the idea behind not letting people get around the honor system this way, but in doing it this way, you are forcing people to pick between playing with their friends, and getting/maintaining honor. I feel this is a massive flaw in the honor system, because i personally want to play with my friends, and love playing with full premade teams, be it in ranked or normals, just because we get to do silly stuff like 5 smite, but I also would like to get honor. \n\nAs far as my questions, will there ever be an time when we can honor enemies, and can we honor multiple people? I have already had multiple games where I want to honor more than just 1 friend, as well as some of my enemies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nathan Prescott","date":"2017-07-05T22:03:06.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor levels are not instantly granted, but instead is a gradual progression as you play your matches","replies":[]}]}
