The carries (Usually Bottom and Mid) need the most gold and exp so they generally take priority of minion waves (when a support has Spoils of War charges they should actually have priority for the use of those charges). Junglers still maintain the most benefit from jungle camps because they get the most experience and sustain from them. If your jungler is on the bottom side of the map and you see a minor camp is up on your way to shove out top side, .. by all means, take it.","replies":[{"poster":"Potato Doc","date":"2018-08-29T21:53:02.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Laners so often \"claim\" any and all lane minions, regardless of the time of the game.

Priority should go to the carry because they generally have better wave clear and gain the most benefit from gold. \n\nOtherwise, if the tank is the only champion in range to get a wave, they take it. This is actually an advantage of split pushing. Your team is more effectively dividing resources and applying pressure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kats Pajamas","date":"2018-08-30T12:21:19.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Potato Doc,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9b5g5AEl,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-08-29T21:53:02.930+0000)\n>\n> Laners so often &quot;claim&quot; any and all lane minions, regardless of the time of the game.

You can&#x27;t ignore that even after laning phase. Also im talking more about me interacting with the camp and they steal it, not any camps across the map.\n\nThis is probably because, generally speaking, laners carry the jg.\n\nI've seen Faker given countless camps, and then in soloq we get jgs like you who get mad if I steal 2 small wraiths to save 30 seconds for my largest powerspike.\n\nYou just say me jg my camps me. Do you care to know what the trade would be if you gave the camp away? No? Oh ok.\n\nThe best part is when I steal 2 wraiths and the jg complans, and acts like they didn't hover mid 1/3 the game and passive leech my xp, I don't even get a choice in the gold/experience you steal from me? LOL. Jgs that want to win don't cry about camps nearly as often. You also think you're justified to tell me to fuck off and that it's your camp, when there are a lot of jg that try to shove their camps down my throat they want to share so bad, so really, nothing is special about you taking the camp unless you 1v9. If you selfishly horde your camps and lose, maybe consider 'teamwork'.\n\nI've played jg in diamond elo and hit 30 assists before 15 farm with pantheon, _but you need your camps._\n\n90% of the role is ganking, not farming. Jg is a proxy damage support. You should be dying at opportunity to give away camps. Normally just giving my scuttles to mid laner alone causes a 3 level advantage, instead of the natural 2 level advantage. \"Funneling\" has been meta for whole seasons and you think sharing a camp is a bad strategy? LOL. This is a message to every jg that thinks all the camps are theirs. Not just you. One of the single greatest strength cheese first bloods I've ever got consistently is giving ADC red. It started naturally by accident, but then I saw if I just gave winning matchups red, they won even faster. Combine with a gank, the enemy normally never assumes is coming when the ADC has red, you pretty much can force entire lane decisions with single camp donations. JG passive(On your jg tool) that gives you bonus xp for being lower level, is almost designed this way for helping catch up after donating camps.\n\n\nEdit: you literally only play carry on hit jgs tho, so, it's not like you probably even know how much power laners even can get, while minimizing your losses. your roster speaks for itself that you're terrible at that. The best way to play jg is as a support, and you prioritize it as a carry position, and now you're bitching about farm, (how predictable right :P).","replies":[{"poster":"Potato Doc","date":"2018-08-30T14:42:11.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right gold 5 played in diamond and got 30 assists before 15 farm XD you funny bro \n\nAny good jungler would abuse the fact you weren't farming by invading and preventing you from leveling\n\nNice shitpost","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zed genius","date":"2018-08-30T09:02:15.446+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a trap I'm telling you.
