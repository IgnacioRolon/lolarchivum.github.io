And Lee Sin? It roots the target for a quarter-second before the knockback, which acts like a stun for the duration *as all knockbacks do.*\n> While most of these arent quite as applicable as the veigar stun, or even more so the Azir wall, since they arent quite the same effect, its easy enough to see riot has a ton of \"reapply\" mechanics to the game.

It's not really much of a choice, more a gauge of your reactions to a specific situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Potato Doc","date":"2015-11-29T15:47:31.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dont choose to be CC'ed by their abilities. It just does it. \nBy having patience you can avoid any CC by poppy from her W\nLike veigar as you stated you choose to walk into it (not always but most of the time). You choose to be stunned and be on the edge, or stay in the inner circle. A fair trade off, but the stun duration on veigar's stun is much longer.\nViktors G-Field comes up so quickly unless you have a dash or blink you dont choose to be inside it. \nYour argument is assuming everyone is Faker, and even Faker gets stunned or locked up by those abilities\n\nYour argument for Galio it used to be that you couldnt use QSS on it because you would just get re-taunted however I already went over why they changed that.\nI do remember the double stun with viktor, never really had an issue with it. I could see why Riot would change that but at that point it is the persons choice to stay in the area.  Still in this case a person could attempt to flash or dash out to avoid a second stun if it was still in game, which would cause them to avoid the second stun. Only problem would be the duration of the stun, when compared to poppy's W the CC is around .25 enough to stop a dash, but not game breaking by any means\n\n\nGoing to what you said about being balanced around an ability hitting multiple times, its funny how you think .25 second stuns that requires YOU to make the decision of using your ability or not, and if you do use the ability having it stopped, isnt balanced if it applies more then once.  \n\nWhat makes this move so great is slows are so tough against champions like udyr and singed who dont have a single dash and rely on small MS buffs to get around. Does the enemy team have an ashe? Well its not my choice if shes able to perma slow me if she caught me out and with the amount of MS ADC get these days its so hard to turn on an Ashe as an Udyr without flash. Its just one example (not including how easy it is for mages to buy ryalis). When compared to slows against non-dash melee champs without a means of cleansing the slow in their kit (garen and olaf are examples of this) this argument you put up is so silly. You have poppy whos aura, which is only 400 distance around her and only lasts for what im seeing as 2.5 maybe 3 seconds, and requires you to use a dash, which if you wait the 2.5 or 3 seconds, or to flash out, and it only affects dashes not flashes blinks or untargettables or unstoppables, it seems more then fair, plus most champions don't even have more then 1 dash in a time period, the champion pool it targets is even more limited at this point, but riven and yasuo can negate slows through dashes.

However, you can't walk in, QSS it, walk out, walk back in and get taunted again. That was the example.\n> I do remember the double stun with viktor, never really had an issue with it. I could see why Riot would change that but at that point it is the persons choice to stay in the area.  Still in this case a person could attempt to flash or dash out to avoid a second stun if it was still in game, which would cause them to avoid the second stun. Only problem would be the duration of the stun, when compared to poppy's W the CC is around .25 enough to stop a dash, but not game breaking by any means\n>\n> Going to what you said about being balanced around an ability hitting multiple times, its funny how you think .25 second stuns that requires YOU to make the decision of using your ability or not, and if you do use the ability having it stopped, isnt balanced if it applies more then once.  \n>\n> What makes this move so great is slows are so tough against champions like udyr and singed who dont have a single dash and rely on small MS buffs to get around. Does the enemy team have an ashe? Well its not my choice if shes able to perma slow me if she caught me out and with the amount of MS ADC get these days its so hard to turn on an Ashe as an Udyr without flash. Its just one example (not including how easy it is for mages to buy ryalis). When compared to slows against non-dash melee champs without a means of cleansing the slow in their kit (garen and olaf are examples of this) this argument you put up is so silly. You have poppy whos aura, which is only 400 distance around her and only lasts for what im seeing as 2.5 maybe 3 seconds, and requires you to use a dash, which if you wait the 2.5 or 3 seconds, or to flash out, and it only affects dashes not flashes blinks or untargettables or unstoppables, it seems more then fair, plus most champions don't even have more then 1 dash in a time period, the champion pool it targets is even more limited at this point, but riven and yasuo can negate slows through dashes. Seems more then fair to have those dashes entirely cancelled out for what is a short time period, \n\nDo you always compare apples to giraffes?\n\nUdyr or Singed vs. Ashe is evened out by many things--CC reduction, slow reduction, both champions have higher base MS *and* innate MS steroids--that allow them to overcome this problem in solo situations, not to mention that team fights generally make it easier for them.\n\nRiven or Yasuo getting multi-pinged by Poppy's W is not something they can counter. They have 3 options. (1) Never go anywhere near Poppy if they can avoid her (good luck if you're top lane). (2) Wait out the duration of her W (only works in 1v1 situations). (3) Flash (5 minute cooldown).\n> Going back to the original argument of it not being consistent with what riot has done, this is absolute bogus if you actually know the history of this game.

I mean, I have 260ms reflexes and that's considered slower than the average gamer. *I've grown up on video games* and my natural reflexes are slower than average.\n\nActually it is, go watch challenger level play and you still see people with slow reaction speeds and incorrect reactions. [Took](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bioPlmDvvfM) me about 30 seconds to find a video of a super high tier player who has slow reaction time through google. Even nami's ult which looks painfully slow when you aren't playing causes people grief in trying to avoid it. If we expected people to correctly react within a half second at every single point in the game, skill shot speeds would be in the 5000's to allow people to actually hit them. The only people with always half second reaction times are scripters... and faker (i joke on this one)\n\nIf you still think it is fine to assume everyone can always do .5 second decisions and make them right im done with this argument.\n\n> Do you always compare apples to giraffes?\n Do you always make humongous and erroneous comparisons to try and lower peoples validity? \nThe argument isnt apples to giraffes its more akin to zebras and horses, similar but not entirely.\n \n> Udyr or Singed vs. Ashe is evened out by many things--CC reduction, slow reduction, both champions have higher base MS *and* innate MS steroids--that allow them to overcome this problem in solo situations, not to mention that team fights generally make it easier for them.\n\nThe jokes you make are funny XD, team fights for singed and udyrs, oh wait... You clearly dont understand how those champions are supposed to be played. Ever see Pro play? Very few udyr or singed and for a very good reason. They are better split pushers not team fighters. They specialize in putting pressure around the map, meanwhile in Pro play you see almost every game is based around team fights. An example of this was the master singed player himself SilSol. Would have games where he would go 0/12 yet his team would dominate. Why is that? Because he was putting pressure on the map and his team acted accordingly, He almost never played with his team, expecting his team to make the appropriate plays. There are many most examples but I think this one suffices\n\nAs for the fact that the \"many\" things you said like CC reduction allow them to over come this problem in solo situations then obviously your elo is showing. For an udyr to escape an Ashe with them being on equal grounds in kills, without being poked into oblivion, the udyr has to have mad thinking skill. And thats just escaping, not including trying to get a kill. Anyone who plays udyr a lot knows the rage when they face an Ashe its just that bad. In higher elo its even worse.\n\n> Riven or Yasuo getting multi-pinged by Poppy's W is not something they can counter. They have 3 options. (1) Never go anywhere near Poppy if they can avoid her (good luck if you're top lane). (2) Wait out the duration of her W (only works in 1v1 situations). (3) Flash (5 minute cooldown).\n\nDo you always assume when the choice is up to you on if you waste your dash or play it smart that its a counter?. You also assume this game is entirely 1v1's if it was then your argument would be more valid but... \n\nHere ill change your list for you\n1.) Never go near poppy until they baited the W out\n2.) Wait out the duration of her W. They do have other abilities that they can use, and both have massive AD steroids that they can use for auto attacks, much like when their abilities are on CD they can and will be able to do something if they think calmly about it.\n3.)Flash(5 min cd unless you include riven with boots of lucidity/mastery to lower SS CD which both riven and yas can get)\n4.) you realize yasuo only has 1 ability that is countered, unsure if poppy's ult can be stopped by windwall, but you realize your ult and Q still work. Plus on the 3rd Q it knocks her up allowing you to escape or deal more damage.\n5.) Realize this is a team game and both Yasuo and RIven excel at team fights given they follow up their team, they shouldnt be aiming for 1v1's if they are just that afraid of poppy. Just like how a Fiora is just obliterated by a Renekton this isnt out of the ordinary with having champions just oozing full of counters to other champions.\n\n> Riot has made abilities that require a target to be under specific effects before you can use them (ex. Twitch's E), so it's not actually their first time doing that. It's not even the first conditional ultimate, as Katarina's requires you to be in range before you can cast it (unlike similar AoE channels that let you use it at any time) \n\nYou used to be able to use Twitch's E and Kat's ult whenever you wanted, the only reason they limited it, (same reason azir can only get 1 ability at lv 1, and zilean cant take his time warp at lv 1) is to prevent people from accidentally using it when it would just hit nothing/do nothing. When comparing it to nunu which takes time to build damage and can be used for an ambush, or maokai who can use it without others nearby to avoid damage from a skill shot or for allies too, it makes sense because the only thing those 2 abilities do (twitch and kat) are damage and twitches is instant, and kat's is consistent damage. Also neither of those \"conditions\" are \"the opponent is CC'ed\" and neither is a very specific form of CC, and neither isnt possible to be up at any time like how yasuo requires 2 of his Q before hand to knock up or have another ally nearby that has a form of knock up. There are more examples I could give but yet again I feel like this is enough.\n\n> Double passive on the passive slot? Sure, it's the first explicit double-passive, but it's not the first passive to have multiple effects, nor the first champion to have multiple passives.\n\nNever said other champions didnt have multiple passives from other abilities, but starting the game at lv 1 with a possible 3 passives is pretty big in terms of power. Not only that the passives included for Yasuo are huge as is by themselves. When compared to other passives that are much more lack luster early game Its surprising they allow it.\n \n> Because they specifically made it so Cleanse can't remove Suppression. Otherwise, if an enemy ever picked a suppression, you could auto-counter them without any real cost.\n\nSo im going to relate this to CoD MW2 heartbeat monitor and the perk ninja. I would take HBM on that game only to force my opponents to use ninja. Did I need it? Not at all, but it caused a conundrum for my enemies, do they take ninja and not be seen? Or take a more useful perk and not be seen. In this game it would be the same thing. Do you pick a suppression so the enemy has to take cleanse and lose out on either a.) flash, or b.) ignite/exhaust/whatever else they want. Do they take cleanse in the game? Or just wait out till QSS is able to be bought? In all honesty its just easier to pick up {{item:3139}}, which any bruiser or adc can build early without too much repercussion. You might think otherwise but in the end its a bit silly cleanse doesn't do that. Before grievous wounds was re-released many complained about how OP it was and that it was at no real cost to counter people like mundo and swain, but we still see people choosing LDR instead, why? Because it just isn't as useful when comparing 4 other champions to 1, there is a trade off, and you act like there wouldn't be. There totally is.\n \n> There's a significant difference between inconsistency and differing implementation. All of the things you called \"inconsistent\" are actually consistent with their past design principles applied in a different way.\n\nIt is easy to say now looking back that it is applied differently, but at the time they came out they were radical changes. I don't know another champion that stuns at the beginning and at the end of a knock back like lee sin, or like how he has two abilities for each normal ability, that requires you to use the first ability to allow you to use the 2nd ability. Nidalee was a huge inconsistency when league first came out with being able to change form from a ranged to a melee with different ability timers and skills. There are tons of other champions who are \"inconsistent\" with the normal build patterns. Talking abilities, Bard, enough said. If I have to explain how just about every part of his kit is so radically different from others and how they introduced new patters of use then I deem this argument over. However, Instead of calling it inconsistent though we call it innovative because this game evolves, it changes, it has to. We can and should implement new ideas such as multiple application of CC when its under the decision making of the enemy not the user. Following in line with your previous quote this is just being \"consistent with their past design principles\", being innovative.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shyvauni","date":"2015-11-29T16:00:26.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Veigars stun can proc twice and is not a bug there is a time delay between the 1st and second stun","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2015-11-29T20:09:05.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Event Horizon can only stun a unit once per cast.
