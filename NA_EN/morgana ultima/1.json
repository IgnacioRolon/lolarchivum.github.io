I sure love going 4/0 in lane only to have every other lane feed out of control like 8 games in a row.  Lots of fun.  I sure do love losing LP because of these kids too.  What a great ranked system!  Let's not take personal performance into account at all! Genius!\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder people just quit this game?  Not everyone wants to play 2000 games per season to coin flip games to diamond.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-06-04T00:57:18.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking up a necro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2018-10-23T03:30:37.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"According to the community \"It's never your teams fault, only YOUR fault YOU lost, should have played better and carried yourself\" meanwhile, whenever i bring up the fact that I lost lane to riven because she has had 16 ganks by 10 minutes (no, this is not an exaggeration, I've actually had this happen to me) \"it's a team game bruh\" I really don't understand this community, seems no matter what you say, your just crying because your bad\nTBH I don't even think the players know what this game is supposed to be anymore, as the ideas i hear always conflict with one another, just like a certain book\nEdit: Just an FYI, i understand learning from your mistakes to improve yourself as a player, but when im in top lane and lucian down in bot feeds 10 kills in 5 minutes, its not my fault, I can only tp once every 360 seconds (6 minutes) and letting irelia free farm while i keep walking bot is not a good idea","replies":[{"poster":"2 Weezy Baby","date":"2018-10-23T07:06:09.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xavanic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fehvbLjj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-23T03:30:37.586+0000)\n>\n> According to the community \"It's never your teams fault, only YOUR fault YOU lost, should have played better and carried yourself\" meanwhile, whenever i bring up the fact that I lost lane to riven because she has had 16 ganks by 10 minutes (no, this is not an exaggeration, I've actually had this happen to me) \"it's a team game bruh\" I really don't understand this community, seems no matter what you say, your just crying because your bad\n> TBH I don't even think the players know what this game is supposed to be anymore, as the ideas i hear always conflict with one another, just like a certain book\n> Edit: Just an FYI, i understand learning from your mistakes to improve yourself as a player, but when im in top lane and lucian down in bot feeds 10 kills in 5 minutes, its not my fault, I can only tp once every 360 seconds (6 minutes) and letting irelia free farm while i keep walking bot is not a good idea\n\nYou just have to win your lane even harder than. Can't climb if you aren't stomping your lane every game. Sometimes you'll lose, but more than 50% of the time you'll win if you can win your lane every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2018-10-23T08:17:36.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=2 Weezy Baby,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fehvbLjj,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-10-23T07:06:09.003+0000)\n>\n> You just have to win your lane even harder than.

under the tower and if I so much as look at them the jungler rushes to their aid since their 10/0 jinx doesnt need any lane pressure at this point since even if my jungler ganks that lane, jinx just turns it into a triple, this is a big issue, now your going to probably tell me, \"oh if their sitting under the tower, go roam and pressure other lanes\"...this sounds good in theory, but lately this is a bad idea, i left lane a while ago to go help another, just to see my lane get taken down all the way to the inhibitor by a herald (ive done this a few times too, if mid roams you can damn near take their inhib if your jungling) its impossible to solo win the game unless you play something like kai sa or vayne now a days, you need your team to work together but tilucian is refusing to cooperate now because he's 0/10 and according to him its all mid lanes fault for not roaming bot so now he's just afk farming until we lose\nOverall, this game is ENTIRELY decided by your teammates now a day's, there is no winning your lane harder, since they will just play safe under turret, and to be honest, this is not good game design anymore, damage NEEDS to be pulled back, so snowballing isn't as big as it currently is before we can really see some proper gameplay return","replies":[{"poster":"2 Weezy Baby","date":"2018-10-24T09:14:01.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">

the time to play all day every day I could prob hit master, this game isn't about skill anymore, its about how much time you have to play it, but people like me have this thing alot of higher elo players tend not to, its called a job, it really sucks since it eats up your free time but you need to do it, or you don't get the money to buy a food or pay your bills, i mean i could have been 22 and still living with my parents, but tbh, that's just pathetic, plus i see the ideal in being part of my community as well and helping out\nOverall, this game has gone down the shitter, i only play once in a while and even then, I really don't have much fun, losing a game because someone on the enemy team (usually the adc) snowballed and became too much to handle since marksman, (especially kai'sa) have so many defensive options, it becomes too much to handle alone, and since your relying on the people you call your team for that game to assist in killing the adc, (the people who chase sion all the way to his tower then get caught and give the adc 4 more kills, even after you ping them dozens of times to stop chasing) they usually don't get focused and you lose the teamfight since everyone focused the tank for some fucking reason while their adc went straight for the backline unopposed\nOverall, I've been learning from my mistakes, while others....apparently have not been, but please, assume I'm not climbing because of my mindset, it's really not, it's just the fact the people I'm usually being put with on my team are surely in the wrong elo","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kazoo Soloist","date":"2018-10-23T03:34:32.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">
