","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":60,"down_votes":5,"body":"I really feel like itemization is weak in this game.  When I play Morgana I build the same damn items every single game.  The order might change depending on the matchup, but its the same core items every single time.  \n\nIf I go play dota 2 as say Invoker the items I rush will depend on the team comp and matchups.  The items are powerful in that game so if you need mobility you can get an item that gives you a huge teleport.  if you need CC you can get an item that lets you turn shit into a pig/sheep so they can&#039;t cast. Every game is different.  \n\nIf every single Zed is going to take electrocute, and build duskblade then why not just put those things into his kit and remove the items and runes entirely?  It&#039;s almost as if the concept of item builds and rune choices are really just an illusion.  \n\nIt is this lack of choice which creates this cancerous meta with the same brain dead play over and over and over and over.  If there were more serious itemization choices then you could out think your opponent with your build.  Hour glass is an absolutely amazing item for that reason.  \nGeneric item that gives +AP and some other crap is not.  \n\nFlash is not a choice.  Ignite is not a choice (because teleport too op or some shit must nerf)\n\nYour runes are really not choices.  Wanna guess which inspiration rune I have to take every single game because of this current meta?  Hint: its a stopwatch.  Surprise! Look at how clever and thoughtful I am.  \n\nRight now we have several brain dead easy champions in the game entirely because their first item every single game without any thought or intelligence is duskblade.  Zed. Wukong. Talon. Rengar.  Khazix. Nocturne.  All have kits that attempt to one shot people, and with duskblade it is completely possible.\n\nSo what does that do to mages?  Every single game: Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass \n\nI played Morgana support earlier.

Sorry, gotta finish this hour glass first because everyone in the game can 1 hit kill me otherwise.  \n\nSo because one item is obscenely overpowered every other champion in the game now has to adapt their build to survive it.

The active items (in the long run) would have better abilities and shine far brighter than stat sticks could while players who are overwhelmed can stick to the stat-items. \n\nI think a good comparison is in WoW talent trees: Usually the additional ability/more complex rotation awards you more DPS.

Ultimately relegating all of those stat based items to the realm of noobtrap. W\n\nWoW talent trees are probably not the best example either, I would bet my ass those are optimized to hell and back. A \"serious\" raid group would expect you to be using the 1 or 2 optimal rotations because the other ones are for beginners.

The other direction is that you need to be so optimized in their precise uses that they're only used in the top 10% of players or when a champion uses one as a core item because of absurd synergy.\n\n\nI think giving every class a couple different items that they could choose from to get a bit of this effect sounds good, but then you realize that Riot **has** tried doing that.\n\n{{item:3046}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3085}}\n\n{{item:3030}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3152}}\n\n{{item:3003}} {{item:3030}} {{item:3285}}\n\n{{item:3715}} {{item:3706}} + the removed 2\n\nHave any of these really succeeded?

Aether Wisp + NLR. The active did a _15% max HP_ nuke and increased magic damage they took for like...10 seconds or something. \n\nRiot released the statistics on the item. You know how many people _actually_ used this item's active for how busted it was?\n\nNot 10%.\nNot 5%\n~~_Less than 1% used the active._~~\n\nEDIT: I was incorrect slightly. [According to Riot](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/57nejn/1_of_people_who_bought_dfg_ever_used_the_active/?st=jk4nthp7&sh=4d10086d) the usage rate of DFG's active was around 1% with a small margin of error pushing it between just over/under 1%. However, there's also an interesting stat here that Veigar's winrate _went up_ after DFG's removal...because nobody used the active.\n\nAnd this item was around from Season 0 to _Season 5_. So no. I don't think the playerbase would readily adapt to it. At least not the majority would. \n\nFor the WoW example: They really don't care, actually. I've raided pretty high back in the day (Heroic 25 Wrath was my prime but I've done someodd raiding in other expacs) and the rotation didn't matter. What did matter was doing the most DPS you could. See, the thing is that they don't see you doing the rotation, they just see the numbers you're pulling. So if you're doing 1.5k with the complex rotation and 1.75k with the simple rotation, they'll want you to use the simple rotation. The only place where this truly matters is in the top 0.01% of raid guilds who need absolute max DPS. AKA: Pros only.\n\n>Have any of these really succeeded? Or have they all been either optimized onto specific champions, generalized to every champion, or relegated to useless trash?\n\nThose examples are actually bad ones yet there are also legitimate tech options.\n\nFor the zeal set, yes, people swap and pick a variety depending on the meta and champion changes. The issue is that the Zeal set can stack, meaning you're rarely making a \"choice\". \n\nThe hextech set is arguably the best example as people pick a little of everything. GPL could use a buff but otherwise, there's purpose for all of them.\n\nThe second mage set is ok. They tend to see usual play on both Ludens and AA with the choice often varying based on meta and champ. Again, GPL could use a buff.\n\nAnd smite items were never a good example. The ability to get more wards was absurdly powerful. Removing that and you have the smite that provides an immense buff to dps/durability. The important thing here is that the choices _should be equal_. The smite items were never equal in terms of power.\n\nBut the real problem, again, falls back to stats: Why would I care about Protobelt? The STATS on it aren't as good as the STATS on, say, Ludens. So I don't get it, even though protobelt's active could arguably be better. The same situation befalls other items: Stats are king and you need bigger numbers.  Hence why I said the stats of the game need an overhaul to be less gold efficient or on-par with actives at BEST.","replies":[{"poster":"Mogarl","date":"2018-07-27T16:02:55.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Riot released the statistics on the item.

Janna's Q on a item? A staff that adds entire new abilities to your heroes? Clones that you can summon to bait your enemy? Higher stats at the cost of losing health over second?\n\nThat being said, I was also once a noob LoL player, and at the time, I hated item actives (never bought Deathfire Grasp for that reason, always forgot to use it or required twitch reflexes to use so many skills so quickly). On the other side, picking the old GLP on Aurelion Sol was always fun, because its active complemented him so nicely, and because Sol only has 3 combat skills, so it never felt overwhelming (that's the case for many dota heroes).\n\nI think a good compromise would be to make LoL's items with stronger passives instead of adding (many) new actives, and to make sure that those passives are clearly comunicated and intuitive, so that complexity creep does not shoots off the roof.\n\nFor example: If you're buying Stattik Shiv, shouldn't the lightning bolt be the most satisfying thing about it? Definitely. (Oh how much I miss Shiv Yasuo, with tornados that shoot lightning bolts, before the generic stat-stick phantom dancer took its place). Yet, that passive has been getting nerfed because \"ADCs can clear waves too fast\". Wait, isn't that the point of a massive, AoE lightning blast? isn't that the reason you would want to buy it in the first place? Maybe the problem was on the fact that ADCs had no other item to compete with it, so they were all forced to buy wave clear items because they were the most viable first option? Maybe melee users deserved to have a stronger lightning effect (for the same reason they deserved to have Hydra items)? Regardless, the effect was nerfed, and is not as exciting as before.\n\nAnother example: Sunfire Cape. I always loved the thematic fantasy behind it. When I was a noob Shyvana player 3-4 years ago, I ALWAYS wanted to pick that item because it felt so fitting and perfect to her, even when it was not viable. But truth is, Sunfire's damage is low enough to make it more appropriate to tanks and to farming than to my agressive fire-themed diver. AND that passive was nerfed because if was too (passively) strong on tanks. Sometimes I wonder: if it was an active with a stronger effect for a limited duration, wouldn't that make it more exciting? Or, if it were to remain a passive, what if it had a windowed duration? (Say: triggers when you attack or get attacked at melee range, lasting for 4 seconds, dealing satisfying damage in the process? Or alternatively, have it explode 2-3 seconds after that trigger, proceeding to deal dot damage for 2-3 seconds after that? Perhaps too bursty, but I'm just brainstorming.)\n\nLoL's items have those interesting ideas that are ultimately nerfed and made too subtle, too uninsteresting, while the bulk of a completed item's essence is in its stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2018-07-27T06:00:41.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Praise you Maple Nectar for taking time to communicate with Boards.

While they have passives clearly meant to act as counterplay, they're more often bought for a different reason. Liandry's isn't being bought primarily to shred tanks, it's bought because most of the champions that use it have a DoT effect that synergizes with it.

Making a game basic isn't very fun but a too complex game is also hard for MOST people to handle. (AKA Grand strategies. I like EU4, but sometimes the game is a god damn chore. I think that have a complex itemization with a complex champion can create a lot of different paths for people to take . . . right now it feels like we currently have:\n\nBasic Champion / Basic items featuring the AP / AD / Tank differences that all involve the same items, AD is excluded as they get to build more freely . . . however, the items are still basic.\n\nAdvanced Champion / Basic Items featuring the AP / AD / Tank differences all, still, involve the same items but at least a little bit more flexibility and fluidity is added. Usually these champions are dumpstered very quickly until a rework.\n\nThat's sort of . . . it. There are no advanced items to give something or somebody more depth and it feels shallow when you've played the game longer than a year. It'd be really cool to have an item that gives literally no stats but 3 passives that are amazing and able to be applied to MANY different champions. (The keyword is many by the way. I mean I know {{item:3115}} is called Nashors tooth but honestly? It's actually called KAYLES ITEM.)\n\nI mean it'd be cool to see an item that is basically Pyke or Tahm's passive ability to heal, but at the cost of doing limited amounts of damage. Yeah, it'd be SUPER broken for somebody like {{champion:84}} to have that passive but what the hell are they going to do when they rush it or get it 2nd item? They'll fall off a cliff in comparison to others who didn't make such a stupid mistake.\n\nOr maybe make an item that gives negative stats. Like something that takes away half of your magic damage but gives you MR equal to your AP subtracted. There would be some really cool combination with this.

Spending some goofy amount of like 3k for a handful of damage in dota is terrible. However, in return, the items actives are amazing in terms of what they can do. A massive screenwide slow field. Upgrading your ultimate. A 4 second stun on an enemy. Being completely immune to CC and magic damage for a brief time, etc.\n> \n> League doesn&#x27;t have that. If anything, people have demanded we move away from more unique itemization like this because it adds more complexity that people often can&#x27;t handle. The only class that comes remotely close to this is support with their cavalcade of actives and unique passives....and they&#x27;re STILL gold-efficient. Hence why Supports are absurd.  \n> \n> Riot should honestly look into lowering the efficiency of all items while upping the passive/active abilities these items give.

Of course, this will be fought against because people have hated the idea of more actives since the same season (0) due to complexity.\n\nGenerally I believe the only thing making Dota2 significantly harder than league, are the items. For example, play as Sven vs a CC heavy team and build black king bar, then don't build it. The difference one item makes is insane. This is the most basic example, another good example would be, a good team will buy things such as dust of appearance vs a bounty hunter/Riki, maybe even winning the game off it, the tankiest player may purchase a gem of true sight, this becomes a massive contest between teams, the team with invisibility must kill the player and gain possession of the gem so their invisible heroes can be used to their maximum potential, the defending team has an advantage as long as the gem holder is protected. The list goes on. So many different items for different situations. In league its clear cut. \n\n\nBeing bursted as an AP champ? Buy zhonyas!\nBeing bursted as an AD champ?

Of course, this will be fought against because people have hated the idea of more actives since the same season (0) due to complexity.\n\nI agree with this. To take this even farther to the extreme, I feel we've reached a point in League where stats themselves may simply not be valid anymore as a source of gameplay. For quite some time now, stats have failed to add diversity to the game, as most champions now are intentionally designed to scale off of only a small handful of them, often in a preset order. Riot has also often struggled to implement choices through stats, which is why Zeal's upgrades have almost identical stats, right down to their distributions. In the end, stats do little except add power, without much in the way of gameplay, and that is exactly the kind of stuff we need less of in League.\n\nAs such, I feel one potential direction to consider would be to cut stats out of items entirely, and instead release items purely as actives or passives (or both). In fact, even runes could be rolled into this, in order to maximize diversity and choice. Such a system would likely not be perfect, as there'd still be the problem of these items needing to be generic enough to fit on every champion, while still inevitably synergizing more with certain kits over others, but at least it could still remove one layer of complication to champion balance and design. As mentioned above, a system like this would also be liable to add a lot of complexity, so in order to minimize this, it might be better to limit the number of passives and actives any one item can have. Piano builds should still be possible, but shouldn't be common.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-07-26T03:38:13.649+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass,Hourglass \n \nin the post, it just went completely out of my browser lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Morgana Ultima","date":"2018-07-26T04:20:15.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aint nobody got time for that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"giantZorg","date":"2018-07-26T11:05:44.724+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot: Our data shows that hourglass is taken in a majority of games, therefore we will nerf it to promote more item diversity /s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2018-07-26T12:00:58.133+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather they didn't add Dota 2's item system into League.

There's obvious exceptions like Invoker, but most kits have relatively little going on.

The thing is, DoTA doesn't use scaling AP and AD. As I could remember, stats were designed like that :\n\nSTRENGTH. Each point of STR stats would increase your Health by 19. If your champion is a STR champion, each point would also add 1 extra dmg\nAGILITY. Each point of AGI stats would increase your attack speed by 1% and 0,14 armor. If your champion is a AGI champion, each point would also add 1 extra dmg.\nINTELLIGENCE. Each point of intelligence would increase your mana by 20 and give 1% extra mana regeneration. If your champion is a INT champion, each point would also add 1 extra dmg.\n\nItems you would buy would give Stats that you needed the most while also adding extra dmg to your basic attacks. Spells don't have scaling AP like in LoL meaning that mage dmg would see their dmg greatly reduced in late game. This is why, DoTA has access to very powerful CC items and spell that would literally stun someone for over 3 seconds +++. They compensate lower spells dmg for higher CC in the game. Mages would also see their auto attack have more impact compared to LoL where an Annie would take a year to kill a tank with only auto attacks.\n\nHeroes also had a basic flat 25% magic dmg reduction. Only 1 item would provide additionnal magic resist by about 30%. Laning phase in DoTA would also be longuer and champions could actually kill its own creeps to deny gold and experience to other players (hardcore I know).\n\nWhen you die, you lose gold, you buy Town portal scrolls to go back to town or you return by walking there. Diving champions while knowing you would die was never a good idea. You usually would lose more gold than you would get.\n\nYou could also have an animal ''courrier'' which would allow you to buy items from the base and get them delievered to you. There is a total of 4 ''secret'' shops in the map which would allow you to buy items you normally can't buy in town.\n\nChampions actually had a stats that indicates how fast a champion can turn around and attack which would make kiting a lot harder.\nchampions could level up to level 25. Spells had a maximum of 4 level. There was a skill you could get that would increase all your stats by +2 (STR, AGI, INT).\n\nan interesting feature on DoTA, is you could destroy trees which sometime create a path for you to go and juke your ennemies.\n\nFinally, ALL champions on DoTA uses mana on their ressources to cast spells.\n\nThat being said, I think DoTA and LoL can't be very much compared as their have evolved to such an extend that they just can't be compared in terms of mechanic.
