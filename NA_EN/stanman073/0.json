The reason mages like Brand and Zyra have been feeling oppressive is because they can get away with dealing a lot of damage with comparatively low AP.

Lethality is balanced right now and thank god. Still, I wouldn't mind a few mage itemization buffs and nerfs. \n\nNerfs I said? Yeah, Morellonomicon {{item:3165}} . Either cut 1 amp tome from the build path and make it give 85 AP or making it give only 10% CDR. It's too strong of an item. You could say the same for cleaver, but we're talking about mages right now. Trying to increase diversity without giving such a 1 item do everything; this opens up room to buff other mage items.\n\nLuden's Echo {{item:3285}} could use a very nice buff that seems to been given to everyone: a cost reduction. Reduce cost by 200 gold (3200 -> 3000).\n\nRylai's Crystal Scepter {{item:3116}} needs 1 kind of change. The passive can stay as mediocre as it is, but this item has shown it's problems in it's current state. First off, it's being built easily for mage \"supports\" due to it's low cost. Secondarily, the stats aren't slot efficient enough for an item slot. +100 HP, +5 AP (80 AP, 400 HP), cost increased to 3000, build path changes to Blasting Wand + Amp Tome + Giant's Belt + 715 Gold. Passive stays the same, item just becomes worth the slot it's in decently; Supports won't be able to buy the item. If Zyra would need a buff, buff Zyra.\n\nSeeker's Armguard {{item:3191}} sounds nice to beat AD assassins, but is actually worse than going damage mostly. Changes are simple. +5 armor and +5 AP, but the passive caps at 20 stacks (10 extra armor/AP) from 30 (15 extra).\n\nZhonya's Hourglass {{item:3157}} is a huge staple item in every AP build. Too huge of a buff would put it overboard. As such, a very simple +5 AP would suffice. Seeing as Seeker's Armguard would be a better rush, a small buff is warranted and fine.\n\nRabadon's Deathcap {{item:3089}} is the #1 AP item, but it suffers one huge downside. Cost reduced by 200 gold.\n\nMoonflair Spellblade {{item:3170}} brought to Summoner's Rift for AP bruisers and fighters (Diana, Kayle, perhaps Ekko). However a few changes are warranted. +150 gold cost, +10 AP.\n\nVoid Staff {{item:3135}} gets a Last Whisper treatment. With all the buffs in other items, the \"tank killing\" item needs to stop contributing too much to the death of a non-tank. 35% Magic Pen changed to 35% Bonus Magic Pen.\n\nHextech Items {{item:3030}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3145}} lose their \"Hextech\" clause so they can actually be balanced individually. Hextech-GLP's effect cast time reduced by half, cooldown stays the same. Hextech Protobelt's cooldown increased to 60 seconds, +5 AP, +100 cost. Hextech Gunblade's active cooldown increased to 60 seconds and Leblanc's AoE Q now counts as AoE damage instead of single target (no more massive sustain). Revolver stays the same. Yes you can stack Hextech items, but that doesn't sound too unbalanced.\n\nZeke's Harbinger {{item:3050}} needs a lot of changes. First off, Conduit effect window increased to 10 seconds from 8. Percent AP increase bonus increased to 25%. 50% Critical Chance bonus changes to 25% attack speed + 25% more AD. Makes the item bindable to just about everyone.\n\nPox Arcana added to Summoner's Rift. Cooldown reduction reduced to 10%. Mana regen stat changed for 400 Mana (to fit Lost Chapter). http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Pox_Arcana\n\nSounds like a ton of buffs for mages, however they do trade off losing Morello as a 1 item big ticket. Outlying mages can be buffed or nerfed, but the class as a whole, including AP assassins and fighters, could use a tiny buff. Also this will encourge diversity in mage items instead of Morello Void Hourglass.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-05-06T07:52:04.132+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Rylai's Crystal Scepter needs 1 kind of change.

It _completely_ trivializes Mana management where even Tear is worse than it at doing that. As a dedicated Mana item.

And then, ADs already have a _plethora_ of Penetration items, between Flat, Reduction, and %Pen. APs have 3 items that give MPen. Technically 4 if you could Guise/Liandry's as two items, but they don't stack. Void and Sorcerer's Shoes are the only two good sources of Penetration available in itemization.
