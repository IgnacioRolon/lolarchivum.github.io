Umm it seems to stop at 33% and says a unknown error has occured. And when I use the repair function I get the same message around 4000 files ish. I've made sure my computer's firewall or internet isnt effecting it. I'm running on windows xp (if that helps at all). Would you need the logs?","replies":[]}]}]}
