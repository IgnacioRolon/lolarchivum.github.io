Simply signing up for PBE access doesn't guarantee access and the criteria with which we select PBE testers changes all the time, depending on what we're testing. We generally look for players that are *really active* and a *positive influence* on summoners around them. I definitely recommend checking our [**PBE FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) out, as it may answer most of the other questions you have about the system.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions that the FAQ was unable to answer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"killer61099","date":"2017-01-11T01:23:56.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you man i  sighed up for the PBE 2 years ago and no invite or email","replies":[]}]}
