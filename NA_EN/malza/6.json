Annointed enemies deal 1.5x dmg to Allies of Garen.\n\nW: stays the same, but instead of giving Garen the buff it gives the buff to the entire enemy team\n\nE: heal enemies that are within the spin instead of damaging them\n\nR: Forces both teams to instantly tp to Baron Pitt and every character is suppressed for 1 minute and immune to damage while using the dance emote.\n\nSeems balanced to me{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
