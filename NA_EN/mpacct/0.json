I have the ISP of MIDCO (midcontinental), and live in Lawrence, Kansas.  Currently, my ping while playing league is around 300+, even though it is normal when doing speed tests (see attached).  Also, the same issue is going on when playing Blizzard games, such as Overwatch.  I didn't know if you guys had any suggestions to help me with this issue.\n\nGeneral information regarding MIDCO: they are a new company that replaced WOW in June of this year, and since the switch, my ping has been consistently higher.  It used to be around 28 with WOW, and then when MIDCO took over it has risen to an average of 50 - 100 while playing league, even though they claim that nothing changed (ie: still use all of WOW's connectors and stuff). Not sure if that is helpful or not, but thought I'd include it.\n\nHopefully you guys know of a fix, but also wanted to see if anyone is having similar issues.  I was on the phone with them for for around an hour tonight with no luck!\n\nThanks,\nMpacct","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T23:29:49.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like these spikes might be caused by packet loss, which your test might miss.
