Playing against plat as silver is always good practice as they will test your mechanics/decision making much more than playing with someone at your level. \n\nRather than getting frustrated at the skill level difference pay more attention to how they play the game and maybe you'll learn a thing or two :D","replies":[{"poster":"Daxanater","date":"2016-03-16T00:45:03.550+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look thats something I can't lie about to practice but this game they were a 5 man q just invading my jungle bming of course and literally destroying us, there was nothing I could learn about that.","replies":[{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-03-16T01:15:53.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Theu are not gods.

I made a bunch of typos from typing with my cellphone in the subway.\n\nBut yeah I mean, you are always going to have unfair matchups here and there. Its just like that in norms since people don't normally try hard, some plats get their Normal MMR tanked down to silver MMR, and some silvers might take norms super seriously and get a higher than silver MMR and then you get matched together because your MMRs cross in the Gold range maybe, I don't know.\n\nPoint is, not every game can be the absolute best in terms of balance. These things happen. I'm pretty sure you've had some one-sided stomps vs  Bronze teams in the past perhaps. They probably felt the same way.\n\nIf I play a norm and encounter a plat/diamond player, I see it as an opportunity to learn. I can understand it if its not your case...

(S1 seems to be the point where tryhard normals players, and people who almost exclusively play ranked start to meet.)\n\nThere's nothing related to the current season that's causing it.\n\nI've been playing games with people ranging from B1 to masters for 2 seasons, and before that it was Bronze to low diamond.  Normals queue just gets bizarre past a certain point.  You either learn to accept it, or you stop playing normals.\nBut honestly, it means the average skill level, and also the game is more fun than playing ranked.\n\nI get better players and less stress.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-03-16T22:52:55.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aazzlano,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EE8dgvEK,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2016-03-16T22:08:07.034+0000)\n>\n> Maybe because this season is cancer and a lot of the plat/diamond population stopped playing the horrible dynamic queue and  started to play normals with their low MMR?\n\nFrom memory this started happening towards the tail end of season 5, for me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThePikol","date":"2016-03-16T07:30:38.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be glad it happens in normals.
