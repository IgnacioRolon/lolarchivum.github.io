I wasn't nearly at the level of \"disgusted\" back then, but there were times where I would read the patch notes just to think: Wait...what the fuck did I just read? Are you kidding me Riot??  Suggestions at the bottom if you don't want to wade through the lake of salt.\n\nI watched their favoritism for champions like Lee and Zed warp the meta to the way they want it - to appeal to spectators.\n\nI watched those spectators scream when flashy plays happened, prompting Riot to invest resources into making mobility-creeped monstrosities.\n\nI watched Thresh and Yasuo be released who indirectly set the standard for new champs and reworks to be overloaded to Hell and back for the sake of being unique,  fun to play, and fun to watch, all at the expense of the old standard of champions.\n\nI watched the season 4 jungle chances where most struggled to clear, (except Lee Sin - God forbid he'd have problems) and off-meta picks got the hell beat out of them for having the audacity to show their face where they aren't welcome.  This shouldn't have been as surprising as it was to Riot. \n\nI watched mobility metastasize with the reassurance that \"Mobility creep is definitely on our radar\"....then came Kalista. At first when I saw the reveal on S@20, I honestly thought it was a sick joke. When I saw CertainlyT was the designer, my heart sank realizing this was a real thing, and that he's going to introduce another tumor to the roster.\n\nI watched Ekko, who took the form of an un-killable, un-kiteable, un-bearable \"assassin\" who also happened to have 3 slows - one of which was from a 3 hit passive which chunked you AND gave him a speedup, an AoE stun, percent execute damage, a dash blink combo, and an Oops button that gave an AoE AP nuke and HEALED HIM. All the while, his mana costs let him spam relentlessly, because as we've seen this season, having cooldowns are apparently anti-fun.\n\nI watched the healthiest and most balanced state League had ever been in during the middle of Season 5 disappear with the Juggernaut catastrophe, which wasn't dealt with because it wouldn't be fair to the pros for drastic changes to happen so close to Worlds.  If anyone reading this happened to be involved with the decision to hold off, seriously, fuck yourself.\n\nI watched Preseason 6 and all of its cancerous changes pollute and corrupt everything that made this game fun to play after we screamed bloody murder that everything was broken, unhealthy, Yasuo and Trynd were going to be out of control from your bullshit Keystones, Graves was walking over everyone, Soraka was even worse to deal with, ADC's were in every lane not because people wanted to test them, but because it was the most optimal way to play...etc. And Riot did nothing except steamroll ahead with it.\n\nI watched Kench and Kindred released.  Why? Why would you allow these champions to exist? Did you hear our complaints that having both teams line up mid and vaporize each other in 2 seconds and think \"Welp, I guess dying is anti-fun lawl, here ya go!\" not even mentioning unnecessary passives included. And then there's Jhin with his book report essay for a passive which lets him outplay people with a 1400 damage right-click late game.  But I guess he's unique right? Mission accomplished?\n\nI watched this Dynamic Queue shitshow knowing full-well after so long of being lied to and disappointed that they had no intention of bringing Solo Queue back, but remain angry with them for the same reason as everyone else, in addition to seeing them lead players on, reminding them that it's still on the way, don't worry guys, we're not lying to you, just wait, it's coming, it's definitely coming, no, we're serious, lol fuck you we lied. \n\nThe last thing I watched before I quit was the projected mage update.  I'm just going to ignore the broken champions that came out of it and focus on one particular addition that ultimately made me walk away: Protobelt. Since Riot is so stubborn in their refusal to tackle mobility, their solution to immobile mages...is mobility.  Holy fucking shitballs what a great idea.  Let's not do a goddamn thing about mobility creep other than accentuate the problem, and you know what? Let's make it shoot rockets so mobile mages have another thing to add to their burst combo. \"But they don't buy it.\"  _They want to buff Protobelt!_  It's the same problem as Duskblade, which was introduced with the same rationale as they used to remove DFG! You don't see collateral damage right now, why would you? People are building full tank on assassins for Christ's sake. Once you get rid of that, who's buying it now? Zed? Riven? Pantheon? Talon? J4? (Which was done in LCS recently) Rengar? Just wait for it to happen.\n\nThere's plenty more I could go on about, but those are some of the major points that led me to question why I'm even playing because going through all of the nerfs and buffs and the contracting reasoning to justify them would be way too long. Right now, I'm just hoping Season 7 will actually be fun. I might come back at the end of the season just to get my Victorious rewards again, but that might be all for S6.\n\n/rant\n\nPersonally, Civ 5, XCOM, Vanilla WoW servers, Darkest Dungeon, and modded Skyrim have kept me company recently, and since my tendinosis has been healing, I can actually play guitar again.

When I started after Draven's release, I browsed the forums from time to time and saw a lot of community interaction...of course back then people were generally happy with the game.  It's not that they never listened, in terms of gameplay specifically, it's just that they don't do it nearly as much now, and it's mostly seen as corporate PR-speak or dismissive indignation. Story and Art on the other hand have _constant_ interaction, which is pretty great.

League has definitely been trending towards a faster pace with the mobility and complicated kits (hard to dispute that). And people have gotten better at making fast plays. So given the list of games you provided at the end, it just seems like league is not your kind of game. Also, maybe you just don't like change? That's all fine; there's nothing wrong with those preferences.\n\nBut it doesn't make league a worse game. From my perspective, Riot has been adding new and interesting things that move the game forward. And while they fuck up sometimes, they try to fix their mistakes quickly. So overall, I'd say league has improved over the years. I'd hate for all the changes that people complain about to be reverted, because in that case we'd all be playing the same game from 2009 but with better graphics and more skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2016-06-20T02:46:42.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that I hate mobility - I actually believe there's a place for it believe it or not, it just pisses me off when _everyone_ is getting mobility when they either don't need it, or shouldn't have it.  For an example that I keep bringing up, Ahri's Q speed shouldn't be in her kit.  If Riot wants to push for thematic gameplay like Rek blindness and Graves having a real shotgun, it should be obvious why getting movement speed after throwing an orb somehow makes more sense than the \"Kiss of Death\" that this **succubus** briefly had.  One is obviously more thematic than the other, but it's cast aside because of something which is defended for being \"fun and unique\" just like every other nonsensical aspect of a kit such as  Kalista hopping like a kangaroo on crack after every attack for some strange reason. That strange reason is it makes the character more flashy and fun to watch...thematic design be damned as long as champions can zip across the screen to keep people with low attention spans watching. I guess that's also why ward hopping still exists.\n\n>From my perspective, Riot has been adding new and interesting things that move the game forward.

It won't happen, but I'd love it if they dialed everything back to the start of Season 4 and ask \"what went wrong from this point?\" Then again, I'm also one of the people advocating for legacy WoW servers because I hate the changes Blizzard has made over the last six years, so maybe starting over, if unsuccessful, might be interesting at least as a separate client.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BloodLord Kitty","date":"2016-06-19T20:34:02.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im in the same place as all of you. Started Season 3 when Zac came out and the game seemed pretty fun. Some champions were unbearable but I thought it was simply because I was bronze which meant that I sucked and didn't know what to do. 3 years later and I got plat right before season resets. And you know what? I just watched some videos made in 2013 and it was the most balanced season ever. Even though i didn't know how to use cougar form i loved to play Nidalee and throw spears and deal tons of damage. Remember when Renekton was king of top lane? or when Shen was unkillable? DFG always being overkilled? or maybe you remember Kat having no counter? Well at the end of the day I can tell you it was probably the most fun I ever had in this game. Right mid season 5 was balanced but was it really fun? It was more about team game and strategy because no one could 1 shot you or kill you without have a possible counter. In the end I feel like season 3 was really fun and mid season 5 right before the juggernaut update was very balanced but now it's pretty stupid. i regret paying over 250$ on this game and I wish I could just sell my account, get my money back and maybe start off with some other games like overwatch, csgo maybe even DotA who knows.

They know what their community thinks, and try to make it better. An example of this is the badge that will be coming. There were actually a decent amount of people that suggested this, or agreed with someone who did, but now its announced their crapping on Riot's decision because they see the negatives in the badge and how some might abuse it.\n\nAlso, to anyone reading this far down, Riot has no plans to return solo queue, but have said if ranked truly goes to shit for most of the player base, they will return it. You guys might just see that and go \"Pfft, they lie again\" but thats not true. Different teams at Riot work on different things, as well as some rioters having different opinions.

League might have the worst playerbase of all time. Of all time!\n\n2: Everybody thinks the only answers are to join the trolls or quit.\n\nI joined in season 3. About all that's changed is player disposition as far as I'm concerned, which is crazy because League was already worse than WoW even then. And here I always say that the bottom of the barrel is just a checkpoint.\n\nAnyway, if you want to quit you have to start by uninstalling and then you've got to actually get up, away from the computer, when you want to play Leeg. Serious, games are a habit and you gotta break 'em.\n\nMe, I still manage to enjoy the experience with friends. I also don't play ranked; I firmly suggest this is part of why I enjoy League so much still.","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-06-19T14:42:32.975+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"*cough cough* Season 1 *cough cough*\n\nJust because you weren't there, doesn't mean it didn't happen.\n\nGive it some time, allow league some patience for all of the years It was good.

You feel financially invested when you spend money on the skins, icons, and maybe even an account name change. With most games running around 35 minutes to an hour it becomes a second life that you live on the internet that is very similar to how people become trapped in MMO games. League used to be fun and then the game is changed in ways that you don't like. I relate to you that's for sure. I had a similar experience to World of Warcraft and then League. A solution I used was to play other games and think of your time spent in what used to be as fun entertainment with great memories. If your relationship with a game isn't good it isn't like you can fix it because you aren't a game developer. There are lots of great console and PC games out that can give you a fresh experience.
