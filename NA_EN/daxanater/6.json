O.o If anything, it is one of the most generous ults in the game. It is relatively slow, the hitbox isn't even that big but is a bit bigger than the visual. BV/QSS/Mercurial hard counter it by completely negating it, so does flash, any dash/blink, Zhongya or any other stasis. Backing off hard as you can means he can't use his E for damage in most cases which is a core part of his damage early/mid game, and still a good chunk late game, as he needs it to close the gap unless there is a mob/player he can Q to get close enough and even with the ult's knock up might not be enough.\n\nHex drinker/Maw/GA/Zhonga/anything that counters his burst and gives Mres+HP or a Mres+Shield make it hard for him to kill, especially if there is mobility with the champ. Personally, I think Fizz is one of the most appropriately tuned champions in the game when going AP, tho some issues can be seen when going bruiser. Having a good amount of range + AoE for clearing waves also causes issues for Fizz and prevents him from engaging, generally even forcing him to waste his little bit of mana on clearing the minion wave and not being able to roam due to this. Raw HP, in general, is very strong against Fizz especially before late game or he gets pretty fed since he will usually not have the AP to support Lich and skills and CD reduction to do much after his initial burst.","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2016-05-02T11:59:05.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Qss won't drop it anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RespectPlus","date":"2016-05-01T23:28:46.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I'm playing ADC and Fizz ults me, I cross my arms.
