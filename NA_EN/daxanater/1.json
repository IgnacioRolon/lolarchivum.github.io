I&#039;m not the best at writing poems but I tried my best here. I&#039;ll think about making part 2 because there is way more then just this. The purpose I guess is just to share the feelings for the game. Please leave some feedback and ideas maybe for part 2 and what to speak about.\n\nRiot, I&#039;m tired.\nI&#039;m tired of all the feeders, trolls and afks but it just seems like another day.\n\nRiot, I&#039;m tired.\nOf all the toxicity in the air and I can&#039;t bear another word I swear. If you can compare the game now to back then, I know whats there, a game full of options but open the door now and theres no more left. Just like a theft.\n\nRiot, I&#039;m tired.\nBeing told to quit the game but looking back now and then I know this isn&#039;t just a game it&#039;s a way of life, I swear sometimes I appreciate it as much as my future wife. Everyday we come back from a long day sick and tired of people saying it will be okay, but when you logging into the game it&#039;s opening the gates of heaven where you are not too late. But you don&#039;t want it to be the same.\n\nRiot, I love this game.\nI see people gain fame for their plays and you try to imitate every single mistake and play but you can&#039;t get it right. You just want to be recognized before your demise and when you finally get that play you have been working hard day by day you notice the smile on your face, you can&#039;t get enough of it, you ask &quot;When will it be enough&quot;.\n\nRiot, I hate this game.\nI hate the op yi thats runs before me making me 0 3. I hate graves pressing R with no cigar and giving me a scar. I hate pre made fours that can&#039;t even understand a word you told them. I hate my team that are not the same as me and can&#039;t understands things I want for me. I hate this season and I&#039;ll hate this the next one because I can never make it the best one.\n\nRiot, are you amazed?\nPeople care about this game, balance threads, toxic threads even shows we still care and our eyes are open and we are aware. This game can bring good deeds, cancer streams, lightning beams of peoples creations with no hesitation. Are you amazed of hours put in to get somewhere within on what they want, people fight for this game and what things it needs to be sane but it will never be right. Your insights aren&#039;t good enough and it&#039;s back to the drawing board for you again.\n\nRiot, I&#039;m scared.\nI don&#039;t want this game to die, leaving for mistakes that we or you never have tried to fix, but people don&#039;t realize riot wants to satisfy. When will realize the game we love could be left in the dust because WE were never satisfied. Some times I feel ashamed by filling up the toxicity air with more of it, asking &quot;Why tower dive&quot; the spark that we can never understand that brings up the flame and opens the gates of feeders, trolls and afks and like I said it&#039;s just another day of league of legends. Can we understand it's not riots fault but ours only.\n\nRiot, thank you.\nThank you for bringing me out here and inviting me to a community with a great diversity of many people, cheering on for you to try your best and I&#039;ll never detest the LCS. Thank you for bringing me out of my depression because I can never question how I got there in the first place. If it wasn&#039;t for you I&#039;d be alone in a time zone where no one see&#039;s me sitting alone and cold with no friends like me. Thank you for motivating me to do something with my life even though if no one understands it I know you do. Thank you riot.\n\n- Dax, a bronze who can&#039;t adc for shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-02-28T17:02:52.876+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it :)  It feels like it'd _really_ shine when spoken aloud, too.\n\nThank **you**.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Daxanater","date":"2016-02-28T17:23:00.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem man, appreciate the feedback :).
