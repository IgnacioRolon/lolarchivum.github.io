I don't own the best computer so this is just straight up stupid to deal with. Not to mention there's a few bugs with it. One of them is when you accept a que and it loads nothing making you dodge.

Most of the time, this is caused by specific network settings that conflict with League's ability to maintain a strong connection to the different services you access within the client. I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address the most common solutions.\n\nLet me know if this resolved the issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silent Air Ops","date":"2016-11-21T14:50:59.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Targons Blade\n\nI been using the macbook for league of legends. The beta and alpha client window size was too big, but then it gave me a option to make it smaller. Then the client became too small and i can't adjust it back to the bigger client. I tried the instructions in other forums like crtl + or crtl - but I don't think that applies to the mac. Is there any solution? Thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
