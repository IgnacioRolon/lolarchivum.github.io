These errors can be very tricky to pin down and figure out because there are a lot of root causes, commonly:  \n\n- Issues with your OS's permission settings -- having proper Admin access for example\n- A type of certificate error with Internet Explorer/Safari or with your Internet Options\n- Your computer isn't able to establish a consistent connection to our Login Server\n\nBecause it can be extremely varied, try the steps in our [Login troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944-Login-Issues).  It has some of the most common solutions to these root causes that should get you past this animation and into a real game of League!\n\nIf you have tried all of the steps here, and still can't get past this screen regardless of how much you swear at your monitor, then it may be a more complicated issue with connection settings being the root cause.  Therefore,  make sure that you complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as well.  While I am not blaming your connection in any way, we need to make sure we can rule it out as a possibility. \n\nNothing coming up Milhouse?  Don't give up just yet!

It seems to work the first time, but might not do so everytime.\n\nOnly thing I've found that works with any consistency whatsoever when this happens is ending the lolclient.exe process (which then **usually **shuts down the other two), running lol as admin and clicking \"Launch\" as soon as the word shows up in the launcher.\n\nI hope this helps someone until Riot finds a more reliable solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"itsatarp","date":"2015-01-22T08:33:21.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue here, was able to login running the lol.launcher.admin.exe found in your install location, default should be: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penguin Juice","date":"2015-01-22T03:14:24.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing here, sometimes it works to restart the client, sometimes it does not. I am also having really strange log issues, not normal lag. In these instances of lag I am seeing champions glide across the map and their health bars depleting.
