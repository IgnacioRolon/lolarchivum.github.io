I'm guess its because her polymorph is an invisible projectile? \r\n\r\nYasuo's windwall should be nerfed so that fight changing abilities aren't completely ignored. For example ultimates, *cough* Nami *cough* or abilities like Lulu's W were it literally turns a hated assassin into a squirrel.\r\n\r\n-This is coming from a Yasuo main so its not just another person on the bandwagon of Yasuo hate.","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2017-06-18T19:52:36.765+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you watch the animation, it is a projectile. \n\nAnd there's no way to code \"fight changing projectile\".
