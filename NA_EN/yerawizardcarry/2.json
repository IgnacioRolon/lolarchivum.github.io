It's like saying Faker should be banned from the LCS because he's simply too good and no one knows how to lane against him. Yasuo already has a 50% ban rate. That's 1 Yasuo ban for every 2 games. That's utterly ridiculous. The best thing one could do if you simply hate playing against him is ban him, but to increase the amount of bans just so that \"Overpowered\" champs can be banned is ridiculous.
