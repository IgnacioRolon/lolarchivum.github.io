After picking one of the locations they are automatically teleported to the location. Tree then roots himself into the location and stays there the entire game until the game is won or lose.\n\nNo- Q,W, E,R\n\nLore: Tree was just standing in the forest one day when a man came up to him. He said &quot;want to join the league of legends?&quot;. Tree said &quot;....&quot;. So that is how Tree became a champion in league of legends. \n\nAdvantages: Living ward, can&#039;t feed, can&#039;t troll ( good for bronze )\n\nDisadvantages: 4 vs 5, Tree is rooted in place\n\nYou can buy this champion next patch for ONLY 2IP or 1RP\n\nChampion release skin? The same thing as classic skin but he has a mushroom on his side.\n\nWhy buy this champion? THIS IS THE PERFECT CHAMPION FOR BRONZE! JUST THINK YOU CAN&#039;T FEED or TROLL! IT&#039;S 30 MINUTES OF COMPLETE FUN!\n\n Classic Splash art: {{champion:57}} \n\nQuote in champion select: *cricket, cricket*\n\nALL BRONZIES CAN THANK ME FOR CREATING SUCH A CHAMPION!

He can deactivate his ultimate after 10 seconds or longer if he so wishes.   But he can cast summoners or actives as a tree. \n\nThat could be useful, say the other team is heading to baron and your team can't contest it.  Go to baron and activate tree.  They can't kill you in a realistic time frame and if they try to do baron you can make it a smite steal or come out of tree state and use some sort of execute spell then smite baron. \n\nIf you are in the front line and they engage on you and your team is kiting back, you activate tree.  Now they can't effectively kill you.  If they continue to chase  your team while ignoring you, then you can come out of tree form behind them and attack their carries.  \n\nIt would be a very different kind of champ.  could be interesting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"morris1","date":"2016-04-08T17:05:10.545+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CosmicMageX,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EYk82kJ1,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-08T12:17:37.190+0000)\n>\n>  Classic Splash art: {{champion:57}} \n\nWas this a subtle middle finger to Bronze Maokais?","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-04-09T18:26:45.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Maokai will get a new splash art.
