I would've been happy but I already had the skin. So do I just get like nothing? I am confused.\n\nEdit: If I could get SSW Talon instead I would be ecstatic :)\n\nEdit 2: Just noticed the warning in the client. I guess I didn't actually get a gift. Sadness.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T23:33:37.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the confusion!  Indeed, it's a toast notification of old stuff you already received.  The toast notifications were enabled on the updated client so it's showing old stuff.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
