Well, somewhat. The leagues thing is a terrible system. Basically the worst thing they could have implemented. Worse than anything i could have imagined they would implement for the ranked ladder. But, while i do think losing should cost you lp regardless of how you performed. On an occasion where you had an afk or someone that literally dies over 20 times in a game there should be an LP loss reduction failsafe. I think it's a good idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2015-03-28T19:49:18.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"statistically, if you're better than everyone around you, the other team has a 5/9 chance of having a feeder/the worst person in the lobby, and your team has a 4/9 chance. this works out in practice as well, nearly every person who charts their KDA and objective taking versus their elo climb long term has shown that if they're doing better, they climb.\n\nAs for referring to someone as superman, its called the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). If you are in that elo, 1 of 3 things will happen. you're not good enough, and will lose consistently, and will drop. you're too good, and will rise because of the wonders of statistics (and carrying like a boss) or 3: you deserve to be there until you get better, but cannot see that you need to improve. thinking of yourself as superman blocks this, and makes you play the game like you're alone on an island. which consistently loses games because you're not working with your team. if you watch diamond+ games you can see that in soloQ they work together wonderfully with ganks, counterganks, split pushing, and objective taking. \n\nThis is a team game and making it seem single player is a sure way to lose more games.","replies":[{"poster":"BlizzardMOBAsoon","date":"2015-03-29T01:39:45.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yet you're making very big assumptions that just because one person does well, that your team will likely win, that is not true, and almost never true in fact. \"Superman\" was not me, it was an example, re-read for comprehension.
