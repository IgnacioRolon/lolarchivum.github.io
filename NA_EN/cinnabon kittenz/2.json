If I entered a bots game with both sides being bots the FPS drops still ever so often but not as frequently as the every other mode type. I even made sure to close all other applications. I tried out the new client, and on the old one too. \r\n\r\nSo far these issues have only arisen right as the new Alpha Client arrived, no changes have been made to my cpu since then or before then either. The FPS drops are in fact lesser on the Alpha Client but still, you shouldn't just drop the FPS on the old client just to boot everyone off. Just take it away already, I'd rather have games with my usually 40-60FPS rather then trying to 1 shot players with 04fps and then getting raged at for not making it clean by saving my allies in time. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll I want is my favorite game to become FPS worthy again, and I swear my rage will only continue the more often this 04 FPS happens and instead of killing I end up dead because of a stupid screen freeze. >.>","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-24T04:45:30.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be a number of reasons why you're having a constant 4fps.
