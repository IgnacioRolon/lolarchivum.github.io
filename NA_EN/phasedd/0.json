The bar on top of the window had a minimize and exit button on it. I tried to reconnect the game, but it would not let me in after i left the game. I am currently trying to reinstall again hoping it would work..","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-29T02:42:41.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting, I've never heard of this randomly happening before.
