I don't mind losing the champ shards. But that is a bummer. Since I want to fill my whole champion pool up.

Any way to get her back? I would actually really like to use that champion and that would suck if I have to buy her now.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-20T01:28:21.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Porocles mentioned that your crafting went through and resulted in an Illaoi permanent and your connection to our servers went through, but the animation seems to have crashed the client.\n\nYou should now own Illaoi.

I'm happy to say that your crafting went through and resulted in an Illaoi permanent.  Your connection to our servers went through, but the animation seems to have crashed the client.  This may be due to an issue with game files trying to render hextech crafting, and [running a repair ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6) per our game crash guide might fix this.
