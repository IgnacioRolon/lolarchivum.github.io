Why are you doing this?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":58,"down_votes":6,"body":"I am absolutely lost on some of these balance changes. High plat support main. Why are you reducing player choice and expression through item builds and rune choice? I feel like I am more pigeonholed than ever into buying a specific set of items or playing a certain way. This is just... completely wrong and the opposite direction I want the game to go in. Are you trying to cater to new players? Are you trying to make the game easier to play? I&#039;ve never been more opposed to so many of your recent changes. It&#039;s fascinating and terrifying to watch the &#039;dumbing down of league&#039;. \n\n1.) **Runes Reforged did some neat things, but it definitely means less choice for players coming into the game.** There are so many obvious &#039;right&#039; picks for champions that it&#039;s sad how few options you truly get. If i want to try a new &#039;build&#039; .. it feels like I&#039;m under performing or getting punished for trying something new. _A lot of this is because the design caters to a specific type of  or set of champions. As an example, what mage has interest in the &#039;precision&#039; tree? Not many. They should have that option. 2nd example: Let's look at overgrowth. It's absolutely broken-good on someone like Mundo. What about a champion like Zilean? it nets him about 150 health after 30 minutes. It's not viable, and it should be. _\n\nAdd to this the imbalance between some of the trees and you get a really &#039;basic&#039; experience. I want more runes. I want the runes to be competitive with each other, I don&#039;t want to EVER see one rune to rule them all, which is most of what it is right now. I want the ability to customize my starting stats and abilities more than currently offered, and runes could totally do this, but it just doesn&#039;t right now. \n\n2.) **The potency that champions bring to the table has never been more out of wack**, and I understand this to a point because of Runes, but... enough is enough. Certain champions are now awful, and other ones are completely busted. Please react accordingly and make some changes. I&#039;m tired of wasting my bans on Ezreal and Vayne. You also really, really need to look into buffing champions who just arent competitive. Furthermore... Dinger wasn&#039;t on ANYONES radar, yea, he&#039;s annoying - but there are SO many worse offenders right now, and so many champions who need attention more. Why are you even bothering with him? \n\n3.) **The support item changes are pretty baffling.** I want a MORE COMPLEX AND REWARDING VISION SYSTEM. I do not want my first support item to just promise the basic wards and that&#039;s that. This is a step backward and frankly stupifies the game in many ways. Nevermind all the balance issues your going to have to fix along with it, like removing all the old support actives. Those items allowed players tremendous freedom to have player and skill expression... They just gone now? Why? I mean, more gold is always good, and supports could always use more gold to stay competitive, but this isn&#039;t the right direction to go. **You need MORE options with MORE player expression. Not. Less. **\n\n3.) **There is no longer any significant item diversity in league.** There is a core set of items that are broken, and that&#039;s what you get. Doubly so if you have a champion that syngerizes extra good with one of those items. It&#039;s so bad right now that if you DONT have a champion that works well with one of those items, your out of the meta. Go back to point 2 - its the same thing - more changes that REDUCE player choice and put everyone on the same path. Please get some of the items under control. And there are some crap ones right now in league. Why haven&#039;t you messed with these? I&#039;m not asking for broken items, but holy shit, lets give some of these some love - If you did, we might have some better OPTIONS to play with. \n{{item:3060}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3091}} \n\n4.) **Kleptomancy NEEDS to be standardized. **Why are you tying it into an autoattack? What&#039;s the problem with having it hand out an item every 30-60 seconds? It is a NON-CHOICE to most melee champions because of this. Make it proc on spells, at least. So its not reserved for Ezreal or GP. This would open up the keystone and frankly, the whole path to being taken on a LOT more champions. \n\n\nWhy are all of your decisions reducing player choice? Why are you taking away rather than giving options?","replies":[{"poster":"zarxus1234","date":"2018-01-10T16:18:50.996+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":3,"body":"because riot is wants to intentionally ruin their game.

There are just less options to choose all around. We went from like what.. 30-40+ choices as to what to bring to the pregame down to a solid 5. This alone is a big deal. I do like some parts of RR, **but we need more options. ** Your asking me how it's more restrictive? I kinda thought it was obvious that we got less choice. \n\n2.) A lot of the runes are designed in such a way that they are really bad on a large portion of the roster. See my above points for specific examples. The old masteries had SOME of this, but it wasn't so lopsided. You could take movement speed quints on pretty much EVERYONE and have some impact, and possibly discover a neat build. Same thing with Mana per 5, or even gold per 5 quints. Kleptomancy is kinda the equivalent (with gp5 quints), and its fucking awful on half the roster. This is one of my main beefs of RR compared to the old system. \n\n3.) The way the paths work is also very restrictive. If i want to take a splash of health or survivability, i am REQUIRED to go into the resolve tree. With the old system, I had so many more options. Do i want health? maybe just some MR or Armor, and ill buy a health item early.. there was flexibility here. I could tailor my pre-game to what I wanted to build. Runes Reforged is very binary in that regard. \n\n4.) This is to be expected, but it's still a fair point - **there are a lot of unbalanced and crappy runes right now. ** There is a reason no one is taking the armor or mr options in the resolve tree, and its because they are hot garbage. This further narrows the focus on what we can take. Granted this will get better as we roll through season 8, but it's still a big piece of why the game feels so much more restrictive. \n\n5.) As a platinum support main, your argument that I would only take 1 or 2 sets into a given matchup is absolutely dead wrong. It depended on several factors. I feel like i've lost this with RR - now you can be damn sure I'm only taking one set into a match because the rest of my options are **hot garbage. \n**\n\nLastly, I just wanted to say that RR is just one piece of the puzzle, and I think there are many other issues with itemization and damage that are contributing to the 'dumbing of league' .. its not just runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NichtHurz","date":"2018-01-11T15:08:59.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fairyfleur,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AFm43tgl,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-01-10T22:57:35.575+0000)\n>\n> How are runes reforged anymore restrictive than the old runes and masteries?

The options in the trees weren&#x27;t valuable enough to matter and you went the same ones **every single game**\n\nOkay, if we're going for full optimization you're right, old runes were no different. But that's not the point. With old runes you could try out a lot of cheesy and fun things and if you had the runes for it, you could play around with them a lot. With the new rune system it's very clear where to go and for many champions there are many paths that'd not just be suboptimal, but outright unplayable and just really detrimental, no matter what kind of crazy thing you might wanna try. \n\nAlso, Riot is taking away more and more ways to do anything off-meta or individual with the champs in game. Scalings are being standardized to AD or AP on champs or where it's not the other choice is just being made so horrendously bad that there's no point in trying to play the champ differently. Everything's being pressed into some kind of form where it may never slip out.\n\nTwo good examples: AP Xin Zhao and AD Malzahar.\n\nAP Xin Zhao never was broken, but could be insanely fun to play if you were able to take off early enough in the game. It never was meta, it didn't hurt anybody, but now there is no other choice than \"Will I go for more attackspeed oriented builds or will I go for AD only?\"\n\nAD Malzahar was just one of the most unique things you could play. It made Malz feel like a totally different champ, opened up possibilities that no other champ had and it never even slightly interfered with AP Malz. Really, not being able to play AD Malz (after Riot said they'd keep AD Malz playable after his rework) pissed me off so much. It was doable for like one or two patches and then it just became impossible or at least really really hard to play.\n\nYou know, I just wanna be able to mess around a bit and get crazy with my builds and playstyle without it being outright trolling or near the edge of trolling. The only choices you have now if you wanna do something different are crit/standard adc builds and on-hit/active items.\n\nAt least I can still play AP Kog...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colgate Minuette","date":"2018-01-10T23:21:28.135+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fairyfleur,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AFm43tgl,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-01-10T22:57:35.575+0000)\n>\n> How are runes reforged anymore restrictive than the old runes and masteries?

The options in the trees weren&#x27;t valuable enough to matter and you went the same ones **every single game**\n\nHi there - I've been 'retired' from league for months now (9 months I think) and when I played - I played support Sona {{champion:37}} \n\nI had a \"unique\" build with tons of AP and 45% CDR. It included items like {{item:3504}} {{item:3285}} {{item:2301}} {{item:3003}} that sorta thing. And let's be clear it WORKED. I did tons of damage, I had non stop heals and I played her a LOT. Some people disagree with the way I built her but they can suck my positive winrate. \n\nEither way, I was considering (bad idea) returning to league lately and when I saw the new runes I immediately stopped the download and uninstalled it again. My runs used to include lots of mana regen, and CDR. A little magic pen. 1% crit chance and just a ton of cooldown. Masteries were much the same focused on cooldown reduction, healing strength and damage. \n\nNow here I am with the new runes unable to do any of that. I no longer have the amount of mana regen necessary to make that build happen. I no longer have the CDR necessary to make that build happen. \n\nIt tore away my entire build style for multiple characters: {{champion:37}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:267}} \n\nI can't even remember my builds for non-support characters but pretty sure it ruined them too. \n\nIf rito reverses the rune/mastery changes I'd consider coming back but right now I'm not about to crawl my way through a shitty system like this that ruined all my custom builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2018-01-11T00:40:55.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I enjoy the sentiment, but you'd have to test that build in thousands of games with thousands of players to verify it as a legitimate, good, strategy.
