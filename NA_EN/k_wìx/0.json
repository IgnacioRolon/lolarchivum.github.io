It has nothing to do with corrupt game files or odd local settings. The more likely scenario is that ever since the new map, you guys have had to re-code how the \"loading screen\" works, and the game is not properly loading all the required assets in the loading screen anymore, which results in the need to pull them from the hard drive (instead of the RAM) when certain new assets (skills, wards, etc) are used in game, which results in slowdowns because HD access is slower than RAM access.\n\nAlso: I believe you are wrong about the game patching \"the moment the client requests it.\" I have extensively looked into how the game handles corrupt/missing files, and it seems to work like this:\n\n1) Game detects a missing or corrupt file. If the game doesn't crash it ignores it, and pretends it doesn't exist.\n\n2) Game puts a blank file called \"SOFT_REPAIR\" into \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_game_client\\releases\\<current patch folder>\"\n\n3) The next time the patcher loads, it will check for \"SOFT_REPAIR\" and if it exists it will say your game files are corrupted, and ask you to repair. It will then scan ALL your files, repair corrupt/missing ones, and delete \"SOFT_REPAIR\"\n\ntl;dr whoever coded how the \"loading screen\" works before a match did it wrong when they updated it for the new map. Which was a REALLY long time ago at this point.\n\nPS: I just tried running League from a ram-drive, and so far I have had almost zero slowdowns. Which just further proves my point (your spaghetti code is trying to read the HD during the game instead of during the load screen like it's supposed to - causing slowdowns). The RARE slowdowns I have had were reduced to a 0.05 second stutter using the RAM-Drive, and happen maybe once every 2 or 3 games. Compare that to the 0.25 second stutters I get when running from a normal HD, which happen 5-10+ times per game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jesus is Saviour","date":"2016-07-10T07:13:31.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=k wìx,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=N9LIRRuU,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-07-08T20:30:06.224+0000)\n>\n> Hey guys - I&amp;#039;m having an odd problem and i haven&amp;#039;t been able to locate any information on it - was hoping if anyone could help me out! \n> \n> When playing the game, It generally runs very smoothly, i can run it on max settings, lowest settings, and I generally have no issues with one glaring exception. \n> \n> It seems like when **large teamfights break out / new abilities being used/ wards are being placed for the first time**, I incur an odd stutter that causes my client to freeze up for about a quarter of a second? like a short little delay.

You'll need at least 12 GB of RAM for it to run properly. If you have more than 12 GB of RAM you can make your ramdrive a bit bigger if necessary.\n\nLet me know if it works.\n\nhttp://www.ltr-data.se/opencode.html/\n\nUse this link if you want a GUI (you probably want this, I just wanted to link the source): https://sourceforge.net/projects/imdisk-toolkit/","replies":[]}]}
