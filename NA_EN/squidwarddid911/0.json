The items lose their uniqueness if you can still obtain them afterward.","replies":[{"poster":"SquidwardDid911","date":"2017-10-02T03:19:40.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what's the harm of bringing back old events? Surely it was exclusive to the gangplank rework but why not make butchers bridge a playable map again?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T03:39:22.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no harm, it just hasn't come back around. There's also no guarantee that they will, as these events are meant to be a fun thing for people to take part in while they're happening. They stop being unique and fun, just like the icons, if they're available all the time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
