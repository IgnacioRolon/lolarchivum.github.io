My concern is that regardless of how well or not he does in the early game, the mid-late game he becomes nearly unkillable.  I know he&#039;s in a healthier state now than he has been but how are you supposed to deal with a champ with an overloaded kit like his?  I think people are sick of {{champion:157}} for similar reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2017-01-24T20:05:51.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its really not overloaded. He is an assassin, so he should be oneshotting you lategame. All he can really do early is spam Q and try and go for the occasional Passive proc  W is super hard to land in lane. Late Game ekko has his ult for an escape, or damage, but if you use it for damage. that 4ish seconds it takes for his ult to get there is your window. But if your problem is unkillable late game, Try and pick someone with Point can click cc, ekko cant dash or ult while in any immobilizing cc","replies":[{"poster":"JoeMG","date":"2017-01-24T20:55:54.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I don't mind the oneshotting part, mostly just the defensive resources he has on top of that.  Can he dash/ult out of snares, though?","replies":[{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2017-01-24T21:02:00.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope... this is why you hear every ekko ever say ;-; I couldn't ult feelsbadman\nalso his only defense resource is his shield which is a bit much.....","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ruin Lance","date":"2017-01-24T21:00:05.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uh what? he's quite far from \"unkillable\" in late game. ekko is best in early-mid game. his damage doesn't fall off but his ability to assassinate does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-24T20:11:34.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is - like yasuo - incredibly annoying and requires his opponents to think about him and what he has access to. It is not \"overloaded\" for you, all you have to keep track of are a couple cooldowns and the position of his ult.\n\nSame with yasuo - to the person fighting him, all that matters are his Q stacks, E cooldowns and predicting W.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SGT Dingle Berry","date":"2017-01-24T20:02:41.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's 50-50 in low elo as he does take decent macro, but yes late game with a butt ton of AP he becomes a monster. I would never put him in the same bracket as Yasuo though, he doesn't have a BS wind wall that blocks projectiles, a cringe worthy amount of crit, an ult that's ALWAYS up, oh and his stupid ability to ice skate through minions as he laughs at your teammates for coming to assist you.","replies":[]}]}
