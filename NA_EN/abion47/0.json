I'd like to set specific images to specific monitors, but League Displays doesn't seem to have that functionality. The closest I can get is to have all three on a cycle, but this doesn't allow me to have the images on the monitors that I want, and often times I even have two or even all three monitors displaying the same image. (Not to mention that I don't really like wallpaper cycling anyway.\r\n\r\nIs there a place on my computer that the images are downloaded and stored? If possible, I'd like to just set the images to my wallpaper manually so that I can have them be on the monitor that I want without changing. (Though ideally, it would be cool to have this multi-monitor setup support in League Displays itself.)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T02:31:34.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Weeeeeiiiiiird....I'm using multiple monitors myself and that app actually set different images on the displays all by itself without me telling it to. I'm really curious as to what's happening differently here, do you have each display set as it's own independent desktop or are they mirroring desktops?\n\nI'm happy to try and work through this here, but you might get a little better help from our techs as well, who you can hit up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Abion47","date":"2017-12-06T03:46:34.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are all extended desktops, not mirrored. And I suppose I should clarify that they do show different images, but I have no control over what images they are (beyond building the list of what images they _could_ be), nor do I want them to cycle (and it's due to the cycle that I sometimes have the same image on multiple monitors). I don't just want to pick three different images, I want to set a _specific_ image for each monitor and the program doesn't give me that level of control.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-06T04:06:22.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm yea go ahead and hit up our techs in that ticket, they might be able to figure this out a little more than I can here. It sounds like something may not be working properly, since my images actually change at exactly the same time, whereas yours sound like the rotations aren't synced up either =\\ .","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lêu Lêu  UwU","date":"2017-12-08T02:15:09.336+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Found it.

Find the image you want in the app, click the image to enlarge it, in the top right corner next to the X there is a download button for you to save the image. After that, you can use it like any regular wallpaper outside of the League Displays app using the default personalize tools, or whatever other software you use for display customization.","replies":[{"poster":"Abion47","date":"2017-12-06T04:47:25.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, sir. It would be nice if multi-monitor control was a feature of the program (perhaps it will be in the future) but it's good to know that there's a workaround to get this functionality.","replies":[]}]}]}
