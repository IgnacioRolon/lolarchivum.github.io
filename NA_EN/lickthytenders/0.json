Nothing is working. The only way we can play is if I make a custom lobby and he joins through the custom lobby list. help please and thank you..\n\nPS. if I invite some one it will come up with 'An unexpected error has occurred' and if I try to make games occasionally the same error will pop up. AND the shop does the same thing collection etc..

Run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to see if that will fix things up!","replies":[{"poster":"LickThyTenders","date":"2017-11-12T21:24:51.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thanks for the reply it appears the bug has fixed itself. But it was nothing to do with connection to the servers as I was getting 19 ping in a custom game with him, he was getting 25. It was simply something to do with the matchmaking not letting us invite eachother if we did, it would come up 'an error has occurred, please try again' and continued repeating. we both could go solo but NOT duo. If this happens again I'll make another thread till then thanks for the reply. ^.^ (we are the same elo bracket aswell, so that's not the issue especially in norms)","replies":[]}]}]}
