My favorite post 4.20 junglers are Nunu and Trundle, they clear no problem and can usually get the Gromp on first clear. I have been able to get Gromp on second clear on every jungler I've used which would be:\n\n{{champion:9}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} \n\nI think you still need a leash on many champions though, there's no way I could jungle Rengar without a leash. I don't think your idea is bad, probably works just fine but I think there are many viable ways of clearing the jungle. On my first clear I usually just do Red-Raptors-Wolves-Gromp, sometimes no Gromp if low sustain champ. This gets me enough to get my first machete upgrade and some potions, more if I get the Gromp. Then on second clear I go Krug-Raptors-Wolves-Gromp-Blue, again on low sustain champs sometimes can't do all. There are probably better clear paths than this but it works well for me and keeps me at or above the other jungler. After second clear it changes because then I prioritize Red-Gromp-Blue in that order.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-12-02T05:55:18.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For most champions, this doesn't sound as good as (blue side):\n0.

Then recall.
