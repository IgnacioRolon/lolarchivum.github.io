I know the initial post was a bit of a rant, but let me elaborate.\n\nMatchmaking is supposed to find players of equal-ish skill to compete against each other, however it gets more nuanced. Let's say it finds 10 people using silver 3 as a baseline, so you might have some silver 3's, 2's, 4's. Now it has to attempt to take the available player pool and sort them out. The system isn't going to take the 5 best people in the pool and put them on one side. So there is a balance. If a person is at the top of the pool and can be seen carrying the last 3+ games, then it would make sense to put the lowest player in the pool with them. Depending on how big the gap is the greater chance of discrepancy in the pool assignment.  So you might see something like this 1,4,7,8,10 vs 2,3,5,6,9. Which is sorting players by rank in the pool. It could be larger depending on how high number 1 is. So you could get a 1,5,8,9,10 vs 2,3,4,6,7. And that is a super easy win for the 2,3,4 side. A great example is a friend of mine that can hard carry. He will go on win streaks and then get something like this.\n\nhttps://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2849453363/230306980?tab=overview\n\nYou can see where he will go on a win streak, then get a team that does that. The same happens to me. This game is still unfortunately about the worst player on the team having the most impact. But you can see this under Ranked in your profile. You don't really see many people on a hot streak. And it's why if you are on a win streak, you'll come across a game where you and one other player on the team are at the same skill level, if that.  \n\nThe problem which has been pointed out, is they allow people from different ranks into games they should not be in. This is where the system primarily fails. Especially in Silver where they can let first time ranked players end up in.\n\nBut before you say get better, there is any easy way to check match history and look at the stats, maybe there are merit to these words ;)","replies":[{"poster":"haaaaaaalp","date":"2018-08-27T14:23:02.016+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chase 5,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EzdOUWtt,comment-id=00000003,timestamp=2018-08-27T13:52:27.080+0000)\n>\n> It kind of does.

Just from a mathematical standpoint alone, it is impossible to create a queue that you are describing without queue times spiking up to 10-20x normal range when accounts go on a win streak.\n\nThe reality is that there are a ton of shitty players and you will get them on your team a lot.

As far as I know, only mobile games attempt to use such a model and that is for 1v1. Other large mobas use an elo system similar to league. When you win, you get better allies and opponents. When you lose, you get worse ones. \n\nAnyway, your accusation is that league will intentionally give you worse players as allies as you go on a winstreak. That means initially, you can be paired up with anyone in your elo range. However, as you win more and more games, the game becomes more and more restricted in who it can pair you up with because it has to find worse and worse players. As the subset of players get smaller, your queue times will skyrocket.\n\n\n> And to be clear I&#x27;m not talking about players who are having a bad game or maybe aren&#x27;t performing as well, I&#x27;m talking about blatant seeding of players who have no business being in a game at the current skill level that you are at.

People aren't going to pick optimal champions or even build a decent team comp every game. Some people will tilt. Some are already tilted from previous games, for the same reason that you're now upset at them.\n\nReview the last 5 or so games of each of your teammates when you think Riot is \"inting\" your LP with their matchmaking. I seriously doubt that all four of your teammates are on a hard losing streak, or that they're inting/soft-inting all of their games. If they are, then that is the rarest case and will not consistently be happening to you.\n\nLearn how to hard-win your role and to guide your team to victory. If you're 5/0 out of lane top as Darius and your bot is struggling. Go help them. If you're 1/4/2 as a jungler, then you're probably part of the problem and you need to figure out what is going wrong. Bad pathing? Counterjungling someone you can't fight? Counterjungling while enemy laners are missing and getting countered? Do you play support? Then all is not hopeless if your AD is having a rough game. Go roam and help the strongest part of your team and have your AD farm it out, and then bring the strongest part of your team to get your AD back into the game, while securing vision and denying vision to the enemy.\n\nWhat usually makes the difference in the lower Elos is macro play and shot-calling, because players at these tiers just want to fight constantly and then don't know what to do after the fight is over. If you ace the enemy team at 20+ minutes, you get Baron if you are healthy enough or multiple towers, but I see lower Elo players base or go farm Krugs.\n\nI've played at every division below Challenger on a variety of accounts over the years. If you put in the effort, you can come out ahead. Some games you will lose because the enemy team plays/drafts better than you, but you need to work on your gameplay because statistics completely disagree with your thinking. As much as you, and I, want it to be true that the system is broken, statistics don't lie.\n\n\nGood luck on The Fields of Justice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Summonah12369","date":"2018-08-27T14:07:40.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I go through this all the time, I recently managed to balance out the losing and winning somehow.
