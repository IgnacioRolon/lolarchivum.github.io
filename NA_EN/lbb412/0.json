And it would be an interesting way to either give Nunu more ganking pressure (he could max Ice Ball first since Consume's damage scales with level) or more unique map control (you could double down on Consume being an objective control master spell by giving the Consume buffs considerable control over objectives. Like % health damage against monsters, maybe a speed buff when moving towards large monsters that triples when moving towards epic monsters, and like a massive armor buff when in combat with monsters).\n\nI see tons of potential in a Nunu rework.
