A couple months ago, my account got hacked into and the password and possibly the username was changed. The email linked to my account was also changed so I can't do much. I really want to get it back because I spend hundreds of dollars on rp on that account. I want to try and find out how to change the email linked with my account so I can get back into it and change it all back. The person on my account changed the summoner name to bootbrah92 if that helps anything. If there is a way you can help, please suggest something in the comments section. Thankyou for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T03:59:40.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit up our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) picking the option \"I need help recovering my account\" as soon as you can!
