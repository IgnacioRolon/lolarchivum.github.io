Her mana issues are horrid. Even if I build a morrelos. Now I understand her passive helps a bit, but tbh a free cast every 18 seconds sucks. I go oom after i get someone to half health. it takes me 90% of my mana bar to poke them down enough to go all in, then i have no mana for the all in. A buff to her passive would help this, or just change it to something else and low her mana costs imo. The passive cd gets reduced by spamming abilites, and it just does not pay off. Her damage is balanced, but in such an unbalanced game calling something &quot;balanced&quot; just means it sucks. I understand shes more of a close range cc mage then a burst. This is what sucks. There is no room in meta for a close range cc mage. Its much better just to pick an ahri or swain. She has nothing significant to bring other then a 1.5 second stun, might as well just pick annie instead. I love her all in potential with E, so either buff her damage and make her an all in burst mage or change her mana costs to help her poke down her enemies. Her teamfight is nice, good aoe ult when she ults herself and nice aoe. These are my thoughts. Just lost gold promos for a 2nd time so sorry if i come across salty.","replies":[{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2015-08-05T04:29:24.864+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"idk why THE FCK  they  would give a heal to lissandra lol  , revert her w nerf since DFG IS GONE in first place ;  and then rework her  passive","replies":[{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2015-08-05T04:59:54.265+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=King Freeza ,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PmvWcE0t,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-05T04:29:24.864+0000)\n>\n> idk why THE FCK  they  would give a heal to lissandra lol  , revert her w nerf since DFG IS GONE in first place ;  and then rework her  passive\n\nThe heal is to buy her even more time when setting things up and baiting for her team I believe.\n\nIt also gives her another reason to use it on herself, which honestly she wouldn't do much in teamfights. \n\nI haven't played Liss on SR for awhile, but honestly I didn't really have mana problems with her. \n\nEspecially after getting Catalyst.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-05T06:27:22.952+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's basically the thinking here.

One of them is the W range being lower than her AA and ult AOE range which makes the spell very clunky to use in alot of times. Another issue is the low gameplay value of her passive, which you guys have been saying you want to revamp her passive since forever, so why not do that, instead of this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Louddy","date":"2015-08-05T21:33:21.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you could exploit this a little bit more, for exemple you could use her passive and say that if she ults herself and has her passive on: then it heals.

I'm rarely using mana because I often just wait for a guaranteed hit on my Q rather than throwing it out to zone or CS'ing with it. She's not an oppressive long range poke champ, she's much more of a mid-game teamfight winning machine. Machinations, bro. She's waited centuries, she can probably wait for a bit before going full ham on the enemy laner all the time.","replies":[]}]}
