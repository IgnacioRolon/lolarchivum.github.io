Does it provide the same timer on the legacy client?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nIs it just you who sees the timer, or did everyone see 34 minutes?","replies":[{"poster":"Leon Gashwig","date":"2017-01-22T14:27:31.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone did see it, the LPQ lasted for 40 minutes, and I haven't tried it on Legacy client because BattPlayerTV doesn't have LPQ now.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-24T16:38:24.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the follow up!
