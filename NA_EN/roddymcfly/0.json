Game loading slow or not at all. Team offers remake before loaded into game. Getting penalized even though I have no history of leaving games intentionally. Riot, please help review my account and correct this patch issue. It is causing me to lose unnecessary LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T23:32:17.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't able to remove [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ), and even though it's intentional it still causes other players a negative experience.  Still, it sucks that happened and I'd like to help.  These bugsplats usually result from driver issues or something else like bad game files.  I suggest going through each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot and fix this up.
