As a low elo player, I'm very familiar with the onslaught of problems it comes with. Trolls, toxic players, players with an overbearing sense of superiority, no communication, etc. All of which feels more potent of an issue than someone who simply isn't good at the game. It's hard, I know, knowing that regardless of what we do, both the faults of our own, and as a group, can still invoke a loss. But the moment we throw away the potential growth for teamwork for the sake of improving only ourselves with the sacrifice of an ally, it will very much turn a bad situation into something worse.\n\nThis game isn't in season 2 anymore. We don't have the flexibility to simply forego our own growth and ignore the growth of our team. The game as it is right now, is designed to punish those who have ignored all sense of communication and team growth up unto even the introduction of Season 6.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-03-14T17:28:45.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm awful at ADC though.

Working with no energy after getting home from work fried my sense of logical thinking.\n\nAdditionally, my mention of growth actually refers to the player, not the champion. Gold gain means jack if the player itself can't hit his/her target at the appropriate time. I apologize for the self reference yet again, but the bronze tiers as a whole are a perfect representation of what I'm talking about. Players who are here due to either trolls/toxic players, or just as much due to the lack of sense of team effort or otherwise. I can't tell you how many times I've watched a lane die despite my pings or contextual clues that a fizz or some other monstrosity is about to rid them of their virtual innocence with the gang bang that's about to take place if they don't move. They ignore it of course, and die. Not once have I ever seen someone response appropriately to blatant warnings, because they choose to ignore team communication, because they choose to isolate themselves if it's not for the convenience of wanting someone to blame if something happens.\n\nPeople can do well with their roles, they can fulfill it to best of their abilities. But if something is lacking, it'll show. I commonly play mid, sometimes ad, sometimes top, sometimes support, and I've been fed before. I've had my lane snowballed, and I've won my lane. But the moment roaming phase hits, it's a common theme to witness that go all out the window for this or that reason. Moment a lane loses, my power is just as greatly imposed by the power of that lane, so and so forth. \n\nInexperienced players happen to appear in games, whether we like it or not. But regardless if we win or lose, if we intentionally ruin their chance to learn, we aren't helping the problem, we're making it worse. They lose that chance to learn, that chance to get better. Losses come with the territory, but it will always come down to why we lost.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-03-14T17:49:34.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh~~, I no need to apologize~~ no need to apologize (jesus why didn't I reread it before clicking post).

I've thought about picking it up because I've seen the terror it can bring.\n\nAs for a better scaler, it's always a tough call since it's hard to know who scales better being a Silver level player.  I could be wrong, but I've always seen some ADCs as more garbage late game (Lucian) and good mid/early.  I usually play Zyra/Malzahar/Brand to carry (though Malzahar is probably a pick AP Support instead of a APC Support) which I view as scaling better than Lucian because Lucian's main problem is he's screwed over by Ninja Tabis and his short range is a huge hinderance (while Zyra/Brand don't have that issue) for example.\n\nI never say I take the gold.  I even mentioned that I actively avoid CS during laning phase (it changes during team fights and late game because lane cleanup isn't a priority for Silvers as much and I'll save a tower from a huge wave which usually inflates my end game CS).  I'll typically have maybe taken 2 CS during the entire laning phase (even as Malzahar), so I'm not sure where you are getting your assumptions from because it's certainly not reading what I'm typing.  As for kill gold, a lot of the times my laner gets it, while a minor amount of the time I get it (talking about laning phase specifically).  While if I had picked supports that I'm assuming you want me to pick, there would be no kill gold.  It's still a net +150/200 or 300/400 regardless of whether or not my ADC got the kill.  The enemies still died because of my play/support choice and my ADC still got extra gold.\n\nAs for being mad at a weak adc, you have no idea my personal outlook and couldn't be entirely more wrong about where I place blame. I focus on myself, and if someone else is not doing well, I could care less.  It's understandable that you think that way since it is fairly common in LoL.

Now your just wanting to call me wrong so you did with nothing to call me wrong about. No I am not entirely wrong. Anyone who argues Sion is a Good support is wrong. If you don't focus stealing cs then good for you. But you specifically told me you don't waste the gold on the adc. So what was I suppose to think???? You lead me through the door even opened it up. If your good enough to take credit for kill then get good enough to deliver the kill to the adc. I had one game today where the support could do that. He knew how to get out damage and how to get the kill to me. Sine he was not greedy for the kills a support he fed me up nicely. And guess what happen. I had 0 deaths into late game. Bam 0 deaths is where it is at for this game. That is more fun than any full build. And it only happened because my support let me take the cs and kills. \n\nAnd you know what is funny about that round? I was just screwing around with my rune pages and took the wrong one. That is right I took a late game teemo rune page as adc and came out with a S+ because my support was the bomb.com My early game was so weak I was for sure that my support would abandon me and start taking everything. But they dint care my early game was weak. They just fed me up and watched me carry from their shoulders lol.\n\nSupport has become the most important role. The Adc gets all the credit when thing go good. But he also takes all the negative grieving from the team when things go bad. Supports are the real carry here. The adcs cant carry troll supports as they are all weak from their nerfs over the years. Heck most people dont relize but full AD teemo does more DPS with the auto then all the adcs but draven. Ya but he is not broken cuz when you pump his auto up like that his abilitys are wasted minus the blind, and he is short range for a range champion. Support tho if they do it right can carry. I dont know about the rest of the ellos but bronze is totally owned by the supports. When they are good at the role. other wise they just a drag. something extra for the Ad to have to carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-03-14T18:45:11.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if you read it, it's a hypothetical question.\n\nI was asking the opinion of the poster when the ADC is a poor player, and giving them gold is a waste.  Let's say they have 0 CS (they are just missing everything, and not being harassed let's say).  it was an inquiry, not a statement.  There is a reason that asking a question is not necessarily the same as saying something.\n\n\"What if I have herpes?\" is different than \"I have herpes.!!!!\" just on a logical level.  It is suggestive, but doesn't always mean that I have herpes.  Hence why I didn't tell you that I 'do not waste gold on the adc'.  Because I usually do, despite when I can tell the ADC is a sub optimal choice for gold income.  Thankfully, Support Carries are gold efficient, so it's not terribly bad choice to still do that.\n\nEspecially with a following statement (about CS) indicating that I avoid stealing gold in some situations, it's logically consistent to assume that would probably extend to other areas as well.\n\nI also called you entirely wrong about your _assumption on my outlook_ and not my taking gold from kills, and you're still wrong there because there is nothing in any of my comments here indicating I'm a salty player.  Therefore, I'll still call you wrong in your assumptions about me.  You can take the Carry Wheel without being mad about it.\n\nThere are certainly times when the ADC can not get the kill.  \n\n1) His positioning at the start is poor, and the enemies flash away so my ADC can't reach but I can\n2) My ADC can't dodge anything and almost dies and has to flash away (then again not being in reach), but I can finish off the opponents\n3) I solo kill someone because I can and no one is around.\n\nHowever just like CS, I feed my ADC as much as possible, so like I said.  I never said \"I always take the kills yo!\".   I just asked the opinion of the person when putting gold into a carry where the person just needs to be carried, not given gold to see if they can maybe carry.  If it is obvious the ADC is new to the role, and won't be able to do it (they clearly can't position well, constantly die, can't cs, doesn't really know how to ADC in general) if possible, I will be far less cautious to avoid taking kills.  I'll just make sure the kill happens, and if the ADC gets it, fine, otherwise I don't mind the gold.  This is different than just always taking the gold.  ADC is really hard actually, so I don't blame when an ADC can't carry very well.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulpiercing420","date":"2017-03-15T13:12:27.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can sit here none stop trying to look for things to argue about your just repeating your self.

Out of the people that responded there is about 2 out of 30 people that like to playing sion support. Never do I find adcs that like having a sion support.\n\nSion support makes the game to hard or to easy. As is feed rate is incredible. I don't like having him as my own support as he will lose the game for me. And I don't like fighting him as support. As he makes the game to easy to win.\n\nThe role report should be for rank mode not normal. Rank is where it gets serious. I tried it out and was really enjoying the extra competition for a while. I had a win steak going there up until the finale three games for promoting. All three games got a sion support. Everyone called me trash as the sion murdered my lane. That huge winning streak to sion support and being called trash\n\nAs for my Leona top lane. I would not take to rank, but you go ahead and msg those people I fought against with Leona. I win most every lane. Leona just over kills with her tank and stuns. Her damage falls out bad late game and if you try to keep the damage up you will lose to much of her tanking. So she is a special play. You gotta push hard and win fast or not at all. I can 1v1 yi all game with leona until he full builds. So Leona is awesome until late game. Once late game comes Leona loses pretty much everything in the way of damage and is just their for the team fights through her none stop stuns.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-14T17:57:02.274+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll be the bad guy\nYou're not accepting reason\nYou say you see this\nso that must be everything\nthe site above\ncollaborates\nthousands of players games to make a decent prediction\nIn terms of info the site is more accurate than your opinions/feelings","replies":[{"poster":"Soulpiercing420","date":"2017-03-14T19:22:39.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Opinions feelings? you must be stupid.

Always dropping his slow fat ability hit on the minions barely even aiming for champions. Waits for us to farm attacks us and the minions all at once. I just step off the side and proceed to attacking the fat tank standing there waiting for his ability to finish dropping. Unless their adc is range then of course I attack that since the sion i busy and can not help to return damage.","replies":[{"poster":"cuddlykitten4","date":"2017-03-15T19:05:33.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I've seen it win plenty.

That's trolling too huh, even if it works for the player? That sounds like meta worship and it only makes things complicated between those who are and aren't open to flex.\n\nNot playing a key role is not always trolling.

Meta worship huh I don't mind getting a shaco support. As I have seen what he can do in lane when the player is good. Shaco is simply broken stupid good. Sion on the other hand has the slowest fattest hit box the game has to offer. He can only land the hit on people dumb enough to stand in the big red hit box auto attacking the tank. Yes Sion bot lane is a troll pick as he can only beat trolls. I like many champions bot lane but try to avoid the ones like zyra as they focus the cs and kills to much. You get a zyra or lux and you know you wont be getting any magic minions that game. Because they are gonna one hit all of them.\n\nSion top is awesome I see him do really good up there. But of all my 2000 rounds in rift with all the games I have ever been in with sion support he has lost all of them. I have not seen sion support win a single game. Maybe you have but I have not.","replies":[{"poster":"GeminiRune","date":"2017-03-14T19:42:33.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You praise Shaco yet dispraise Sion, both which are **unconventional** picks into the support role. You classify Sion as a troll pick but not Shaco because of his hitbox and means of being a suitable support. Give me a break! First of all, I've been on the 2 losing sides of a Sion Support as Leona and Soraka during the tank support meta a while back. Experiencing it firsthand was enough to tell me what good it can bring to the 2v2 on top of the rest of the game. I didn't walk into the first game and say \"Oh look at this...what is this Sion\" and proceed to get slammed. It was an enjoyable experience that I'm willing to take on again whenever that comes.\n\nSecond of all, you add nothing to what potential Shaco has to make him \"simply broken stupid\" in the support role. Invisibility, blinks, slows, and traps. He has utility, but like Jhin (as initially posted) will lack the power desired later on. Those traps become ineffective and the slow less fearful without the gold. Sion brings two slows, displacement, and a gap closer as his utility. When built tanky, he doesn't need to harvest for power as that just comes with time. Now if you really know the context behind the term \"troll\" which pick sounds more like it and why do you still say Sion?\n\nAs for your preference of champions: you just don't like damage supports. Simple as that. You don't like having your farm and power spike reduced or taken early as a bot lane carry as that's all the more desirable than the rest of the map. You say above for them go elsewhere for their cs and kills yet you grieve and call a pick like Sion in Support role a troll pick. By that logic: moving the Twitch and Jhin at this current iteration of the game would be considered trolling as well as they don't often run those other roles just like Sion. Frankly I think you're just picking at things you can't cope with.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulpiercing420","date":"2017-03-15T13:02:40.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes they are but I get trolled it happens at least the shaco seems to have a 50-50 (just giving it a low one because it seems troll, but I have not lost a game with shaco support yet.
