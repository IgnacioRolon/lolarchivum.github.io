Yes it's just two examples, but it proves that they do get punished.\n\nP.S.

But I guess I cannot do that and I must except the majority of the community to be \"stupid\" by my definition. Which is incapable of learning. But really that is hard to do. I really don't like considering people to be stupid. Its like calling a human trash I just don't like it. But here it is a must. Stupid trolls. Screw it trolls gonna report me for asking their friends not troll me. I will do it back. go ahead enjoy your ban when the system finally gets worked out right. Metaphorically speaking not you of course you seem pretty smart. And like a influence. You just keep doing what your doing and you might make a difference. I know you sure make me feel like an ass when I should feel like one. I get it flameing is not good. But they took away my report options. So its either I come flame on the boards every time I get trolled or flame there. Gotta get that stress out somewhere. Cant report it out. Can't griped it out to the real trolls. So Im am going to gripe to random ass people who don't give a fuck. Also I am going to start writing down the names of trolls if I can remember to do so and post them up here sometimes. Hope people like their names going on the boards cuz I am gona let everyone know who the trolls are lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
