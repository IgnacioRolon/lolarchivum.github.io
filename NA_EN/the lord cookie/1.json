One of the major hallmarks for certain cancers is that they promote angiogenesis, that is, they release factors to promote the growth of blood vessels towards them in order to generate their own blood supply to grow off of. This has been noted scientifically, and anti-angiogenesis treatment is a part of dealing with certain types of cancers. These drugs serve to help cutoff the blood supply to the tumor, preventing it from receiving the nutrients and other factors needed sustain growth.\n\nHilariously, Riot has done the same with us. They&#039;ve restricted our access to the front page, hidden us away from the side panel at one point, removed upvoting/downvoting -&gt; all methods of strangling us off from a supply of new posters and individuals that might serve to allow us (the cancer) to grow! \n\nAs IAintDarius has already so wonderfully memed, there is a course that be taken to allow us to grow as a community and become great again. We must return to the front page, and integrate with the rest of the boards so that our specific brand of cancer may flourish and metastasize.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEdit: For reference, I've included an image as to the current state of things.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JHjBC5m.png[/img]\n\nEdit: Lemme get to the point of this here, folks, since this isn't just a meme.  Would like to say that it is imperative that we are allowed to be on the front page of boards along with the other boards and thereby not continue to die as people slowly leave.","replies":[]}
