This ends up throwing off the way the charge feels, making it seem less fair to play against imo. Not sure if it&#039;s just something on my side or it just needs a small update to the timing of the sound effect.\r\n\r\nRecreation is simple, play Urgot, use your q, the audio might shouldn&#039;t be matched to the explosion.","replies":[]}
