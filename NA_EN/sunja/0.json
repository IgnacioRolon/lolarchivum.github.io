After a while of being logged in I will often get disconnected from the league chat with no ability to reconnect other than closing and logging in again. This also happens after every game I play, which prevents me from chatting in the end game lobby. \r\n\r\nI've tried a few older solutions such as flushing dns, disabling ip helper but to no avail :/.\r\nIn game I'm not lagging or anything either the chat itself is the only thing not working.","replies":[{"poster":"Sunja","date":"2016-10-11T05:05:58.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I switched to a wired connection, allowed everything stated under my firewall, configured my dns, used the indicated website for packet loss/buffering, release and renewed my ip, and flushed my dns. All to no avail. The only thing I haven't tried was port forwarding which I don't have any access to my router's settings. But I do know however that nothing has changed related to its settings since before the problem has arised and it the chat itself has been working prior to this problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T02:18:12.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chat servers are separate from the game and matchmaking servers, so you could only be encountering issues being routed to that one subset of servers. As a first stop, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in its entirety to ensure your local network settings aren't causing this to happen.\n\nLet me know if you continue to have these disconnections after working through that guide.","replies":[]}]}
