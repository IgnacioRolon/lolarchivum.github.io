This is by no means a small update. When Riot performed the small mage update mid-season, all of the mages who received a small update, still had the same general playstyle as before. With Akali&#039;s small update, they are giving her a 1 dimensional playstyle of only being a cleanup champion. \r\n\r\nBefore this small update, Akali could perform multiple roles of being an initiator, splitpusher, or cleanup. She doesn&#039;t have the damage to 1v1 champions consistently, and her passive to help her take down towers is gone. At least when they changed Akali not proccing Q w/E, they did not nerf anything with numbers, so the combo changed only slightly.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t mind that they change the cd on her E, nor if they changed her passive, however I would like to revert her R to her current state, and remove the blink in her W, as there is no need for mobility in that ability if it already gives movement speed.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2016-11-05T01:39:47.031+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think every Akali fan feels like she is in a bad state currently and this update will make her even worse.

Given the current rate of VGU release of 4-6 months PER TEAM (there are 2 teams each working separately on a VGU at any given time), those 6 VGUs are like to take between 12-18 months, counting from Ryze's and Yorick's release.

The mathematical representation might not be what's realistic as i feel it's somewhere around 2-4 months. Leaning more on 3-4 months between them.\n\nWe're still discussing cadence of releases here. Cadence in this discussion means pace/frequency of VGUs coming out. What we're not discussing is how long does it actually take from an idea to a VGU. I'm well aware that some champions are on the VGU list internally but are not officially on the list until the right idea comes along. That's why Yorick was known to be in a need of a rework months/years before he actually got one.\n\nIf a project does lead to a dead end, they can either cancel it or icebox it and move on to something else. It You are not correct in your statement as if the VGU teams were only occupied by 1 champion project per team, the actual cadence of VGUs would be more or less equivalent to their \"conceptualization to realization\" times. That's roughly from 6 months to a year(s) between VGUs.

But from the past, you can at least make an educated guess on how far from each other the new content will come out - new champions, VGUs or class updates.\n\nHow long a champion will have to wait for a VGU depends on us. If we want it faster, Riot is going to move her closer to the top. It's the reason why WW, Galio, Urgot and Eve more or less next in line - not necessarily in this order. As for Riot doing work on Akali right now (even if she is going to be VGU'd in the future) is for the same reason Swain was also changed.

In 2016 the rate of VGU releases was 6 months for each team, there being 2 teams entails 3 months between each VGU. Shen's update is an outlier since his wasn't a full VGU, so if you want to include 2015 releases then include Darius-Poppy's 4 months too. This means that this rate Akali's update will come at 12-18 months, which is what I've been saying all along. Please, I beg of you, curb you argumentative enthusiasm until you take the time to at least understand what's been argued in the first place. This is getting extremely annoying and repetitive. \n\nExpanding on the timeline so far, it's quite clear they're aiming to release a class update in between 5 VGU-new champion alternating releases, and try to make it so that there's a new release of something every month. That leaves a likely timeline as something like this:\n\nAug Darius (VGU)\nSept nothing\nOct nothing\nNov Marksman Roster (CLASS UPDATE)\nDec Poppy (VGU)\n---2016---\nJan Shen/Jhin (VGU)/(NEW)\nMar Aurelion Sol (NEW)\nApr Taric (VGU)\nMay Mages Roster (CLASS UPDATE)\nJun Taliyah(NEW)\nJul Ryze (VGU)\nAug Kled (NEW)\nSep Yorick (VGU)\nOct Ivern (NEW)\nNov Assassins Roster (CLASS UPDATE)\n_[speculation from now on]_\nDec WW (VGU)\n---2017---\nJan ???

But the point is (and has always been) that Akali will very likely be the last since, unlike the other candidates she was decided to be put in the list somewhat recently, as evidenced by the fact that they were still considering fixing her up with this class update and only decided to leave her for a proper VGU after the work on it had started.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Iceember","date":"2016-11-05T05:11:19.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So lets take the data we have and output an actual estimate.

In fact compared to like the marksmen its hard to see how the different assassins are supposed to stand out when it comes to their team utility.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DeathTheHorseman","date":"2016-11-05T02:42:10.041+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/550/771/7ac.jpg\n\nBloody hate the changes.\n\nI hate more how they completely ignore the feedback from the Akali testers even more...\n\nP.S. \n\nRiot gets an underplayed champ (1% pick rate) and turns it complete garbage with the nerf bat (when she has only 49% win rate on championgg)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-11-05T11:01:33.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Confirmation bias is at play here.\nThat's when people, who see that the lack of information supporting the opposite claims don't exist, believe they're right because there obviously aren't any.

Everyone should have an opinion about a certain champion, whether they wanted to main them, play them occasionally or tangentially think about them. This means that my opinion on how Morgana should feel like and play like is my preference that stems from my comfort zone and muscle memory while someone's view or Morgana might be different than mine.

The other big factor alot of people don't discuss when talking about her rework is the fact that shroud grants a **non-decaying movement speed buff**.

Use the fact the shroud is in FoW to gain an advantage over my opponent. \nor \n2. Let him potentially escape because I threw it over the wall instead. I don't have any form of gapclose to get ontop of him and he has a blink on a relatively low CD to use as an escape. \n\nAs for the Dragon steal. Their jungler was there and my initial plan was to just sit in shroud invisibility in the pit and wait for it to be low enough to smite. I was a bit unlucky that one of em warded outside the pit but jumping to kat or trundle may not have yielded me the steal as I didn't know if Xin had smite or not.
