I couldn't even log back into the game. I sat at 400+ ping every time I tried to attempt to log back into the game sitting in the load window. It's been 40 minutes now.. the game is probably lost and I am probably reported because they think I bailed. Not to mention, this never happens... and it takes a long time to even load from the client for some reason. After sitting in the loading screen it tells me to check my internet, and then gives me a link? It's not me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ominous Wizzard","date":"2015-06-26T00:04:07.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the exact problem i keep getting.

It started to happen at about the end of one of my games, thank god I had already helped my adc get kills so we won, after the game I reconnected my router couldn't find anything. I thought maybe it was that I was running something that was killing my process' I stopped anything that looked like it could interfere, didn't help. I play 1 game after to see if it worked bc my computer was running fine nothing else had problems like this.
