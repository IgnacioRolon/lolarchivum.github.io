This issue has caused me to disconnect from 4-5 different Draft Mode champion selects, and I&#039;m sitting at a **15 minute wait time** each time it does this. This is also in addition to the chat login errors, and the server disconnects. I&#039;ve tried repairing my client, and **nothing** has been fixed. A few of my friends have this issue, but some have no problems at all.","replies":[{"poster":"secsy jakim","date":"2015-05-10T04:50:13.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude I am haveing exact same problem.
