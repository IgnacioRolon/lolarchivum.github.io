{"poster":"Dis The Chris","date":"2015-11-01T05:24:06.742+0000","title":"New Summoner Spell Ideas","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So with Clarity and Clairvoyance gone from Summoner&#039;s Rift, opting to suggest new Summoner Spells that could introduce new play styles and strategy for players.\n\n****\n\n*  **Back-up** - Immediately summons 2/3/4 Melee Minions and 1/2/3 Caster Minion into your lane (Increases at levels 6, 12 and 16). These Minions has increased Health and Damage. If an Inhibitor is destroyed on the designated lane, it will also summon a single Siege Minion with increased Attack Speed.\n *  _Pros:_ Allows players to split-push effectively, provides a more Siege-type of approach in lanes.\n * _Cons:_ If timed incorrectly or used recklessly, will allow the opposing players to earn more Gold.\n\n****\n\n* **Snatch** - Grants half of the Gold Bounties of a Non-Epic Monster(s) in a small radius around you and the Smite Effect of the Jungle Monster (Can only be applied once per spawn). This also grants you vision of these targets for 60 seconds and reduces your cooldowns by 1.5 seconds for each Jungle Unit affected (2 seconds on Large Monsters).\n * _Pros:_ Alternative to Smite Summoner Spell, a Utility-type of Jungling, focused on Gold Income and Counter-Jungling. Upgrades also provide different types of utility outside the jungle.\n * _Cons:_ Lowers offensive output in terms of both in and out of the Jungle. \n\n****\n\n* **Sacrifice** - Bonds to an allied Champion, increasing your Armor and Magic Resistance by 5% for 3 seconds. During this time, 55% of the damage received by the Bonded Ally is transferred to you. An ally can only be bonded once at a time, attempting to use Sacrifice on an already Bonded Ally will cancel the previous Sacrifice.\n * _Pros:_ Provides Support or Tank Players to have a direct impact in terms of saving them or the ability to save their allies or let them survive in skirmishes if timed properly.\n * _Cons:_ Risk of dying is pretty high.\n\n****\n\n*  **Body Double** - Briefly stealth the player before creating a body double of the user. Body Double immediately dissipates if approached by an enemy champion or attacked. Body Double's Dissipation Range decreases (600 / 550 / 400) as the user's level increases (3 / 9 / 12). Body Double also grants a small vision around it and lasts for 4 seconds. Can be controlled by pressing the Summoner Spell Button again.\n *  _Pros:_ Tactical usage weather offensively or defensively, allowing players to escape or cutting out escapes during a gank.\n * _Cons:_ Long Cooldown, disappears immediately if used incorrectly (like nearby an enemy champion).\n\n****\n\n*  **Shock** - Strikes a random enemy champion in a large radius, dealing 20 + (13 x Level) and stunning the target for 2 seconds. The stun duration against the enemy champion is further reduced by 0.2 seconds for every enemy minion within the radius. An enemy champion cannot be affected by Shock for the next 35 seconds.\n *  _Pros:_ Powerful tool in terms of offense and utility, leaning towards the utility side as the stun can possibly lockdown a single enemy champion if alone. \n * _Cons:_ Utilizing it in lane and incorrectly timing it can greatly reduce the Stun Duration of Shock as well making it unreliable during Teamfights.\n\n****\n\n*  **Beacon** - Creates a small beacon around the user, granting allies inside a boost in Ability Power and Attack Speed. Grants 5 + (3 x Level) Ability Power and 40% Attack Speed. Beacon lasts for 8 seconds or if the user goes out of the beacon. Multiple Beacons does not stack.\n *  _Pros:_ Provides a strong boost in a small area in favor of your allies, allowing you to hold down the enemy forces or to quickly siege through the enemies.\n * _Cons:_ Locks you down in the radius as leaving the area quickly removes the beacon, also makes it easier for the enemy team to aim at you and your allies.\n\n****\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Dis The Chris","date":"2015-11-08T08:52:50.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated with 3 new Summoner Spells, thanks for the input guys!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fifilona","date":"2015-11-06T19:02:23.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes we really need some new summoner spells to replace the ones they keep getting rid of. Good job thinking of new ideas. I hope riot is on the same page and thinking of new ones too. I hate that certain spells have been dominant for so long but whats worse is that the pool of choices is just getting smaller. Some new ones would be awesome!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dis The Chris","date":"2015-11-01T14:20:51.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the confusion.

I dunno why you mention Malz though. If you mean people cleansing his R, you can't cleanse Suppressions. You can QSS a Suppression, but you can't use Cleanse on it, which was done that way because current suppressions are on very long CD's and are cornerstones of the entire kit really. Having to counter-build compared to grabbing one summoner spell is a major difference. lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dehydratemonster","date":"2015-11-01T07:59:14.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just my opinion,\nthe last one may break the balance coz it means everyone can be a 'sup' wif dis spell\nthe life-saving sup may disappear at bot lane\nalso heal and barrier did similar things \nso i dont think its so new\n\nfor the 'back-up'\nits a rly good idea but it shouldnt be a spell\nif it is a item maybe better or replacing {{item:3060}} \nrito should consider dis","replies":[]}]}
