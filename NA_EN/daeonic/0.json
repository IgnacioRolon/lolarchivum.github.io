You can't force them to come out since you have no CC and a range of 500.\n\nLater on, the enemy base damage alone, if they land even 2 spells, is enough to send you recalling or risking dying to 2nd rotation, while your autos don't actually threaten them.\n\nThen late game, your team now has 2 AD carries with 500-600 range, and thus 2 team members with either no or very weak CC and burst, AND only AD damage. Meanwhile, the enemy team has 1 AD carry and 1 long range mid with 700-1000 range, and at least the mid will have some sort of CC. The team comp with Lucian also forces an AP top or jungler, realistically which means {{champion:8}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:76}} ... all of which aren't the greatest CCers.\n\nThere's alot more effective non-meta picks than Lucian mid.
