The real problem is that this occurs inconsistently and is causing me to be placed in lower priority queues with extended wait times. I have reported this problem before and dutifully done every troubleshooting method the riot-employed responder gave. This included removing 3rd party programs such as 'curse', closed all other computer activity prior to playing, reinstalling the league client, etc. Additionally, the real caveat is that this only occurs on one of my accounts! (I have two so I can play with friends who I can't queue with in ranked) My main account doesn't bugsplat and I usually play a game on my main account before switching to my second one. This tells me that my computer is fine and the network and everything is fine, but I still get bugsplats on this account. It's incredibly frustrating to lose lp and be placed in lower priority queues for something seemingly out of my control. I was wondering if this was a common problem or if there is a way to reset my account to avoid the leaverban/lp loss. Account with problem: ShampooNSlay. Main: IamSamurai.

Typically a Bugsplat happens as a result of a poor system driver interaction or a hardware issue with your PC. For this reason, I think it's probably a coincidence that this has only happened on one of your accounts. Check out our [Bugsplat Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) for a list of steps that should resolve this.\n\nLet me know if that guide was able to assist in resolving this.","replies":[]}]}
