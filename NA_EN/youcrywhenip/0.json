Next morning, I check and it says I'm at 84 LP, even though I still had 4 games of promos left.

You also get a popup notification when you finish the series, and it'll also say so in the post-game lobby where the checkmarks would be.\n\nI'm not going to log in right this second to look at your profile and check, but I'm positive you are still in your series.\n\nThe reason why you are at 84 LP is because you actually do win and lose LP while playing your promo matches (you lost 16 LP). You often don't notice this actually happens because when you win, the total never displays above 100 *even though it really did go up*. Then if you lose a match you'll still show 100!\n\nGet it?","replies":[{"poster":"YouCryWhenIP","date":"2016-07-29T21:56:04.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, thanks for the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T22:54:12.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DTN provided some solid information here.  Indeed, your LP will still continue to adjust with each win or loss even in a series.  If you win your series then your LP will reset to 0.  Let us know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
