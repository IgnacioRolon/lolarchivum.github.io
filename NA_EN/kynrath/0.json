Roughly 20 minutes ago this happened and I attempted to resize my screen, resulting in a total blackout and being unable to lock in champ selection, resulting in a \"loss\" for me (it was ranked). And word on this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-09T17:35:51.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically a black screen during champ select is caused by a connection issue. This is because when your client isn't able to establish a proper connection to the champion select instance, it will just appear black. I recommend you work through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to resolve this.\n\nLet me know if those steps work for you.","replies":[]}]}
