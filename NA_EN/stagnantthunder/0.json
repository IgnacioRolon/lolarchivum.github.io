My download speed usually hits around 2mbps, and the patches finish rather fast all the time for years now, but when 7.19 landed one computer updated like normal, and my other one is... Well, it's been sitting there since the patch went live, attempting to move at all. It started at my regular speed, then halved immediately, then his 900 kbps, then 700, 400, 150, 120, 70, 40, and kept going down until it hit 0 after five minutes. It's still going along at 0kbps. I did try restarting, it's always ran as admin, always connected by ethernet, checked the firewall everything's the same between the two... What gives? Is anyone else experiencing this? If so, anyone found a solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T21:15:25.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is pretty odd that one of your pc's updated as normal but this other one just refuses. Kinda makes me think that it might be a local problem, possibly related to that pc's network settings? Let's update it's port forwarding and DNS settings, as well as some other basic steps with this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nLet me know if that doesn't seem to help and we can dig a little further.","replies":[{"poster":"StagnantThunder","date":"2017-10-03T06:53:39.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried it over a wifi connection, patched rather fast, plugged the ethernet back in and everything on my webpage hit a standstill... I think it's something wrong with the cord, the other one did work when I switched them just now. Sorry for bugging you guys, guess I just need a new cord.","replies":[]}]}]}
