Stories would tell of this creature slowly trudging along in what little shade existed in the desert sands, searching for occurrences of robbery and hijack. Possessing a powerful sense of justice, it silently seeks out and watches over trader caravans and lost adventurers, protecting them from rogue bandits and thieves in the dead of night, and, once the safety of the travelers have been ensured, disappearing once again into the desert, leaving no trace but the bruised, battered bodies of masked criminals, covered in hundreds of razor-sharp needles and half-buried within the blazing sands.\n\n##&quot;Adios, amigos.&quot;\n\nA nameless tribe of nomadic Shuriman sorcerers wanders through the desert.\nAntonio, a young conjurer and a prodigy among his peers, was always kept sheltered from the outside world by his tribe's elders, who feared for his innocence as he grew older, as creations of conjurers of the tribe reflected the host's personality. Antonio, who knew little of the harsh realities of life and the world around him, often dreamt up fantastical stories of monsters and heroes, who in his mind, would always come to \"save the day\" whenever the lives of innocent people were threatened.\nLonely, because of his superiors' constant surveillance, he imagined a friend for himself from his fantastical stories and what little he saw of the outside world, which took the form of a justice-loving cactus, as Cacti were one of the few things Antonio had known about in the outside world. Often, in his imaginations, the protagonist would be his friend, and Antonio, his sidekick. Together, they fought fearsome monsters and terrifying villains, all in Antonio's imagination, of course.\n\nOne night, Antonio awoke to the sound of screams and clashing weapons. He peeked open his eyes, and was horrified at the image and sound of his tribe being slaughtered by bandits. Wishing it were all just a bad dream, he closed his eyes and waited until sunrise.\nAs the day turned bright, he looked around and learned of the harsh realities of life, Antonio sobbed as he looked around the camp. Corpses of his family members and friends lay about, covered in dark-red dried blood from the night before. He attempted to re-enter the world of his imaginations, but they all took the dark form of the disturbing imagery he witnessed. Wishing for his imaginary friend to become real and save the day, he took what he had of his conjuration power, and vowed to make his imaginary friend real, and together, like his dreams, would travel the world and fight those who would dare threaten innocent lives.\nHe took a deep breath, and took aim at a nearby cactus.\n\n...\n\nHoodoo stood deep in thought. It had been a millennium, but he never forgot the day his creator created him, and shared with him his dreams: A hero of justice who would never back down from the face of evil. \nOn his final days, Antonio gave his prided creation a mission: to wander the desert, and protect all the innocent lives that wandered through it, just like Antonio's wonderful stories in the past. \n⁣\n---\n⁣\n>##Gameplay Information\n\n\n##Primary Role: _Juggernaut_\n\n* **Damage Type:** Physical\n* **Primary Resource:** Mana\n* **Attack Range:** Melee  _(175 Units)_\n* **Gameplay Fantasy:** Sticky Juggernaut\n\n**Style:**   \n[⚔️] **-----------------○---** [🔮]\n\n|---- Power Scale -----|\n|-\n|Damage| ◼◼◻ |\n|Toughness| ◼◼◼ |\n|Control| ◼◼◻ |\n|Mobility| ◻◻◻ |\n|Utility| ◼◻◻ |\n|Difficulty| ◼◼◻ |\n⁣\n---\n⁣\n>#Abilities\n\n\n⁣\n##Passive - Spiny Embrace\nhttp://orig10.deviantart.net/460c/f/2017/198/f/4/f493ba4b56c0ac57c7fb212a60acb8aa-dbgom4m.png\n\n_Range:_ 275\n_Damage (Approximate):_ Slightly more than Sunfire Cape (Ambient) / Slightly lower than Garen E (After ability cast)\n\nDeals a bit of physical damage every half second to up to 3 enemies standing right next to Hoodoo (Prioritizes champions). Casting an ability triples this damage for three seconds, with additional ability casts refreshing this time.\n\nDamaging an enemy champion or large monster with this passive applies a stack of Puncture. At 10 puncture stacks, the target's armor is reduced.\n\nMinions take reduced damage from Spiny Embrace.\n⁣\n---\n\n##Q - Cactus Create\nhttp://orig12.deviantart.net/931e/f/2017/198/0/e/0e46899d6cb882d865ba4693064a5dca-dbgomh9.png\n\n_Range:_ 700/775/850/925/1000\n_Cooldown:_ 12/12/11/11/10 seconds\n_Cactus Health:_ 2/3/4/5/6\n\nSpawn a large Cactus at a target location for 6 seconds, knocking aside any enemies directly over it. Cacti act as impassable terrain, and gain the effects of _Spiny Embrace_ [Passive].\n\nThe Cactus can be targeted by enemy basic attacks, being destroyed after enough attacks. However, each attack on the Cactus deals heavy physical damage to the attacker, based off their maximum health, and slowing them by 20% per attack.\n⁣\n---\n\n##W - Sticking Spines\nhttp://orig06.deviantart.net/5cb7/f/2017/198/e/3/hoodoo_ability_w_by_serpexnessie-dbgommw.png\n\n_Range:_ 350\n_Cooldown:_ 24/23/22/21/20\n_Latch Duration:_ 3/3.75/4.5/5.25/6\n_Bonus Armor Duration:_ 4 Seconds\n\nHoodoo spawns longer, sharper and \"stickier\" spikes to cover his body, granting bonus armor for a few seconds.\nAfter a second, the ability may be re-cast again to dash to a nearby target enemy champion to latch onto them for a few seconds.  This is treated as a second spell cast for [Passive] _Spiny Embrace._\n\nThe latched target deals reduced damage to you.\nWhile latching on, you remain on the target and follow them through any dashes, blinks, teleports or miscellaneous mobility. \nYou are immune to displacement and immobilizing effects, but they instead reduce the time you are stuck on to the target. \nAfter remaining on an enemy for at least 2 seconds, you may re-cast the ability to jump off early.\n\nDuring this time, you may still cast abilities, but cannot use basic attacks. \n⁣\n---\n##E - Sharp Shooter\nhttp://orig04.deviantart.net/7d13/f/2017/198/2/d/hoodoo_ability_e_by_serpexnessie-dbgompt.png\n\n_Range:_ 275/425\n_Cooldown:_ 10/9/8/7/6\n\nAfter a 0.5 second channel, Hoodoo launches 4 large spikes in each direction, from both Hoodoo himself and all spawned Cacti [Q], with each spike dealing physical damage to the first enemy they strike. You can continue to move during the channel.\n\nEnemies take slightly reduced damage when taking damage from every additional spike after the first.\n\nThe spike fired closest to the direction of your cursor gains increased range and speed, and additionally slows the enemy by 30% - 55% depending on rank.\n⁣\n---\n##R - Hug of Death\nhttp://orig00.deviantart.net/53b1/f/2017/198/8/5/85b72c5934fd5677c51b2a0df77f6049-dbgomt7.png\n\n_Range:_ 425\n_Cooldown:_ 120/105/90\n\nSurround the nearby area with a circular ring of tall cacti after a brief delay.\nEnemies cannot move through the wall, and enemies dashing through the wall are damaged and slowed. All allies can freely walk in and out of the ring, except Hoodoo.\n\n\nAfter two seconds, the wall closes in on itself, dealing physical damage to all enemies struck while carrying them to the center of the circle.\n⁣\n---\n⁣\n##Core Items:\n\n{{item:3071}} - Combined with passive makes for easy armor shredding. Phage passive makes staying on enemies without [W] slightly easier.\n\n{{item:1401}} / {{item:3068}} - Combined with passive makes for even more passive damage to enemies standing closeby\n⁣\n---\n---\n\n>#Changelist:\n* Passive now prioritizes champions\n* Added Deviantart link for art. (I still made it, though)\n* Passive has a stacking portion. Added approximate damage values to passive. Q cactus health lowered at early ranks.\n* Lowered ult radius\n* Expanded lore and backstory by a lot.\n* Added art for all abilities\n* Q Cactus can now be destroyed by enemies, but at a cost.\n* Decreased W stick duration at early levels, clarified movement through ult wall. Brief cooldown added for W for jumping off of enemies.\n* Halved Q cooldown and added cinderhulk to \"core items\" to push this champion as more of a jungler\n\n---\n\n>#[My other work!

Its really getting some nice attention on the boards ^^ So I thought, let me give my thoughts :P\n\nFirst of all, I find the whole \"living cactus idea\" very funny and original (and its probably what most people like about him). My only concern with it is that it feels more like a skin (april fools or something) then an actual champion thematic. The lore, while nicely written, is too short to really establish him into the world of Runeterra. What is he (maybe Vestaya...)? Where does he come from (other then Shurima)? What is his goal (other then filling bandits with needles)? What are his motives? Why is he a cactus with a hat? He just does not (yet) feel like he fits into the overal lore and theme of League of legends...\n\nHis passive:\nVERY fitting for his theme!!! And really makes him a good tank of sorts. Maybe do something with melee champions aa'ing him? Other then that very little remarks :D\n\nHis Q:\nthis is pretty much a Trundle Ice pillar with some extra combo possibilities with his passive and other abilities. I'm not disliking it but I'd try and make it more unique in some way...\n\nHis W:\nAlmost say that the second cast would make for an awesome ultimate if you gave it some more power (somehow). The first cast is good as an ability on its own, just seems a bit lack-luster to put the two together in one ability.\n\nHis E:\nAwesome ability, not much to say about it :) Nice combo with his Q.\n\nHis R:\nAs I said, his current second cast on his W would fit here perfectly, including the name (I mean, hug of death...must I say more?). The current ability is fine too though.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nAll in all a cool champion concept ^^ Nice idea for a tank you do NOT want to stand next to XD I love the way he can stick to enemies and think you should focus on that thematic when (or if) you look over some of his abilities. A big, living, hat wearing cactus that wil hug you to death sounds like an amazing idea to me ^^\nI'd also put some more energy in the lore and try to establish him in the world or League of legends some more. That will really go a long way in the CCOS :)\n\nI must mention that I only give feedback out of my own experience with league and the CCOS...I've made a lot of concepts already, but I'm still learning aswel so take some of my feedback with a grain of salt. I'd hate to have my feedback change Hoodoo so much that he wanders from what you originally wanted him to be :) I wish all the luck to you in the CCOS and may the best concept win ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Serpexnessie","date":"2017-07-17T18:46:03.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! ;D\n\nI'm planning on expanding his backstory by a lot, so expect that coming later today.\n\nAlso, I added a new effect to his Q.","replies":[{"poster":"TheMoralSupport","date":"2017-07-17T22:44:08.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*I'm posting it again in case you don't get notifications from replies on other comments*\n_____\nI'm a huge lore-whore and as soon as I saw these questions I immediately started crafting a real backstory for him. Here's my somewhat acknowledgeable, yet amateur attempt: \n\n>What is he (maybe Vestaya...)? \n\nThe first idea that struck my mind was that he was some sort of golem created by an old tribe that used to roam the Shuriman deserts. It was a time, long before the Noxian invasion, a time where Demacia was but a dream. The tribe included powerful shamans who had settled down, surviving the ferocious living conditions thanks to their magic. They had long known about the threat that lurked under the dunes, the vicious Xer'Sai. A race born from the shadows from a distant world, plaguing the realm of men. The tribe had to do something, to prolong the inevitable. Although there was hope, they would all suffer the bitter end. Before the mighty queen of the Xer would tie the knot herself. \n\n>Where does he come from (other then Shurima)?\n\nThe Shaman, head of the tribe, knew she had to come up with a solution. Therefore she summoned HooDoo with only sparse resources at her disposal, cacti. The tribe had always found their land sacred, willing to slay nosey explorers and relentless merchants salvaging the lands. Yet, in order to protect their people, they had to use what they once held so dearly. The cacti (fkin dramatic lol). The golems were worshipped like gods, divine beings that stood between them and the beasts. The tribe embellished the creatures with garments enchanted to make them endure the spiteful drought as well as rejuvenating properties.\n\n> What is his goal (other then filling bandits with needles)?\n\nEach time the Bells of the sand-gliders rung in the distance, the HooDoo as they're called, would wake from their slumber and protect the tribe. Day and night, through storms and droughts. Nothing would stand in their way, nothing but Rek´Sai. It was an eire night, the sands laid flat as the southern winds peacefully made their way over the dunes. Until the tremors started, tremors like the village had never experienced before. The shaman glanced out in the shivering sands, from the dark a purpur light emerged from the distance. Then, an ear-splitting screech filled the once silent night, alarming the HooDoo. The tremors continued, they got more intense as the purple haze came closer. And then. From nowhere, the earth shattered. A beast bigger than ever before witnessed. The beast rammed through the village, crushing everything in it's path. The cacti guardians didn't stand a chance, crumbling one after another, disappearing in a green smog. The shaman knew this was the end, she channeled her power, searching for the very essence of this sacred desert. She embraced the last HooDoo with her own power, draining herself and giving up her life as a last resort. The fight went on all night between the HooDoo and the Xer'Sai queen, thorns against fangs, scales against brute force. \n...At the break of dawn, there were nothing but mere memories of a once powerful tribe, shattered by the unnatural forces that came to curse Shurima's future. The only thing standing was a lone cactus, in search his long lost creator.\n\n>What are his motives? \n\nTo aimlessly find it's creator and make up for what happened. \n\n>Why is he a cactus with a hat?\n\nNo fkin clue lol, maybe it was a tribute from the tribe, although why would they have a Sheriff's hat...\n\nSo here's my lackluster concept of his backstory, hope it can be somewhat useful lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpexnessie","date":"2017-07-17T23:07:21.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually finished with the lore expansion (You can read it now under \"Lore\"), and I think i did a way worse job than you.

Simply because most people would just walk out of range of the aura and would just ignore them instead of attacking it. Also the fact that you can only put out one seems kinda limiting, especially with the interaction of his E.\n\nMaybe lower the cooldown or up the duration and remove the impassable effect. I say this because I feel like spawning multiple cacti to make his E a bigger threat would be a cool idea. Removing the impassable effect would avoid abuse cases of boxing people in. It would need a cc effect instead then to compensate for the limitations as a single ability. Maybe have it sprout from the ground after a slight delay and if a target is hit they are knocked up or snared and take his passive damage on hit? Seems thematically appropriate. Also if he could spawn multiple, it would give people more incentive to destroy them despite the effects of doing so.\n\nI have a question regarding his ult, is it centered on Hoodoo? As in the circle moves with him until it activates, because the would open up interesting combinations with how you have his w working.\n\nAlso minor nitpick, I feel his Q and E should be swapped as spells. Reason being because it would follow most champ designs by Riot where the Q is the bread-and-butter/important skill. Not saying the current Q isn't important, just that E is probably going to be the first skill leveled, used the most, and gives him consistent ranged poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpexnessie","date":"2017-07-18T18:45:48.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult would be initially centered on Hoodoo, but it doesn't move.
