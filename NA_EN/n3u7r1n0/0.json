You, and *only* you, are responsible for what you type. If someone flames you, you can just mute them, report them after the game,  and move on with your life. If they troll, well, it sucks, but it's something that unfortunately happens and all you can do is report them and hope they get penalised.

Verified reports do slow down honour progress, but having had a penalty doesn't.\n\n> These are type that unfortuntly exist and can't be truthfully as punished vs someone that got tilted from these people.

And why wouldn't it be fair that people who flame and rage in chat get punished as well? They drag the game down just as much. It doesn't take much effort not to type something in chat, it takes more effort to type something in chat.
