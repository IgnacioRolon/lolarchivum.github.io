You just said you understood your toxicity and the rules, and now you suddenly don't understand it?\n\n> Ezreal that was on my team was flaming me just as hard. I just dont understand the Perma Ban for this particular reason. Help me understand.\n\nThe system doesn't punish based on severity alone. It punishes based on consistency x severity, meaning you can be punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many many games of mild toxicity. \n\nIf I were to use an analogy; Think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter.\n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nIf Ezreal had the same behavioral history as yourself, then sure, he should be punished as well. But we don't know that information.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-16T23:14:11.327+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You cant appeal permbans or get unbanned, you had multiple warnings you would be banned for any further broken rules.

You chose to flame after being told you cant do that again, it is that simple.","replies":[{"poster":"CallmeZachy","date":"2019-10-16T23:16:28.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"When was i told to not flame again?

Signed it and went to Alt account to keep playing. I didn't read anything. I know thats upon me to read it but whats the point i see a 14 day ban and dont want to read anymore further because what's the point? I didn't need an explanation on why the ban went through. it doesn't make sense that when i flame someone its the end of the world for league to go out the their way and perma ban me for flaming one more game. Btw, the flaming will continue to happen. It's a natural instinct for us HUMAN beings to react upon our nature. Didn't know how someone playing a different champ isn't a troll in a ranked game. Anything doesn't work in that elo hell because of that reason, the troll picks. We dont want to see that bologna.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-17T02:25:02.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in short, you refuse to take responsibility for your actions. The bans will continue until you do, and they will come faster.\n\nFlaming is not a natural reaction unless the person in question is dysfunctional and unable to control themselves or their emotions. Only a tiny percentage of players are ever banned for it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Teemos Tittiees","date":"2019-10-17T07:57:18.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Auto ban system is a joke.
