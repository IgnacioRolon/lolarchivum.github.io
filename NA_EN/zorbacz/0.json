This patch is a bit of a grab bag, with good stuff all around. We've got a broader assortment of changes than we can cover in an intro, but we'll do our best to hit the highlights. Ryze's update leads us off.","url":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-614-notes","image":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/patchnotes_2016header_0_0.jpg?itok=nXg5JLwI"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The latest patch says \"Support grades specifically weigh assists equal to kills, leaving one fewer excuse for bloodthirsty Flash-Ignites\". Now I main Leona, does support apply to Leona or no because the game calls her a tank, but her secondary is support, yet I always play her as support.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-14T18:22:27.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Role selects your placement on the map which could be something the grading system looks at when you appear in that lane.  It's also not just specific to a role, but t a lot of other factors too.  The grading system might look into other things like map position, spells, and a variety of different things that we don't have details on.   Unfortunately, the specifics are not something we have a lot of visibility on beyond the guide previously linked, but I hope that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2016-07-14T18:04:37.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes me wonder, how does it grade in blind pick when roles aren't defined beforehand.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-14T18:17:33.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system doesn't depend on the role selection in SR Draft Pick to determine your role as you can swap roles / lanes.\n\nThe system determines your role by your lane (in-game) for the first few minutes, on Twisted Treeline and Summoner's Rift.

For example, if I selected to play Kayle as an ADC Role then the grading system would score me against other ADC Kayles.  Your score with Leona would be graded in a similar why if you selected Support as your role.
