I was playing as blitzcrank bot with my friend playing Sivir adc. During the champ select we were flaming each other saying things like \"Icalled adc SvRi why you auatolock\" which is really bad spelling for, \" I called adc Sivir, why did you autolock\" Which would probably be seen as enjoyable banter. When we entered the game and starte playing we started well with a 4/0 lead bot lane at ~minute 4-5. So in the natural course of events, we flamed each other saying how much the other was inting, \"this blitz can't land hooks\" \"This sivir can't cs\" etc. etc.\r\nThis goes on for a while when an Udyr and Zed on opposing teams from each other start flaming for real, and we tell them to stop bc league is a game, and it was draft. This resulted in the friendly team Udyr saying that we were flaming just as much and that he's gonna report us. So it made me think of if this was grounds for a report or not. I wouldn't be surprised because I was being sarcastic, and sarcasm is hard to translate into text form so it might be taken literally. I don't believe I'll be suspended though because I have a clean record.{{champion:53}}   {{item:3681}}  {{champion:15}}","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2020-02-29T05:57:39.630+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to directly insult your friends like that, you have to avoid the public channels. Everything in /all or /team is subject to the same rules. You can use voice chat while premade, or you can \"/whisper #name\" or \"/w #name\" to send a private message. Then \"/r\" will reply to the last person that whispered to you.\n\nAlternately, you can ask the people on your team to not report you for insulting your friend, because you are friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leon4167","date":"2020-03-01T05:21:40.151+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to say no but the problem is that if you're looking at that kind of chat from a third-party perspective you can't tell whether or not you're being sarcastic. I can honestly say that just by reading what you guys said I'd be very annoyed and tilted and would be reporting too because I don't have the same context of what you're saying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-29T14:51:07.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"people have been punished for sarcasm before.

I use sarcasm too but less insulting sarcasm. More like locking anivia bot and someone calls me a troll ill say ya totally dude.","replies":[]}]}
