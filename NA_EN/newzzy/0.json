I&#039;m not sure if someone else has had this idea or not but the idea is similar to PBE and the rotating game mode system.\r\n\r\nEvery week or weekend, a legacy client would release an old patch for league of legends. This patch would rotate between multiple patches from every patch previous to the prior season before the current season, preferably the big patches (mid season update, last patch of the season, first patch of the season, etc.). The idea would be to both; give players that have been a while the nostalgic feeling of the game they grew to love, give new players an idea of what League of Legends used to be.\r\n\r\nI came up with the thought of this around the same time that Nostalrius blew up and I thought to myself, &quot; This would be cool if Riot did something similar!&quot;. Of course I have no knowledge of how to implement this or if it would even be possible, but I imagine those old patches are lying around somewhere and it would just be a matter of how to create this client. I know there would be obvious issues with this like, server costs, old bugs, is it even worth it to invest into something like this, etc., but I still think that this would be pretty cool to see happen.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think and maybe even some Riot employees could shed some light on this.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-01T04:27:42.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be almost impossible to implement (massive amount of work) and completely pointless to something like 99.9% of the community, nobody wants to have a 1-2GB download every week just to play outdated game modes.","replies":[]}]}
