IP champions, release in advance what the 4800 and under champ reduction is. I got Mordrkaiser a while ago. But had I known that he'd be reduced, I'd of waited. Now I'm not asking for a refund. But if I got one. I'd be happy. Just hope you can release all the reductions not just the 6300 ones. \n\nIf you are confused. Click on the link. Then you will see that although it shows some champs like Elise or Zed. It only says  and 4800 or lower on every 3rd champion release. The second portion what I'd like changed. So you could see in advance what's happening. Like mordekaiser dropping to 1350. Or Galio to 3150 etc. Etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T22:50:10.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty likely that those 4800 champs that will be reduced haven't actually been decided upon yet.
