This will raise team morale and help you to see less \"bad teammates\".\n\nKeep vision on objectives, don't be afraid to spend that 75g on a ward, it could turn the game around even if you just use it for temporary vision over a wall.","replies":[{"poster":"SingGames","date":"2017-05-10T13:22:15.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll have to keep in mind the spoon feeding of bad teammates, I never even thought about doing that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pisykan","date":"2017-05-10T07:49:36.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"38m 38s\n\nfull built vayne AND Gangplank, two late game champions, against your comp thats rough if they had a braincell which looking at all we can look at damage output and KDA they did, and you cant discount the Yi thats just going to run at you.\n\nif your Vs a vayne/GP or like that game BOTH of them if you go to 40mins chances are if they have a braincell or even if they dont but can just position safely your going to get chunked so fast its unreal, that game obviously we cant see this or if you tried it but you NEED to flank those carries and make the fight a 4v5 before you start as in a TF its a straight up loss. \n\nwhen you have one or both of those champions give yourself a 25min timer, if you cant secure a finish or a finishing position by then, prepare for a rough ride.","replies":[{"poster":"SingGames","date":"2017-05-10T13:20:37.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea.

There's a number of different factors that can lead into the win or loss of a game. Unfortunately, there's nothing that can be said from a random forum poster's standpoint that wasn't actually in the game you're bringing up.\n\nThe most important thing to keep in mind though is that we deal with a vast amount of players when participating in a game like this. Despite what would eventually feel like a trend, it's for that reason that we run into a good deal of poor skill handling from fellow players in terms of gameplay or communication, as well as those who seem to just know what to do and when to do it. Unless someone pulls virtual moba genocide and purges the entire community, that's not going to change. All we can do is the best we can, and simply move on if it doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"SingGames","date":"2017-05-10T13:17:35.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking in hindsight, the question does seem a little rhetorical, please keep in mind i wrote this at nearly 3 am ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}
