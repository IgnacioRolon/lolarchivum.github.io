When client pops the game freezes and sometimes closes out. This issue also sometimes occurs in game, my game just freezes but I can still hear the game.\r\n\r\nI do play on the PBE and live and the issue happens in both clients.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering if any one else is experiencing the same issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T00:35:04.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can think of two different reasons this might be happening. It could possibly be an issue with your connection going into a kind of dormant state when the Q pops for some strange reason, in which case adjusting your port forwarding and flushing your DNS with the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) should be able to help.\n\nIf not, it could also be some kind of weird graphical issue causing the client to freak out. In this case, run a quick repair through the client options and double check your drivers and settings using our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) instead.","replies":[]}]}
