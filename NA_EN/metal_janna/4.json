I know that apparently back during Tribunal times, whenever a perma-ban was about to be issues, a Rioter was going to look over it. Dunno how it is today. I've reached the point where I rather submit Tickets than trust the instant feedback system. It's cool and all that you wanna keep it discrete and not even tell me if the system has taken any effect, but it's bound to fail. What can that thing do to check if someone has decided to just walk in circles or purposely leave their lane for good than just checking for some chat message saying \"I'm AFK\". What if it is just a joke? The IFS is BOUND to be unreliable. So yeah, write tickets, don't issue reports. According to Riots Support EVERY report is evaluated by the system, it doesn't matter how many they are. \n\nIt's the same reason why it always only gives u a chat log if any punishment is issued against you. Unless someone recorded a video and submitted a ticket there is simply NO evidence against you. This is not me encouraging to troll without using words, what I'm saying is, record every game, or save the replays and attach them to your tickets. \n\nAlso stop the discrete bs about whether you took actions pls @Riot. Not because I wanna bath in self-praise over me reporting someone but because I wanna know if you actually do something about toxicity like you claim to.\n\nI've reported 2 AFKs that have been AFK for over 15 minutes, deliberately, so as in, it seemed like they didnt do it the first time (Leaverbuster did not detect them, which is something you'd normally see in the endgame screen) and after checking their Match History they were able to continue playing just fine, DESPITE me directly reporting them to the support.\n\nThe \"I agree\" text when leaverbuster detects you left a game should be for those who fucked up and had their wifi disconnected or couldn't connect back into the game, these players announced that they would go AFK and **NOTHING** happened to them.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meteora707","date":"2019-04-27T11:33:07.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">And HOW are people getting all the way to Gold with an attitude that they can just quit whenever they personally aren't winning their lane?
