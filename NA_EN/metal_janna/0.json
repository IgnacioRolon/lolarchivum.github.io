You guess is as good as mine as to why.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Metal Janna","date":"2019-05-14T09:24:15.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaspers,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=KuqmQLeW,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-05-14T08:27:47.820+0000)\n>\n> Did you see how much damage that 1 auto did to Orianna?

It wouldn't be the first time i've seen a Yasuo ult immediately after a knockup (on him) lands.\nIt might be intentional. I can't find anything in the patch notes suggesting it is, but there are champions who are allowed to ult while CC'd.\n\nAs for the damage, yeah IE is nuts. It also helps that that's my Support Orianna, so even squishier than a normal one.\nI was just salty that I wasn't able to yoink him out of his ult because he didn't appear where I expected. It looked like the turret dive crutch but now that you mention it he's inside the turret range so that doesn't make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-05-14T09:38:04.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"KFC's explanation is decent enough.
