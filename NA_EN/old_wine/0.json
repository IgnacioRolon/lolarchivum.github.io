Right after champ select, my league will bugsplat and when I close and reopen it, it says I have corrupted files. It allows me to patch these files up to 14%, when it then starts calculating differences for a bit. After that, it loads right on up to 100% and I can get into the game but usually the team has remade by then. I have tried deleting all the files and then re-downloading the game along with uninstalling it. I also do not have Lolreplay, which many have said was their problem. I can usually play about one game, but if I try to play another it will crash again. So far I've been put into a low priority queue for 5 game for 5 minutes and now I'm in a low priority queue for 5 games for 10 minutes because of this. If anyone has a solution I would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T23:20:28.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a number of things that could be causing this, especially with some recent Windows 10 updates that have been problematic for some players.
