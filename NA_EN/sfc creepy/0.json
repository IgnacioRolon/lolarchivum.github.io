I used two accounts because friends played on West and East servers, which forced me to have both accounts to play with all of them when needed. Now having two accounts I keep switching them if I want to play specific champion or role. Would there ever be a chance to merge two old accounts? One of them is back from when there was one EU server and second after they got seperated. There might be people needing that function also.\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-12T23:59:36.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I'm not on the team that works on these features, I can't tell you whether or not this could be a thing.
