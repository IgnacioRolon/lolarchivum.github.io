Even the fabled \"Continue\" button is nowhere to be seen, when it fails, my options are \"retry\" or x out.\n\nI tried running as admin, I tried turning my computer off and on again. Nothing seems to work.\n\nAlso, side note. While reading comments, a Rioter seems to imply there are percentages other than 33% while updating, this has never been the case for me. The moment the patcher starts up, it goes straight to 33%, on days where the patcher works, it will eventually jump from 33% to 99% to 100%. There is no 0%, nothing between 0 and 33%, nothing between 33 and 99%. This has never changed in my history of League of Legends. Is this normal?\n\nHelp please.\n\nUpdate: I x'ed out of the error message and the files being scanned are not being reset, it freezes at 116 files scanned but it slows my entire computer to a halt, even slowing down my inputs in a text document. Had to stop attempting to patch.\n\nPlease contact if there's a fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T16:14:46.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While the symptoms you have might be related to last night's issue, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the same problem.  When you close out the patcher while it's processing, it needs to scan all of your game files for corruption.  This has to be done before it can even consider applying a patch update.  It's absolutely important that you let it finish scanning your files, as it will be the only means of getting to the next phase.  Do not close the patcher.  \n\nIf you are getting an unspecified error at 33% or higher, then your network might actually have a problem connecting to the patching server.  Should it happen again, your best bet would be to follow the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this fixed up.
