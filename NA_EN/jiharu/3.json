We've seen some performance issues with the Beta Client on lower-end hardware. Have you tried using the Low-spec mode and disabling animations? You can access these settings in the Beta Client from the cog in the top right. I've included a screenshot below:\n\n(Click to enlarge)\nhttp://image.prntscr.com/image/598e949fe2904c85b3220875cf13760f.png\n\nIf you still have issues with the Beta Client after making those changes, we can work on getting you back on the Legacy Client, just let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Jiharu","date":"2016-12-14T22:51:31.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I deleted the folder and got legacy to work by reinstalling the game. Low spec helped, but the new client would slow to a crawl randomly. Most of the time it would be fine then the accept button would appear and vanish before I could click it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-16T02:49:44.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you got the Legacy Client up and running again. Yeah, since you're still having issues performance-wise with the Beta, you may need to hold off on using it until we've added more optimizations to it. You'll still be able to access everything gameplay-wise from the Legacy Client, you just won't be able to access replays and highlights, since they're part of the Beta Client's platform.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
