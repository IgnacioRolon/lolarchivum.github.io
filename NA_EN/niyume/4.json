{"poster":"Niyume","date":"2017-12-15T06:16:51.449+0000","title":"The guide on never losing to Zoe","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":39,"down_votes":37,"body":"I'm really sick of all the whining and complaining about a champ that's more fair than 80% of the roster, and I don't want another champ I actually enjoy to be nerfed into nonviability, so I'm going to write a very detailed guide for all you whiners -- I doubt you'll read it, but maybe someone will, and they'll beat Zoe, and they'll tell other people.\n\nSo, first off, let's rehash a bit on Zoe's kit.\n\n---\n\n#Passive:#\n\nAny time Zoe uses an ability, her next auto does a little extra magic damage.\n\n* When she has her passive ready, her ***left hand*** will have a little ring of gold sparkles around it.\n\n* Her passive auto is instant, and goes through things like Yas's W. (Laserssss)\n\n#Q:#\n\nZoe shoots a star in a direction, and for the next couple seconds, she can redirect it to a new location, dealing damage in a small area upon hitting a unit.\n\n* This ability only moves in ***straight lines***\n\n* While there is no limit to how far the star can go, she can only direct it to a location within the original ability's cast range (about)\n   * It's about the size of Ori's Q.\n\n#W:#\n\nAny time an enemy champ uses a summoner ability or active item, they leave behind a bubble for ~40 seconds that Zoe can pick up, allowing one use of the summoner spell / active dropped.\n\n* She can only hold one at a time, and can only hold a spell for about a minute.\n\n* Sometimes minions will have balloons in their hands, meaning they'll drop a random summoner spell or item active for Zoe (these bubbles only last 20 seconds)\n  * Try to zone her off these minions, because ***she*** has to last hit them, or the bubble just disappears.\n\n#E:#\n\nZoe kicks a bubble a set distance in a direction (extending over walls), that gradually slows any enemy unit and eventually puts them to sleep for 2.2 seconds\n\n* If you get hit while sleeping, you take double damage from the next ability / attack to hit you\n   * This damage has a cap, so Veigar isn't just going to hit you for 3,000 damage. The cap late game is ~500 extra damage.\n \n* If nothing is hit, the bubble pops on the ground and leaves a little puddle that does the same thing to whatever walks into it.\n   * If you walk into it... stop reading this guide, because nothing I say will help you.\n\n* This ability has a serious windup, so just watch for that, and it makes it easy to dodge.\n   * Additionally, as Zoe is winding up to kick, she ***always faces the direction the bubble will go***, so dodge accordingly. (She holds the bubble up in the direction it's goinna go)\n\n* During the windup, ***Zoe cannot move***, so she's easy to pick off if she's trying to use E as she runs away.\n\n#R:#\n\nZoe teleports to a location for a moment, and then teleports back to where she originally cast from.\n\n* During this time she can be CCd, but she will always go back to her original cast location, even if you pull her with a Blitz Q or something.\n\n* While in her ult, Zoe can still attack and cast spells like normal.\n\n---\n\nSo, hopefully you know how her kit works now. But I'm goinna go a bit further than that, and talk about some of the things I hear people complain about a lot -- namely, her Q and her E.\n\n---\n\n#Dodging Zoe's Q#\n\nSo, in order to understand how to dodge Zoe's Q, you have to think about it kind of like Vel'Koz's Q. Don't look at the actual projectile, but look at where it can go. With Vel's Q you have to imagine that right angle splitting off of the first bolt, yeah? So, with Zoe's Q, you have to imagine a straight line connecting it to you, and if there's nothing blocking it in that line, it can potentially hit you. Here's an example of a Yasuo who won't get hit, since he's using his minions like a smart person, and knows that the line is broken.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pmeZa5z.jpg\n\nNow, anywhere in the red side, Yasuo could be hit. But, since minions have those lovely hitboxes (outlined by black), Zoe's Q cannot get to the other side, and that whooooole side is safe, as shown by the green.\n\nSo, if Zoe throws her Q at you, just imagine that blue line connecting you both, and move so that the minions get in the way of the star, and wow, you don't get hit. But **do remember that it blows up in an area about as big as Syndra's Q, so don't stand directly on top of your minions**. :P\n\n#Dodging Zoe's E#\n\nThe big one. The one that all the whiners whine about. The one that's already been nerfed since they whine so much... Zoe's E.\n\nSo, I already told you that it has a massive windup, right? And I told you that she ***ALWAYS*** faces the direction it's goinna go, right? So, she shouldn't land a close range one on you, or you're just bad at this point.\n\nBut what about a long range one? Well, there's a solution to that too: It's called proactive playstyles. \n\nSo, here's the area Zoe can hit with her E through a wall mid lane (if shot from around the red X).\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Tb0f6BO.jpg\n\nThe green areas are safe, since she either can't reach you or you'd be able to see her at that point. Big area though, huh? So, that's where this whole proactive thing comes into play. Instead of just waiting for her to shoot an E at you, and then you mess up dodging it (then go and cry about how OP she is), you think about where she would shoot it from. Did you see her go topside? Did you see her in bot lane? Think about where she could shoot from, and react ahead of time, making it that much harder for her to hit you.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ps9151C.jpg\n\nSo, in this picture, imagine Zoe went off toplane, and you don't know where she is. Would it make sense to stand near the wall so she can shoot you through it? No. So, stand on the green side, where the minions will block her E for you (with their hitboxes shown in black again).\n\nNow, what did we learn about Zoe's E? Well, it's very telegraphed for one, and it's predictable. So think ahead instead of rushing blindly like an idiot, and you won't get hit by it, wow! Plus it moves pretty slow, so it's easy to dodge anyway.\n\n---\n\n#Beating Zoe#\n\nSo, now you know how to not die to Zoe (or even get hit at all), but how about beating her? Well, you gotta remember she's entirely immobile, she's goinna be playing close to the minion wave so she can reach you with Q, and she's squishy with no sustain.\n\nSoo... someone with heavy poke through minions, or someone who can just all-in and ignore/avoid her E.\n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:143}} \n\nThese guys all work. My personal picks into her are Liss and Lux, since you just poke her out of existence and dominate the lane. And if you land your combo, she's just dead. If you wanna be a real asshole, play Fiora. If she ever hits you with an E, Q up to her before you fall asleep, and parry in her face -- the stun will trigger your parry and stun Zoe, and then she's a free kill for you. ^^\n\n#If you're still not convinced, give me a situation you struggle with, I'll explain even more.#\n\n---\n\nHopefully I can play Zoe in draft every now and then once people realize she's not god tier broken. But, with people being fucking sheep how they are, I really doubt that. She's going to be gutted into obscurity, just like so many other champs.\n\n#If you don't believe me, then I dare you, add me and we'll have a 1v1. If I die EVEN ONCE, then you win. If I get your tower, I win. If you come in here and say Zoe is broken, I'll be adding you, and you're goinna prove how broken she is.\n\nEdit: ... Good God did this thread and my Reddit post blow up.

When a champion is designed like this, they cannot be nerfed too hard because it will end up gutting them.  But when they are balanced heavily around RNG and low cooldowns, they are extremely unfair and frustrating to play against.  \n\nZoe was designed into a corner.  She can't have too much done to her kit because it will gut her.  She can't be buffed because she's already insanely strong when she lands her combo.

I think she's pretty fair, but there's not a lot of time to actually all in her in lane if you're not someone with high range because of how little time you have between her casts to avoid her poke. I don't think she needs to be nerfed but I do think she needs her E changed to have a longer cooldown with a higher CDR from hitting champions. I made a post about it before but I'll put it here. I usually get about 30% CDR on Zoe, so by max level I have almost a 7 second CD on E if I hit another champion with a 10 second CD if I don't(Not a big difference is it?). I think they need to increase the base cooldown to be like 22/21.5/21/20.5/20 second base CD with a 60% at all ranks CD refund if she hits a champion. This would give more time to react vs a Zoe who missed her E and allow her to fire bubbles everywhere if she didn't. It's more of a buff to good Zoe's and a nerf to bad ones. She's pretty bad in teamfights so this might make it a bit better if she hits those Es. They could undo ALL of the other changes if they just did that one buff/nerf imo because then you could actually feel good when she missed an E rather than \"Oh she missed her E, but her Q-passive poke hurts so much that I won't be able to deal enough damage by the time her E is up again to make it an even trade unless I'm someone with really good range\". It kind of makes it a noninteractive lane. I feel like this change would make her more fun and possible to play while also making her less annoying to play against(unless she's just good enough to hit all her Es and have bubbles fly everywhere). \n\nBtw with 30% CDR in mind, that comes down to a 5.6 second CDR if she hits a bubble and a 14 second CDR if she doesn't. Huge difference compared to now, which the reset mechanic is hardly noticable. With 40% CDR it could even be nuts(super fun) if you hit Es consistently(4.8 second CDR for hitting an E).\n\nAnother thing to note, I once went against a Darius top as Zoe, and I just constantly R>auto'd and backed off to poke him down to kill him.

She gets active item bubbles far earlier in the game than they were intended, such as Gunblade and Redemption.  And she can also pick up a Teleport pre-6, so she can just all-in, lose the trade, and still base because she can suddenly port back to lane.  \n\nZoe's kit isn't overpowered, but it is very unfair.  Yes, dodge her skillshots and disrupt her combo and you'll be fine.  But the problems are 1) her cooldowns are so low that it doesn't really matter if you stop one combo and 2) her base damage is so high that when she finally does land an E, she'll either kill you or send you back to base, guaranteed.  \n\nZoe isn't fair to play against.  Her numbers aren't the problem, as most people have routinely admitted.  It's her kit, her cooldowns, and her RNG.\n\nPeople aren't whining about Zoe.  People have legitimate complaints about how toxic it is to play against a champion that breaks so many of League's built-in rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sujiren","date":"2017-12-15T07:37:30.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Or ban her, 100% counter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dead Anime Dad","date":"2017-12-15T21:31:51.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anytime I lose to her it is usually because I start having ptsd flashbacks to original nidalee.

This is the same in high ELO, just like it is in bronze. In high ELO, mechanics will be a little tighter, macro play will be much better, and team coordination will be better. That doesn't mean that every challenger is a microplay god, though (even in LC$), and it doesn't mean every bronzelord is necessarily terrible at playing the game.\n\nSo Zoe comes out. She has a lot of damage potential, and isn't autos like the last several damage-oriented champs were. People aren't used to dodging her skillshots, and they don't know where to look for her E. So people stomp the enemy team because of that, and people call her broken.\n\nDoesn't mean she's broken at all. Just means people haven't gotten to practice against her thanks to her 70% ban rate. Do people still call Camille broken? People said that as long as she has her ult, she'll be broken.","replies":[]}]}]}
