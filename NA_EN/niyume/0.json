Kindred, Zoe, DT Trist, and so on. Been a dream of mine since I was little to be a composer, and I wanna get started on it. My brother bought the fancy version of FL Studio, and it can be installed on multiple computers, so I have it now and I&#039;m goinna learn it -- but can it do orchestra?","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2018-01-09T18:27:47.670+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Niyumi!\n\nI second Just ChiII in his assessment that it doesn't matter what DAW you use (within reason, of course - certain DAWs that have very specific specialties would be too limited for \"general audio and midi production\"). \n\nOutside of the DAW, there is a bunch of software and hardware that play a part in the making of music. That greater ecosystem may include samples (the actual sounds you use, often \"multisampled\", mapped across the keyboard, so you can play them using the DAW or midi keyboard), a midi controller (keyboard to input music into the sequencer), sound interface, plugins, etc. \n\nI don't know for sure whether FL Studio can do orchestra, but I can imagine that it does. See what sounds/samples come bundled with it. In time, you may find yourself wanting to expand your palette of sounds to include better or more varied samples. \n\nIf you want to produce orchestral music with a computer, you will need to harm yourself with patience, it's almost like learning how to play an instrument.  Ultimately, what matters most is what YOU have to contribute as a composer - the stories you want to tell, the colors you like, etc. Make sure to cultibate that first and foremost (and study/listen the masters!).\n\nGood luck in your endeavors!\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"Destructor242","date":"2018-01-09T18:50:31.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ed, \nI have a quick question for you.

Do you have any tips or ideas on how this is possible or what I should do?\n\nHey there!\n\nI do have a few random tips, not in any particular order:\n\n- if you are going to be writing music for games, make sure you're a gamer (duh!). Gamers can sniff out non gamers very easily. Because music is such a time-intensive endeavor, don't spend ALL of your time playing games, but know what you have to know;\n- mingle with game developers;\n- embrace the idea that writing music for video games is, in fact, being a game developer who specializes in music;\n- learn how to write and produce interactive music;\n- be flexible with your career options. I am (and have always been) medium agnostic. I used to do a lot of TV and now I work on League. I love writing music for film as well. You don't know where your musical journey will take you, be open-minded and learn to recognize, pursue and seize opportunities!\n\nI hope this helps! Good luck in your endeavors!\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niyume","date":"2018-01-09T18:55:24.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response. ^^\n\nPatience is something I've always been good at, and learning FL Studio has been easier than I thought (so far), my issue is just getting something down that sounds good. I'm so overcritical of myself that it's hard to get ideas flowing. :P","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-01-09T19:00:36.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best cure for being overcritical is to give yourself a window of time in which you are allowed to be critical, but never allow it outside of that time. So for example, do 25 or 50 minutes of work then spend 5 or 10 minutes allowing yourself to think about it critically. That way you're not just trying to stifle the impulse, but you channel it to allow yourself more time to get work done before it takes over.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyume","date":"2018-01-09T19:22:31.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, my brain doesn't let me do that. :P The nagging is just always there, even if I try to ignore it.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-01-09T19:29:43.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, my GF deals with that too. Not sure how to help you there, I haven't been able to help her with it yet either.\n\nMaybe meditiation and mindfulness would help? And not mindfulness as a concept, but the actual practice of it. It's a thing having to do with meditation, you should look it up there are a variety of benefits to practicing it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lemonhead Mental","date":"2018-01-08T19:30:38.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter what DAW you use.
