So while you can spew whatever to me, I will report in case it is a regular pattern for them. The usual punishment tiers for the game are:\n10 game chat restrict\n25 game chat restrict\n14 day ban\nPerm ban\n\nSo they have 2 mutes to help you clam down first and the only way you skip to a 14 day on first offense is Hate Speech/encouraging self harm. Which Hate Speech isn't what our focus was.\n\nYes, empathy, at the very least I know 50 students who learned that lesson. I can only hope it stays with them as they grow.\n\nIn response to another thing you posted farther along. The reason why Riot doesn't just hire a team to deal with feeder/troll reports is because it would still cost too much. I base it off that an employee would need to watch the entire match to fairly judge and ideally you would want at least 3 different employees to watch the same game separately. We will low ball and say an average game is 20 minutes. That is 3 games reviewed in an hour. And 24 games reviewed by a single person in an 8 hour work day. Assuming 100 employees that is 2400 games reviewed in a work day. Looks nice (also basing off only 1 person reviewing a game), but how many games were reported? Lets go ahead and low ball again and say 5000 games. Of the 2400 games how many turned out to be false reports? Probably 90% (admittedly a number I pulled out of thin air, but fair I think). 2600 reports to look out tomorrow, more generating at night and then 5000 more during the work shift. If you feel any of these numbers are exaggerated or you would simply like to counter, I do enjoy speaking to you. So please feel free. If it seems I misread something, also point that out.","replies":[{"poster":"Niyume","date":"2018-01-17T02:02:05.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"No, it's not a contradiction. You can throw out slurs and \"hate speech\" in WoW, Overwatch, GW2, BDO and so many other huge games with no issues unless you are actually a problem. They don't just look at your chat log, see that one word, and auto ban you like Riot does -- but, then, they're also not F2P, so they don't need to reset accounts to make more money off of you. FF does that, but that's because a good half the playerbase is gay, trans or something else weird and easily triggered.\n\nThe other funny thing... the word \"toxic\" doesn't even exist outside of the League playerbase (I mean unless you're talking science). I've been playing MMOs and online games since I was 8 (that'd be what, 2002?), and I never even heard the term \"toxic\" until I came to League in the early part of S5.\n\nAnd they don't need to rewatch an entire game (unless they need to specifically for that case), they have all kinds of information on you like where you usually click, keybinds you use, play patterns, champs you play, things you do, all that. They can just glance at that information for a minute or two, and know whether or not you were trolling -- Tantrum has done just that many times when he \"smites\" people.\n\nPlus, according to Riot, <1% of the population is ever validly reported.

While League may be the origin and popularized the term, it is indeed used in other game communities now. I could probably find some examples on various forums again.\n\nClick patterns and those named tools are more helpful determining if it is a different player on the account. Yes, consistency is a big thing but different champs may require different click patterns (most likely). Champs people play can change on a dime. Personally I think I only lack game play on a handful of champs and I try to cycle in order to get chests.\nAn example of what you named as a way to detect, working against the system. The 100% Yi and 0% Tahm. He consistently did poorly on Tahm but since it wasn't a drastic change the system or person may just think at first glance \"Wow, they are bad.\" After 25 games or something maybe raise a flag about that. There have been people who claim to \"test\" the system by making an account and running down mid to see how long it takes to get banned. The system is just seeing them as a bad player who doesn't get the game.\n\nUsing the 7.5 million concurrent players number from 2014, will do math.\n 10% would be 750k so 1% would be 75k I believe.\nMind you validly is only after a punishment has been given.

People bent on sexuality think straight people and \"cis-males\" are evil. People bent on race think whites are evil. Feminists think guys are evil. Normal people think I'm weird or depressed or something since I say I'm asexual. \n\nSo all these people hate me, and announce it to the world every day, and it's totally fine because I'm an oppressor and all that bullshit. But I'm not allowed to have an opinion of my own for those same reasons.
