I like happy, silly romance animes, or slice of lifes that have some kind of plot to it all. I don&#039;t like a lot of fanservice, and I can&#039;t stand gore or over the top violence, and any kind of existential talk will get my anxiety going (so no Your Lie in April or Clannad :P).\n\nI liked Toradora, Chuunibyu, Acchi Kocchi, K-On!, Working!, Chobits, DearS, No Game No Life, Kono Suba, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, Miss Kobayashi&#039;s Dragon Maid, Jitsu wa Watashi wa, Squid Girl, Eromanga Sensei, and so on.\n\nMy computer went bad lately, so I had to get a new one (everything was fried in a surge), and I lost my list of animes I had. : / So I need to remake it. Any recommendations help, so long as they fit my few criteria.\n\nThanks. ^^","replies":[]}
