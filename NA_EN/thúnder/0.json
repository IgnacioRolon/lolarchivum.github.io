The after I bought him I only had 1,227. I knew that wasn't right so I backed out and logged back in still having 1,227 RP. I then went to my purchase history and there were two Jayces both 880 RP each so that's 1,760 RP lost from a 880 RP purchase. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T22:55:44.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YIKES! That's not supposed to happen.
