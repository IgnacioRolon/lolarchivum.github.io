No I don't have more than one program running at a time. Yes, league is the only thing on my PC utilizing the network. Nobody else is connected to my internet.**\n\nThis has happened every once in a while but it's to the point where I can't even figure out where or why it's happening. I'll be playing a match and randomly my ping spikes to 100, drops, 200, drops, 500. drops and fluctuates for about the whole match between 138 - 400. I've never had this issue so frequently.\n\nI've hard reset my modem/router. I attuned my network configurations and followed the trouble shooting guide. Comcast states that there's no issues on their end. Is it just my router itself? I've replaced my ethernet cable mutliple times and it's still the same issue. I don't think there isn't a single thing I've done in the troubleshooting guide.\n\nThis ONLY HAPPENS TO LEAGUE. All my other games run fine, no network issues, no random lag spikes. I honestly don't even know anymore and I'm probably gonna call it quits.\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/A4Uw5Y4b &amp; https://pastebin.com/iFGEWxTA\n\nNetwork Logs from the past few matches:\nLatest: https://pastebin.com/6hHiz6FV\nhttps://pastebin.com/KfcjcGL0\nhttps://pastebin.com/vfmegZX0\nhttps://pastebin.com/xjAFT4N8\n\n[Speed Test](http://beta.speedtest.net/result/6435302877)","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-07T21:40:46.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to see you've already done a lot of initial troubleshooting; since you mentioned it only happening with LoL you might actually be onto something suspecting the ISP, but we can't be positive.\n\nSince you've tried a lot of the steps I would suggest, it may be best at this point to contact Tech Support [**in a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and show them this data. They can make the most educated decision on what's causing it and see if maybe there's a fix they can try out. You can also contact your provider again and ask them if they route games differently, but Comcast Xfinity is one of our peered partners so usually you should get a better, more direct route. Hope Tech can provide some more help for you in the ticket!","replies":[]}]}
