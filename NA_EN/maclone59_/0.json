I know you're excited to try out the Tresh skin so let's see what we can do about it. Can you try a few things to see if we can get the promotional site working? Here are a few things I tried when I encountered it a few times before:\n\n* Access the website with all extensions/add-ons turned off. Some browser have a (No Add-ons) option so you don't have to manually turn everything off.\n* Refresh the browser. There were a few times where I could choose the language, log in, and the page appeared blank (minus the background); after refreshing the browser, it loaded fine.\n* Try a different browser. If you use Edge/Internet Explorer/Safari, try Firefox; if you use Firefox, try Chrome; if you use Chrome... try any of the above.\n\nThose are the basics. If you continue having trouble, feel free to contact us via the [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) and my colleagues will help you out!","replies":[]}]}
