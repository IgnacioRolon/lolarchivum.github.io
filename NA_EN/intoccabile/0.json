(consider high ping anything between 100 and 999). I would imagine anything without a skillshot will do but Ive found threads saying who not to play yet not a single one stating the best possible options for support or jungle. Up until now I believe that the list should have the following champions:\r\n\r\nSupport\r\nKayle, Nunu, Sona (risky but has no skillshots other than her ult), Fiddlesticks, maybe a few of the tankier champs like Braum, Leona and Tahm Kench cause they can take the beating\r\n\r\nJungle\r\nAmumu, Shyvana, Udyr, Volibear, Warwick\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any others or if you would switch some of these out.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"UnbornHeretic","date":"2016-10-10T14:54:15.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiddle jungle\nMaokai jungle and support\nJanna support\nLulu support\nNautilus support and Jungle (his hook is the easiest of the 3 hook champs)\nZac jungle (although it may be hard to land E's)\nTaric support (everything has a delay anyways)\nIvern jungle doesnt need ping to make a first clear\n\nI would switch out Kayle because she is basically a utility adc and adc is difficult with high ping (also no clutch ults, zilean would be better if you get skilled with him). I would switch out Nunu because he is only really useful if he counterjungles the enemy and that is difficult o high ping (nunu is really bad as a support too). Amumu would be difficult because he needs to land Q, if you can land those Q's, add bltz to support along with thresh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T18:32:21.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For support champs, I find Leona is a safe pick for me when I play on Oceania with my mates in Australia. I get about 200ms latency to that server, so it's still fairly doable. \n\nIs there a reason we cannot work together to resolve your high latency issue? It's awful to experience high latency, and I wouldn't wish for anyone to have to live with high latency to the server if at all possible.\n\nLet me know what you've already tried to do in order to resolve your issue.","replies":[]}]}
