I normally get anywhere between 18-22 ping, but as of this week I've been getting about 1000-4000 ping like every few minutes and disconnecting in some games. It's really making the game unplayable at times bc of the amount of lag.\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\nHuge ping spikes, normal ping is 18-22, but after patch 7.7 it's been jumping from 1000-4000.\r\nIf you know how to fix this, send help please!!\r\n\r\nThanks so much guys!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T20:33:05.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \nYeouch 4000 ping?! That's definitely not gonna work out. That kind of intense ping spike could be caused by packet loss, which would mean your ping is only spiking when your network misses bits of information.
