I'd like to get this answered as quickly as possible because the match history where you can download replays is only 20 games. I am on the new alpha client by the way. Anyways, downloading and watching a match works directly from the league client, but when I go to the folder that the replay .rofl files are located in, I cannot open them. I tried downloading Firefox 3.36 which is supposedly compatible with html5, but I just get blank tabs when I try to open my replays. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"PMA Nipples","date":"2016-11-12T07:29:53.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think if you record them in the replay system it creates a file you can view out side of the game client.","replies":[{"poster":"mushroomism","date":"2016-11-12T07:54:48.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there is no way to go to games 20+ games back and download them?","replies":[{"poster":"PMA Nipples","date":"2016-11-12T08:44:50.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think so","replies":[{"poster":"mushroomism","date":"2016-11-12T19:57:17.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's... kinda stupid. So I have to go and record anything I want from games less than 20 games back. Man here I thought I could download the replays and access them later... I mean there has to be a way to play the .rofl you get from downloading the replays.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T00:34:53.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can only view *highlights* on a web browser, not an entire game. You can create a highlight by downloading and launching into a replay, then recording a segment that will be turned into a *highlight* that you can later access in the same folder as your replays and view them online. \n\nI hope this clears up the confusion.","replies":[{"poster":"mushroomism","date":"2016-11-16T18:38:54.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok, I think I understand better now. Although I have a few clarification questions if you don't mind. Firstly, is there any way to access matches outside of your last 20 games (in terms of if you didn't download/make the highlights while it was in your match history)? I assume not, but I figured I might ask. Also, it might just be me misunderstanding how the system works, but in match history the button to access replays first downloads a .rofl file, and then you can watch the replay. I am just wondering what that initial .rofl file is for?
