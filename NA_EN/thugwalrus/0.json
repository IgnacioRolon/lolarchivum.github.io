Maybe some will continue to build TF, but honestly attack speed is pretty lackluster on GP and the loss of crit makes it kinda pointless. I think there are two noticeable downsides to the changes to TF for GP. The first is the loss of being able to build Sheen in lane, which was such a nice item since it gives much needed mana early helps with harass. The other (minor) problem is the loss of the health and mana in your final build (250 health, 250 mana). My initial thoughts is to rush essences reaver since it kinda helps with mana issues (although you have to wait until the final item is done which sucks) and has all the stats GP wants anyway, then go boots, Shiv, IE, Mortal reminder/LDR, tank item (Sterak&#039;s, GA, Visage). The thing I liked about TF is it substituted for building another crit item like shiv which wastes a lot of stats on GP with the attack speed, and  you could get another pen item like ghostblade/maw or another tank item if need be, but the options seem kind of limited now because with just ER and IE you only have 40% crit, which might be ok but obviously the 60-70% is way nicer to have.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking maybe you build sheen anyway and delay your ER buy, and then just hold onto the sheen and make it into an IBG later for a tank item? it&#039;s alright since the Q can proc the IBG slow and you&#039;d incorporate some mana into the build, but the stats are pretty bad as you wouldnt have any health, you&#039;d end up wasting gold efficiency by going way over CDR cap, and you would be delaying outputting any meaningful damage until way later. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anyway this is viable, although it&#039;s kind of a fun idea\r\n\r\nI mean I think the unfortunate truth is that you just go ER first, suffer through an even weaker laning phase, and end up having less damage, health and mana but with 10% more crit (yay?).\r\n\r\nI doubt our boys at Riot will give him any compensation buffs, so what do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"x R e n g a R x","date":"2016-05-26T00:54:40.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3004}}","replies":[]}]}
