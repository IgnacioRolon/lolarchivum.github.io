It is hard to sit down and enjoy LCS matches for me right now because it is repetitive in picks. I realize it is difficult to keep all champions balanced with each other and viable. Hopefully the up-incoming patches will help balance out the picks and open up more variety.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinRaigeki","date":"2014-04-21T10:19:28.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally speaking, most champions don't get any LCS spotlight because the top champs are fairly defined... so it gets sad Q_Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Labcown","date":"2014-04-21T15:14:04.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Personally speaking, most champions don't get any LCS spotlight because the top champs are fairly defined... so it gets sad Q_Q.\n\nThere are only a few champions left that haven't been played in any professional manner this season, I think the number is somewhere around 15.\n\nWhile I'll agree not every champion has it's fair share of LCS spotlight, this season has seen more variety in champs I believe than any other season (except maybe season 1 percentage wise).","replies":[{"poster":"Menneskelig","date":"2014-05-02T11:32:47.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even the devil himself saw play. The champion meta in LCS at the moment is a lot more versatile than people realize, at least now. I was getting pretty sick of Mundo vs Shyvana for a while, but champions like Soraka mid, I wouldn't mind seeing in every game. As long as the games are interesting and the strategies keep changing, (*cough4v0cough*) I'll keep watching.\n\nEdit: That said, I've never seen Viktor played even once even in soloqueue and I don't know why that is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinRaigeki","date":"2014-04-22T07:08:32.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I'd rather if every champ had a more common chance of play rather than \"here's the standards!\"\n\nSure, some champs MIGHT see play, but uh, to quote the Veigar/Lulu story in the main forums:\n\nAshe: \"[To Veigar] Weren't you only chosen twice? And the one time you were chosen as a mage, none of the enemy team were mages\"\n\nTl;Dr: most champs that DO see pick are troll picks and not to be competitive in the least. While they COULD be competitive, they just don't stand up versus any of the high priorities. It makes for a boring game when \"Niche\" is the excuse for \"Competitively unviable\".\n\n\nThose niche picks won't be chosen when they won't be effective versus the competitives *unless troll/random picks that even the users themselves can't explain WHY they went for them*. Morde won't hold vs Renekton, Veigar won't hold vs Ziggs, Graves won't hold versus a Caitlyn (usually), and Jungle Maokai won't hold vs Lee Sin.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kal Vas Flam","date":"2016-02-01T02:04:50.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zil was played today in the NA LCS, and as an up and coming Zil main I found it to be awesome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"blindasleep","date":"2016-01-31T08:17:28.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kind of tired of seeing 4 ADCs in almost every game because their itemization makes almost everyone else look sad and snowballs games out of control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Menneskelig","date":"2014-05-02T11:25:46.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Competition is the spirit of change and adaptation, if they did that more than once we wouldn't have even the small variation of champions that occur now. Not to mention some players (reaching example: Oddone on {{champion:57}}) would be outplayed just because someone else happens to like a champion that is also in meta. \n\nThe meta is constantly shifting every patch and I rarely see a game that ends up with the same 10 champions in them every single game, and when one team picks the same team as before, they usually lose. (Unless you are c9 season 3)\n\nWhile it would be fun, it won't lead to a constructive competitive game, that is essentially what they did on the U.R.F. exhibition game and it was entertaining until you realized that c9 had stronger picks and won by a mile.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wOy JhonnyBamBam","date":"2014-04-24T15:14:26.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it wasn't their job totry and win those games i would agree that it would be nice to see them on their comfort picks.
