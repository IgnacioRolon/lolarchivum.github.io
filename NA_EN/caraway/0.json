Before today it was fine, but now whenever I try to spectate it takes forever to load the players. Then it tells me \"can't connect to spectator data\" and closes. I don't think it's the patch in this case. It's frustrating, nonetheless, since it appears to be happening for no reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DefenderOfFaith","date":"2014-12-17T22:30:46.881+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made it through the firewall steps OK.  Then I made it as far as to the part where they want me to install java to run the network analyzer, and you know, friends don't let friends install java.  So I'm done, but maybe a more spirited volunteer can submit information.\n\nThe troublesome thing about it is at one point it worked, and with literally no software or configuration modifications to the computer  except a new a League of Legends  patch, it suddenly stops, so it has that anecdotal feeling that its all League.  But I do understand there are growing pains as well, as backend technology needs to be upgraded and secured.\n\nThanks for helping out DArtagnan.","replies":[]},{"poster":"weeng","date":"2014-12-15T20:37:05.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.

It appears to be working normally, which leads me to think that there is something else going on.  When we've received tickets about this previously, it usually involves a type of connection issue where the main game can connect, but not the spectator client/servers.    The steps here usually resolve this issue:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nThere are quite a number of steps there, but every single one is crucial in helping make sure that you can properly connect to our Spectator Servers.  If you are still not able to see the Spectator Box on the Client, or spectate games, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our Tech Team!

The games  freeze. I get a Popup window that says \"Download Failed... Unable To Download Spectator Data. The Game Will Now Exit.\" after roughly 16 mins of spectating. Also the download bar starts off at 100%, but begins to decrease after 18 mins has downloaded as shown in the attached image. The clock continues to increase in game time, but nothing plays, and the players stand still, sometimes even doing their, standing moves, while minions fight and glitch. \n\nhttp://dilaryn.com/20141223_080845.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"o Mim o","date":"2014-12-29T03:14:08.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can spectate games on the PBE fine.

I don't know if that information will help, but I think its relevant.  The information representing my spectation session that might be pulled to the other player, so that information for me is being generated incorrectly or as a corrupt record.","replies":[{"poster":"o Mim o","date":"2015-01-02T17:35:11.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't spectate on a friend's game or the dashboard selection of games.

The amazonaws thing (no idea what that is) seems to sync fine.  Some SYN requests were not receiving their corresponding ACK, and thus re-sending.  Then further down the stack  duplicate ACK requests were received.  Its not just in the negotiation, also the TCP sequence numbers for general information requests kept re-transmitting.  Sometimes more data went through than others.\n\nI'll have to reflect on these logs awhile.","replies":[]}]}
