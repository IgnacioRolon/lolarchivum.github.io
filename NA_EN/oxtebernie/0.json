You are thinking of season 4. That was true in season 4 when everybody played zed talon yas even riven mid was huge at the time, khazix mid etc and all those champs were top picks in worlds as well. Patch 5.X was in season 5 which was entirely a tank meta. The \"first\" tank meta with the first tank reworks/items. Introduction of cinderhulk and all that. In a tank meta, assassins werent that common but they did have access to old LW which was 100x more healthier than lethality for both assassin players and players of other roles. People complained about tanks nonstop but looking back it wasnt even close to as bad as the game is now. So id take 5.X any day.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-17T02:27:44.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"..AP Warwick..\n\nYeah, no.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2018-03-17T05:58:56.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Season 3 best season\n\nWhere art thou, Wriggles Lantern?","replies":[]}]}
