I dont know how this could happen but whenever I am in a game, the game crashes along with the internet. \r\nI have tried restarting the whole computer (which ALMOST works and when i say almost i mean ill have internet... until i start the LoL client then its back to square 1), i have tried internet solutions which say to do stuff to the Command thing in main computer, tried restarting the modem.\r\nAlso to add that my computer is running AMD r9 290, all in all a strong working computer but loses to a battle with a free game. Why does this happen on seperate occasions? Why cant I get my internet when i play LoL whenever it crashes? Please help. Also thank you for reading if you got this far.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-09T17:20:06.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your internet and game crashing as a double whammy sounds like it could be due to a connection issue.

I wish that maybe this post would be able to reach out to those who are still having the same problems out there since your answer was straightforward and to the point (More updated than googles answers). I tried the trouble shooting connections advice on the Support page and I am trying the turn off all firewall, the easy way they mentioned. I hope this works and if anything I'll come back with an updated report on how the game functions after this change, sometime before or soon after the rank rewards and if i have connections problems again I'll try again. Thank you for your help :D","replies":[]}]}]}
