Email has been changed/Unknown match history","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am asking for help to recover my account. I logged in to my LoL account after not playing for 2 days when I noticed I had more IP than usual and noticed my match history. Someone used my account to play a couple of games with Annie and a Pantheon game but also deleted my friends list. I went to the LoL main page and noticed the server for my account, after I logged in to the main page, was for EU and the email default wasn't my -snip-. That was my original default email but now I can not change my email or my password because all the changes would go to the new email.\nThe email used for this was -snip- and after checking on Google that is a Chinese email so I'm pretty sure that I have been indeed hacked. At this point I'm afraid to log out of my account on the main client as to fear that my account's password would reset if the hacker would choose to do so. That means I will have to leave my computer on, which I don't want to but I have seen this before. If there is a way that I can get back my original email used then I can reset my PW.\n\nI hope this reaches out to someone who works for Riot games and notice that my account was created with mail.com and not a fake Chinese email made by a person who hacked my account to play a few rank games. Please help me get my account back or change my default email since I have tried to change in the support ticket but only asks for the email used in the default settings for email/PW changes. Thank you for taking the time to read and I hope you reply with help.\n\nUpdate** 15 minutes ago I posted this same post on the Behavior discussion and was not intended to be there, I need help in the Help and Support section. I deleted the old post and here is the new one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T15:41:39.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've edited your post to snip out personal information at a public venue.
