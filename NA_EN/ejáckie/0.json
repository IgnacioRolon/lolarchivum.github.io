Everything in my background is working perfectly (YouTube and Discord). I thought this might've been a problem on my part but I disconnected and reconnected to my internet. I waited a good minute before I left the game expecting a reconnecting button, only to find out that I'm back at the home screen and was able to get into queue. No LP was lost but on op.gg it still says I'm ingame. I tried relogging but I'm still at the home screen. \r\n\r\nI'm worried that I may be AFK in the game :/ Has this happened before? Is this common..?\r\n\r\n{{item:3070}} ____{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T02:33:29.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries! Those is pretty typical symptoms of when a game fully crashes on the server side of things. When it happens, everyone will be booted from the game and nobody can reconnect because it just doesn't exist anymore. You won't lose any LP or get any punishment, and you're free to requeue!","replies":[]}]}
