I like big visual representations to get that kind of broad overview of something this complex, so I created a schematic to show how champions are affiliated and related to one another in LoL.\n\nI know things like this have been done before, but I didn't see that there was anything currently being updated. I am hoping this is a useful resource for other members of the community who also find the lore engaging. You can also see from the image that there is still a lot of room for interaction amongst champions, although some like Singed are fairly well connected.\n\nPlease let me know if you find anything missing, as this is still very much a work in progress (and likely will always be).\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotNinjaTabby","date":"2013-09-17T19:57:03.181+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"drink together\" connector just made my day. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Montag","date":"2013-09-18T05:17:28.584+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would. ;-)","replies":[{"poster":"moltovcarrot","date":"2013-09-19T01:10:06.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Confirmed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FlySkyHigh777","date":"2013-09-19T01:20:28.513+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"So where's lucian?\n\nAnd where's my pink line between Shyvana and Jarvan.\n\nAnd my taric/ezreal pink line!!!","replies":[{"poster":"IMSOJUICY","date":"2013-09-21T16:11:40.961+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"THis is fucking heresy, Jarvanna for liiiiife\n\nGO AWAY, QUINN, NO ONE LIKES YOU.
