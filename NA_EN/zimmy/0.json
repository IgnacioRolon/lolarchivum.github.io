Before I upgraded to W10 I had Windows 8 and the GPU would only be at Sub 41 C at 40 percent fan speed. Now I have mine at 70% and it still at such a high temp. On CSGO it would be around 64~ C at med settings and lower fan speed.\r\n\r\nAny ideas why it's so high? Is there random stuff that windows 10 runs in the back that I should be aware of?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-20T15:42:52.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a couple of reasons why your PC could be running under such thermal stress, although an OS upgrade is extremely unlikely to be one of them.

Open your Task Manager and see if there are apps running in the background which you didn't launch.\n2. Perform a Disk Cleanup and a Registry Error check. I recommend [CCleaner](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner) for this.\n3. Perform a virus scan to see if there any viruses on your machine.
