Would you happen to have a replay/video or would you be able to get me your R3dlogs from that game? \n\n**TL;DR** - A match log is created each time you play a game. It contains vital information about your loading process and will log any errors that occur during the course of the game. These logs are essential for troubleshooting in situations where you have problems in-game.\n\nEach file appears like this: [yyyy-mm-ddT15-40-03] _r3dlog.txt, where yyyy-mm-dd is the date of the match played.\n\n**You can find them here:**\n\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\GameLogs, under the time and date stamped folder for the game in which you had issues.\n\nAny additional info is appreciated!\n\n**EDIT**: Okay! Figured it out! Looks like it's just when he dies, the gray overlay is reapplying once he's alive again.
