When my client crashed, it said LoL had crashed and made me fill out an error report.  I filled it out, but I feel like I shouldnt be punished for this when it actually wasnt my fault.  Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T19:03:28.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system treats all leaves equally even if it was an untended crash.  The reason for this is because they still cause other players in the match a negative experience.  You also need to have a history of leaves and not just one game to receive a penalty.  It's really important to resolve your crashing to not only prevent further issues but to get you back in game! \n\nThese crashes, or bugsplats, usually happen when a game file or driver fails to render your game.  My suggestion would be to go through the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
