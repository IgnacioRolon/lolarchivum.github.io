My ping is great (30-50), and I can still watch what everyone is doing (this is the weird part), but I cannot move or cast spells.  This is getting to where I can't play, cause I will just constantly dc.  I'm not sure what's causing this, and I would love any assistance.\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems to slightly go away when I launch the old client.  Could it be an issue with the new client?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T02:30:20.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing some really common symptoms of *Packet Loss* or *Packet Buffering*. This mostly happens if there are some issues between your PC and the servers that cause the packets of info you send to the servers to get lost along the way.
