Ok, a bit of a reason there.\n\nYoure in promos and someone is trolling? Alright, I understand\n\nMultiple games in a row with afks/feeders? I feel for you\n\nBut when someone explains to you both in champ select and in game that theyre new and not particularly skilled, why are you going to start raging at them when they do poorly? Do you expect them to be lying? Do you think that your very presence should somehow lift them up skill wise? Im at a loss.\n\nIm a noob. I know this. Its the main reason I stick to normal games for right now. But, for reasons I don't fully understand, I typically find myself playing with/against golds/plats and sometimes even diamonds. Im not going to pretend to understand Ritos matchmaking system, because im sure it makes about as much sense as some of the balance decisions they make. But as of right now, im 90/92 win/loss. Im down 2 games and yet im still playing with golds/plats in every game.\n\nJust today, I played a game in which I last picked Vel'Koz into Ahri. Apparently this wasn't a very smart move, but I wasn't aware of that fact. I explained to my team that im a newbie, but that id do my best. I then proceeded to get destroyed in lane by this Ahri. I couldn't do anything about it, as it seemed no matter where I was she could just dive ult up to me and kill me with patriot-missile level precision on her Charm. No matter how I tried to juke, she always managed to land it. It was pretty impressive really, hats off to her.\n\nOf course, some of my teammates decided they wanted to start raging about it though. Complaining that I lost our team the entire game (which, maybe I did, but do be fair I never saw Panth try to gank and get me back in it or anything) despite the fact that bot didn't do that great either. Panth decided to blame his lost lane on me as well because Ahri roamed top and ganked him twice for kills, even though I pinged her MIA every single time she wasn't in mid lane.\n\nI just don't understand it. I TOLD YOU that I wasn't a very good player. I TOLD YOU THAT, and yet youre going to start flipping out about my performance anyways? If you want a more stable and evenly matched game environment, go play ranked where youll be playing with properly skilled players, don't go into normal and flame someone that TELLS YOU THEYRE A NOOB.\n\nOf course, I report these people after the game for being dicks, but I just don't feel like it amounts to anything. Of course im sure they report me as well for anything from unskilled player to intentionally feeding despite the fact that I never give up in games and never troll. These peoples attitudes are just so...childish...\n\n/end rant\n\nTL;DR The MMR system needs to be reworked or something because it doesn't seem like it works properly. And I feel like player toxicity needs to be addressed in a more visible manner, at least to the people that are submitting reports. Something like a message from Rito that says: \n\n\"Hey there -player-! We were just letting you know that -toxic player-, who you reported for -reasons-, has been issued -punishment- in keepings with the Summoners Code! Have a good day!\"\n\nYou know, to let people know that reporting actually accomplishes something.","replies":[{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-03-17T16:58:11.688+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive noticed this in online games / forums / well, just online in general.

League for some reason has an amplified version of this phenomenon festering in its bowels like cancer.\n\nI fee like part of League's particular issue has always been their focus on emphasizing twitch-reflexes and optimizing for competitive professional play. It leaves the largest part of their playerbase in the dust, and when you're stuck in a 45 minute match where you're at a significant disadvantage and nothing you do helps turn anything around, there's really nothing TO do but get upset about it. You're trapped in a game that was decided ten minutes ago, but you cant leave without getting reported and losing your account and you can't get your allies to surrender because they all cling to the slim 1% hope of a comeback instead of doing the sensible thing and moving on to a better game.\n\nChrist, that's probably as much a factor as anything else: being held captive in a lost match by over-optimistic people who can't see common sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Damorion215","date":"2015-03-18T01:52:15.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You and the OP of this thread have just won the fuckin' internet!

You speak of legends as if you are familiar what makes one a legend, and all i see is a petty child who cuts down those around him so that he feels as though he is risen to another level, when in reality you are no better than you were before and have now weakened your entire team. Do you think that Generals before battle remind their troops of his prestigious rank, how great he is, and how shitty they all are...how useless and weak, unskilled, and heartless they all are just before battle? Or during? No sir, he does not. He builds them up and encourages them, even when they are losing...even when they are showing themselves unskilled at their craft he continues to lift their spirits and tells them they can win. \n\nYou are absolutely NOT a legend. I could recommend you take your own advice, but i would rather you just stop cutting people down, because even if you leave, you would just go break peoples spirits in another game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FearEngineer","date":"2015-03-17T18:35:13.486+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Greetings Summoner,\n\nI wanted to let you know that a player you reported, guyWhoHurtYourFeelings, has recently been reviewed for Verbal Abuse.\n\nYour comment \"fkn ashoel tol me that building ap on riven was retarded. fuk him idot need ban for toxic\" was very helpful to us and we appreciate your role in improving the League of Legends community.\n\nSee you on the rift,\nRiot responseBot\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"ladention","date":"2015-03-18T01:36:12.919+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally feel you.

But if you want to win, the fast track is *not* berating your struggling teammate. In fact, that sounds more like a cheap way to shield your vulnerable ego from the loss which you have already decided to concede without a fight. \n\nThe fast-track to victory when a player is trying his best but failing hard, is to tell him what to do differently, exercise patience, and help as much as possible. \n\nUltimately, though, I think the internet has successfully allowed many people to pretend that the character and name on the screen does not represent a real person, and thus you can say whatever you want.

IN the game I described above, literally not a single person made any suggestions for me except \"Lol you don't pick Vel'Koz into Ahri noob\" AFTER I WAS ALREADY GETTING STOMPED IN LANE. It wasn't until the post game screen that people decided to tell me I should have just farmed under turret and waited for ganks, despite the fact that Ahri was able to kill me under turret anyways. So basically my options were to either never go in lane (including under tower) unless Ahri was gone, or try to farm under tower and hope she misses her Charm, which she rarely did.\n\nHonestly I think youd be hard pressed to find a legitimately new player that would disregard advice. Now, some people might assume that if that new player continues to die then they obviously are disregarding that advice, but that's just an ignorant way of looking at it. Based on what I said, even if someone told me to farm under tower in the game I was in I still would have died and they likely would have raged at me for \"not listening\" even though Ahri just killed me under tower.

Most of them don't listen to any advice. When I was on a smurf account playing with my friend who was brand new to the game I tried to give advice all the time (not toxic advice at all). One game we had a tristana who rushed frozen mallet. I tried to tell her that frozen mallet is one of the least gold efficient items in the game, and that it is also not a good buy for trist. I told her that the best items to buy on trist right away are infinity edge or static shiv. Did she listen? No, she just kept building the damn frozen mallet, saying retarded shit about how she \"likes the slow\". And then she started building a second one for \"more HP\". I tried to explain to her that her build was poor for several minutes but she wouldn't have any of it, and I just gave up. I swear if doublelift himself tried to reason with her she would have just ignored him. This is just one example.\n\nIn another smurf game we had a garen who went full AP. I asked him why he was building AP and he said \"to get more damage, idiot\". I could totally understand the misconception he had. When I was new to the game I didn't know about scalings, and because AP was called \"ability power\" I just assumed that buying it made all of your abilities do more damage no matter what. But when I tried to explain scaling to him he just kept calling me an \"idiot and retarded noob\". This was a level 12 player. I hardly ever smurf, but when I do I never try to help new players on my team anymore because they do this kind of shit every game.\n\nWhen I hear about how smurfs are so \"full of themselves\" and \"toxic\" I think, well that may sadly be true, but some of the most stuck up and stubborn assholes I've ever encountered in this game were new players. Most of them will flat out ignore any good advice given to them. Oh, the guy with 3000x more experience is telling you that your build is wrong?

Work with me here.\n\nI heard a wise man say that \"Stress is related to identity.\" While this may not be true in every case, I think it makes sense here.\n\nThe short version:\n\n\"I think I am good at video games.\"\n\n\"I am not performing very well in this game.\" (or at least the 0/7 stats claim he is not doing well)\n\n\"But I am not bad at video games! I am quite good! **Therefore, it must be someone else's fault!**\"\n\n---\n\nConsidering yourself a skilled player and performing poorly in a video game causes *cognitive dissonance* which in part is defined as \"stress which is caused by being confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.\" In the above example, the player's self-perception and belief is that he is a skilled player - perhaps better than most! But this belief is confronted with the experience of performing poorly, and this dissonance causes stress. This stress causes discomfort and causes the player to lash out at whoever they believe is at fault for their mistakes.\n\nThe only way to fix this, is to accept that *even skilled players can perform poorly.* Watch any LCS match, and you will not see every pro player going 10/0 in the game. To get a kill, someone must die. And sometimes that someone is you, because - even though you are a skilled player - someone may be more skilled than you.\n\nEven if it isn't \"our fault,\" we must ask ourselves \"what could I have done differently in this situation?\" Nobody is perfect, and we all have ways we can improve - otherwise we'd all be in the Challenger bracket! It is a team game, and other people will impact your performance - in some cases, maybe even throw the game. But there is **always** something you can do to help change the outcome, and it usually isn't \"get pissed off at the person you think is at fault for everything.\"\n\nThat's my theory.\n\n-xN\n\nTL;DR\n\nPeople who think they are \"skilled players\" often ignore the fact that there is always some way for them to improve as well, and instead of immediately searching for what someone else did wrong, we should all be asking ourselves in every situation \"what could I have done differently to change this outcome?\" Because there is **always** a way to improve our own skill. Asking someone else to be a better player will never make *us* better players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LOL Spammer","date":"2015-03-19T01:51:19.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH: A little under 50% win rate isn't bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Respakt","date":"2015-03-18T22:31:38.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dota 2 sends you a response that they have taken action against a player you have reported and gives you additional reports (you can only report like 4 people a week something, idk the exact numbers) and I got to say, its very satisfying knowing that some punk is going to get punished for ruining part of your life, especially since you cannot surrender in dota. \n\nAlso,  I don't report newbs but instead flamers and trolls or people who are obviously trying to throw.

Im down 2 games and yet im still playing with golds/plats in every game.\n> \n> Just today, I played a game in which I last picked Vel'Koz into Ahri. Apparently this wasn't a very smart move, but I wasn't aware of that fact. I explained to my team that im a newbie, but that id do my best. I then proceeded to get destroyed in lane by this Ahri. I couldn't do anything about it, as it seemed no matter where I was she could just dive ult up to me and kill me with patriot-missile level precision on her Charm. No matter how I tried to juke, she always managed to land it. It was pretty impressive really, hats off to her.\n> \n> Of course, some of my teammates decided they wanted to start raging about it though. Complaining that I lost our team the entire game (which, maybe I did, but do be fair I never saw Panth try to gank and get me back in it or anything) despite the fact that bot didn't do that great either. Panth decided to blame his lost lane on me as well because Ahri roamed top and ganked him twice for kills, even though I pinged her MIA every single time she wasn't in mid lane.\n> \n> I just don't understand it. I TOLD YOU that I wasn't a very good player. I TOLD YOU THAT, and yet youre going to start flipping out about my performance anyways?

I watch LCS matches fairly frequently, ive watched some Leaguecraft 101 videos, I understand the basics of the game such as last hitting, warding and trading. The problem is that I have a small champion pool, and I have better performances in certain roles as opposed to others. In terms of how well I can play a role, its prolly ADC>Supp>Top>Mid>Jung from my best to my worst, and in every champ select I usually say \"ADC pref, pref not jung\" so my team knows where im at.\n\nBut at the end of the day, you need to play the game to improve, and Bot matches aren't anywhere near an appropriate level to learn in. I can go into a bot match with Vel'Koz and go 20/0 without breaking a sweat, yet in normal ill get absolutely destroyed. I need to play normals to improve, but im so worried about my teammates raging and losing the game that ill pretty much always just try to play in my comfort zone of ADC/Supp, which leads to situations like in my OP where I feed Ahri as Vel. Even if I don't get ADC/Supp I usually just relegate the lane as a loss before it even begins, and ill just pick a safe tanky top laner or jungler and hope that I can get beefy enough to just run around the middle of the enemy team in fights absorbing damage.\n\nTL;DR, People need to play against other people in order to improve.
