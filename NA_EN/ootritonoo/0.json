After the patch, I am able to login, get to a game, champ select and whatnot, but as soon as the game starts (loading screen) it crashes. Consistently. This is on two different gaming computers mind, with two different setups. \r\n\r\nAny way to fix the issue? Both games were ranked games and I don't want to get another leaverbuster warning due to the game continuously crashing whenever it tries to get to the loading screen.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-18T23:24:10.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you getting the same crashes in custom games as well? . It's a little unusual that it's happening in the same spot on two different computers, but I don't see any notifications of widespread game crashes in loading screen so at the moment I'd say it's more likely to be coincidence (though not ruling anything out yet).\n\nAs a first step, I'd check out our [Bug Splat and Game Crashes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) article that has some fixes to the common causes of crashes that we see.  Let me know if it helps!","replies":[{"poster":"oOTritonOo","date":"2016-05-19T00:09:56.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't getting it for custom no. On one computer I had LOLReplay. On the other I did not, but I had Windows 10. I don't know if it will work for others, but the computer I had Windows 10 on I disabled it back to another version and now it works (in normal games at least.) So I don't know. But at least on one computer I can at least play norms.","replies":[]}]}]}
