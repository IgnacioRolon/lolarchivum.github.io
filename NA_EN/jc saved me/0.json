I also use a proxy server \"kill Ping\" I usually sit at around 65 ping. However recently my ping will be higher but still steady at 88-90 but my commands will stop working but I everything around me happens in real time without skipping a beat. Suddenly my commands will work again after about 3-7 seconds. I play ranked often and this affect my games and the outcomes severely. I have seen others post this problem but I haven't seen a response from RIOT or any other player who has had this problem and been able to fix it. I'm 99.9% sure that it is not on my end. I have reset everything flushes dns reset my ethernet adapter, restarted my computer and entire network, the whole 9 yards. It is completely random when it happens. some days it doesn't happen at all, other days it happens every other game or every game. It is super frustrating and it didnt change when the new patch came out. I also tool the liberty or repairing my patch more than once. This did not fix it either. PLEASE HELP RIOT OR ANYONE.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T16:23:15.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen any issues with the servers that would be causing this to happen.  It seems like your network is having trouble maintaining a connection, so it can't communicate your inputs to the match.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to configure and strengthen your connection.  I also suggest testing this out in a custom game to prevent any penalties, but to also try disabling the proxy server just to see if the issue might be originating there.  Let me know if you continue to have any issues!","replies":[{"poster":"JC Saved Me","date":"2016-09-15T17:40:38.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened in the past, this is only the first time i've posted about it because there is no way that it can be on my side, It has happened to me at different houses, on different isp's my friend in california has had it happen to him. It was happening before I started using the proxy server, and i will be fine one game then the next game it will be slightly higher ping and my commands will not work randomly. It has never made any sense to me, and ive never seen an answer to this on any post of other people having this issue.\n\nI have seen threads of people having this issue in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015 and no one seems to know what causes it. And it's frustrating because there is nothing I can do to fix it on my end. I have also checked my ping in a custom game seen it was 65 immediately went into a ranked game afterwards and my ping was then 88 and i froze randomly with my commands not working. Hopefully someone from riot will have this issue so it will be fixed, because no one seems to take it seriously like its not a problem with something on RIOTS side of things. Because it doesnt happen in other games.","replies":[]}]}]}
