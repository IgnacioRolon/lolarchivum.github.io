You've lost a customer. Your company's \"experiment\" to improve behavior is just a marketing ploy, the reality is you ban the \"try hards\" and not the kiddos with mommy's credit cards. I've lost many friends to your bans, and I've never, ever, seen anything justifiably bannable in their cases. When a company bans people for things like sarcasm, or being provoked into reacting, it's no wonder League's popularity has tanked, and to no surprise, Riot has yet to release official, legally recognized QER to even certify the numbers they released in the first place. \r\n\r\nWhy is it that DOTA2's Valve releases their QER, but not Riot? What are you afraid of Riot? I think the evidence speaks for itself, if you can't release a legally recognized QER to back up your claims, then your numbers are fabricated, and this entire behavioral system is another way for you to try and save your image all while corruptively banning those who actually want to play the game, and keeping the ones who provoke people in the first place, simply because they have the $$$; that's not good business practice, and it's probably why you've not released any legally recognized form of numbers, you've got nothing but fabricated numbers for the sake of advertising, and given the increased queue times, up to 5-7 minutes, I am not at all surprised that this ship is sinking, and fast. Your matchmaking is also horribly lopsided to be placing premades against non-premades, and the matchmaking values are way off, which is why I see games that are either horrible losses or huge victories, almost never an even match, your system is broken and I wouldn't be surprised if it was intentional. Riot, you've had a million chances to be honest and transparent, and instead you've chosen shady business practices and saving the kiddos with mom's credit card. You're not improving anyone's behavior by banning them for 2-weeks or permanently, it's sheer ignorance to think that permanently removing someone is improving their behavior, because, they would be gone... how is that improving, it's not. Instead, they come back with a new account, probably more angry than ever before, and you call this a successful system? Goodbye Riot, I got my money back, and good riddance. I will not see another friend of mine nor good player banned for the sake of appealing to your kiddo audience with mom's credit cards, this is not China nor Russia, your shady practices are not welcome here. There are other options, options that unlike you Riot, aren't afraid of releasing their official, legally recognized numbers, and it's likely because they're far more popular. League is a scam, there aren't even half as many players on here as Riot claims, and until they release official, legally recognized numbers, it's nothing more than a fabrication for the sake of advertising.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-01-30T10:42:27.085+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":4,"body":"D...did you just admit you were a kiddo with your mom's credit card?","replies":[{"poster":"b1TLHaKERl","date":"2015-01-30T10:44:37.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"I do look like a kiddo, but no I'm not.","replies":[{"poster":"xInkredible","date":"2015-01-30T13:00:26.607+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do look like a kiddo, but no, I'm not.","replies":[{"poster":"OhOkYeah","date":"2015-03-01T00:17:28.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I'm not, I do look like a kiddo's butt","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-01-30T10:59:08.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get it.

Once approved, the chargeback cancels the financial transaction, and the consumer receives a refund of the money they spent. When a chargeback occurs, the merchant is accountable, regardless of whatever measures they took to verify the transaction.\n\nIf his account is not currently suspended, then he has either never issued the chargeback (which makes him a liar) or he has already repaid them (which makes him a liar).

Or, you did them with a different account, it changes nothing.  \n\nI know you think you look cool, but the only reason I chimed in (and I'm probably not alone) is that I wanted to be sure that other kids on here don't read what you did and think it's something that is acceptable to do.  It seems like that's all you are trying to do, is convince some unwitting kid to initiate chargebacks, just so you have the sick joy of knowing you have destroyed part of their life for a while.  I consider my posts here more of a PSA than anything else.\n\nSo ya, at this point I think anyone reading through this can easily tell you are a troll, so our job is done.\n\nFraudulent chargebacks are a very big deal.  That is one reason why there are criminal as well as civil penalties.  For the company selling the products/services, there are big penalties, regardless of the legitimacy of the chargebacks.  If it goes over a certain mark, card services simply will not process transactions for them anymore.  When you see that warning on a website, steer clear... I've seen it before.  \nSo in addition to the lsot revenue, they could lose payment services.  So, naturally, they have strong policies.  There are legitimate reasons, however.\n\nA friend of mine once was unable to play his Steam games for a while because, while he normally used prepaid cards, he decided to use his bank card one day.  The bank itself reversed the transaction (steam was relatively new at the time, and they didn't think it was legitimate), and Steam blocked his account.  He had to physically go into the bank and then submit a ticket to Steam for it to finally get unlocked after a week or so.  Even his offline games refused to play.  :o  he was sore about it for a while.  :)  He is one of those obnoxious people who are pro-DRM, so I gave him so much hell about it.  :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"b1TLHaKERl","date":"2015-03-01T06:08:20.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"\"Pretty much this, so I don't have to wikipedia it myself\" is what you just posted, you must feel really good about yourself now, except for the fact that there was no lying involved, and I told the bank exactly why I was disputing it, which they then investigated and approved, which is why it's 100% legal. \n\nAs I told the other guy: Feel free to add me on League right now, will prove that I'm not banned.

Tencent doesn't need to broadcast the financial results of every individual holding they have, just their overallnumbers as a holding company.\n\nIt's Tencent's decision, not Riot's. Holding companies make the decisions of how to financially report their earnings.... as longa s all the numbers are provided and accurate, that's all that matters.\n\nRiot really has no say in the matter, and going against the wishes of their holding company and publishing the numbers themselves - while certainly legal - wouldn't be a good idea since Tencent is the 'hand that is feeding' Riot and you don't bit the hand that feeds you.","replies":[{"poster":"b1TLHaKERl","date":"2015-03-01T06:54:54.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hahaha \"it's there bro, mixed in together, with no distinction bro,\" yeah, that totally solved the problem.

There's no reason for them to do so - they just muddy the overall message. When you're THAT large of a company, you typically have some holdings that are risky investments and others that are stable and the OVERALL picture is the only thing that matters so that's what they report, along with specific high and lowpoints that are worth noting for their investors and shareholders.\n\nTencent's market value is around ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION USD. Do you know how small a portion Riot is of that? I'd be surprised if Riot made up even 1% of their value. What possible reason could Tencent have to report Riot's specific numbers? They're simply one of DOZENS of holdings Tencent has.\n\nTo compare this to Activision Blizzard....  they're worth approximately ~15 billion. and have a fraction of the number of holdings of Tencent. Because of this, it's important for them to show off that their holdings are performing well to validate the acquisitions and investments. Tencent Is large enough that they simply wish to show that they, as an organization, are performing well. It's a difference of scale.","replies":[{"poster":"b1TLHaKERl","date":"2015-03-01T07:52:51.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're saying that a publicly traded company doesn't need to use distinction because they're worth 150B, despite every other company using distinction, seems legit.\n\n{{champion:105}}","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-03-01T08:04:16.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Winterglow,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=mKkB3sGF,comment-id=0000000000000000000100010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-01T07:52:51.296+0000)\n>\n> You're saying that a publicly traded company doesn't need to use distinction because they're worth 150B, despite every other company using distinction, seems legit.\n> \n> {{champion:105}}\n\n\"Every other company\"\n\nNot true at all.

I've trolled people (in other games) so hard with sarcasm that they start raging like a mid-laner whose blue you just stole for the fifth time.  Just because you're 'only' being sarcastic doesn't mean you will never deserve a good slapping.\n\n2)  Being provoked into a response is still doing whatever you shouldn't be doing.  It just means someone else gets banned too.  If a guy punches me in the face and I stab him in retaliation, there's a good chance we're both gonna get arrested even though I was 'provoked.'\n\n3)  Generally speaking, few people who get banned think they deserve it.  If you're losing lots of friends to bans, odds are that, objectively, they are being jerks and breaking the rules.  Your subjective opinion may be different, since they are your friends, but that actually clouds your judgement more than theirs since you have more trust in them..\n\n4)  Valve releases their QER because they choose to, they're not obligated to.  Only publicly-traded companies have to.  Riot, being a subsidiary of another company (Tencent Holdings), does not release a separate QER but is instead included under Tencent's, which is publicly available. Individual numbers for just Riot -are- out there, since people have them, but they're not made publicly available since that would be meaningless to the business community.\n\n5)  I think banks and creditors are honestly going to be more suspicious of you than they are of Riot.  Someone who charges back something that's been on the books for a while is never going to be looked at favorably, and if the bank cared to investigate the claim (they probably won't since a few hundred bucks is nothing to them) they could probably charge you with charge-back fraud if they wanted to put the fear of Adam Smith into you.\n\n6)  The BBB rating doesn't mean as much as it used to considering the organization has had quite a few scandals themselves in recent years, including charges of bribery, corruption, and favoritism.

There's no way you didn't receive those and unless you werent' given the number you were promised c doesn't apply either.... so as longa s you authorized the payment there is no legal reason for you to request a chargeback.\n\nNow if you went in to the bank and requested one and spun the story to make it sound like it was in your favour, that's fine... but banks typically don't require much to auth a chargeback because it is NEVER smart to argue with the customer when they're standing in the bank like that. Also, the frontline staff who approved it do not have the AUTHORITY to reject it. So of course the person you spoke to at the bank approved it. The people who have the authority to reject it are the company's auditors and lawyers.... and every year they select a certain number of transactions of each type to audit.(the number changes from bank to bank)... and they investigate them and validate them. Friends of mine HAVE been contacted regarding chargeback requests and asked to prove that they WERE valid so I know this happens - but it always happens AFTER the fact. Fortunately, my friends - unlike you - were justified so once they'd proved that the request was valid... everything was fine and life moved on.\n\nIn your case, you're defrauding the bank... so matters - if it comes to that - probably won't go so smoothly.
