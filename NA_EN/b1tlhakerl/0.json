In fact, 3 people continually harassed her, and said there was nothing she could do about it, and that they would report her. When she asked why, they said, &quot;For being a homosexual.&quot; 30 days later, these 3 bullies remain un-banned, and my friend, despite never using vulgarity or name calling, has received a 2-week ban. When she asked customer support, they gave her an automated reply. Riot, once again, your system has failed. The bullies were right, they can get you banned, and they succeeded. Glad I am now moving on to Heroes of the Storm, where the employees actually read each report, and Blizzard doesn&#039;t ban the victims. In fact, Blizzard doesn&#039;t even get involved unless it&#039;s an extreme circumstance, which this would definitely qualify as. Riot, at this point, it&#039;s not laziness, you are just **evil**.","replies":[{"poster":"I Kill Commies","date":"2015-04-07T07:06:30.474+0000","up_votes":104,"down_votes":17,"body":"You don't get a 2 week ban for being reported in one of your games.

There's no way your friend got a 2 week ban because people false reported her in 1 game, absolutely no way.\n\nEDIT: Don't you think it's overboard calling Riot **evil**? No matter how shitty you think their reporting system is, I find it hard to justify it as being evil. Do you even know the definition of that word?
