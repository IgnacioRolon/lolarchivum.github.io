I do want to help with your issue though, it sounds pretty stressful!  This might be happening due to a security setting that's blocking your game files from updating, so it's getting stuck at 0.  As your first step, I recommend going over every step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to help troubleshoot this.  If you're unable to access the support page or our site, then there might be a stricter setting completely blocking you off.  \n\nIf that's the case, send us an email instead via support@riotgames.com.
