They are working on a hotfix ASAP, but there is a temporary work around to get this solved:\n\n\n1. Un-pin League of Legends from your task bar.\n\n2. Repair the game by clicking the question mark icon to the top right of the patcher. Select \"Repair\" and let the patcher scan and repair corrupt game files. When the process is completed, you'll see the orange \"Launch\" button.\n\n3. Let us know the results.\n\nhttp://eune.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/template_lcu_changelog_1280x720.jpg?itok=uV6zjzTq","replies":[{"poster":"BlackDesert","date":"2016-07-27T17:23:15.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"iam running currently windows 10 i dont have LoL binned in my task bar  and i cant reach repair coz the game doesnt even open after the logo it just says bugsplatrc resource dll not found","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-27T17:37:35.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thought you meant you couldn't start a match.\n\n[Visit Heimy’s Workshop to patch these issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues)\n\n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/c5/Heimerdinger_PiltoverCustomsSkin_old.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120118075912","replies":[{"poster":"BlackDesert","date":"2016-07-27T17:52:03.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah i meant LoL itself QQ","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-27T17:55:55.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like you might have corrupt game files that's causing your game and patcher to not load properly.
