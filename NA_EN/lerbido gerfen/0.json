I had just played an ascension game 20-30 min ago, and there was no problem. Though after that game i queued up for normal draft mode, got my role, picked my champ, everything fine ( well except for the masteries bug), but then as my client launched the game ( as the loading screen was going to show up), my screen viewed for me \" Input not supported\" . It's a first time too. \n For more details, i had played ascension, then i queued up for another, but has some IRL business so i dodged, then i reopened client and ( another client bug, it showed up as black and stuck at the left up corner of the screen, not a first time ) so i restarted ( worked for me before and fixed it). Then, came the viewing bug. I could still type and told my team about the problem, and they remaked. The game has just been remade 5 min before i typed this post , probably less. \n I would love a fast response !\n EDIT 1 : Entered practice tool, still up.\n EDIT 2 : restarted computer, the problem is still there.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-19T21:11:00.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clarify, your game loads up alright but you're not able to actually see anything?\n\nIf this is the case, we can try a quick and simple fix first. Once the game loads and you get the input not supported error, try hitting alt + enter to switch the game from fullscreen to windowed and see if that fixes it.\n\nIf that doesn't seem to work, something may be going wrong with your configuration file. You can force your config to reset itself by deleting the current one, which can be found by following=> C:/Riot Games --> League of Legends --> Config.\n\nLet me know if this help!","replies":[{"poster":"Lerbido Gerfen","date":"2017-03-19T23:01:50.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the client fixed it by himself, so i think it's was PC-related.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lerbido Gerfen","date":"2017-03-19T23:00:55.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Euh, i actually just opened a game and it showed up just fine!
