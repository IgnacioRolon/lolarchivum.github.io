We're an amateur team who've had some success on the tournament circuits, and are looking to improve our play further until \"some success\" becomes \"total domination\". We've recently had some roster shifts, and now we're looking for a new support. Our current roster is: UltimateTrianer, VS Dreamweaver, VS brubie (myself), and Grumpyvegan. We also have a sister team who we scrim with regularly.\r\n\r\nWhat we're looking for:\r\n\r\nA diamond, or upper platinum support, preferably with previous team experience and a mature disposition. A versatile champion pool is recommended, though we're not outright mandating any. There's plenty of time to improve, so we're focusing on people who have an attitude we like, and if you do demonstrate toxicity, you will be immediately removed from consideration or from the roster.\r\nWe play most weekdays starting at 7PST(PM) until ~10 or 11 PST, and often at various times on the weekend.\r\n\r\nApplication:\r\n\r\nIGN:\r\nCurrent Ranking:\r\nAge:\r\nTime Zone:\r\nChampion Pool:\r\nAbout Yourself:\r\nWhat would you bring to our team?\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me IG, at VS brubie. WE will be hosting try-outs tonight.","replies":[{"poster":"I Only Hook","date":"2014-11-25T08:14:20.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: I Only Hook\nCurrent Ranking: Diamond 5\nAge: 17\nTime Zone: Pacific (California)\n\nChampion: I can play all supports, but my main champions are Thresh, Morgana, Blitzcrank, and Leona\n\nAbout Yourself: I've played on several serious teams before, I'm pretty much flexible enough to fit whatever schedule the team has.
