I've play against him is 2 games recently and he can literally stand in lane and auto minions while I auto him and still sustain.  I forget who I was in the first game but I just got out of a game where I was Morgana vs Trundle.  He would just stand there in my W and take it.  We were even on CS, He had one kill on me, but he was building armor.  I would cast W to clear wave and auto attack him too, he would stand in my W to clear his wave and still come out like I wasn't even there hitting him.  His first MR item was GA which I think was his 3rd or 4th item.  This is his build order best i can remember.  {{item:3748}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3065}} \nabout 15mins into the game when I had solid AP Items I was baffled that he would just stand there and not just melt.  I heard Morg W got a nurf recently but it was mind blowing how effortlessly he could stay in lane.  He wouldn't even side step my W...  SMH.  Anyways please look into it.  Thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-26T21:44:38.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The correct section of the boards for concepts of skins for champions would be [Concepts & Creations.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper of Tanks","date":"2016-07-26T22:59:05.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, I am level 1, why ar'ent the boards available for all levels?
