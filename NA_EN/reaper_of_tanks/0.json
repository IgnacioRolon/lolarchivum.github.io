It actually doesn't do anything else to your account or cause you to have some kind of demerit.  It's totally fine to agree and keep playing until then.

This will help you learn and grow until you reach 30!  Some other players may also be new and not necessarily know some things, like you can't unlock smite until level 10.  This is a great time to help each other out and shed some light, let him know why that would be a struggle or if he can help!\n\nIf it seems like another player is just being mean, you can silence him by typing /mute playername.  After a game, use the reporting tool on the post-game screen.  This will help us prioritize who we look at!","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper of Tanks","date":"2016-07-29T19:07:35.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok...so be the bigger person\n\n\nand ONE MORE THING!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cmqxe6P4Ms\n\nif someone types a lane in lobby faster than you, does that mean they get it and you fill or should go into this bidding war?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T20:29:00.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw, that was such a good show!

I don't know when it unlocks but I prefer using normal draft pick because I'm more likely to get my preffered spot, and even if I don't get my first choice, I'll still get a place I'd rather be in.  Draft has a primary and secondary roll selection which I enjoy.  Try doing that to avoid that kind of issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Iageri","date":"2016-07-30T02:12:45.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">please update my board profile so i can post this bug\n\nHaving similar problem.","replies":[]}]}
