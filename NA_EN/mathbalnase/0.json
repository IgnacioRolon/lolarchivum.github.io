It definitely _seems_ to me like something I should be able to report, as it is an open public admission of behaviour contrary to the Summoner&#039;s Code, but very clearly does not qualify under any of the categories in the boards&#039; report function.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does the rest of the community respond to posts/threads like the one I mention?  How do they think we _should_ be responding?\r\n\r\nRioters&#039; perspectives?

While you can still report them through the Boards, there could be a lack of context for our moderators to get the full scenario.\n\nThe best way to reach out about handling a player engaging in these types of edge case negative behaviors is through a support ticket where you can fully detail out the situation at hand. It'll be escalated into my queue where I can assist you out further and investigate more thoroughly.","replies":[{"poster":"1greathero","date":"2015-08-26T23:46:54.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lets play a numbers game there are 70 million players in NA 200,000 players where \"punished for their behavior\" so less then 1% are ever punished for feeding being toxic racial slurs or being trolls big improvement riot :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2015-08-28T03:19:08.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Op I was just thinking that not long ago, I even said something to the effect that if you are bold enough to admit it here then why doesn't anyone check into it.

Yeah can anyone help me with that part ...this is not a joke is it somewhere on the boards ( or do I somehow have to find it in-game ) ?","replies":[{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-08-28T15:12:19.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top of the page, 'support', beside 'merchandise'.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThatToxicTroll","date":"2015-09-05T16:22:24.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The {{champion:48}}s thirst is quenched by your {{item:3070}} s","replies":[]},{"poster":"teddy bear mamas","date":"2015-08-31T22:33:30.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Potato","replies":[]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2015-08-28T17:01:06.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron Von Zeri","date":"2015-08-26T02:06:43.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Rioters...I'm a humble player and I'm not even sure if I should be telling you this here but I needed to let you know my thoughts on the report system.  First of all...I understand how the report system works and I understand that the community are the ones that participate in the tribunal for review.  I personally have no issues with this method, but I believe I'm speaking for myself and many others here when I say what I'm about to say. \n\nI do NOT believe that the threat of \"Reporting\" a player for misconduct is drilled in hard enough, nowadays majority of players take it for a joke and continue with this unacceptable behavior.  In fact most player who spend money on the game believe that because they spent money, that they are somehow \"Immune\" to being punished for their actions.  I really think that this needs to be looked at.  Too many games have I been in where people are just outright making fun of the games Report system and are making fun of YOU, at RIOT Games.  THIS raises a cause of concern for me and I'm certain that some players agree with me, may not be alot as they are few people like me that play this game, but I honestly believe that something drastic NEEDS to be done about these types of players and I stress that word \"NEED.\"  I'm not just talking little curse words or simple acts of misconduct, I'm talking about players that openly flaunt the games authority system and the threat of being Reported. THEY DON'T CARE!  I know that you guys are trying to make the community a better place and honestly I've meet some kind and very helpful individuals that I play with almost everyday.  \n\nSomething NEEDS to be done, something BIG and DRASTIC in order to stop this foolishness from happening.  The thought of being reported at all should deter people from behaving like they are, but it doesn't. I understand that you should have a freedom to play and I'm all for it, but they are somethings that should NOT be allowed to continue.  To who ever RIOT employee is reading this I would like to entice a possible brand new reporting system or simply revamp the old one, made it big and loud.  Also you should definitely add a \"Unsportsmanlike Conduct\" to report players, because honestly there are cases where people SHOULD be reported for showing massive amounts of Unsportsmanlike Conduct and get away with it, because there is NO report system for it.  \n\nFor Example: I was in a game a few days ago when I started to get some lagg. Like up in the 400 ping lagg.  I couldn't do anything, expect try to farm under my turret. Yet the enemy Lee Sin would constantly and purposely gank my lagg then taunt me afterwards. Ofcourse I got pissed off about it and I called him out on it.  Ofcourse he continued with his routine and continued to annoy me. This continued until I eventually blew up on him, to which it had no effect. Yes! I admit I got angry enough to break a few rules of Conduct myself.  He was being a toxic player through the use of abusing the sportsmanship aspect of the game, which is one of the key reasons WHY I play League.  I love the game for that reason and I hate to see it being destroyed be people like him. So there NEEDS to be a feature implemented to deal with players like him. I reported him and his teammates after the match as they all saw fit to join in on the \"Fun\" of bullying a lagging player.  This is downright disgraceful and honestly unacceptable.  It's bad enough that people do NOT respect you methods for dealing with their \"kind\" enough to even care, so something needs to be done about that.  \n\n*Sigh* I apologize for writing such a long letter of both complaint and tribunal stuff.  But I needed to let you guys know, it's time for the \"Fun\" of toxic players to end. COMPLETELY!\n\n\nWith utmost respect and humbleness...\nZerichan...","replies":[]}]}
