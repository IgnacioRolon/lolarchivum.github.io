I wanted to say that  I apologise for my mistakes as I’ve having bad games and lots of pressure from my family. I apologise for flaming and I did not mean whatever I said. please note that this will be my last chance if I ever get reported my account will get permanently banned\r\nAs I’m a league of legends fan and it saddens my heart to get banned without knowing what to do. I will never do stupid things ever again and i wont talk in all chat or team chat ever again. It just hurts that my team keeps feeding and blaming me for all the troubble caused in the team. I get uppset when they ban people that aren't meant to be banned. Anyways i hope u can forgive me and give me one last chance to get my account back. I really do want to play your awesome game. And i have spent lots of money on it cause i really enjoy playing it.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-01T00:35:11.753+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are one step behind the situation: you already had that last chance where one more report meant a permaban, and you blew it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-08-31T23:12:27.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had chances.
