My account was also banned.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"So I get reported a lot because I often get \"attempting to reconnect\" in game and can't move at all. My team doesn't believe me and blames my computer or internet because it's only me lagging. Well after troubleshooting with League of Legends for a month and by myself for over a year, my ISP has made it clear that lag stems is because of League of Legends servers. My account was banned until the end of the month. Any of my \"toxicity\" has been me defending myself from people cussing me out due to me being unable to play the game for any that's out there.\r\n\r\nAfter going through every single troubleshooting step possible, they ended with telling me it's my ISP due to traceroutes.\r\n\r\nThis is the letter from my ISP:\r\n\r\nThanks again for your patience.\r\n\r\nOur network team concluded their research and found that the destination you’re attempting to reach is to the League of Legends game server. \r\n\r\nWe have had customers in the past bring this issue to our attention, and League of Legends (LoL) and their Engineers have admitted that they’re working on this issue. The core problem is that League of Legends only has a single West Coast server. Based off of internet reviews and forums (as well as reports we’ve received), they’ve had floods of complaints from Central and East Coast customers about high latency (relative to the low latency required by the game). \r\nMost games provide multiple servers in various locations, such as East, West, and/or Central geographies to provide customers the best opportunity to have the lowest latency possible. Unfortunately “LoL” does not. \r\n\r\n· Here is a forum thread started by LoL customers complaining specifically about the lack of an East Coast server. Their own Network admin admits that they are working on the problem. This thread is 1036 pages long and was started back in 2012 and has posts as recent as 9 hours ago. http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=44035159#44035159\r\n\r\no “LoL Network Engineer”: This is something definitely on our radar, and has been a talking point in our various teams at Riot for quite some time now. We're currently working on ways to make matchmaking more intelligent so this can be possible. In the meantime, we're working at optimising the connectivity from the East Coast to our servers on the West. This stuff does take time - but I promise we're constantly working in ALL of our regions on making it the best experience for everybody.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe below graph is a constant ping test to your cable modem for the past 12 hours. It does not show any packet-loss or abnormal latency which indicates the issue you’re experiencing is not an issue that is being found in the immediate Suddenlink network. \r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/yCK64rN \r\n\r\nThis graph is a constant ping to the destination server (216.52.255.12). The connection all the way to hop 6 is flawless and shows no packet-loss or latency up to that point. However, between hops 6 and 7 there are intermittent spikes of high latency. This hop is between the GTT network and the Internap network that hosts League of Legends and is unfortunately outside of Suddenlink’s control. \r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/ITjeAgs","replies":[{"poster":"YazDawg","date":"2014-09-18T02:09:20.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot in denial before I gave them my ISP's response:\n\nWell I hate to say they are wrong...but they are unarguably incorrect.

Hopefully we can clear that up.  In order for ISP's to get your connection to servers all across the United States and all around the world, they need to utilize backbone ISP's, most commonly Level3, Internap, and Telia.\n\nThese backbone ISP's receive connections from the local ISP and then take your connection along their routes until your connection reaches our servers.   Local ISP's do not have the infrastructure to get your connection to go wherever it needs to go and therefore has to contract out to backbone ISP's to take your connection the rest of the way.  In this instance, since your lag exists on Level3, we enter a gray area of responsibility.  \n\nTechnically, this is not the fault of your ISP, as their lines are stable and provide no Packet Loss. Yet, since they utilize Level3's network to get your connection to where it needs to go, there is a certain level of responsibility.   Level3 is not directly controlled by Riot and while we can work with them to provide more stable service for our players, we cannot make changes to their network.  \n\nAt the end of the day, there is Packet Loss on your connection, which is causing the connection issues when you play League of Legends.  However, this is not the fault of our Servers, but the Network Path being provided by your ISP and the backbone provider.  \n\nThe argument used by your ISP is a separate issue entirely regarding server location.  Server Location does cause variations in ping, but should not be a factor at all when it comes to Packet Loss on the network path itself.\n\nLastly, regarding your suspension, keep in mind that you were not suspended on your main account due to issues with your connection.  You were manually suspended by our Player Behavior team for 2 weeks because your actions in-game are among the most toxic in the League of Legends community.  Specifically excessive swearing and severe verbal abuse.  If you would like more information regarding your suspension, make sure that you reach out to our Player Behavior team by [submitting a ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/tickets/new)!","replies":[{"poster":"PaigeMoon","date":"2014-09-18T03:51:24.441+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All in all, with a game this huge, with hundreds of thousands of daily players, traffic is incredibly high on the NA server; and you guys only have ONE in the WEST. This is completely unfair to your consumers residing in areas outside of the west on the NA server. Although the connection issue is a gray area, it is Riot's responsibility to make sure that ALL regions receive the best experience for everyone. Well, the NA servers... in the country you are based in, are completely unplayable for non-western customers. Whether your solution is to upgrade the ONE server you have, or create more servers to lesson traffic, I don't know. What I do know is the fact that for this long Riot  has refused to help EVERYONE have the BEST EXPERIENCE, well, Riot must be the absolute greediest and uncaring company towards its consumers that I have ever seen.

Unfortunately that means I will never ever be able to play League of Legends without lagging out.\n\nI disagree that I am toxic to the point of deserving a ban and will be submitting a ticket. I am mostly honored during my games excluding the games that I have lag issues beyond my control where 9 players report me in mass. Taking swear words or \"verbal abuse\" out of context is not a conclusive way to determine if a player is toxic and worthy of being banned for 2 weeks. As a courtesy to players I inform them when they are being reported, unfortunately this also results in an increase of reporting me in order to retaliate.
