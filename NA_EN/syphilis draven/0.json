After numerous tickets and conversations with bots I have come to the conclusion to just make a discussion. So lets start from the beginning. Obviously you cant just get permanently banned instantly. So I have received i believe two 2 week bans prior to the perma ban. Those 2 week bans were definetly deserved, like you could see that i was toxic. And i obviously understand that this was bad and i deserved it. After  those bans I had changed and have tried (succesfully) to just stop being toxic. Now didnt i just say i was perma banned? Kinda paradoxic right? I was smart enough to stop flaming but i still got perma banned. I have said this in tickets, and riot actually admitted that the chat logs were NOT pretty much toxic. They use the excuse \"negativity\" something interpretable. I first thought that this was just some bad joke but they are serious. Let me explain to you what they meant by that. See you get banned ingame for being a bad person in general. Calling people names, telling people to commit suicide or just general obvious bad behavior. Also trolling and intentional feeding and afking is also part of the roster on how to get banned in league. Now, I believe that i got banned because the mixture of my past bans and spam reports of teammates. I also believe that there were no humans involved in the permanent suspension. Which I also find a bit crazy, because they are out here banning people because of bot reports and no actual investigation of the logs. I just find it funny that even the riot employee thought that the logs werent actually that bad and he saw that i was just having a bad day playing league. They just insisted on the fact that i have been banned in the past which should not have any infuence in future reports to be honest. Now I will show you the chat logs and I will comment on every sent message. Please bare with me.\r\n\r\nAnd also if you think that I am lying or that I edited the chat logs, you can gladly ask a riot employee or maybe someone is seeing this that has access to my account can show you the original chat logs. Here we go! By the way, excuse me for my name, its super cringy and i was a tyler1 fanboy back in the day. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere we are with Game 1:\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nSyphilis Draven: harvest dark\r\nSyphilis Draven: no its good\r\nSyphilis Draven: twitch jgl is not good\r\nSyphilis Draven: dunno what to do\r\nSyphilis Draven: i cant go in properly\r\nSyphilis Draven: because twitch is there 24/7\r\nSyphilis Draven: i get no ganks even tho he is pushed 24/7\r\nSyphilis Draven: dunno\r\nSyphilis Draven: i realise that\r\nSyphilis Draven: 197 to 70\r\nSyphilis Draven: it hurts doesnt it?=\r\nSyphilis Draven: we can basically ff\r\nSyphilis Draven: i deal 80 dmg to garen\r\nSyphilis Draven: ez maybe 100\r\nSyphilis Draven: i dont scale vs garen LOL\r\nSyphilis Draven: i scale at minute 50\r\nSyphilis Draven: i got filled btw\r\nSyphilis Draven: you really think this game lasts long enough\r\nSyphilis Draven: for me to scale with 70 farm\r\nSyphilis Draven: thats naive\r\nSyphilis Draven: got ganked btw\r\nSyphilis Draven: what are you coming top for\r\nSyphilis Draven: they will oneshot you now\r\nSyphilis Draven: very smart to come now\r\nSyphilis Draven: when they kill you\r\nSyphilis Draven: what else should i do?\r\nSyphilis Draven: feed 0/10\r\nSyphilis Draven: ?\r\nSyphilis Draven: that happens when i dont talk\r\nSyphilis Draven: just useless lol\r\nSyphilis Draven: need help top?\r\nSyphilis Draven: reeeeely\r\nSyphilis Draven: why didnt you ping that when he was actually squishy at lvl 6?\r\nSyphilis Draven: because you only care when you lose huh\r\nSyphilis Draven: so you can blame me for your loss even tho you could've prevented it\r\nSyphilis Draven: i am playing\r\nSyphilis Draven: you will\r\nSyphilis Draven: trust\r\nSyphilis Draven: you will type report jax\r\nSyphilis Draven: when our nexus explodes\r\nSyphilis Draven: you dont mute me lol\r\nSyphilis Draven: lying\r\nSyphilis Draven: got my first item\r\nSyphilis Draven: 20 minutes past\r\nSyphilis Draven: LOL\r\nSyphilis Draven: thats not english\r\nSyphilis Draven: not properly used\r\nSyphilis Draven: report me for talking\r\nSyphilis Draven: ill be banned HARD\r\nSyphilis Draven: and didnt i call it\r\nSyphilis Draven: that you will say report jax\r\nSyphilis Draven: because of your loss\r\nSyphilis Draven: that will result on you being salty\r\nSyphilis Draven: that you didnt help out by ganking once\r\nSyphilis Draven: ey i am doing what i can do\r\nSyphilis Draven: turn on auto attack and go to bed\r\nSyphilis Draven: nasty crit\r\nSyphilis Draven: baron or nash?\r\nSyphilis Draven: kappa\r\nSyphilis Draven: how much is that garen skin?\r\nSyphilis Draven: 1350?\r\nSyphilis Draven: aw crap\r\nSyphilis Draven: I have 1k rp left\r\nSyphilis Draven: would buy him\r\nSyphilis Draven: really?\r\nSyphilis Draven: maan\r\nSyphilis Draven: that skin is dope man\r\nSyphilis Draven: some giant anime sword and jade utl\r\nSyphilis Draven: will buy it next year\r\nSyphilis Draven: you just had to come once and kill him\r\nSyphilis Draven: told u\r\n\r\nSo after Game 1 I havent said anything negative towards my teammate, i just stated the fact that the game was lost and could have been won, if top lane would have gotten some support. Literally thats all i said. Explaining why we lose is toxic i guess and bannable. \r\n\r\nHere we go with Game 2!\r\n\r\nGame 2\r\nPre-Game\r\nSyphilis Draven: its ok\r\nSyphilis Draven: can i pick you alistar please?\r\nSyphilis Draven: does vayne have all?\r\nSyphilis Draven: i want to counterpick\r\nSyphilis Draven: we'll be fine\r\nSyphilis Draven: as if i want that champ that you dont have\r\nSyphilis Draven: yeah\r\nSyphilis Draven: you got darius?\r\nSyphilis Draven: any of you two?\r\nSyphilis Draven: ali?\r\nSyphilis Draven: jax?\r\nSyphilis Draven: nice\r\nSyphilis Draven: you go ahead and pick alistar\r\nSyphilis Draven: ill swap with vayne\r\nSyphilis Draven: yes\r\nSyphilis Draven: pls\r\nSyphilis Draven: so you are playing your problems away\r\nSyphilis Draven: how can people be sad after they get dumped\r\nSyphilis Draven: i mean\r\nSyphilis Draven: you knew one day you will break up\r\nSyphilis Draven: so yeha\r\n\r\nPre-Game 2 was literally nothing, just a little smalltalk about somebody evidently getting dumped. And suggesting support picks. Super toxic according to riot.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn-Game\r\nSyphilis Draven: lvl 2 gank top\r\nSyphilis Draven: i kinda need a gank\r\nSyphilis Draven: udyr ruined it all\r\nSyphilis Draven: dont care\r\nSyphilis Draven: LOL\r\nSyphilis Draven: it doesnt matter\r\nSyphilis Draven: he cant help me\r\nSyphilis Draven: so we lost this\r\nSyphilis Draven: because of him leaving\r\nSyphilis Draven: same\r\nSyphilis Draven: even if i wasnt losing\r\nSyphilis Draven: we cant really win\r\nSyphilis Draven: I dont like the fact that shaco might not even get a punishment\r\nSyphilis Draven: exactly\r\nSyphilis Draven: i mean\r\nSyphilis Draven: there are 2 ways rito can make afkers balanced\r\nSyphilis Draven: either ban them instantly\r\nSyphilis Draven: or just reduce the lp loss of the other 4 poor bastards\r\nSyphilis Draven: what are you spamming spanish for jeeez\r\nSyphilis Draven: just get shaco banned pls\r\nSyphilis Draven: 9 reports\r\nSyphilis Draven: also fill out a complaint to the riot page\r\nSyphilis Draven: bg\r\n\r\nHere we are after being ingame in game 2 and nothing happened. To be exact, we had a flaming shaco that went afk. And me and my team got really frustrated about that and we just ranted a bit about afk people. I havent said anything bad to my teammates that actually tried to play the game here, I was just annoyed that the loss counts as if the game was played fair and square. It is ironic that i have stated in the chat that shaco wont get a punishment for afking and i am sure to this day he didnt get anything. \r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Game\r\nSyphilis Draven: can you guys shut the fuck u\r\nSyphilis Draven: and report shaco\r\nSyphilis Draven: jeeeez\r\nSyphilis Draven: wtf\r\nSyphilis Draven: spanish people are so weird\r\nSyphilis Draven: what are you caps locking for\r\nSyphilis Draven: just report and move on\r\nSyphilis Draven: LOL\r\nSyphilis Draven: are angry\r\nSyphilis Draven: and i can understand that\r\nSyphilis Draven: i am pissed aswell man\r\n\r\nNow post game in the launcher i must admit that saying \"shut the fuck up\" to the enemy team was not nice. They were speaking spanish and all i wanted was them to report shaco. But i really should have asked nicely. But you guys know how you feel after someone ruins your games. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Resume, I hope alot of people will see this. AND IF ANYONE here thinks that the ban was deserved, then i have lost all hopes for this game and this company. If you think i was editing, just ask a riot employee to view this discussion. I am done for the day. Take care guys.","replies":[]}
