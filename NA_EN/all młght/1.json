Get out of here.\n\nWhat do you mean he doesn’t have to play carefully, he is a short range, squishy, no mobility burst caster. \n\nThat stun is his only tool to survive, the moment it isn’t up, he is utterly defenseless and because he isn’t say Ryze who has a lot of defensive options with his itemization with his build, he can’t afford to build defense options.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beacon Academy","date":"2018-05-26T23:29:57.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A person who plays a spam mage wouldn't understand that there are threat zones associated with the range of each spell.\n\nIf Veigar uses his cage willy nilly, not only is it a waste of mana, but his threat zone is massively reduced and he has to watch his back because everything else in his kit either can miss or requires everything else to land to be effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-05-27T01:30:15.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao, Ryze doesn't have to play carefully.

Ryze's root cannot be.\n\nAnd, no, you do not need to land your Q. It's already landed. You just have to press the fucking button to make it hit.

If the stun results in a WQR with a possible Auto, then its not accurate to say that all he has to do is E then R.  \n\nI recommend you take a little time and play veigar yourself, I checked your accounts champion history and I don't see any matches with you playing as him. A good way to learn counterplay for a champion is to play that champion, you can first hand see how other players deal with your kit, and experience what makes lane phase more of a struggle for you. You also  will get a better feel for his abilitys ranges and that can help you keep a mental tab of if your in danger or not in future games when your playing him, you also get the feel for when he is and is not actively a threat and a better understanding of when, where, and why he powerspikes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-05-26T20:28:04.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, his ult is an execution, therefore under all cicumstances he must poke you first. \nits AoE, but only the edge actually stuns you, and his skillshots aren't big enough to fill it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-26T19:45:38.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annoying, yes.\n\nOP, no.
