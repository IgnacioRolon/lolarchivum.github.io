It&#039;s just CRAZY how I have to literally torture myself playing Ryze at 300% effort but I wont EVER be able to do as much as other champions. No, I will not play other champions because I think Ryze is very good. I am not the best myself but a fucking Silver 1 Shaco main with 61% win rate OVER 100 GAMES. I have nearly 400 games on Ryze at 46% win rate and I&#039;m Gold 4. And actually, I only climbed into Gold by playing Twisted Fate. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m just fucking tired of it man, I&#039;m tired of assassins being good and when they&#039;re bad they just split push and farm up and one shot. I&#039;m tired of bruisers being good, they just split push if behind and are able to 1v1 anyone. I&#039;m tired of Kai&#039;sa being good patch after patch. She&#039;s nearly played every single FUCKING GAME in LCS. Rageblade nerfs didn&#039;t do anything to her or Master Yi. \r\n\r\nEveryone complains about tank meta but have you seen a tank split push or one shot squishies? Tank meta enforced team work but this fucking shit we are in now allows people to play League of Legends: RPG game. I can SHIT on my laner but the second I leave my tower to help my team, boom my tower is gone because it&#039;s squishy, boom my laner gets ahead in CS, boom they split push until THEY FEEL like fighting. Huge issue with Irelia is she fights when she feels like it. She can engage whenever because her CD are low, she has damage mitigation, healing, conqueror, damage amplification etc. When I play Ryze  I literally have to wait for them to use their abilities before going in but with everything being such low CD I can&#039;t do shit.\r\n\r\nThanks Riot, you&#039;ve made Ryze unplayable and undesirable in LCS games. He&#039;s not even being picked anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Vyntrius","date":"2018-07-01T21:37:16.587+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that surprised me is that this guy has a 60 percent win rate in 289 games with his top 2 champs, yet his overall win rate is only 51 percent.

What I am saying is that assassins have dual purposes in games inherently in the nature of their kits. Zed has his blink ability or whatever to gap close to get to squishy or get away. If he's doing bad, he can just split push and farm up. You can't send one person to deal with Zed since he naturally can deal with 1 person. You have to send 2 or 3 people to deal with him, relieving so much pressure somewhere else on the map.\n\nPeople wanted solo carrying in the game, they definitely got it. AD assassins can feed but then split push to win, that is the opposite of solo carrying.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-07-01T21:46:34.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze is already up for his [next rework](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/iBepJ3XW-ryze-changes-that-riot-didnt-want-you-to-see).

It's just not worth discussing the balance of champions in low elo because the players in these elos don't understand nearly enough about the game itself; and as a result, they don't have the information necessary in evaluating champion strength.\n\nIt's not to say that low elo players *can't* discuss balance, but it has to be understood that A) personal experience in these elos is worthless, and B) low elo examples (winrates, play rate, etc.) don't matter.\n\nThere is perhaps a discussion about champions that tend to steamroll in low elo (the Yi effect), but that is typically a separate issue from balance, and more to do with champion design.\n\nAnd Ryze is legitimately a fairly strong champion; but as unfortunate as it may be, low elo players don't perform well on him. Whereas champions like Garen work quite well in low elo but fall off heavily in the highest ratings, Ryze is the opposite; he can be an absolute monster in high tier play such as challenger, but falls off heavily in use outside of the top 200 mid players. \n\nI want to reiterate that you can't use your gold level experience on Ryze when discussing balance; you just don't understand enough about the game for that discussion to be useful. Instead, you can discuss the extremely high skill cap of Ryze, and that you'd like to see him dumbed down so that lower elo players can be effective with the champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Śhunpo","date":"2018-07-03T09:34:00.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not fun.
