It&#039;s really a shame since each song really fit the spell. Only hearing the Q music really feels weird for her identity since it&#039;s all about music and its many abilities (in the Valoranian/LoL universe). \n\nHere&#039;s what her music is for Q, which is the only song you hear in-game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qPfCKv0csU&amp;amp;t=1m57s\n Here&#039;s what her music should sound like for her W. It&#039;s characterized by the higher pitched &quot;healing&quot; sound resonating throughout: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qPfCKv0csU&amp;amp;t=3m21s\n Here&#039;s what her music should sound like for her E. It&#039;s definitely a lot faster and has a more frantic vibe:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qPfCKv0csU&amp;amp;t=4m57s\n\nHere&#039;s a video of me using all her spells along with the music afterwards: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkBwLWCkqiI \nThe music&#039;s a little quiet but if you listen closely you can hear that they all sound the same as the first segment of the video parts I showed.\n\nI know it&#039;s not *the* most important thing but it does play a key part in how Sona feels to play for me.\n\nSteps to recreate:\n1. Begin any game mode and pick Sona in champion select.\n2. When in-game, reach level three, adding one point into a different ability each level.\n3. Cast Hymn of Valor, or the ability on the Q key for Sona.\n4. Listen to the style of the melody that plays afterwards for about one minute.\n5. Repeat steps three and four for Aria of Perseverance, Sona&#039;s W ability, and Song of Celerity, Sona&#039;s E ability.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-25T18:03:07.290+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mid Sona (is mid Sona still viable?

I'll be very thankful If you do\n\nIt's a little bug on Anivia's wall for the BF Skin. I've already asked a friend to do this experiment for me cause i don't have the skin :C  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/zkPzfSy\n\nIt LOOKS like the BF skin wall it's smaller but THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE.. just the Visual model its not well adjusted .. \nIt's a visual error on the wall... Even when the black frost wall looks smaller... it is not, but it need a FIX.\n\nthere is also a thread on this... but i think it's pretty abandoned to be an actual error  :C\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/lIPxyOQT-classic-anivia-wall-size-lvl-1-is-larger-than-blackfrost-skin#oembed-content-modal\n\n Thanks for all the effort you put on your job : )","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-27T18:55:25.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo!
