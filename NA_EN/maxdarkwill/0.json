From few accounts. \r\nI am sick and tired of this . I tried to play 4 games In all four hell broke loose. Its a damn joke. I honestly wish I had a refund for all the money I wasted on this damn game. I was young and stupid to even bother playing this. only thing it did was messing the hell out of my head.This game has the worst gaming community i've ever seen . I haven't been in a single match without at least 4 players being complete jerks. The balance is probably one of the biggest flaws. The grind during the 5 years were like beating a dead horse 24/7. I honestly think that Call of dutie's community was better than the league community . only thing was good was the artist community. \r\n\r\nAlot of potential was in this game but its a complete waste of space. I'd rather go play on heroes of the storm with one friend as 2 player character than having a bad mood after having bad games on league. \r\n\r\nIf riot reads these well I'll just say this.\r\n\r\nSee that money enveloppe with my name on it . Yeah hand it over.","replies":[{"poster":"RemIsAmazing","date":"2017-03-28T03:46:29.813+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"people like you are the reason the community is bad. you complain about everything like its riots fault that you suck and can't help your teammates win.  people get frustrated when they don't understand why they are losing, learn to take advantage of that instead of getting mad too.","replies":[{"poster":"MaxDarkwill","date":"2017-03-28T03:53:27.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Oh believe me after 5 years I'm done trying to see how \"balance\" the game is . stop sucking their toes","replies":[{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2017-03-28T12:36:12.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens that people lose interest in a game after a long time. You're just at this point where you're not interested in it anymore, but inside of you, you wish you were.\nYou played for 5 seasons. You experienced many different meta and you liked one more than the other. You met some very skilled players over the years and some very bad palyers. \nThe meta now doesn't suit everyone and that is frustrating for some people. So frustrating that people blame their teams, because they're used to a different meta and have met different, better teammates.\n\nIt is not your fault, I can understand your feelings. Before league, I played many other games, some games I even played for 5 years+.\nI hope I won't get these feelings in league, as I really love this game.\n\nGood luck on your way","replies":[{"poster":"MaxDarkwill","date":"2017-03-28T12:38:12.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Finally someone that has a bit of a brain.

There's probably not a lot I could say to make that would actually make you feel better, but I wanted to let you know I saw your message. It feels awful to have just one game where people get on your nerves or don't share your desire to win, and to have a run of bad games can be majorly tilting. So I don't think anyone can blame you for the feelings you're experiencing right now.\n\nWhatever game you decide to play, I wanted to share some things I've heard and like to think about when the grind is getting to me:\n\n* After the game, I'm still the same person I was when I loaded in. I'll be just as valuable to my team the next game. I'm just as valuable as a person, and I'm just as deserving of appreciation as before my teammate flamed me in all-chat.\n* If I go into every game with a specific goal—meaning something I want to improve on that isn't just \"win the game\"— and I stay focused on that, then even if I lose I have something to feel accomplished about. I'm a support main, so I go into every game thinking \"I want to have the most wards placed of nay player in this game.\" Then, after every game, win or lose, I go to the stats and see whether I met my goal. That's something I'm completely in control of, and if someone wants to flame me for getting caught out, that's fine, because I wasn't focusing on positioning that game. If the other team tells me I'm bad, what do they know? They can't see my damn wards (like, literally). [Oh, and the mute button is my best friend at times like these.]\n* The most important thing is that I try as hard as I can. If I gave my best effort, there may be failure sometimes, but there is no reason to feel ashamed.\n\nI hope that helps and that in whatever game you play you have a better experience with your teammates. Peace.","replies":[{"poster":"InTheory","date":"2017-03-29T09:47:14.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"JGamerStyle","date":"2017-03-29T11:11:17.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, you are the toxic one here...
