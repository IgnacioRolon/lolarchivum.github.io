I'd consider Tahm's music to be Dark Folky Delta Blues (with demonic undertones).There are many types of Blues, but the River King piece was heavily inspired by Delta Blues. If you want the real deal for that Delta sound check out Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Mississippi Fred McDowell. If you want to hear amazing modern blues guitar check out Stevie Ray Vaughan! Let me know if you want more :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2015-07-20T20:40:53.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which is the darkest?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2015-07-21T19:43:05.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reikken, if you're looking for dark check out \"When The Lights Go Out\" by The Black Keys, and \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" by Son House (That one always gives me chills).","replies":[{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2015-07-21T19:44:33.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot TreblMuffin,realm=NA,application-id=aAJWt2b9,discussion-id=W9GYUEEt,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-21T19:43:05.418+0000)\n>\n> Reikken, if you're looking for dark check out \"When The Lights Go Out\" by The Black Keys, and \"Grinnin' In Your Face\" by Son House (That one always gives me chills).\n\nRecently you guys released some league music (which had some of the champs login tune) I was wondering if you guys are going to do that again for some champs had some great music that wasn't included (yasou for example) and Tahms is pretty great as well!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-07-20T18:26:35.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not quite the same, but the Bastion OST has a lot of the folksy, bluesy guitar sound in it as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrCookiepants","date":"2015-07-20T20:14:50.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot please respond to this thread: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/8IATmjz1-513-info-needed-failed-to-connect-unable-to-connect-to-the-server-please-check-your-network","replies":[]}]}
