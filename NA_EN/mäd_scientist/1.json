After the match I was level 29 with some exp already plus the exp gained from playing the match....which confused me because I didn't get the notification or capsule for leveling up. Feels Bad Man, just trying to grind BE, can someone help me with this? Oh also I also tried to make a ticket on the support site and it says I needed to login to make a ticket, but I was already logged in and when I try to login in using the link it gives me it says error.
