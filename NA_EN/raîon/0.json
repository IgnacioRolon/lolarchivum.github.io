But not enough to give immediate 14 days ban (thats usually reserved for hate speec, encouraging suicide, threats and stuff like that). And if u didnt have chat restrictions in the past, that means 2 things: Either you edited these chat logs to remove things that escalated u to 14 days ban (which is pointless as Riot wouldnt look at forum logs to check if your ban is correct, but would look at actual chat logs that thye have) or there is third game which u refused to show (which again is pointless cause Riot also have chat logs from that and they would look at it to see why it was 14 days ban). \n\nOverall:\n\n-Either you hid 3rd game\n-Either you edited your chat logs\n-Either you had 25 games chat restriction before this punishment","replies":[{"poster":"Raîon","date":"2017-07-15T09:57:59.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=archerno1,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VziX9xm4,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-07-15T09:28:21.793+0000)\n>\n> Well these chat logs are toxic and enough to warant punishment.
