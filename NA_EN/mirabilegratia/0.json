Sadly the URL for the HTTP sever league uses is entitled riotgames. I've done some digging on my own and have discovered that bypassing my router's keyword filter will be close to impossible. My question is this \"Is it at all possible to utilize the IP from lol's server instead of its URL during the connection process?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T00:16:26.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, that really sucks! I haven't heard of this issue before.\n\nSince you've nailed this down to being an issue with your router's filtering, you'll either want to reach out to the manufacturer or your ISP (if they provided it) for assistance with removing the filter for \"game\". \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"MirabileGratia","date":"2016-11-17T14:24:51.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I posted my question I've done even more research on this topic, and discovered that a large amount of companies and parents use this method to shut league addicts out of league. Unfortunately for me this happened by mistake and wasn't intentionally meant to keep the lol client from launching. As amazing as it would be to simply remove the filter that power sadly is beyond my reach. That being said I did manage to find a way around the filter by simply using an ethernet cable instead of my wifi connection.Thanks for taking your time to help me, and I hope you have an incredible thanksgiving too!","replies":[]}]}]}
