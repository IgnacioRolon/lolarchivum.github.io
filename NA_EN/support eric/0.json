I feel like I did not deserve a 10 game chat restriction and my honor (Level 4) to be reset to locked level 1. Here is what my in client reform card says. It is one game and one game only. \r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/89df5110593b3a0d4ee87bec73782ae6\r\n\r\nIn this game I was flamed by two of my team mates, and once they began I immediately muted them. I did not argue or berate them, at one point in the game the enemy team mentioned something and I asked which of the two were flaming in all chat now after already being toxic in team chat. At this point someone on the enemy team began being toxic as well, so I muted them as well. I’m the end game screen they all posted to report me so I get “banned for being bad”. To which I responded with “REPORT ME? :’)))” but again nothing toxic. \r\nCan someone explain to me why I got punished, was it because they mass reported me after flaming me in game ? Riot support says I was berating and arguing in my chat logs, but I fail to see where I was.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-14T15:14:15.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive aggressiveness and asking for reports in the form of harassment.  \n\nThe reform card only shows you 1-5 recent games as examples of unacceptable behavior,  doesn't mean you were punished for 1 game alone. You can ask support how many recent games you were validly reported in and they'll give you a bigger picture (though still not the full picture).\n\nFor the question on whether it was deserved,  most report askers don't know that asking for reports can be considered as harassment against others, so they keep doing the same thing over many many games. At the end, the consistent mild toxicity gets them punished.

You're essentially using it to one-up them in the argument.\n\nReports are not there so you can win an argument.

While that is still not the full picture of why you got punished, it was better than nothing. I wonder if things have changed since the 10 yr anniversary and support only tells you what is in your reform card or maybe you are incorrectly interpreting what they are saying.\n\nIf you have removed chat since your chat restriction and have played more than 20 games, I wouldn't be suprised that Riot support couldn't pull more chatlogs within your recent history.
