One thing that *might* explain what you saw is that if Malphite is hit with a CC during his ult, the CC will be applied **after** the ult completes.  So what could have happened is malphite ults a little short (aka it won't hit the ahri), ahri charms in that direction.  Malphite will then travel just in front of Ahri (without landing the ult), and then be charmed.\n\nIf this isn't the case, a video or more specific steps to help reproduce this issue would certainly help!","replies":[{"poster":"VENOCHU","date":"2014-12-12T12:28:47.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Afic,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=kpjtpTjE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2014-12-10T22:57:39.857+0000)\n> Thanks for taking the time to post.  \n> \n> I was actually unable to reproduce this issue.

Here you can also see that charm interrupts right at the start of my dash rather than after, and I barely move a centimeter.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2014-12-10T19:36:55.208+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a rock.
