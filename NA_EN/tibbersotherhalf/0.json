On my phone so hope I can grammar good. But anyways, I had this problem in the last Sona game I played as well(it was about a week or two ago IIRC), except in addition she also wasn't using her DJ VO at all. Im afraid I can't remember if she started with her normal VO or it just switched to it midgame. However, the taunt/joke/laugh would play both VOs at once(IE her normal laugh would play on top of her wub laugh). Dunno if that helps, but I would like to see it fixed asap since she and Tahm are basically the only supports I play x3 I'll probably play a game later as her to see if I can recreate the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-28T22:05:04.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a couple reports of this, but we've been unable to come up with a solid reproduction of the issue. It doesn't appear to be something that happens often.
