Or well its not the FPS, its some kind of stuttering i get from 10 minutes, with as result at the end of the game 100fps and stutters very badly (starting with 230+fps). \r\n\r\nI had already contact with Nvidia and they cant find it out too. Vsync on seems beter but give me some delay. I have nearly tried all settings (Nvidia Inspector). Im hopeless and it is really getting annoying. \r\nIm playing on a laptop called Asus Rog GL-553VW, with a GTX960M, i7-6700HQ, 16GB ram. 2x 250gb SSD.  \r\n\r\nPs: Capping my frames on 60fps does really help my GPU to get less loaded and heated over time (no i dont have any temp issues at all). It is just feeling more stable when my Vsync is on but unplayable cuz of the delay there is or some weird kind of playing. \r\nI really really hope someone can help me because im struggling for a long time now (especially Soulstealer Vayne skin laggs very badly)\r\n\r\nGood evening all.","replies":[{"poster":"hotdamn1212","date":"2017-12-12T19:04:25.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not just the minions tho the shop drops the frames crazy too like to 75fps","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-12-11T21:48:37.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It is just feeling more stable when my Vsync is on but unplayable cuz of the delay there is or some weird kind of playing.\n\nAll in your head, vsync will not add more than around 10-20ms delay.\n\nMake sure you have triple buffering off.","replies":[{"poster":"Le ßaron","date":"2017-12-11T22:44:41.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LE72Ptub,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-12-11T21:48:37.999+0000)\n>\n> All in your head, vsync will not add more than around 10-20ms delay.\n> \n> Make sure you have triple buffering off.\n\nI wish it was that, for me its probably more  it really feels bad :S","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hotdamn1212","date":"2017-12-11T21:46:19.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same issues for the last two month with a gtx 1080 and 7820hk i-7 still no real answer ive been looking for the last two months reinstalled updated clean reinstalls ect ect  tried every setting nothing","replies":[{"poster":"Le ßaron","date":"2017-12-11T22:43:36.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=hotdamn1212,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LE72Ptub,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-11T21:46:19.674+0000)\n>\n> i have the same issues for the last two month with a gtx 1080 and 7820hk i-7 still no real answer ive been looking for the last two months reinstalled updated clean reinstalls ect ect  tried every setting nothing\n\nPff sounds bad man with a gtx1080..... dam. Hey maybe this willl fix a bit for you too; Uninstall all your drivers with DDU, then install the  manufactered Nvidia Driver u had when u had your laptop/pc new. Im checking it now and to be honest it helps me a bit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-12-11T21:51:06.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I myself had had problems with FPS drops on my Desktop, I just bought a new laptop and now its fine...\nRiot has said within the past week that its working on fixing these lag issues\nit has to do with Minions and some particles, the longer the game goes the worse it gets, im pretty sure it has something to do with invis particles not disapearing and it just adds up overtime.","replies":[{"poster":"Le ßaron","date":"2017-12-11T22:40:36.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oke nice, atleast a good thing that Riot is trying to fix it.
