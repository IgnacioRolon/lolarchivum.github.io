So it really matters on what would be a good concept for them that is something unique compared to all the other skins. Theater'theme may not fit well with Zyra and putting Jhin in a forest 'marksman' sort of shmick kind of feels like it would not work with him, at the very least with every skin outside of the really bad and lazy old ones (though some are still theme fitting), i tend to usually see them as What'if scenarios that also match the champion pretty well. Otherwise if Riot was super lazy they would of end up making a bunch of crappy ninja, pirate, 'death god', sports theme and atleast a dozen more champions in bunnygirl outfits then just Riven. Hell even the 'April Fools' costumes fit because:\n\n-Draven has such a ego he would gladly throw a giant head mask on himself and that would basically be a costume.\n-Maokai's meow'kai costume basically being his spin on the 'Definitely Not Skins' where its something so out of place, it just works.\n-Definitely Not skins work with the over'dramatic disguises where its so obvious that its them yet they might as well continue to 'deny' who they actually are.\n-Urf Kench because we know that crazy bayou'ish freaky fish'man will likely disguise himself even as a poodle to get a fantastic meal, no matter how out of place he looks. So makes sense with his URF costume that he might as well be dressing himself up as such a great icon to get 'showered with praise' (and food).\n\nTry posting a few ideas first before you throw up a silly poll just to get people thinking about some other ideas they can recite too.","replies":[{"poster":"Planty Raid ","date":"2016-12-23T00:41:25.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk I wanted to see what people thought since they both haven't gotten a skin in a while.
