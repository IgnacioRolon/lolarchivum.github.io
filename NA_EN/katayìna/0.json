In this case if 2 r trying to do this strat there's more risk as they fight at lower chances plus 2 g Kass means more strategy about economy and hp instead of just face rolling at 40 gold after krugs and start not losing hp at all. If riot is worried that this removes the only 1 g sorc in the game then just make tf cost 1 g and Kass 2 g as I think tf's power suits a 1g unit","replies":[{"poster":"Heroboy10","date":"2019-09-19T07:25:31.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin falls late game a lot even with 3 best items.
