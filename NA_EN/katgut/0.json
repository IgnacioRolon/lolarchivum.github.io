Heh, _suits._ \n\nThe core idea was to turn Tahm into a more bewhiskered, dapper gentleman than usual. I looked at white-tie dress and catfish for my main inspiration, and tried to incorporate an ornate, art nouveau inspired shell design for his markings. \nI designed this with a theoretical 750 RP price point in mind.\n\nI worked on this before the nifty Urf Kench skin was previewed on the PBE, now it's out I can see the blue skin colour I chose here is awkwardly similar! But instead of shelving the concept I thought I'd put it out there and share it for feedback. \nC&C very welcome! \n\nhttp://orig12.deviantart.net/4fbc/f/2016/067/b/c/gentleman_tahm_kench___skin_concept_by_fivetinsoldiers-d9udmax.png","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-03-10T04:49:45.678+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":1,"body":"I must say this is an ingenious illumination to ignite the imagination.

If the skin is cool where the light hits it we put some warmth into the shadows. If a material is black we'll make decisions about how to subtly colour it with greens, blues and browns. Generally putting a lot of rich colour, and multiple colours, into gradients. Particularly on skin where subsurface scattering can make the terminator point of light extremely saturated. Studying from photographs or classical paintings can really help wrap your head around colour!","replies":[{"poster":"Katgut","date":"2016-03-14T06:22:17.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate the pointers, it's great to hear what I can work on to improve.
