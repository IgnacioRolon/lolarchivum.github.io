The problem is NOT that you removed the connection on the Universe page.\n\nNo, the problem is that you fail to acknowledge there WAS a reason, and that's only one new sign in a very long list that, from my limited knowledge and point of view, I can only interpret as you not recognizing/understanding the value in the old lore. And to be clear, I have full confidence that you and your team are able to create great new stories. But I don't want that to be at the expense of the slightly-less-great older stories.\n\nI could elaborate on that, and I'll gladly do if you ask me to, but at this point, I think brevity and clarity are more important, so I'll stop there for today.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-09-07T02:05:31.247+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"These are all valid comments, and I'm aware that there is pain when stuff gets changed. That sucks.\n\nThermalKitten and I have been quite open about this - we want to minimise player pain when we update lore. We have tried a few approaches, and we have more in mind that we'd like to try out. However... some old lore is going to change, completely. The Journals and the Institute, Summoner's Rift being a location, all of that is most definitely not canon anymore, and we can't cling to it when we plan out new stuff. That's not even our call to make, actually.\n\n(Did you get a chance to watch the Narrative panel from PAX West, this last weekend? We actually touch on this, and some players said it helped them to understand why we had to change certain elements of the old lore.)\n\nI would always pledge that we don't change stuff just for the sake of it. It HAS to be for a reason, and now we can be a little more open because Riot has adopted a more open stance on this. We are working towards other products beyond League, and the old lore and really early versions of champions don't really fit within that.\n\nHowever (again!) we can and should try to honour the themes of older lore, where possible and appropriate. With reference to Zed and Syndra, those champions are simply not in the same mindset or looking to the same goals right now, at all. In fact, they'd probably be enemies, if they met today - Zed would likely see Syndra as a dangerous liability for their homeland. But as I said, they might come to be closer, or linked in some way, as stories develop. Time will tell, and then we might give them some sort of formal link on Universe.\n\nI'm looking at the lore with the fresh eyes of someone who HASN'T been following it for years - that's one of the reasons I was hired. I saw a player ask why Syndra and Zed were linked, and I could find no lore-based reason, in the up-to-date lore, that we consider canon. So we made the call to change it. Nothing more sinister than that. :-)\n\nWe want to make this lore fun and accessible for new players, as well as keeping true to the characters and places that existing players love.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-09-07T03:54:11.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is a lot going on here.\n\nYou said you were hired (in part) **because** you didn't follow the old lore for years. Well, I was, which means I **also** followed all the reasoning of why the great Institute of War/Summoner's Rift retcon was necessary. And I agreed with that, I'm not absolutely opposed to any change! You painted yourself into a corner, so sacrifice had to be made, and I'm fine with that.\n\nWhat I wish for, though, is that **the retcons are minimized**. I understand the paradigm shift, and I understand that such a big shift will have more repercussions down the line, but I'd hope that you and Riot would consider everything not directly related to the IoW/SR as still canon, and would make a conscious effort to keep as much of it as possible.\n\nBut from what I can see, that's not your current stance at all. From what I can see, everything that was published before the great retcon is obsolete, even if it's not directly related to what was actually retcon'ed, and treated as mere inspiration, as tonal indications, as a mood board, but definitely not as factual canon. And even that last post of yours, which is supposed to reassure me that there is \"nothing sinister\", only reinforce that impression. Still, thank you for posting it, I prefer to clearly know where we stand, even if I don't like it.\n\nSo in the end, I guess the core of the problem is that: **what does Riot actually consider canon?**\n\n**Before today**, I thought that your official stance was \"anything that doesn't involve the Institute of War is still canon\", and that was a stance I totally agreed with (and I was angry because what you actually published didn't fit that stance).\n**Now** I get the feeling that it's more \"nothing published before the great retcon is canon, we'll try to keep it if it fits well, but everything is open for change\".\n\nBut can we get a clear and official answer from you? What does Riot actually consider canon? (And no, I didn't see the Pax panel.)\n\n_____\n\nSo yeah, the important part is above. If you're short on time, you can stop here and ignore everything below, but I have a couple more unconnected points I want to get off my chest.\n\n1) To elaborate a bit, what really irks me is that the old lore wasn't really developed much. There was precious little of it, and most of it was vague, coming from blatantly unreliable narrators. Overall, it wasn't setting many constraints. So I wouldn't pretend to do your job for you, I only have my perspective as a reader, but it really feels like it should be reasonably easy to abide by what I thought was the official stance. To integrate most of it in the new canon. To expand upon it and build around it, and to change a few details here and there where needed, and pretend it's due to unreliable sources. In that context, I'm ready to stretch my suspension of disbelief a bit, even if the old and new versions don't perfectly fit together.\nIn short, I feel like I wasn't wishing for much, and I'm still let down.\n\n2) In a certain way, it feels like instead of starting from the old lore and trying to minimize the changes, you're starting from scratch and trying to maximize the overlap with the old version, which in theory should lead to a similar result, but in practice makes the new version feel \"off\".\n\n3) Seriously, this discussion would have never happened if, after I said \"they were marked as friend because they were politically aligned, and I think that's still the case today\" you had directly answered with \"No it's not, Zed would probably see her as a liability for Ionia now\", instead of a joke about Bruce Willis hairstyle.\nMaybe that's not a bad thing, maybe we needed to have that discussion, but damn, actually answering my point was just as short and quick as making that joke... -_-\n\n4) To be very clear, I don't give a damn about Zed and Syndra specifically. I care about the status of the old lore as a whole. What prompted me to post in that thread was not an attachment to Zed or Syndra, it was you acting as if there never was a good reason in the first place, instead of saying that the reason had changed due to the newly released lore. \"Things never existed\" is very different from \"Things changed\".","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-09-07T21:06:45.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really busy today, but I wanted you to know that I read all of your post and I want to continue the conversation in a timely fashion. :-)\n\nI think there is a slight misunderstanding here, though - we've never said \"This never existed\" about anything in the lore/canon, nor do we intend to throw everything out from before 2014.\n\nHowever... what we are (I hope, consistently) saying is *\"Anything that is not currently on Universe or the Runeterra map is not canon, and we are not guaranteeing that it will be restored in any way\"*. If something is not player-facing on either of those two locations right now, please don't hold your breath for it to return, because it might not, ever.\n\n(However, MY personal pain point is that some stuff that existed before November last year is also wobbly in terms of how \"canon\" it is, and we just haven't gotten around to removing or updating it yet. It sucks that I am only really allowed to vaguely wave my hand and say \"We're getting to it\", but I can't even highlight which parts of the lore it would include.)\n\nThe only other option was to completely remove everything that wasn't considered canon last November, and then add stuff back in as we worked on it. I still feel that would have been a worse experience for players, worldwide...\n\nBut anything published since November 2017, you can have much higher confidence that we won't change it anytime soon. And lots of other stuff that is older also will not be changing. But some stuff will.
