I had an idea with a friend of mine to literally int. I was dying but I got many kills and assists as well. He was only dying. After some time I'm playing a game with 3 premades other than me and one of us bans Mordekaiser while I told them I wanted to play Morde, just to trigger me. So it was only fair I trigger him as well and I inted like shit. 1/25. ONCE IN ABOUT 700 GAMES. And after 5 minutes I get a message telling me I got the ban. FOR 1 GAME. My friend (XtoxeusX, Yasuo) did exactly the same but stole a phew kills with a bit less deaths and he got nothing (His score might imply he didn't int but believe me he did). And to everyone who says it was because of prior bad behavior and such it literally said it was only because of my last game. And now I wonder. I only destroyed a 20-minute-match for 1 person (The Talon, our midlaner). The other team had fun of course. My premades didn't bother and the ones who reported me did it to laugh at me getting banned. Now if that 1 match where 1 person didn't have fun was enough for 10 fucking months of playing almost every day to get to lvl 4 honor (checkpoint 2) to be deleted that's up to Riot and they say it was. Plus a 14-day ban from playing but that's simply annoying, nothing more. \r\n\r\nGame my friend inted: https://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUN1/2226927777/226988541?tab=overview\r\n\r\nGame I inted:\r\nhttps://matchhistory.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/EUN1/2229617914/226988541?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"ChrastGR","date":"2019-07-21T12:37:47.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":17,"body":"I love this community.
