It really isn't funny anymore\n\nThis are my Top 10 reasons why :\n\n1. Class- Updates\nAre to 90% failure. \nAfter the class updates, this game is even more unbalanced . The game was nearly  balanced in Season 5, then the juggernauts came in.\nYou ruined my favorite Champion Leblanc, to a clunky annoying to play and play against, delay mage.\n\n2. Champions like Blitz still exist\nYou can Dodge 99 Hooks, he can stay 0/20  and still win the game when you aren't able to dodge one of his hooks in late game.\nHow does Designs like this still exist.\n\n3. Champs who can influence other teammates\n{{champion:432}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:34}} \nWhy is it still possible to cage in other teammates or what ever? i had so many bard ults on me while i was chasing enemies so they could escape.\nHow is this still a thing I really don't understand\n\n4. Ranked Match making after a win rate. Oh ... what a surprise ? the next 7 games i get matched with : first timers, people who have 2 different divions, people who play a champ they never play meanwhile my enemie team has 4 Level 7 Masterie Mains.  Now I'm back where  I started or even lower. \nAnd its ALWAYS like that. \n\n5.  Unsatisfying Report-Function\nSo basically the enemie calls a wonderful \"Gg easy\" at the end even though it was a very close match, it doesn't matter if I report him because:\nhe doesn't get banned anyway or when (what never happens ) I don'T even notice because no one tolds me.\nSometimes I think is the report function even usefull at all ?\n\n6. Why can a only Zeal Yasuo easily outdamage and kill me as a Bf-Sword. Pickaxe, Zeal Jinx using heal.\n\n7. Why can Darius outdamage so much Champions and still be Full Tank like a Shen ?\n\n8. Caitlyn having 5 Traps\nThis is the most forced update to make a Champ viable I have ever seen. 5 Traps are just way too much\n\n9. Towers are way too weak.  Tower dives in early stages are no problem anymore.\n\n10.  Balancing the game around Lcs more than about the real players.\nThe only thing this game is alive is the amount of player playing it, not stupid LCS. How long do you need to notice ? \n\nWell was still fun the other 4 Seasons\n\ni could find many other reasons too .. maybe later","replies":[{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-08-16T07:15:51.841+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with everything except #3 and #8","replies":[{"poster":"RaptureRage","date":"2017-08-16T07:19:17.537+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"so you think its good when your teammates can influence your playstyle and you cant do something against it ?","replies":[{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-08-16T08:06:01.584+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trolls are going to be trolls.","replies":[{"poster":"InstaPoppy","date":"2017-08-16T13:52:41.394+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mechanics that influence team mates are fine if they are rare imo, they are very cool and unique and i don't feel like they negatively impact very often unless the players are actually doing their best to troll.

It plays a lot more like how League use to play, but not like season 5, more like season 2 or 3. \n\nIt will take some time to get use to, and some of the \"items\" (they actually use cards) are gated and need to be unlocked, but for the most part the unlocked cards tend to be side-grades not upgrades, so lacking them doesn't hurt your chance to win or anything. \n\nAtm they don't have a massive champion pool, so unlike learning 80+ champions you would've had to learn about back in season 2, there's only about 30.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-08-16T16:08:33.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RaptureRage,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UOxBrrfI,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-08-16T07:09:51.351+0000)\n>\n> I never thought I would do that because this game is so addicting, but Season 7 was the reason for me to stop this game. It really isn&amp;#039;t funny anymore\n> \n> This are my Top 10 reasons why :\n> \n> 1. Class- Updates\n> Are to 90% failure. \n> After the class updates, this game is even more unbalanced . The game was nearly  balanced in Season 5, then the juggernauts came in.\n> You ruined my favorite Champion Leblanc, to a clunky annoying to play and play against, delay mage.\n> \n> 2. Champions like Blitz still exist\n> You can Dodge 99 Hooks, he can stay 0/20  and still win the game when you aren&amp;#039;t able to dodge one of his hooks in late game.\n> How does Designs like this still exist.\n> \n> 3. Champs who can influence other teammates\n> {{champion:432}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:34}} \n> Why is it still possible to cage in other teammates or what ever? i had so many bard ults on me while i was chasing enemies so they could escape.\n> How is this still a thing I really don&amp;#039;t understand\n> \n> 4. Ranked Match making after a win rate. Oh ... what a surprise ? the next 7 games i get matched with : first timers, people who have 2 different divions, people who play a champ they never play meanwhile my enemie team has 4 Level 7 Masterie Mains.  Now I&amp;#039;m back where  I started or even lower. \n> And its ALWAYS like that. \n> \n> 5.  Unsatisfying Report-Function\n> So basically the enemie calls a wonderful &amp;quot;Gg easy&amp;quot; at the end even though it was a very close match, it doesn&amp;#039;t matter if I report him because:\n> he doesn&amp;#039;t get banned anyway or when (what never happens ) I don&amp;#039;T even notice because no one tolds me.\n> Sometimes I think is the report function even usefull at all ?\n> \n> 6. Why can a only Zeal Yasuo easily outdamage and kill me as a Bf-Sword. Pickaxe, Zeal Jinx using heal.\n> \n> 7. Why can Darius outdamage so much Champions and still be Full Tank like a Shen ?\n> \n> 8. Caitlyn having 5 Traps\n> This is the most forced update to make a Champ viable I have ever seen. 5 Traps are just way too much\n> \n> 9. Towers are way too weak.  Tower dives in early stages are no problem anymore.\n> \n> 10.  Balancing the game around Lcs more than about the real players.\n> The only thing this game is alive is the amount of player playing it, not stupid LCS. How long do you need to notice ? \n> \n> Well was still fun the other 4 Seasons\n> \n> i could find many other reasons too .. maybe later\n\nWent ahead and fixed the title for you (deinstalled to uninstalled).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nymzo","date":"2017-08-16T14:54:08.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RaptureRage,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UOxBrrfI,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-08-16T07:09:51.351+0000)\n>\n\n> 2.
