She's so strong in lane phase that experienced players who can avoid being ganked largely don't suffer from being forced off resources. That win rate for experienced players had a direct correlation to her strength against most meta lane matchups and her oppressive early game in a meta that is dominated by fast games and snowball strategies. Her win rate would suffer if the meta changed and game times increased or if Mage top laners become vogue again.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T21:19:33.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea last time i played vs her i played nunu top and won \n\nsooo","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-09-25T21:24:15.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pkGV9tqE,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2016-09-25T21:19:33.629+0000)\n>\n> yea last time i played vs her i played nunu top and won \n> \n> sooo\n\nWell nunu has some things in his kit that negate what Ill does to gain advantages in lane. Just consuming a minion completely negates any of her poke. So nunu doesn't need to worry about her damage out put as much as many other meta top laners. Hes also got poke himself that does massive damage and can't be dodged by ill. Nunu SHOULD win trades vs ill, since neither has massive early burst and the advantages are built up over time and series of trades as opposed to a single all in. In most match ups ill just needs to land one skill shot and thats it, the enemy laner is now perma zoned off of farm for fear of being all inned and killed. Nunu doesn't have that fear against ill to the same degree.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T21:25:50.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow you didnt call me a no talent scrub troll who knows nothing about the game for me saying i play nunu top \n\n\ni also support nunu still","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-09-25T21:52:34.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pkGV9tqE,comment-id=00010001000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-25T21:25:50.641+0000)\n>\n> wow you didnt call me a no talent scrub troll who knows nothing about the game for me saying i play nunu top \n> \n> \n> i also support nunu still\n\nOh yeah, forgot that part, my bad.\n\nNot talent troll scrub!\n\nHappy now?\n\n=P","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T21:54:28.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually i think if you can do well on these so called simple outdated champs shows that you have to be creative in how you use the kits so you can get the most out of them compared to at an over loaded kit that dashes all over the place and call that being out playing someone","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-09-25T22:04:13.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pkGV9tqE,comment-id=0001000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-25T21:54:28.208+0000)\n>\n> actually i think if you can do well on these so called simple outdated champs shows that you have to be creative in how you use the kits so you can get the most out of them compared to at an over loaded kit that dashes all over the place and call that being out playing someone\n\nNah, yasuo's kit ain't overloaded dude.
