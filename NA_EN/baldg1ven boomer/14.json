Good for you, bud. Proud of you. Just so you realize since you seem to be a monkey who has never played Yasuo, his Q is on less than a 1s cooldown with 1 item and boots, which means that he has a spammable, no cooldown knockup that is freely up almost constantly. His W blocks FULL ULTIMATE ABILITIES and some champions ENTIRE KITS. His E is extremely reliable as waves are on specific timers, and easy to predict, and his ultimate is one of the most ridiculously overloaded abilities in the game. A reliable 20s cooldown hard disable that is able to be proc'ed by any knockup at a tower and a half range that not only bursts, but gives massive penetration, A FULL SHIELD, and a reset.\n\nIt's pretty sad when even professional players say that Yasuo is braindead and that you don't outplay a Yasuo, you let him outplay himself.
