If we take a look at item purchases [globally](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/items) you&#039;d see the first popular AP item is a {{item:3285}} at 11.0%, followed by {{item:3157}} at 10.6% and {{item:3165}} at 8.2% and if we take a look at shoes {{item:3020}} is the second most popular at 19.5%.\n\nOut of all the AP items a Morello and Sorc shoes which reduces more than HALF your MR will be bought 27.7% of games GLOBALLY.\n\nLudens, Morello and Sorc shoes 11% + 8.6% + 19.5% account for 39.1% of purchases GLOBALLY.\nAn average level 10 squishy at 20 mins will have 34 MR, you&#039;re literally playing the game as if you have 1 MR.\n\nWhen is this going to be addressed?","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2019-02-06T17:39:26.175+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{item:1057}} Negates 1600g worth of flat pen and then some.\n\nLuden's is a bigger problem, tbh.
