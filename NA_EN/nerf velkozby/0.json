They dont even care that theyre being flamed, they just know they can get people banned if they have enough people on their side.\n\nHere you see a guy who was probably being flamed first which is another problem with the reviewing. You only see what HE said.. nothing that the \"Lee\" guy or anybody said to him. Which was most likely tilting.\n\nWith that said he tilted and went off talking a bunch of shit himself. Yea dude you said enough to get chat restricted at least, like I have done myself many times. But the problem is that the system is pro-mob, as in if enough people come together to click that report on you, it doesnt matter if they were a premade and they incited you all game until u finally exploded. You're the only one getting the penalty because its all run by an automated bot. (no matter what the riot reps and goons say, the bot runs the show and the real riot rep that reviews it, IF you decide to challenge it, only sees what you wrote and could give two fucks about what else was said in the chat.)\n\nIts like being teased on the street by a couple of vandals and then when u finally decide to knock one of them out, you're the bad guy.\n\nps. Asking people to repeatedly \"report that guy\" usually will get people to want to report you. Unless the dude ure talking about is clearly an Ahoe.","replies":[{"poster":"IntegratedShadow","date":"2018-12-16T07:48:50.248+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legit, it doesn't matter what the other person said to instigate the OP flaming.  They're not the ones under review in this particular instance, the OP is.  If the OP and/or anyone else reported the Lee, he'll be getting reviewed as well and if he's on his final warning as the OP was, he'll get perma-banned too.  \n\nAnd I disagree with your example given.  The vandals are breaking the law, but knocking one of them out is assault, which is still breaking the law.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  We've all heard that before.  \n\nIt doesn't matter who \"struck\" first, striking is reportable, and if you've already been given warnings, you should just mute and move on.  \n\nAlso, banning a champion that a player is hovering is not griefing, unless they clearly state it in an obvious way.
