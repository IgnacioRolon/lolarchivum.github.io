I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for an overview of what's going on.  The results will also give some troubleshooting steps specific to your issue, which should get this fixed up.

Up until a couple of days ago I was constantly 45 ms. \n\nI went on twitch to watch GoodGuyGary and noticed his ping which was constantly 41 ms had jumped to 48, Central Florida, Check his past broadcasts and compare it to his newest from tonight.\n\nOut of curiosity I logged on and sure enough I'm also affected. Went from a constant 45 ms as of a couple days ago to now 56-57 ms constant.\n\nSomething is definitely wrong, at least in Florida.\n\nAnd no the hurricane hasn't gotten here yet! ;-p\n\nPlease look into this. Thanks!\n\nThis reminds me of pre server migration which when I started playing I was in the 70s ms and it slowly crept up to 120 ms over the years pre migration. I really hope this isn't the road we are headed towards again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-10-12T00:45:16.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much the same problem. I went from 80-90 to 130-150. Ran through all the connection guide, tried some other non-riot stuff and got a few changes but nothing really brings it back down. When i ping the server its actually saying 90. When I was at 80-90 it was 10-20 off and pinging at 60-70 in cmd but now the difference is a whole 40-50 ms and this is only on League, streams, other games and such still run perfectly at their usual ping (60-90 depending on their servers)\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"yinho7","date":"2016-10-04T17:34:59.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have high ping my ping has been sky rocketing today and I just got dcd as I ulted on sion and when i came back from being dcd i still had the weird camera movement that his ult gets and it wouldnt go away","replies":[]}]}
