I really value good teamwork, one of the reasons I enjoy playing League so much. In the 2 games I was reported in the arguments started from my teammates being toxic by saying someone was \"inting\" when whoever died just made a simple mistake or saying that they purposely don't want to help the team. It can be very frustrating and somewhat tilting to see teammates talk like that, so I took it upon myself to let said teammates know they were being toxic and ruining the game for others. They apparently reported me and the system picked up my logs as being \"negative\". \n\nIt was very disappointing to have Honor rewards stripped when I have otherwise been a very honorable player throughout my years of playing League, I even have the Santa Baron icon for what it's worth. My point being, if a player like me has years of a honorable record but happens to get caught by the system when he was having a bad day for two games, that doesn't sound like a Honor system that rewards good behavior, but rather punishes those it catches without any consideration of their Honor.\n\nMy suggestions would be maybe something like a warning for high Honor players when they misbehave and get caught by the system. Or maybe just a 1 Honor level drop for people with higher Honor or a good history rather than an immediate drop to Honor level 0.\n\n_**Edit;**_\n\nI feel like some people missed my point in wanting to talk about the Honor system and not so much my specific situation, I was just providing some context. \n\nAlso not a great first experience on the boards to have my post downvoted out of visibility. I originally had a discussion with Player Support about this topic. I was told they can only provide context and not push my feedback anywhere but they pointed me towards the boards here if I was looking to have my feedback be seen and start a conversation.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-11-19T05:48:39.064+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ILL NASTY,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ItEqrl4P,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-11-19T04:45:25.362+0000)\n>\n> Honor system should take a players Honor into consideration before applying restrictions.\n\nIt already does. \n\nThe system punishes based on consistency x severity, meaning one can be punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity or many many games of mild toxicity. \n\nLet's have you understand the behavioral system a bit more. Think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nSo if you are consistently honorable,  then your toxicity meter will decrease and essentially you'll never get a punishment, as you never get past the punishment threshold. On the same token,  when you are consistently disruptive, you will eventually get punished.

I would propose that the fluctuations in a player's \"behavior tension level\" should be visible and reflected in a player's Honor. Clarity is good and it would serve a purpose to help players with good intentions stay on the right track.","replies":[{"poster":"Zira","date":"2019-11-20T00:56:15.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fair.

You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nLoL's Honor system rewards you with things like Honor, BE, and key fragments when it deems your behavior good. LoL's punishment system (the IFS, or Instant Feedback System) places a punishment on your account when it deems your behavior bad. Behaving well sometimes doesn't mean you behave well all the time. In this instance - and possibly others, since the IFS punishes based on severity and consistency, and the reform card doesn't necessarily display logs for every match where you were validly reported - you behaved poorly. Poor behavior is very impactful and thus carries a lot of weight with the IFS, so to regain Honor and avoid losing it you'll have to work on controlling your behavior. The IFS does forgive the occasional bad day, but if that kind of behavior becomes habitual, you might be greeted with a reform card telling you to rein it in, or with a permaban message if the temporary punishments haven't worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-11-19T06:43:12.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand where you are coming from, but I can't fully support it.

I believe chat is ment for communication to help win the game. IE, JG bot, JG on red, Top lane swap, mid play safe, etc. when you respond to toxic players its enabling there behavior. if everyone just ignores the player being toxic or flaming or just mute them all together the flaming player eventually will stop. and if they don't who cares you don't have to read it. enabling or responding can be just as bad being the flamer.
