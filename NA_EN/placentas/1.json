In the splash one of her legs is kicked up and we clearly see wheels/rollerblades on her feet. \r\n\r\nIdeally, I ask you put some rollerblades on those feet of hers or at the very least just put shoes on her in the splash art. It&#039;s straight up false advertising at this point and I personally don&#039;t want the skin if she doesn&#039;t have rollerblades. \r\n\r\nYou could even just make it a homeguard movement where she pops on some blades and rolls out of base. \r\n\r\nTldr; Why does Cyber Pop Zoe clearly have rollerblades in her splash art but not on her model?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-11-07T18:33:26.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Placentas, she rollerblades on her homeguard run and has a cool half-pipe recall animation. You'll see it when it's on PBE soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-11-07T19:39:29.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yooooooooooo!!!!\n\nThe best! So glad to hear the homeguard animation is her blading!\n\nI'm a rollerblade nerd so this has me so stoked since she's already an awesome champion imo. Keep up the awesome work guys! Sorry I should've waited for more reveal before complaining.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-11-07T22:40:24.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's so cool! I used to blade when I was younger. It reminds me of things like the movie Hackers and Jet Set Radio. I think she's going to be on pbe in an hour or so!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
