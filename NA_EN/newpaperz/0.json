I then had to wait for it to 'repair' the launcher as I waited there for quite a while. I sat there waiting for the launcher to be 'repaired' and then I waited for around eight minutes. I waited and waited until it finally finished. I then finally got the reconnect option and decided to reconnect. Once I reconnected my team was already 13 minutes in game and were losing due to my launcher needing a 'repair'. Now I suffer from a lower priority queue and am quite sad about it and personally feel like this is rather unfair on me. In conclusion Riot please remove me from the lower priority queue as I feel like I couldn't do anything about my connection and those 13 minutes my launcher made me wait. \n\nKind Regards, \nNewzpaperz","replies":[{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-05-23T18:39:41.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happened to me as well. The client said it encountered an error and reverted to a previous version. After it happened, it would take about 15 minutes for the client to launch again (it would be stuck with the logo). When it did launch, it would give the same message every time. I repaired and it did nothing. I had to completely uninstall and reinstall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-23T17:11:32.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really strange issue, I haven't heard of the patching forcing repairs post logging in and loading into a game.
