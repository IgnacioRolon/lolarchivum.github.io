The patcher is now scanning your game files to repair any bad files, which is a good thing.  \n\nYou can also check out our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) guide to go over steps towards tuning-up your software and drivers to make sure everything is covered.
