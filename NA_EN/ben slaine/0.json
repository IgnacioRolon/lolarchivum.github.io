It turns out that they were having some issues on their end with the codes either not going out or not working properly, so that would explain why so many people didn't show up for their matches. It looks like their entire website might be having problems now, because I can't actually get their page to pull up whatsoever from my end.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Slaine","date":"2017-07-23T03:12:23.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So this problem I experienced a bit yesterday and again today after a match disbanded.  Cannot ping, checking from NA or EU, both show 100% packet loss on ping.\n\nNow, https://builtwith.com/superleague.com says they have New Relic in use, so it should be a no brainer to find and fix the problem Can't imagine there's no alerting going on.\n\nAnyway, Can't see how I'll get 6 matches in given the past two day track record.","replies":[]}]}]}
