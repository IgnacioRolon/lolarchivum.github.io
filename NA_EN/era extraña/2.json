I'm not sure if it's because of my wifi or because I was running out of space on my LAptop","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T03:56:20.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't provide an exact time on how long it should take since that vastly depends on your network speed and disk write/read speed. I can say that you'll want to have about 10GB of free space to even install/patch League. The issues you've described sounds like they could be caused by a number of different things. First, I recommend you launch League as admin (right-click, *run as administrator*) before trying to patch. If you're still seeing the patching process hang at 33% or afterward, you'll want to ensure your network settings are configured for League, which you can do with our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). See, any issues after 33% are typically caused by an *unstable connection* to our patching servers, since your patcher is grabbing files from the servers at this point.\n\nPlease let me know if this resolved your issue. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Era Extraña","date":"2016-12-29T05:06:03.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright thank you for the info. I been trying to re download it for the past 2 weeks with 13 gb  so the space isn't the issue I guess but I will try the run as administrator like you would recommend. Thank you for your time","replies":[]}]}]}
