I'd strongly recommend finding a place to use a *wired connection* on campus or maybe a friend's house off of campus. Campus WiFi is rarely quick, especially with hundreds or thousands of others using the same network simultaneously.\n\nLet me know if you encounter further issues on another network.","replies":[{"poster":"Era Extraña","date":"2016-12-20T05:55:25.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright thank you I really appreciate the feedback, Ill be sure to go to a library or use my Home's wifi when I come back for Christmas break and ill be sure to leave enough space for it.","replies":[]}]}]}
