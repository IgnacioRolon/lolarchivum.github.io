I really hope riot can fix the servers so it can be playable on slower networks.\r\nHere is pretty much what I found.\r\nIT doesn't seems to be 100% your internet issue. I found out that even though I have a good enough internet connection, it seems to not work (most of the time). TO find out if it is really my internet problem, I decided to used cmd and ping the EUW server. Using Wifi, it is not the stablest thing on the planet. But I got readings between 20ms to 50ms. which is decent.\r\nBut I get 1000ms+ ping sometimes in-game. Right when that happens, I checked my internet, its working fine. I even managed to chat with friends through the client. I can chat with them and can see their replies no problem. IF the client also said trying to reconnect, then you will want to check the internet.\r\nAnd when cannot reconnect, it will show the popup saying unknown directx error, which is definitely not the case as My drivers are up-to-date. It mistaken connection error as driver errors? Is riot try to blame the problem elsewhere? \r\nAnd the problem only exist after certain patches. It worked fine before that.\r\nI just wanted to say, stop creating more problems. No one will complain if you stop creating more problems and bugs. \r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-15T22:41:29.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't look like we've had major EUW issues recently, nor can we improve our servers to help the connection of a slow network. That's not *quite* how the internet works. It sounds like your ISP might be running into some issues with packet loss with how you explained those pings spikes. Overall though, if your network is slow like you mentioned in the first sentence, we can't fix that on our end, but let's go ahead and check for that packet loss to be sure of what's going on. \n\nGrab some networks logs from one of those games that spiked up to 1000ms and let this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan it. Take a screenshot and post it here so I can take a look.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProblomaticRoot","date":"2017-10-15T22:05:11.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i actually agree with you there, im on the NA server, and was having the same problem after the 7.20 patch dropped a week ago for an entire week.\n\nStrangely enough, when the ticket i sent about the issure was answered,(this is by far weird enough to say it sounds like my old ISP all over again), the lag spikes and the crazy ping issues were lessening to the point of stopping completely over the next few days after the reply from riot themselves and not an automated reply.\n\nthe worst part it there new \"Lag Report Beta\", which doesnt help since i have no choice in using wifi and the score it gave me last month,out of 100, was 98... after the patch it the score was 68.\n\ni dont think their servers are just the problem, since every patch seems to bring a sort of memory leak with it to alot of random players.","replies":[]}]}
