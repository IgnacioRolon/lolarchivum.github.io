Everyone in the game thinks they know better than anyone else how to play, what to build, etc. \n\nThis.  While I hate generalizing, I've been playing for 3 years now fairly consistently and 85% of all of my games have at least 1-2 people that just act like complete jerks for no reason.  When I say no reason, I consider this to be acting like a jerk when everyone on the team has messed up multiple times including themselves, and is clearly losing as a team, yet these people find the one mistake someone else made and blames the loss on them, repeatedly telling the other team to report, and using all chat at all times to ridicule that person.  \n\nYes, all of this, in about 85% of my games over a 3 year period.  Now granted I'm going off of how people act on the LAN server too, which is where I play ranked since my ping is much better there, but I do play more consistently in normals on NA.\n\nThis, I think, is becoming a very, very large problem in the gaming community as a whole.  Most adults either just ignore people in the beginning of the game or brush things off if someone says something, and so it does not affect them as much.  However, I can see this type of behavior being downright traumatizing to 15-16 year old kids who are already struggling to have a good social life outside of league and the last thing they need is for some little prick to be calling them autistic or telling them to uninstall.\n\nThese players are being ridiculed basically because someone else can't admit their own mistakes and wants to throw someone else under the bus in front of 8 other people.  That goes back to another societal issue where people think they can do no wrong now and don't take responsibility for their own actions.\n\nSo when someone says it's okay for you to tell people when they are making a mistake, I just shake my head because I know that what the OP means is not what 85% of the gaming community is actually going to do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-06T05:15:08.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not your job to teach people, and at any rate they're not gonna learn anything through a few rushed remarks by some random stranger that might as well be the most clueless player ever as far as they know.
