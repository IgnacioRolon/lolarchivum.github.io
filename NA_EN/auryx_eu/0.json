I already supplied them with the network analysis, process list, network log etc all the required information.\r\n\r\nWhat responses do I get? \r\n\r\nBasic solutions like disabling firewall, sync windows clock, DISABLING IPv6, PUBLIC DNS and then ASKS AGAIN FOR THE SAME network analysis and stuff I already supplied.\r\n\r\nOk so I did those again.\r\n\r\nThen the player support specialist went on and for 7 days he keeps telling me to disable IPv6, switch to public DNS and ask AGAIN FOR THE SAME NETWORK ANALYSIS etc etc\r\n\r\nAll these despite doing what he told me in the first place but without effect and even making it worse.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-19T22:41:21.614+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Auryx!\n\nThere appears to be a fair amount of confusion that exists from reading your original post.  I want to take a moment to clarify:\n\nIf you are experiencing extremely high lag, disabling your IPv6 and switching to a Public DNS have been known to resolve these types of lag issues in the past, which is why these steps were provided to you!  Beyond this, asking for the same network information again is a two fold rationale:  \n\nOne reason is that we can check the logs to ensure that the steps were properly completed, and that there were no errors/issues.  \n\nAn additional reason is that your network configuration can change dramatically with taking basic troubleshooting steps such as disabling your IPv6 and switching to a Public DNS.  By re-running the logs after completing these steps, we can see exactly how your network configuration was affected by these steps, and what further steps we need to take in order to resolve your issue.\n\nFurthermore, I went ahead and performed an investigation to find your ticket.  After finding and reviewing it, you are correct in that the specialist repeatedly suggested the same step of switching to a Public DNS. This was done due to the fact that your logs repeatedly showed that this step was not completed.  In fairness however, you mentioned several times that changing to a Public DNS made your connection \"worse\".  This is EXTREMELY unusual, and such a step should not negatively affect your network in any way.  This strongly indicates that there is a fairly significant issue with your connection, if it becomes degraded by completing a change to a Public DNS.  \n\nGiven that you mentioned this issue typically occurs during peak hours, this strongly indicates an issue with the connection itself provided by the ISP.  I have talked with the tech specialist, and we will investigate this path to see if this is indeed the root cause.\n\nI am sincerely sorry for any aggravation or frustration you experienced in your ticket, and hopefully we can get this resolved ASAP!","replies":[{"poster":"Auryx EU","date":"2013-09-19T22:53:07.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, I'll continue to monitor the situation. For example today it was OK even during peak times, only some minor Attempting to reconnect that lasted 2-3 seconds at most.\n\nThe thing with the public DNS is that it makes the latency really unstable, it fluctuates a lot, getting lag spikes. \n\nAs I said I will continue to monitor the situation myself especially that the weekend is coming, trying to use WTFast during laggy periods to see it's truly a routing problem. I'll even try and contact my ISP to explain the situation.\n\nAgain thanks for the reply, it really meant a lot.","replies":[]}]}]}
