Sorry to break it to you, but Katarina took little to no skill to play before her rework. It was the same combo over and over again, with no real substance  to gameplay. She was a face roll champion and while I understand it's hard to accept that fact, it's very much true. Old Kat compared to new Kat, new Kat is far superior. She has way more outplay potential, she doesn't feel so linear and boring, she in my opinion can win a game much easier compared to old Kat, and overall can do more damage. The change was what she needed, and I love it. They changed her because she was unskilled, boring, and a cancer to the game. Now, she isn't. Everytime I see a Katarina main say they wished they had old Kata back, all I see is someone complaining they don't get to just face roll the keyboard anymore.","replies":[]}]}
