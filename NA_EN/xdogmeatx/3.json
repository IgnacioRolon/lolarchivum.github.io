I’m autistic and my friend group (also autistic) use it to describe things as relatable, calming, good, etc.  when we ask if a streamer is autistic, it’s done in an excited, hopeful manner (because hey they’re like us so relatable).  \n\nWhen non autistic people ask if someone is autistic, it’s at best neutral (genuine curiosity with no ill intent).  But it’s usually meant as an insult with them defining it as stupid.  Which is wrong and hurtful but unfortunately how much of the world views us.  Preferable to the r one tho.

How could that be seen as an insult?\n\njokes aside:\n\nin an ideal world, it would depend on the context, but currently, when people get offended over everything and focus more on what words were used than what was meant, you are better off staying away from words like that. And don´t forget that making jokes is not an excuse since you are only allowed to make jokes about non-controversial things because that´s how comedy apparently works. \n\nAnd afaik there are autists on the entire IQ spectrum.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2018-12-21T12:42:17.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"btw i didnt call anyone that im just questioning the word in game sometimes people would say \"dang u have autistic high iq\" ally says to ally after that ally does the triple aka the hard outplay.  so thats why im asking plus i didnt use such word just saying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2018-12-21T08:42:57.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that calling someone \"autistic\" is practically always an insult (See MegaLoBunny's comment below - that is the only time I have seen anyone to consider it can be used in positive way. Neutral way to use it is in medicine.) If you wish to call someone/thing smart, say he is smart. That is also shorter to type and thus faster to type during a heated match. It is also less often misunderstood - but anything can be misunderstood due to too much sarcasm in the air.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-12-20T20:52:00.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use it to describe a medically diagnosed condition.
