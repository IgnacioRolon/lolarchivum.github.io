Deal 100 damage, gain 30 health. You would like to know how much lifesteal % you need to have in order to still gain 30 health with GW applied. GW now comes in various strengths, so let's say it's the standard 40% healing reduction.\n\n30% lifesteal multiplied by 1 / (1 - 40/100)\n30 times 1 / (60/100)\n30 divided by (60/100)\n30 multiplied by 100/60\n3000/60\n50\n\nSo you would need 50% lifesteal when affected by a 40% GW effect to deal 100 damage and gain 30 health.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-08-22T06:31:33.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in other words it takes away alot of 'stat money' thats basically its effect. thats interesting math though","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
