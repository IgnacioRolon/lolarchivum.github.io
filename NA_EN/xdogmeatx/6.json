Plus slow duration is reduced to 1 second why not just accept it and practically remove it at his point since that's what you (the balance team) want. It's not bad enough she's basically a item now they are deleting her only ability that helps. All she is good at is afk in teammates and don't bother wasting mana on ultimate costing Q ability.  The Main reason why I buy ludens on her it's the dmg buff she deserves but after these nerfs. I only will play yuumi adc is the most logical route instead of being a heal slave.\n\nBut wait the top tier champions got buffed despite already burst nature. I'm guessing Yasuo is getting buffed the patch after that.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-09-13T00:57:50.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't you seen yuumi performance in pro play? In that case if you only see her soloq performance I get your confusion. \n\nObviously riot don't want every worlds red side team to waste a ban on her.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-09-13T01:01:14.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I was right and the mass is wrong they all said yuumi isn't pro play material?  After all that time I proved them wrong wow.  I told them the masses were wrong why didn't no one listen how yuumi is made specifically for pro play no more or less.\n\nSorry if I'm ranty but I play yuumi a lot.  Idk why the most powerful champs are getting buffs while the \"funish\" champs get nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-13T02:02:23.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So I was right and the mass is wrong they all said yuumi isn't pro play material?
