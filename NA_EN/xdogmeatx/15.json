Edit: my god i realized this escalated into a gameplay forum. im sorry please answer this to the best of your ability.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2018-12-24T14:56:33.363+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"the minigame is \"buy items, watch what is happening, and strategize what you need to do when you res\"","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2018-12-24T14:58:40.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=disregardable,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pq2hsNq6,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-24T14:56:33.363+0000)\n>\n> the minigame is &quot;buy items, watch what is happening, and strategize what you need to do when you res&quot;\n\nok but what about the gray screen thing its pretty depressing tone","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-12-24T15:00:30.358+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corrector1,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pq2hsNq6,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-12-24T14:58:40.864+0000)\n>\n> ok but what about the gray screen thing its pretty depressing tone\n\nIt tends to serve as a sharp visual indicator of when your champion has died / respawned, which can be useful in a game where there's a LOT going on on screen.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2018-12-24T15:08:53.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pq2hsNq6,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-24T15:00:30.358+0000)\n>\n> It tends to serve as a sharp visual indicator of when your champion has died / respawned, which can be useful in a game where there&#x27;s a LOT going on on screen.\n\nmakes sense its just that the color makes me feel down. i wish it could be toned up a bit like a glimmer of hope type of shine into it","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-25T05:48:24.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corrector1,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pq2hsNq6,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-24T15:08:53.111+0000)\n>\n> makes sense its just that the color makes me feel down. i wish it could be toned up a bit like a glimmer of hope type of shine into it\n\nThere is no hope in death, The color tone should be customizable, would be cool atleast.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zone of Endless","date":"2018-12-24T23:56:06.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corrector1,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pq2hsNq6,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-12-24T14:58:40.864+0000)\n>\n> ok but what about the gray screen thing its pretty depressing tone\n\ncant you disable gray death screen in option?","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2018-12-25T00:04:31.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zone of Endless,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pq2hsNq6,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2018-12-24T23:56:06.862+0000)\n>\n> cant you disable gray death screen in option?\n\nI didnt know that how do you do that option it would make me glad.","replies":[{"poster":"Zone of Endless","date":"2018-12-26T02:08:04.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corrector1,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=pq2hsNq6,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2018-12-25T00:04:31.424+0000)\n>\n> I didnt know that how do you do that option it would make me glad.\n\nseem i was wrong.
