Ludans and Zhonays offer him 30% CDR on top of Transcendence or the scaling CDR rune. The Zhonya active keeps him alive and Zhonya and Morello offer him some HP and AR to also help his survivability. Veigs also doesn't really need the Gunblade active because his Q will do more damage in the mid to late anyway, a lot of the time a QR is enough to kill a squishy in it's own right, plus W is 100% AP scaling, he has his own CC in the E so he doesn't need the slow of Gunblade. The omnivamp of Gunblade is intriguing though.\n\nIdk I love mages and I've tried Gunblade on a lot of them, I don't think it's awful on Veigs, I just have a hard time giving up one of those 6 items for it.","replies":[{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-02-01T23:56:45.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would sell the boots or the morollo for it if we are talking psycho late game where you can q ult them your a walking kill zone at that point with possible gunblade.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2019-02-02T02:27:57.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, in some situations, I could see it being fine.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
