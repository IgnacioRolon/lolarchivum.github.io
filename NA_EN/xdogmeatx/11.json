Reading usernames isn't necessarily an easy thing, and doesn't instantly bring the kit of their champion to mind.\n\nI actually kind of like how this works.  Using the names and pronouns for the champion rather than the player is an interesting little thing that developed, since I've seen this happen since season 1 I'm sure it didn't originate with League.","replies":[]}]}
