So here's the idea, increase the shield duration from 5 seconds at all ranks to 7 seconds at all ranks, if the shield is not broken by the end of the duration, it explodes for 100/150/200 damage to all enemies within 2/2/3 hexes. This will allow to Ivern to output more damage if his shield can't be broken allowing him to push a lead if the enemies can't outdamage his shield.\r\n\r\nMaokai's 'Sap Magic,' Maokai being the early-game powerhouse he is and the late game unkillable healer he also is, is a bit problematic for the game, especially when he acts as a counter to Summoners and when Woodland Units are strong in power and shielding, they shouldn't be strong in tanking/healing over damage. So here is where the change comes in, Maokai's 'Sap Magic' has a 5 second cooldown however a spell instantly refreshes the cooldown and Summoned Units no longer count as count as spells to Sap Magic. This will still allow Maokai to sustain through the round while also not able to outsustain summoned units when he's already built as a tank (D. Claw and Warmog's Maokai has been relevant).\r\n\r\nWhile these are perhaps polarizing changes, I think giving woodlands a reliable counter when they can dominate early and late given somewhat decent RNG and if the items go right too they can sit at first for a good chunk of the game. These changes will allow Ivern to output more damage in exchange for weaker shielding seen in Patch 9.23, while also making it hard to access that damage since the shield will last longer than normal. And it gives Maokai some reliable counterplay when a Summoners comp faces him. \r\n\r\nThis is all theoretical and I encourage you to think about the changes and how they would impact the way Woodlands play out, and maybe if the comp was more damage focused rather than a jack of all trades comp (tanking, shielding, innate druid synergy, damage, etc.). \r\n\r\nGood luck on the Rift!    {{champion:45}} &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-11-21T03:01:17.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm quite convinced that Woodland units are good early, but not good late.  Their scaling is fine for tier 1 units, but they can't compete with tier 3 or 4 lategame, and their 40HP per second is HUGE early but TINY late.  I like your Ivern idea, but I think Mao is fine where he's at.","replies":[]}]}
