One of Neeko's voicelines is something like \"Neeko is on her FOURTH tail!\" which implies that Neeko's tribe not only loses their tails for them to regrow, they're quite proud of the fact.\r\n\r\nI think it's like reptiles shedding mixed with tree stump rings. Maybe they treat a tail dropping off like a birthday celebration. It would be a neat bit of trivia and worldbuilding!","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2019-06-01T15:23:20.608+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats on being one of the first to pick up on this. Neeko's tribe indeed looked at the shedding tails as milestones in maturity, like birthdays. This does not occur annually, but is linked to growth in the spiritual realm. That's what made the Oovi-Kat interesting to me, they descended from the first vastaya, with a lineage that allowed little outside mingling (although some did exist her tribe, while isolated, were very welcoming of strangers which shows in Neeko's worldview) which means that their connection with the spirit realm physically affects their body. \n\nHer other three tails were just as beautiful as her current one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2019-06-01T13:26:20.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm disturbed...","replies":[]},{"poster":"WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO","date":"2019-06-01T11:22:41.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That’s an interesting way of interpreting that line.  Perhaps you can also say that Neeko is proud of her previous three brushes with death?  Maybe it’s a sign of valor or experience to have regrown tails.","replies":[]}]}
