It's mostly just a light-sensitive organ that's used for various regulatory cycles.  Though in some salamanders it appears to be able to detect polarized light, which is useful for tracking the sun's position (again, to help with regulatory cycles).\n\nBasically yeah, third eye is a real thing.  But its function is way more boring than suggested by parapsychology.  That's science for you.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2019-06-02T04:46:34.681+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rebonack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jBXAglBh,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2019-06-02T02:33:02.267+0000)\n>\n> The penal gland is hooked up to an actual third eye in some reptiles and amphibians, most notably in the tuatara.

Check out Mark Booth's Secret History of the World for more \"information\" about pseudo sciences, esoteric thought, mystery schools, and new age cosmology. It's a weird primer that tries to wrap everything in history into a single world narrative. It's fun, if not batshit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JonnyBoyy","date":"2019-06-01T23:25:12.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what happens if it gets removed or cut?","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2019-06-02T04:47:03.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JonnyBoyy,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jBXAglBh,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2019-06-01T23:25:12.815+0000)\n>\n> what happens if it gets removed or cut?\n\nHer link to the spirit world would be greatly lessened.
