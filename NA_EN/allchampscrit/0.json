I was playing duo top with a friend (which isn't meta I know) but I was planning on roaming early to help other lanes. Almost immediately I was getting flamed. I remained silent for most of it up until my mid laner started cussing me out repeatedly. Malz out of no where with no provocation started cussing me out saying I made him lose his lane by not ganking (even though bard kept roaming up to him to assist him.) I admit I was getting frustrated but I was trying my best to keep a level head throughout it. Then he said he was going to report me I just responded reported. Then Bot started flaming me too even though they starting tower diving on the enemy while under leveled. At which point I just got tilted and said they didn't deserve help because they kept flaming me. I don't know why everything got so heated. Much less how this was considered to be a mutable offense in the end. Like I know I ended up losing my cool towards the end, but man I really tried to keep a level head. \nGame 1\nIn-Game\nAllChampsCrit: your fault?\nAllChampsCrit: reported\nAllChampsCrit: I can't be reported for what I'm doing but okay\nAllChampsCrit: You were ganked multiple times by bard and you still lost malz\nAllChampsCrit: Your fault\nAllChampsCrit: You let him get fed tho\nAllChampsCrit: Then you got toxic at someone who did nothing to bother you\nAllChampsCrit: still reported\nAllChampsCrit: ye bot inted pretty much lol\nAllChampsCrit: they're currently blaming me for losing lol\nAllChampsCrit: I am fed and farmed\nAllChampsCrit: lmao\nAllChampsCrit: I didn't because the team is toxic af\nAllChampsCrit: They don't deserve me to help when they're flaming hardcore 5 min in\nAllChampsCrit: lol\nAllChampsCrit: Malz\nAllChampsCrit: I had plans to help\nAllChampsCrit: Then you flamed\nAllChampsCrit: There's also a reason why malz doesn't work\nAllChampsCrit: Didn't stop you\nAllChampsCrit: Well maybe if you didn't flame I would've helped :)\nAllChampsCrit: Malz complains about trolling but runs it down top\nAllChampsCrit: neat\nPost-Game\nAllChampsCrit: Learn how to lane\nAllChampsCrit: Then try again\nAllChampsCrit: lmao\nAllChampsCrit: I know how to jg\nAllChampsCrit: Still reported\nAllChampsCrit: but okay\nAllChampsCrit: oof\n\nUnfortunately I only have what I said and I Wish I could have the entire chat. Because some of these don't follow into each other as they seem by just seeing my messages.","replies":[{"poster":"XJ99999999999999","date":"2019-05-26T07:18:45.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont feed into trash talk fights, i consider it griefing.","replies":[{"poster":"AllChampsCrit","date":"2019-05-26T07:20:54.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first I was trying my best to stay out of it tbh.

I don't think your a typical toxic person here, but just had an unfortunate incident.\n\nI know it's hard not to defend yourself, especially if you were supposed to win or you are having multiple games like this in a row. But it's just best to only say important info and just do emotes to communicate (I find them encouraging/funny).\n\nI had a game where we were ahead 10+ kills. Our ADC said they liked everyone, especially me playing kindred. Wanted to back with 3.5k gold but team forces fight against a team fight comp. Throws game and we lost hard. Despite that, no one flammed except a tilted xerath who we ignored.\n\nI've had less than a handful of games myself where I've probably typed too much (10-15 lines) trying to explain something to someone. We are all human, so it's best to just notice your behavior and don't do it again.\n\nthis is your 1st warning, so you'll be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"AllChampsCrit","date":"2019-05-26T07:41:55.301+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate that you're civil and genuinely someone good to talk to when it comes to this.

If only 3-5 than yeah that stinks.\n\nbut tbh ive never gotten anything good from them so... I think it's just a minor set back.","replies":[{"poster":"AllChampsCrit","date":"2019-05-26T07:50:24.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno man I kinda enjoyed the orbs from them. I just am put off about how sudden it was. I don't really have a toxic streak or anything like that. It was just a bad game where he managed to push me to that point. I know I should've just muted my team at that point but I didn't and that's mb there. I just wish there was a less harsh punishment for a first time offense honor wise. Like even if it was just a single level drop. It'd still be better than all honor gone.
