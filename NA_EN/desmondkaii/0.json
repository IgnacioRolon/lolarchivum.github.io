However our jungler who is feeding btw rages at me and says &quot;ill get you back for this&quot;. I carry the game really hard and we push to nexus, but right before it dies he makes a surrender vote and EVERYONE ON MY TEAM accepts. Afterwards they all flame me saying &quot;you shouldn&#039;t have taken blue, now you are losing your promos for it&quot;.\r\n\r\nRiot this is fucking stupid. i carried that game fair and square, didn&#039;t even use that chat at all so you KNOW i didn&#039;t rage at anyone, but these trolls decide to ruin my game that I had 100% won by troll surrendering.The entire idea of promos is stupid to begin with, **if you repeatedly get to 100lp, you obviously deserve to move up the next rank, why the fuck do I have to play 3 games with lower MMR allies and higher MMR enemies to prove that?

I played for placement to receive rewards and that was it. The current unchanging system of advancement does not measure a person's skill. Rather, it relies 100% on blind luck. Even if you have decent teammates, the order of champion selection countering previous selections can end the game in a cruel rock-paper-scissors dynamic before the game even begins. \n\nRanked matches for solo players are not fair. 5-man ranked is not practical for casual players.\nUnless you treat LoL like it is your profession, you see no semblance of balance.\n\nThe removal of the promo series is the best quick solution, because someone is lucky enough if they manage to reach 100 LP and displayed some skill. This will have people promoted quicker, but is that a bad thing? They will move up until they enter a league that is beyond them, and fluctuate between that one and the lower until they improve to the point they can securely continue their upward progress. \n\nAs is, I have 0 interest in ranked matches.
