Good. Now transfer that over to {{champion:3}}'s R. As in he ascends in the air (followed by a quick delay) and dives into his ult. That's the tweak I'm proposing.\n\nNow I know people would say it would be too OP so I figure we can reduce the gap-closing range or add a 0.2-0.3 sec delay as he's in the air. Flies up -> 0.2-0.3 sec delay -> dives into ult. If you sum it up the total time you have before he Idol of Durand your (and your team's) ass it would be roughly 0.4-0.5 seconds. Which should give people enough time to react/counter? The intention is a compensating penalty for the added gap-closer. Of course I am no game designer so the numbers presented are merely for conveying the idea.\n\nI just think it's unfair how heavily reliant on {{summoner:4}} {{champion:3}} needs to be in order to land an effective ult. Not sure if that is consistent (or intended) with Riot's champion design philosophy where {{champion:3}}'s optimal potency can only be achieved paired with a summoner's spell. Other comparable champs such as {{champion:32}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:54}} and {{champion:154}}  (to name a few) have built-in gap closers leading to their ults or better yet, *within *their ults. Not to mention some are uninterruptible. Since they don't need {{summoner:4}} to ensure effectiveness, in case they need to gtho they still have it as back-up. However for Galio it's much less forgiving when you decide to ALL IN. If you screw up your ult and waste your summoner you are pretty much dooomed.\n\nThis should fit Riot's design philosophy where the champion is thematically reserved and correct while still maintains healthy room for evasion/counterplay. What do you guys think?\n\n**Edit**:\n~~Also, for kit synergy, add to his ult that when buffed by the movespeed from his E (Righteous Gust), Idol of Durand's gap-closing distance is increased by [insert number]. Just an idea~~ - TOO OP. THIS WILL NOT WORK LOL\n\n**Edit 2**:\nOr we can just have him propel/take flight into his R ONLY if he's buffed by E? Again, this opens up decision making and kit-synergy. Not to mention it serves as an indicator for people to telegraph his ult. You know? Retaining the whole healthy counterplaying thing and stuff\n\n**Edit 3**:\nThanks for the discussion guys. I see really solid points on the pro and con side. So thanks for that. \n\nIn addendum to **Edit 2**, two other suggestions in the discussions to tone it down a bit:\n\n1) His gap closer has a min-max range. Min being where he stands and max being [insert short distance] units away. The farther his landing spot the longer the delay he has in the air ranging from 0.2 sec - 1 sec delay. For example if ult is casted where he stands, it will take 0.2 sec for ascend->quick pause->land into ult. Now if the ult is casted at a location of maximum range it will take the a total of 1 sec before he lands into his ult. There's your room to maneuver and re-position. Fair?\n\n2) Similar to {{champion:80}}'s ult where the nearer you are to the center the more dmg to take. Carry that over to {{champion:3}}'s ult where the taunt duration is longer as you are caught towards the center and less as you are near the outer perimeter of the AOE taunt. This is to keep his gap-closing ult at bay. Just because he catches you doesn't mean he will benefit the full CC duration\n\n\nWe're just throwing out ideas to make this possible where it isn't punishingly OP while at the same time still give players time to react and counter.","replies":[{"poster":"Gare Jordans","date":"2015-03-24T20:12:05.723+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't support this idea because I'd rather not see one of my main champions become popular and get nerfed into oblivion.","replies":[{"poster":"Castman","date":"2015-03-24T20:14:05.674+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn you know what?

The worst offenders are ad champs.\n\nI played {{champion:238}}mid vs a {{champion:3}}once and oh boy he was rendered useless. Melee to cs? Get poked. Use spells to cs? Bye bye mana. I completely bullied him. I also did the very same with {{champion:157}}{{champion:126}}and{{champion:80}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-25T12:14:35.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those are all AD champs\n\nYou are playing galio, an anti mage\n\nI see the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"JumbaJoopleakley","date":"2015-03-25T14:40:20.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio isn't really an anti-mage, he just get's some extra bang from MR.

Min being where he stands and max being [insert short distance] units away. The farther his landing spot the longer the delay he has in the air ranging from 0.2 sec - 1 sec delay. For example if ult is casted where he stands, it will take 0.2 sec for ascend->quick pause->land into ult. Now if the ult is casted at a location of maximum range it will take the a total of 1 sec before he lands into his ult. There's your room to maneuver and re-position. Fair?\n\nThis has to be one of the most interesting, creative and innovative suggestion I've seen in a long while. Not only that, but add the fact that I've never been playing or interested by Galio, this suggestion truly makes me reconsider my opinion about him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JevelFaithful","date":"2015-03-25T01:49:32.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On one hand : That's what they did with Fid's ult.
