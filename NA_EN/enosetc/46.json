I know someone was banned for it before, then unbanned.\n\nSomeone else just got a 7-day ban for using it.\n\nTransparency WHERE?\n\n_____\n\nEDIT: A rare species has sighted this thread. My people call them \"Rioters\". Stay tuned for the documentary.\n\nEDIT 2: Okay guys, Riot is willing to break the silence here. I'm upset too, but I need you all to **keep it civil**. We don't get the chance to have these conversations as much as we should so we absolutely need to make sure this one doesn't crash.\n\nEDIT 3: So Riot seems to have peeled out of this thread completely, which is understandable. They seemed to have pulled the trigger too quickly and the initial responses weren't received well for the most part. Check back in Riot's thread [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/Ep4t0zPw-lets-talk-about-the-boards) for more updates and a platform to provide feedback.\n","replies":[]}
