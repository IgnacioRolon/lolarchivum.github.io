We were told that there would be leveled up moderation, similar sub-boards would be fused together, and that the universal rules would be revamped. This was good news for us due to the extreme lack of transparency and the general attitude towards our General Discussion board by certain onlookers.\n\nNow, let&#039;s fast forward to today.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/oya47/515af63607.png\n\nThis place has seen better days for sure.\n\nI&#039;d like to outline a few things I&#039;ve seen here that I think are problematic:\n\n* **Nowadays, there&#039;s not much incentive to do anything other than shitpost.**\n\nWhat&#039;s the point of constructing a thread from the ground up, only to have it possibly buried by threads that can be whipped up in less than a minute&#039;s time? This isn&#039;t to say that there&#039;s anything wrong with low-effort posts, as not all points need textwalls to be articulated properly. \n\n* **Activity on this board is sluggish unless there&#039;s drama. **\n\nDrama isn&#039;t always a bad thing, but it tends to snowball into bigger and bigger problems until it eventually crosses the line of acceptable behavior and then the discussion is put down by moderation. Then activity comes to a screeching halt until the next drama bomb blows up. It&#039;s not a very productive cycle at all.\n\n* **GD isn&#039;t very accessible to newcomers.**\n\nThis is actually for a number of reasons. \n\nFirst, the minimum summoner level, while a necessary threshold, is a way too high. Since this is only one of two places where players can discuss topics that aren&#039;t necessarily league-related, it&#039;s important to not have such a high barrier of entry (hehehe sandbox mode) if this place is to get any new blood.\n\nSecondly, there are too many topics that moderation has an absolute zero policy on. I guess this is sort of our fault. We haven&#039;t had many discussions on what&#039;s now considered taboo that didn&#039;t end with a locked topic and a couple of bans. I still feel as though this policy could be more flexible.\n\n* **Too many previously active posters are permabanned.**\n\nAnd some for good reason. Others? Debatable. It&#039;s hard for us to see permabanning as a last resort when the trigger has been pulled so many times on some of the posters here that kept this place going. There are, of course, cases where the permas need to stay. I won&#039;t touch on that too much, though.\n\n______\n\nNow here&#039;s the controversial part of this thread. I&#039;d like to propose a few changes to the current setup:\n\n* Allow permabanned posters that were banned in non-egregious cases to appeal via support ticket\n\nI&#039;m mostly referring to people who were banned after they used up their &quot;last strike&quot;. The rules have changed both in their leniency and their enforcement since a handful of these posters were given the boot. A few of the rules that some of the posters broke don&#039;t even exist anymore. The idea here is to restore their &quot;last strike&quot; for a period of time long enough to give the posters a chance to reform.\n\n* Reinstate a revamped version of the &quot;no multiple, low-effort posts&quot; rule\n\nPut down the pitchfork.\n\nIt&#039;s time for us to accept that adequately moderating a place that allows excessive shitposting is virtually impossible. There&#039;s no way to be consistent because there are so many ways to shitpost and very few forum-friendly rules that give leeway to it. This isn&#039;t me saying &quot;ban shitposts altogether and turn GD into a Catholic school&quot;. This is me saying no one should be able to have five to ten threads on the front page where the only discussion to be had is based on the general opinion of the original poster.\n\n* Remove the voting system from General Discussion\n\nPut. Down. The. Pitchfork.\n\nThis suggestion is geared more towards getting traffic from newcomers here. The voting system on the old forums previously served a purpose of self-moderation, but ultimately led to a choking out of opinions that didn&#039;t subscribe to the hivemind. Here, they serve absolutely no purpose and just open up the door for vote-baiting, smurf abuse, and pressure the uninitiated to keep their not-like-minded opinions off of this board. \n\n* Allow certain otherwise taboo topics to be discussed if they are relevant to current events in the world\n\nIt&#039;s best to leave this up to moderator discretion. For example, if a conversation about the national election in the States comes up, it should only be deleted/locked if it derails into a flame war. I feel like the moderators are doing this already, but I wanted to highlight the importance of this.\n\n_____\n\nAll in all, I still feel as though this place is saveable in spite of how much I&#039;d like you to think I believe otherwise. It&#039;s going to take a lot of work to do it, though.\n\n**TL;DR**: Revamp policies on GD and give some of the perma&#039;d posters another chance.","replies":[]}
