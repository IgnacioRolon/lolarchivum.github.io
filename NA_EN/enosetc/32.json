They comment on the state of gameplay and balance as they see it. I'd hazard to guess that many who are asking for buffs/nerfs would be content if they had discussions which showed weaknesses/strengths that they could use in game.\n\nInstead what happens is that more experienced players down vote them, and proceed to either give the generic advice, such as \"just cc them\", or mock their game knowledge. It doesn't even matter if the low elo player brings up math or stats, because they'll be dismissed as being low elo, or the high elo players will take the weakest of several points and harp on that until the end of time (this happened to me fairly recently, where I laid out 5 reasons to *consider* taking Runeglaive in lane despite it being nerfed and only 1 was talked about).\n\nFlip the tables around, it can come off equally condemning. A high elo player makes a post (lets say it's requesting a buff for someone who's hard to deal with at low elo, but is very weak in high elo), and low elo players down vote them and post why that's a horrible idea. Again, low elo players can only post from what they see in the game. \n\n-------------------\n\nI guess what I want to see from high elo players is more of a \"I was there, that sucks, but then you get to this point and you realize it's not so bad\" approach to G&B discussions. I remember when I first started playing against intermediate bots and thought they were very hard to beat. How I wished Riot would add a difficulty between Beginner and Intermediate! But I got better at the basic game mechanics and they stopped being a problem. I imagine that it's a similar story for anything that a low elo player can bring to these boards, where there are high elo players that have been there, but have experienced the solution to that problem themselves.\n\nI could be wrong, but I'd guess that everyone who posts on the Gameplay & Balance board would like to be better at the game. Some may be trying for it harder than others, but everyone would like to improve. I think if more people share what they know, it'll help the boards community to become better and add a lot of worth-while discussion in between the circlejerks.","replies":[{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-07-31T21:54:03.914+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried that a few times.

Almost everything is going to fall into the gameplay and balance section of the forums as that's the main concern for most players and it's just so incredibly broad. Gameplay and balance needs to be sorted into multiple sections like: map balance, jungle balance, lane balance, champion balance, and an extra category foranything else. Also champion balance could be sorted by champion allowing for even clearer issue finding.\n\nAlso it'd be great if at the end of this when someone makes a new board, someone could just redirect you to a board already discussing the matter.\n\nThe second change would be the search option. You need advanced search options to find what you need to find. If I'm looking for fiddlesticks new ability suggestions from other players it'd be great to be able to sort through those. Allowing players to easily find already made boards on what they want to talk about would really help reduce the clutter. There's probably more advantages to this that I'm overlooking.\n\nAnd finally is another rating system. Something beyond a \"thumbs up or thumbs down\" approach. You give a rating to boards or comments based on how constructive they are. Low scores mean low constructive criticism and mostly just bitching. Thumbs up would mean you agree or dissagree with what the person said overall and the constructive rating would be based on whether the person is contributing to discussion or is trolling, whining, et cetera.\n\nI pretty much just came up with 2 of these right now and I realize there are some problems but if you'd like to discuss them then please do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2015-07-31T18:54:36.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bonipherus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=awRxGKY5,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-30T21:54:35.331+0000)\n>\n> I could write so much about this topic... but it's true.

Notwithstanding the really low pickrate that make the winrate less significant, and that you forgot to mention, there is nothing in those numbers that let you know that he's not unfun to play, or if a good E management is the cause of a win, like you stated. As I said, number are meaningless.

But me being offended or not is irrelevant to the matter at hand.

You're blaming, and not even suggesting.

Elo has little to do with game knowledge. Sure, you might find more knowledgeable players in diamond than in bronze, but still, you should not mention elo at all. Game knowledge is the only thing that should matter, and the only thing that you could get with the formulation in OP is more offended people.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2015-07-31T18:10:57.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I can brutally honest here op, you have a terrible argument.

So the best way to counter her is to burst her hard, zone her out of the fight with aoe, or just pile in on her when she engages because of her close range.

My friends and I would play final fantasy dissidia and I'd often play Exdeath, an extremely defensive character that could block nearly any attack in the game and then counter you hard after a successful block. If played properly, there was almost nothing you could do against an exdeath other than try and fake the player out and make them whiff their block to leave them open. So in theory that character should win basically every matchup. But in practice he wasn't played as often by others and didn't win too many tournaments due to tight timing on his omni block move and high level mind games. I think this may be a similar case whith Vayne. She has that same, nearly limitless potential but is quite hard to use and requires lots and lots of practice. Like Exdeath, her design counters core system mechanics (in her case this would be health and armor stacking) which in a lot of theory crafting makes her the best.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cloud Potato","date":"2015-07-31T14:56:09.857+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are more low ELOs than high ones.
