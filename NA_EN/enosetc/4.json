Or did you not see that? His heal right now is lack luster at best. It's decent if used solo but not as a support skill. The one skill shot I and changed his stun too would not give him \"flashy\" mechanics. The Q was a damage reflector. Jinx wants to ult low hp adc step in front kill jinx instead. Maybe thats what you were talking about as flashy but it would fit support Taric's play style. The passive I made I really like. Taric is not know for big damage so he's healing his adc little by little. You're either healing and pushing the wave or letting damage stick. Has pro's and con's. Never gave him a dash. And changed his Ult from team aura(aura's make me sick) to single target mega buff. Now that said, I agree with you that Taric needs to stay basic and not have super high mechanic level abilities. I was trying to create a little mechanical play with a skill shot though. But I also admit he should keep it. \"Most reliable stun in game.\" Nothing I changed made him a carry. If anything it cemented his role as support.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-09-23T17:33:51.138+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"EPIC FORESHADOWING.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nahara","date":"2015-09-23T17:54:04.065+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really glad it's you working on the Taric rework.
