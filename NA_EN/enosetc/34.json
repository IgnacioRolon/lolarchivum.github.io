I've seen relatively little recognition for the support- myself and others- unless I'm playing with friends on curse.\n\nAlso on the 'if you actually have an amazing game, people will praise you'- Yeah, but it takes much more kill presence for a support to be considered having an amazing game, think about it; most people will see a 7/1/1 adc at 15 minutes to be having (at least) a pretty good game. However, a 1/4/7 support? They're not doing enough/feeding (Even though they have as much gold as they gave over to the other team, and got the ADC all gold over and above that.)

Often times you are lucky that the ADC can capitalize on an opening you have made, in which case, yes the ADC will be praised more. Support is a hard role, and not many perform it well. What irks me is when people who perform average are expecting high praise. Going 1/4/7 in lane is not good. It's not bad either. It's just.... a game. If you went 1/0/7 or even 1/1/7, you would probably see people typing \"man this support is so good\" because not only are you opening up opportunities for your ADC to get kills, you are doing it safely and not allowing yourself to die.\n\nOn the other hand a 7/1/1 ADC is a player who can capitalize on the situation their support creates without exposing themselves to being killed.\n\nI understand that Supports do occasionally get shit on by their ADCs, but it's not nearly as common as they make it seem. If it seems to be happening to you a lot, maybe you should play ADC for a hundred games, just to see what you might be doing wrong (I AM NOT IMPLYING THAT IF AN ADC IS RAGING AT A SUPPORT THEN THE SUPPORT IS ALWAYS WRONG).\n\nQuick Edit: A lot of praise for supports doesn't always come from setting up a kill. Most of the time people will give praise to me is if i saved them from a close death by correctly using abilities (read as \"spammed W and R while playing Soraka\" xD)\n\nSecond Edit: Moreover I will often call out when I messed up, saying something like \"Shit mb.

The thing is, they can build something like Rylai's, Rod, Seraph's, Liandry's, Abyssal, Zhonya's, etccc and be noticeably more tanky on top of something like a Guardian's Angel and Banshee's, but aside from Mercurial and Maw, Frozen Mallet and Black Cleaver aren't that often built on ADCs and only until you buy your last item which is usually the defensive item, you have nothing but base defensive stats, whereas defensive stats come on nearly every single commonly built AP item in the game, including Health, Magic Resist, and Armor. ADCs can't even build Armor aside from Guardian's Angel, unless you're like Imaqtpie and buy Zhonya's on Vayne.\n\nMost AP champions can get much more tanky as they build and have more than just their base stats. Even Anivia with Rod of Ages and Liandry's will be more tanky and have more self peel than most ADCs unless they have some off-meta Black Cleaver + Frozen Mallet build.

The extra 200hp is not gonna do shit for you...you gotta remember ADCs can easily crit you for 1500+ in the lategame and the 50 armor from Zhonya's honestly is not gonna save you at all.\n\nLet's just be honest here...almost any champ, no matter what role has to make sure he positions himself well...it doesn't matter if you are an adc, toplaner, jungler or midlaner, etc...there is not a single thing that makes ADC harder to play than other roles...they have the most reliable damage and the whole team protects them. Why do you think ADCs always end up with the best scores in LCS games? Because the ADC players are the most skilled ones? Lol...no  their teams just protect them and make sure they get their kills and stay alive. People say adc is hard because everyone focusses you...true but you are also the focus of protection on your own team so it even out completely. You have one job as adc...it is not dying, everything else doesn't matter, as long as you stay alive you can do damage, if you are dead your dps is 0. But you are not obliged to kill anyone...you just gotta not die. Compare it to an assassin for example. His/her role is to go in and assassinate the priority target and if he can't do that he is absolutely useless. There is a lot more pressure on an assassin player for example than on an adc and I don't play either of those roles alot so I am not talking with bias but rather from my experience of thousands of LoL games.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-08-15T20:41:34.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just to compare the lowest base health champion in the game (Anivia) and the highest base health ADC in the game (Miss Fortune) on how tanky they will be.\n\n{{champion:34}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3157}} \n{{champion:21}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3026}} \n\nAnivia with this standard AP build will have 2258 health, 139.2 Armor, and 55 Magic Resist\n\nMiss Fortune with this standard AD build will have 2023 health, 125 Armor, and 80 Magic Resist\n\nMind you that Miss Fortune, aside from Graves with his passive, is the most tanky ADC in the game.\n\nADCs have to have the best positioning, and while APCs have to position well too, ADCs can literally be one-shot for simply making one very slight error in their positioning.","replies":[{"poster":"A bad Malzahar","date":"2015-08-15T21:22:31.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lol..I am sorry. If your entire point is that adcs are harder because they have 200-300 less hp than mages at the end of the game and hence die 0.1 seconds faster than a mage then I am done with this discussion, nothing against you, you seem like a nice person but that argumentation is kinda ridiculous and besides no Anivia would skip Deathcap or not build Tear, so don't know where you got that build from. Swap Athenes for Seraphs, and Liandries for Deatchap and suddenly she loses 25 magic resistance and 300 health.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-08-15T21:36:39.431+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I don't think most Anivias build Tear anymore, I typically see them go Rod and Athene's.\n\nMy comparison is that the tankiest ADC in the game is still not as tanky as the squishyest APC in the game at full build. ADCs can't afford to ever be durable to the point where they can't have perfect positioning. It's almost inarguable ADCs have to have the best positioning of all roles in the game meaning that It's also probably the hardest to play. Your Ahri accidentally facechecked a brush? No problem, she just ults away. Your Anivia got ambushed? No problem, she can stun them and wall them away. Your Caitlyn just got ganked?

Please stop that...I can do that too....Your Tristana just facechecked a bush? No problem she just rocket jumps 900 units away and can knock enemies back if needed. Your Brand checks a bush? An ally has been slain. Your Vayne gets ganked? Np, just condemm them away and tumble to safety. Btw Caitlyn is one of the hardest adcs to gank so I don't know where got the idea of ganking Cait being an automatic kill from...she ain't Varus. Anyway do you get what you are doing? You are just picking your examples...there are immobile mages, there are immobile adcs...there are safe mages, there are safe adcs. \n\nYour Anivia build was honestly bad, if you see Anivia's going Athene's (which is not that terrible but not building Deathcap is unacceptable on Anivia) it is probably because you are playing at a low elo. In the normal Anivia build (RoA, Seraphs, Zhonya, Dcap, Void Staff) she has less hp and armor and mr than any adc. \n\nADCs have one job...not to die. They don't have to land any skillshots, kill no priority targets, they are fine to just hit what is infront of them and focus on themselves. The role requires zero decision making and while it might be mechanically harder than playing that full tank Nunu jungle who just clicks E on his enemies, they only have to care about themselves while also being the focus of protection for your team.\n\nYou can check my main account if you want: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/43958679#profile\n\nI have a widely spread amount of games on any role of this game...so I can say I have a good grasp of playing them all on a solid level at a decent elo atleast, and adc has never been one bit challenging.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gorgannan","date":"2015-08-16T01:26:06.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mages have burst damage, which means you can do your job and die, which an ADC can't do.

In my experience, a good support is the more visible one in lane. They are the ones that you notice, they are the ones poking, zoning, all-inning, cc-ing. shielding, etc. \n\nThe best kind of support makes their adc invisible which can really make it easy on the adc, because all they need to focus on with a good support is last hitting and lining up their harass with the openings their support provide. Adc's have to do very little if paired with a good support.\n\nAlthough this all changes when you have a support that doesn't bring presence to a lane. Adc becomes one of the hardest roles to play if no one is willing to rally behind them, or, if the adc doesn't understand they need to stick with their team. Sure, an adc \"could\" go off on their own. But they better have an expertise in kiting and keeping that Shyvana at bay long enough to burn em down. That, can be really difficult and is what separates a good adc from a bad one: Independence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caytheles","date":"2015-08-15T19:31:32.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I mean, i know adc isnt hard and it aint easy. but lets not sugar coat it... they are pretty worthless by themselves.
