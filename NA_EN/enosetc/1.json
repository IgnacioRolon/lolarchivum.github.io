Hope that helps!\n\nI usually hold down the ability because not doing so causes it to be cast immediately.\n\nI do have smartcast enabled and the issue persists even when holding down the ability key for a sufficient amount of time. \n\nThe only thing that works for me (and it only works temporarily) is unbinding and rebinding the key. This lets me charge the ability as normal for the first few attempts before reverting back to casting instantly.","replies":[]}]}]}
