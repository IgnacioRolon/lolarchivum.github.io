It's pretty weak, and you run oom quickly if you do anything but farm up with q. Even then, using q off of cooldown drains your mana, so you make a choice between delaying your scaling or sitting around mid lane as a squishy low mobility champion with no mana. He's a lot like Nasus in that sense. Weak laning, fantastic late game scaling. \nIt's possible to counter a safe playstyle as an ap assassin/mage. Either:\n\nA. Kill him like you're supposed to because you have a strong laning phase. \nB. Push to tower and roam, because if he follows you and face checks a bush you just got a free kill.\n\nVeigar's ult has 650 range, which makes sense for a nuke of that level because it's relatively short. To put it in perspective:\nAhri's charm is 975.\nLeblanc's distortion is 600 range, and her chain is 950-1000.\nBrand's w-q range is 900-1050. \nCassiopeia's q-e range is 850-700. \nZyra's e-r range is 1100-700, respectively.\n\nSo most mages that build glass cannon that aren't even classified as long range mages can do a significant portion of their damage without even walking into range of his instant nuke. Also, all these champions can build Zhonyas, which is another strong counter to Veigar's burst. Veigar tends to build almost pure ap, which means that he is very squishy and very easy to catch out in a team fight before he can press R on a priority target. \nI feel like saying it's unreasonable to expect players not to walk up to a late game Veigar on a glass cannon assassin is like saying that Yasuo should be able to walk up to a late game Nasus and somehow come out alive. His ult has legitimate outplay potential in Zhonyas and positioning, and refusing to acknowledge his weak laning phase is ignoring a large part of what keeps his power budget in check. \n\nOn a side note, I love playing Veigar because it feels like a series of mini games.

People think just because Veigar has a farming mini-game, he has weak laning and NEEDs to farm to be viable. He's not like Nasus at all, where your Q damage scales solely on the stacks you can farm, with no other ratios whatsoever. And the only thing that the stacks affect is that Q.\n\nVeigar's stacks provide AP to everything. His Q has a decent AP ratio on it, not to mention the TWO abilities he has that have a 100% AP ratio on them. Almost no other ability in the game has a 1:1 AP scaling, but Veigar has two of those, one of which is a point and click that also scales with your target's AP. _Even if he couldn't stack at all_, just his items would give more ability scaling to him than any other mage. The Q stacks just make that even more ridiculous.\n\nAnd his E is literally a CC that you don't even have to hit. If you can stun them, great! If not, then you just trapped them in a cage that they can't get out of for 3 seconds while your team engages on them. Its ability to split teams and control people even when it \"misses\" is super OP.\n\nFroggen's been saying it for a while now, and the fact that Veigar's getting bans in worlds means the pros realize it too. You don't waste a ban at worlds on just okay champions.","replies":[{"poster":"DokiDokiTodoroki","date":"2015-10-08T13:21:24.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost every champion needs farm to be viable, save a few low budget utility supports that can function off of about 4k gold. Again, he is very squishy, so for every bit of farm he doesn't get, that's gold that the enemy is getting without harassment to kill him further. With Veigar in lane, if you want to get into a position where you can be very safe with your damage, you have a choice between constantly farming q and running oom in lane or farming normally and getting set behind. It's because he usually builds late game items earlier, if you choose not to rely on stacks and try to build more utility based items like his counterparts, then later you'll end up selling them back and buying something else and that's a waste of gold. \n\nAgain, you ignored the part where I wrote that several other AP assassins outclass him in lane and should be killing him or at least pushing him under tower and forcing him to back.  His laning phase is completely a farming mini game, and that's why it's so weak. \n\nIf the other team has decent positioning, then their tanks are going to be the frontline and should be the only ones caught in a random E because the range on that is only 700. If your team chooses to full out engage on the tank, then you've burned a lot of important cooldowns and should be punished for that by the other team. It's no less \"OP\" than Viktor's gravity field or Azir's sand soldiers, or walking into Annie's stun range. They're used as zone control, like they should be. \n\nThe highest range that he has is 950 on his Q, and all abilities except his ultimate are technically skillshots. That's completely outclassed by long ranged mages, mid ranged mages, and even some abilities from assassins. If you're letting him walk up and hit R on you without any response from your team, you're out of position.\n\nVeigar is an extremely niche pick who was getting destroyed 1v1 the one time he was played. However, his team built entirely around him and the other team didn't respect the CC chain of a Morgana into Veigar into team. It's an extremely easy chain to build with a diverse number of champions, so they're banning it so they don't have to deal with that and such a snowballing champion that they don't feel comfortable playing around.","replies":[{"poster":"TastyMmmYum","date":"2015-10-08T14:34:07.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By farm, I mean stack farming. Of course every champion who's not a support needs farm. That's pretty obvious. \n\nVeigar has a mini-Athene's passive to keep him from going oom. There are plenty of other mages who have worse mana problems than Veigar. \n\nAgain, there's nothing worse about Veigar's laning phase than any other immobile mage's laning phase. The difference is that Veigar has better ratios than all of them, plus his stack farming to boost that even more.\n\nAnd if you think Veigar's cage is on the same level as any of those examples that you listed, then you must be using his cage horribly wrong.  The cage has a radius of 375, so its outer edge actually reaches out to 1075 units, which is the same as any other long range mage. As zone control, it's probably the most powerful zone control ability out there given its size and cooldown. \n\nAnd I think the \"out of position\" argument is laughable. It's out of position now to get within 650 range of an enemy? That's more than adc and caster autoattack range. So unless you're saying that in a teamfight Veigar should never have a chance to press R, then that argument falls flat. \n\nHe's just hugely oppressive to play against. His ban rate has shot up to 15% since people started finding out that he's good, because he's so obnoxious to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"DokiDokiTodoroki","date":"2015-10-08T15:08:34.566+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be other mages that have more mana problems, but they also don't have a stacking mechanism that they need to continually use to scale to late game. They have the liberty of using their spells to poke, or just sitting around and staying at full mana. It's because Veigar has to go after those stacks that he has mana problems. If you try to poke, you're going to run out of mana after one combo. Not having the mana for an E greatly increases how dangerous the laning phase is.\nThe necessity of the stacking mechanism is what separates his laning phase from the other immobile mages. Also the mini Athenes is just that, mini. It's basically there to keep his mana up for one q every few seconds. The longer you try to wait to let your mana build up, the more irrelevant the passive becomes. \n\nAll of those zoning tools punish champions for being inside them as well as touching the outside. Again, basic positioning and decision making means that even when facechecking bushes, tanks should be the ones caught at the front. It's powerful, like it should be for a vulnerable mage with relatively low range. \n\nIt's out of position to walk up to an enemy champion that can burst you, yes. Just like it's out of position to walk into ult range of an Annie, or assassination range of Leblanc. Most ADC's have skills that they can use that are well out of the 650 range, if you're worried about late game, which means those skills chunk Veigar for 1/3-1/2 of his health before he can even get close. Casters should not be auto attacking. As I mentioned before, most of them should blow him up before Veigar can even get close, and if you let him walk up to you, then that's poor positioning. \n\nHe is a late game scaling champion who does well against glass cannon mages that don't use their superior range properly. People don't know how to play around that, hence the bans.

I'm asking about more than just Veigar's own strength in any scenario since things like how it feels to be killed by his current anti-mage identity vs. just bursted out in general play into this discussion.\n\nI can try to find the red post as well as the discussing thread I mentioned if necessary but am unable to do so at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Enosetc","date":"2015-10-07T23:53:39.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeprechaunJinx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WHrJ4umr,comment-id=0011,timestamp=2015-10-07T23:46:19.882+0000)\n>\n> Copypasted response I made from another thread where a similar question came up and I would like more feedback since the matter interests me greatly. \n> \n> I can try to find the red post as well as the discussing thread I mentioned if necessary but am unable to do so at the moment.\n\nI feel as though the anti-mage identity is barely hanging on by a thread as-is and that he'll still be satisfying to play just because of the sheer damage Veigar's ultimate does without the scaling.\n\nRiot also added onto this by making the size of the ult's projectile scale with Veigar's total AP, which makes it more satisfying to use for the one playing Veigar while also telling targeted enemies \"Hey, unless you can find some way to not exist on the physical plane, you're about to get blown the fuck up!\"\n\nI always felt that Veigar was more about the burst than the anti-maging (<- is that a word? well, it is now).","replies":[{"poster":"4th3t0s","date":"2015-10-08T00:51:22.657+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Enosense,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WHrJ4umr,comment-id=00110000,timestamp=2015-10-07T23:53:39.799+0000)\n>\n> I feel as though the anti-mage identity is barely hanging on by a thread as-is and that he'll still be satisfying to play just because of the sheer damage Veigar's ultimate does without the scaling.\n> \n> Riot also added onto this by making the size of the ult's projectile scale with Veigar's total AP, which makes it more satisfying to use for the one playing Veigar while also telling targeted enemies \"Hey, unless you can find some way to not exist on the physical plane, you're about to get blown the fuck up!\"\n> \n> I always felt that Veigar was more about the burst than the anti-maging (<- is that a word? well, it is now).\n\nI don't really think anti--mage is really the right term, perhaps asserting dominance over anything magic-related, like channeling his opponents' power against them is more his shtick; kassadin is more of the true \"anti-mage\" in the core sense of the word.","replies":[{"poster":"Enosetc","date":"2015-10-08T01:52:46.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadaxx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WHrJ4umr,comment-id=001100000000,timestamp=2015-10-08T00:51:22.657+0000)\n>\n> I don't really think anti--mage is really the right term, perhaps asserting dominance over anything magic-related, like channeling his opponents' power against them is more his shtick; kassadin is more of the true \"anti-mage\" in the core sense of the word.\n\nWell said.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FakeGravity","date":"2015-10-07T23:07:18.462+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about galio who's power get rewarded for building magic resist? meanwhile his ulti favor from targeting high attack speed ppl( sure he get damage by it but his ulti does increase in damage further) and morgana black shield? i think pinning down a champion as a pure anti mage is not the right aproach just look at rammus who is in my opinion great against heavy ad auto attackers \n\nif we were to combine all skills in a single kit (galio passive, kassadin Q morgana E and veigar R) i think it would be unbalance (good bye ap champions while crying in a corner against AD)\n\ni great this champions have other tools instead of being straight forward into countering a type of champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"crazydanddgnat","date":"2015-10-07T22:31:32.979+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) I would be okay if they removed that feature, so long as the scaling on the ult was returned to 1.2, or if the cooldown was reduced.

The enemy AP ratio also prevents him from being able to instagib *everyone*, or at least delays that point to the super late game.\n\nYour analysis is really uninformed and just using taglines like \"archaic mechanics\" and \"very little outplay potential\". His ult is short ranged, can be zhonya'ed easily, and is fundamentally built around keeping Veigar's in game power levels in check. The part that makes him broken has been and always will be his cage. You can add a delay, you can add particle warnings, but at its core, until they reduce the punishment to Veigar for missing his cage and reduce the punishment to enemies for being hit by it, he will always be broken. His ult, Q and W have excellent counterplay by themselves, but once his cage gets involved his kit goes to crap since you can no longer do anything but hope you're tanky enough to survive his burst.\n\nIf you want to fix Veigar, give Q a weak slow (say 25%) and reduce E's stun length to around 1.25/1.375/1.5/1.625/1.75 seconds and then he'll be much more healthy. he now has ways of lining up W without E, can kite a little, can slow targets to hit E better, and if/when you are hit by E, it is far less brutal.

Most Veigars have 1,000-1,200 AP anyways because of the Q and will do MORE damage than scaling off of enemy AP. In a decent length game you can easily get 300-400 bonus AP because of the Q, I'm happy because I get my R down on a 48 second cooldown. >:D  seriously though, Veigar already got a nerf earlier this year and he is very slow. It's easy to dodge the E and the Q and the W if you are paying attention. Veigar is an all or nothing champ, you pretty much have to land your E to land your other abilities and to hit your R you have to get pretty close.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enosetc","date":"2015-10-07T18:52:38.510+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PopePancake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WHrJ4umr,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-10-07T18:42:33.474+0000)\n>\n> Do you have any ideas as to what we could do with his Ult if Riot were to remove the enemy AP scaling?\n> \n> increasing AP ratio sounds like the idea most people would go for, but im interested in hearing what you think  {{champion:45}}\n\ncould increase the width of his q now that it's a skillshot to put emphasis on his farming for mid-late game spikes\n\ncould finally give the ult some much needed qol fixes in regards to what happens to the cooldown if the target becomes untargetable during the projectile's transit\n\ncould even make his ult do bonus damage based on how much ap he farmed up by last hitting with q\n\nmost of these ideas i thought up in a stream of consciousness while typing this post up so they may not be the best ideas on paper","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shosuko","date":"2015-10-08T16:39:44.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Veigar isn't supposed to be an anti-mage, he is the ultimate mage.
