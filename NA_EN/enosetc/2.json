Just wanted to chime in, since someone asked about our thoughts on this. LoLWiz, in it's current incarnation, is no different from visiting OP.GG or LolNexus or any other similar site. The only real difference is that it is displayed via an Overwolf Plugin, rather than a web page. It's powered by the Riot API, and no questionable access the game client, so as of right now we have no issues with using this app and will not frown upon players who do so.\n> \n> That being said, we reserve the right to change our stance on this, if in the future the LoLWiz app adopts any functionality we find to be harmful to player's experience or the game's ecosystem. (Though if that happened we would first attempt reach out to LoLWiz and try to course correct things there, instead of banning players.) Also, naturally, we can never officially condone or promote the use of any third party tool, as we can never guarantee your game stability or safety in doing so.\n> \n> TL;DR - It's not directly affecting the client, as it is a component of Overwolf and not a game-mod, so you won't be banned.\n\nEDIT: WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP BUMPING THIS LOL","replies":[]}
