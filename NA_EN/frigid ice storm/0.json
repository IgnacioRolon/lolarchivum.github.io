Sometimes when I put down my W and autoattacked a minion and instantly Q&#039;d it forward to attack the enemy champion, the sand soldier would APPEAR as if it didn&#039;t move to the location I Q&#039;d to, but when I rightclicked the enemy champion to attack them, they still got the damage dealt to them and the sand soldier still made the animation of attacking them even though it was nowhere near the enemy champion. Don&#039;t know if you can reproduce this 100% of the time, I noticed this bug like 2 or 3 times today, but here are the potential steps\r\n1. Use Gravelord Azir skin\r\n2. Put your W down and attack a minion, and then as the animation is finishing Q the soldier forward to attack an enemy champ\r\n3. The sand soldier will sometimes appear to not have been moved by the Q, but will still act as if it is in the location that you Q&#039;d it to, only appears as if it didn&#039;t move.\r\n\r\nWeird bug, never happened to me with default Azir, only happened today on the Gravelord skin.
