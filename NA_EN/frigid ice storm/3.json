But after giving it a few days of thought, it actually puts the item in a better position than it was before. It still gives wave clear for those who need it since the active is AoE and is an AA reset. And since your auto attacks don't do AoE damage, you are still allowed to buy tiamat if you want to freeze lane.","replies":[{"poster":"l Main Renekton","date":"2015-12-06T17:09:53.795+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you were trying to buy old tiamat to freeze a lane, I don't know what to tell you.","replies":[{"poster":"Hex Veiler","date":"2015-12-06T17:20:56.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's kind of my point.

I like to think of tiamat as an ad version of sunfire cape, when you bought it, it was a huge spike in your damage at the cost of always pushing your lane.  The new tiamat isn't as powerful, so I can justify it without too much trouble.
