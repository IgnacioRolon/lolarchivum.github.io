With only a shell of their original identity left. I have not liked ONE not one rework other than Sion&#039;s. Even then they still could have made a new champ instead of scrapping old Sion&#039;s design. Rather then destroy the original design how about enhance it? The changes made to Volibear for example is enhancing in the right direction. I legit could not playing anything anymore because of how the new design philosophies make the champs I once used to play very very clunky as I role my eyes at the changed lore and ascetic. If Riot wants to make so many changes they might as well make a new champion out of it. Every champion now adays need to have dashes, shields, and multiple passives which over complicates the game where it&#039;s harder to have fun. The game already has 100+ champions and counting why complicate things for the sake of it? Older designs were simplistic, easy to understand, fun, but took skill to master. It&#039;s also restricting build paths where before champions could go both ap and ad route (ex. Evelyne) and now are restricted to only one because it&#039;s about how Riot wants you to play the game. Funny how now with all the new super wombo outplay designs where every champions needs to have skill shots and dashes, the game has been significantly less strategic and more of a brawler.  All these changes doing the opposite of what it&#039;s intended, the game doesn&#039;t have more depth if anything it&#039;s more shallow.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-08-07T19:06:22.155+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"how exactly is this unpopular lol, from what i know there are plenty of people who agree with u","replies":[{"poster":"Nenthos","date":"2018-08-07T19:07:35.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im talking about reworking champions in general.
