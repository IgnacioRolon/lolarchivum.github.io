Adapting to play other games.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sure all of you are already aware about the current state of this game. This thread is for people to post alternatives to League of Legends. After quitting the game months ago I feel this itch that something is missing every now and then. Even though to me the game in its current state is unplayable Im unable to get into other mobas like HOTS or DOTA 2 or even BattleRight (Fell a sleep after an hour). League offered an experience where it had the perfect balance of simplicity, strategic elements, competitiveness, and creativity. And you could immerse yourself in the characters you play by reading their lore, hearing their voices, and controlling them in game (Reworks ruined a lot of that experience). I remember crafting builds on pieces of paper with what types of items or runes (Rip old rune system) I would choose to play a champion in MY OWN unique way. I didn&#039;t need to be some high ranked player to have fun. Iv&#039;e been playing the game for 6 years and on my forth year I literally played barely any other game, I used to mainly play rpgs, jrpgs. Honestly after playing League for so long I find it hard to even play single player games again, in some ways I feel kinda broken.  It&#039;s like being in a long term relationship then breaking up, moping about the joy you once had where nothing could take it&#039;s place. Just wanted to know if there&#039;s anything out there that could help slowly fill the hole in my chest to start playing games like I used to.","replies":[]}
