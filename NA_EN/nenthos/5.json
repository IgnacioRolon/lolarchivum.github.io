Tired of change.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":23,"down_votes":9,"body":"I&#039;ve been playing League since season 3. The game was so much fun with people trying interesting builds, strategies to win. Ad Ryze, Taric top,Ap Xin, Crit Kayle, static shiv Voli, only building mr on Galio when the enemy team only picks ap and never die. When I first played my first few matches I was overwhelmed, but in a good way. Everything was so fascinating, I remember playing Annie mid against Kennen. I was mad that there was a champ that had so much mobility to where he could turn into a ball of lightning a moving all around the screen. Later on I would play him and he would become my main. A freaking little small Ninja Squirrel that could control lighting at will. So Cool! Abilities were easy to use and understand. Now every champ needs to have every ability be a clunky skill shot for \"outplay potential\" with reworks that removed my favorite champs (Galio, Eve, Poppy, Yorick, Shen, Taric, Warwick), and have 10 passives and hidden info you can only find online (Echo, Kled). While I think the visual updates are great (Tristana, Poppy) changing the lore entirely just stomps over the champ I previously loved. When they changed Eve everyone was clamoring about how great she was but I cringed. While it&#039;s cool she has the sexy succubus vibe and all, her gameplay only revolves around building ap. Before you could build onhit, ad, hp burn with liandrays and botrk and so on. Her spikes feel weak as before you could use them as many times as you want. Her passive where she turns invisible is completely gutted and only available when lvl 6. Ult makes her warp backwards. Just clunky and a completely different champ. And now look at Aatrox, by far the worst rework. I used to be able to quote almost every line from that lean stance badass of a character. Now he feels like a more generic version of Kayne with his gameplay almost identical to Riven. \n\nAnd in matches everything is so goddamn tryhard when even winning a game feels tiringly boring with no way for comebacks. Late season 6-7 is when I started to notice myself not having fun. The old runes being gutted was the last straw for me, it took away any control to where I can play a champ in a specific way. At the very least earning IP felt rewarding because you could spend it on runes you never used before. I don&#039;t know what to do with the blue essence I&#039;ve earned, other than buy a few champs it just feels pointless to me. Stopped playing summoners rift and only played Aram one year ago. Then I only played the game when urf comes and uninstall when its gone. Now I don&#039;t care to even do that anymore. Doesn&#039;t matter how many more champs they release with 10 skill shots, dashes and shields,  doesn&#039;t matter balancing damage numbers here and there. There&#039;s something wrong with this game on a fundamental level that fluff padding isn&#039;t going to fix. Every season has been worse than the last since season 5 and the only reason I&#039;ve played to now is because this game is addicting as hell. Although I don&#039;t mind putting in hours before but if it&#039;s when I&#039;m miserable then theirs no point. It&#039;s like eating candy that doesn&#039;t taste good. Why play a game that isn&#039;t fun? While League past Season 6 wasn&#039;t perfect I could push away the little inconsistencies and flaws because overall it was entertaining. There was some genuinity behind it, with the community too. \n\nMajority of streamers only playing this game for their livelihood. Pro&#039;s too. Whenever I see them talk about the game through a video it just rubs me the wrong way. Like their ignoring the problems, even if the game was a picture of pile of turd it would be ok to them. Their not playing because they relatively enjoy the game but because it&#039;s their job. So you don&#039;t see any of them speak out against it without pssy footing. (T1 is an exception).  I don&#039;t care about the \"LCS\" or \"Pro Play\". I barely played ranked. Tired of Riot shoving it down my throat.  Before League (up to season 6), I used to play all kinds of games, on handheld, console, but these two years were mostly dedicated to League and I couldn&#039;t play anything else. Fortnight is a generic trend game, HOTS or BattleRight bore me to death. MMORPG genre is still dead (Bless DOA). Part of the reason it was so hard to quit is because there&#039;s no real alternatives to the joy I once had. League has no competitor, but the game is killing itself. It&#039;s gotten so bad I just can&#039;t anymore. I&#039;m done with this game, the philosophy behind the balance team, the direction it&#039;s going in, the streamlineness of these crates blue essence garbage, reworks, meta, half-assed responses on criticism, I&#039;m tired of it.\nOfficially can&#039;t play anymore. Sorry if this post isn&#039;t formatted or structured perfectly but if you at least felt my gripes or agree with me on at least one point then it&#039;s done its job. \nFarewell.","replies":[]}
