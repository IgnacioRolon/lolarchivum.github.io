You can do a _lot_ from top lane in terms of pressure and rotations without ever managing to touch a turret. _However,_ I would also say it's possible to look at other stats to predict that a bit better. A champion with low damage done and low damage taken, low turret damage done, but they have a ZZ'Rot, is likely someone who just kept pressuring top lane, pulling the enemy team towards him, and backing off, staying alive, being a constant relief for their teammates.

A solo player not in a premade doing everything to win, even if it means sacrificing themselves for the team by taking out a high priority target might not get an S because they died, despite making the right decision. \n\nIf at least one player on your team gets an S, and you get an A (maybe even a B) or better, you too should get a box tbh.\n\nso in short: KDA matters if you do not care about winning as much as about getting a box. \nI treat some queues like that because that is what riot indirectly encourages through their hextech system. \nEven losing is better than winning without getting an S, because if you lose then your MMR drops and the next game you might have opponents with lower MMR that you have a higher chance of getting an S against. It literally encourages losing on purpose or surrendering if there is no chance for you to get an S.
