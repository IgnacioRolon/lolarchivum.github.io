Thank you Riot for the great server change. I&#039;m glad I&#039;ll only have to wait years before it&#039;s fixed. I played with 130 ping for years now this upgrade to 300 is amazing. \n\nI can shoot my ult and you better watch out, 15 seconds later shit is about to go down. Sometimes I like to type to the enemy during the delay and let them know I just used all of my abilities on them and in about 8 seconds they might die from it. \n\nThank you Riot for this amazing change you always manage to shock and awe me. Maybe it's a sign for me to switch to a server across the world, because believe or not I actually have better ping on the EU server.","replies":[]}
