Then, I get a ban on my game that I afk'd for because I cannot log into the game. Come on man....

When you are flagged for leaverbuster it's not a ban but rather a delay before one can queue again. This article here https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ explains what I mean. I hope this helps you!\n\nAlso, if you're having issues with your league client and not being able to log in try the hextech repair tool here --> https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool","replies":[]}]}
