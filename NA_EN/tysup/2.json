I turn on \"close client while in game\" but it takes so long to boot up again I don't even bother with the end screen now. The old client was smooth and was just so smooth it didn't need any options to close it in game or anything like that. I know the new client just came out but this really sucks considering how much I play this game","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T22:37:09.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you turn on that  \"close client while in game\" option, it will make the stat screen load slower since the client itself needs to restart after being closed.
