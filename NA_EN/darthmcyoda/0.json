As far as I'm concerned, the only junglers who technically need smite are the ones who won't get through their first clear or two without it.\n\nHowever it really helps.  A lot.  Especially as you get better and need to do things like steal barons or dragons.  However if without smite you can do give help to your teammates during laning/teamfights without it, you might be able to consider bringing it if you are fine not having the ability to 50/50 baron and dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DefenderOfFaith","date":"2014-07-26T11:13:26.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm surprised your poll didn't include Ghost, since Jung-Fiddle's initiate is a bit lacking.  His ult jump distance is horrendously low and really doesn't have any other gap closers.  He is an incredible duelist and is just overall amazingly destructive, but all champs have strengths and weaknesses right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hi Im Dude","date":"2014-07-25T06:08:40.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think every jungler \"needs\" smite, it's meant to better ease your early game while providing a strong impact on games later on. If you don't have smite and the enemy jungler is good at what he does then you will probably have every buff stolen from you. Unless your nunu. Then your fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-07-25T02:34:21.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with Boots3Pots here.

Not only does it speed up your jungle clear time it allows you to secure your buffs, as well as dragon and Baron. (Which are kinda important.) Objective control is far too important to not use Smite.\n\nFlash is pretty good on your jungler as well. What are you using in its place, ghost? Flash/Smite would be better. Ghost allows you to keep people in your ult a bit better but if they flash over a wall to get away from you you're not going to be able to catch them with ghost. You'll also lose a bit of time running after them if they flash away from your ult and you can't immediately flash after them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gelgamek","date":"2014-07-25T02:29:07.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about smite for baron/dragon? yes you need smite..","replies":[]}]}
