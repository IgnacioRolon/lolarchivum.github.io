Irelia&#039;s login screen is probably my favourite and I&#039;m searching for a official music sheet of it. I know that no official music sheets has been reporter on the internet but I am still looking for some. I would really love if you can give free access to them but even if you wil probably don&#039;t do that, please at least sell them, make a full book of your sheets, sell them 100$, 200$ I&#039;ll buy it anyways. Love you and hope you will see this. And again I definitely love your work. Nice job.","replies":[{"poster":"Talondor","date":"2018-07-12T22:13:18.969+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Iceclem! Thanks for the kind words & your timing is perfect.
