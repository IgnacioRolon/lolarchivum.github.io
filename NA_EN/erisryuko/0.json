If they insist, you can then commence an anecdote about the one time you forgot to buy Zhonya's against Zed or something like that.\n\nExtremely dense people will not get the hint, however, but that's not the kind of people you want to engage on long conversations with, so you can freely ignore them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C2ksH4Icqj","date":"2014-11-06T05:28:39.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First time they ask, you ignore the question (any guy would assume he is not being asked if he is a girl)\nSecond time they ask, \"you must be a girl Eris???!\" you answer \"lol why do you think that\". \n\nWhoever asked usually stops at this point, if not, don't act to girly in the future. {{champion:79}}\n\nThings that can give away that you are a girl:\n\n\"OMG gnar is sooo tiny and cute\"\n\"Please, show nidalee chasing her tail one more time she is so cute\"\n\"1:55 is sooo far away, but check out these pretty flowers on the ground\"\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rei Nier","date":"2014-11-06T12:12:34.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean I'm trans sooooo that would be a difficult question to answer...
