Normally I would think this is an issues specifically with my internet; however, this only seems to occur in the League client. It has not happened in game. It has not happened in other games that I play. Think about the amount of time spent in a game versus in champion select. You would imagine if it were an issue exclusively to my internet then I would experience disconnects or lag in the actual games. I have not had a single one. It only seems to occur during champion select or even occasionally when creating the lobby/inviting. I'm sure it happens more often when I just have the client left open in the backgrounds, but I wouldn't notice it unless I'm actually using the client to make a game and/or invite friends. \n\nI will often be waiting for my turn to pick just to realize the timer already hit 0 and stopped and I'm just waiting to get my reconnecting message. I had one game where I was given Alistar (ARAM) and began setting my runes. Once I finished making my rune page, I clicked save only to find out I'd DCed from champion select and clicking save would only make a sound, but not close the page or save the runes. I luckily reconnected before champion select ended and checked the name of the page, it was correct. I then clicked to edit the rune page to make sure it actually saved my changes to the page. All of the runes were correct. I clicked save to close out. The game starts loading and I realize I have my Nidalee page from the previous game and I'm loading in on Alistar. \n\nI'm foreseeing this being an even more aggravating issue in the future if I decide to play ranked more next season as I've been playing LoL more again. I really don't want to be forced to dodge because I DCed during banning phase and the client can't reconnect me fast enough or that I have the wrong runes because even though I double checked to make sure they were set, I DCed during it, so the server doesn't have what I see visibly on my client. It would feel awful to have this issue during promos. It happens once if not multiple times a day if I'm spamming LoL long enough that day. \n\nI'd like to reiterate why I'm bringing this issue here. I honestly cannot remember a disconnect or lag spike in game. My GF and I both find it peculiar that I seem to disconnect only in champion selects, but never have issues in game. I have had no lag or disconnects in game since the preseason patch that brought the new runes. I've had numerous disconnects specifically during champion select/in client since that same patch. Before that patch I was not having any issues with disconnecting in champion select or the client. I don't have any lag or disconnects when I play Black Desert Online or other games that I play. Like I've already said several times, It doesn't even happen in the League games themselves. It only happens in the client. These factors are what lead me to believe it's not simply an issue specific to my internet. I understand it could be an issue with my internet and the client servers, but not with the game servers or the servers of my other games I play. I've also waited however long it's been since the initial preseason patch that introduced the new runes to check if it was an isolated incident or not. It has not stopped. That's why I'm making this post to see if there is any light someone can shed on what might be causing this issue. \n\nhttps://gfycat.com/ActiveAgitatedCockatoo\nHere's a gif of about 15 seconds of my most recent disconnect. Usually it drops me from the champion select once it reconnects, but this one was stuck for 5+ minutes while I typed this post. It sat like this until I closed the client and logged back in. I didn't even have a timer because I let it sit while typing this post so long.\n\nTL:DR: I've been having frequent disconnects in the client and most often during champion select. I have not had any issues in the game. I have no had any issues in other games. This leads me to believe it has something to do specifically with the client and possibly with the client server and my internet. I've given it long enough since the new runes patch hit to know if it was just an isolated incident or not. It has not stopped.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-05T18:41:55.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of different services that your connection needs to reach for League.  Champion select is one service for example, and the game server is another.  While it sounds like your comms are working fine with most services, you're having some instability with champion select andlosing sync.  If your internet is working fine, then there might be a more local network issue or block causing this.  \n\nFor now, I recommend sticking to custom games and seeing if auto-configuring your firewall settings via [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) might help.  If it persists, though, then the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help.  Let me know how that works for you!","replies":[{"poster":"Kizoja2","date":"2018-03-03T21:50:39.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just happened again.

I've been playing a lot more lately and it's still happening. I dug up this post and decided to uninstall the hextech repair tool then reinstall it to make sure I have the most up to date version then tried it again. After that, I tried everything in the connection issues guide and have had a few DCs in champion select since then. Nothing has worked. Everything is still the same as my original post. Only happens in champion select, never in game, never in other games I play. What do I do now? It's getting incredibly frustrating. It's pissing me off. I'd kind of like to try for gold in ranked again at some point now that I'm playing LoL again, but I can't go into ranked games with this nonsense happening.\n\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/ClassicThirstyArizonaalligatorlizard\n\nIt doesn't even resolve itself. I just get stuck until I close the client. It's great if you have some sort of reconnection process set up, but it's incredibly slow, especially for a time sensitive thing like champion select or champion bans. In arams where I usually have the most time to DC and reconnect, I'll sometimes not have time to set runes for my random champion that I'm likely to not have a preset page for. In the gif above it sat like this for 5 minutes or so before I decided to take a 30 second gif and upload it before closing the client and logging back in. On the bright side it at least kicks me out when I can't ban a champion when I DC. In ARAMs, I can just not reconnect or reconnect with 5 seconds left to set my runes. Also it isn't able to tell that my runes weren't saved while I was DCed. I could open my runes with that 5 sec left and they'd show what I set them to while DCed, but when I load into the game it'll have the previous page.

Today, one hour back I've played and stuck during update, stuck during Champion Loadout at 0 time. after restart client is not connected [I have damn good internet connection - never problems with dc or lags in all games]. In next game brutal 30sec-2min lags, at end of game [loose] attempting to reconnect for 10min, then I ended it manualy. \n\nSo, this ruining my pleasure from game. Hope so it will be better cause this really pisses me.","replies":[]}]}
