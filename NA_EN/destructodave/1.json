Its sad that something like that just annoys me to no end, but it does. They literally rage hardcore if a support doesnt take exhaust.\r\n\r\nWhen, IMO, its one of the biggest fuckups you can do low elo. I mean really, how often is a low elo player going to effectively use exhaust? Hardly ever. Half the time, they use it on supports, they use it after damage has been done, they use it as a slow.\r\n\r\nIgnite is honestly better in almost every situation. I dont know how many times we could have killed an enemy laner if the support just took ignite instead of exhaust. I dont know how many times I've turned around a bad situation by using ignite as a peel instead of having a worthless ass exhaust.\r\n\r\nI dunno, its almost comical the amount of rage and arguing that goes into a low elo pre-game about the support taking ignite; most of them buckle to the pressure and swap to exhaust, and fail with it all game, where they could have secured some kills with ignite.\r\n\r\nPersonally, it annoys me to no end when my support doesnt take ignite. \r\n\r\nJust something I've decided to rant about after about 15 straight lobbies of people arguing about the support summoners.","replies":[]}
