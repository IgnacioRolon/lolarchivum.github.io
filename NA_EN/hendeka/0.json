My user experience would be much more enjoyable if I can immerse more with the client by having it being full-screen. Also some text can feel small or hard to read. I play on my 1920x1080p monitor and I love using other games clients that have full screen (usually with some in engine connection with the client like in DotA 2). I understand that the tech is not built that way with League of Legends, but non the less it would still be cool if there was some amount of support for that larger window experience. \r\n\r\nWhat does Riot think about this?\r\nWhat does everyone else think about this?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Zenthon Prime","date":"2016-09-29T06:26:12.520+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually been added.  If you press Ctrl and +, the client expands to 1920x1080.\n\nI will say, some icons look a tad blurry (namely the Play icon and animation), but it's an improvement.","replies":[{"poster":"RetroSplurge","date":"2016-09-29T16:23:26.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only other thing that I have seen turn blurry is the Hextech Crafting icons, like the chests.
