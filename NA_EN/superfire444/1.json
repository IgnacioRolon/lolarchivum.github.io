I agree. It had no counterplay and caused a lot of frustration when playing against her. Instead of changing her into a burst-mage there were a few other things you could&#039;ve done to keep her intact and not change her.\r\n\r\n1) you could&#039;ve made Q and RQ a skillshot\r\n2) you could&#039;ve taken power from Q and RQ and put it into E/QE so she has to hit her whole combo\r\n3) lower her damage\r\n\r\nPersonally I prefer #1 or #2\r\n\r\nYes she has counterplay now but she isn&#039;t the same anymore. Now you are probably wondering why this isn&#039;t right as I claimed in my title. It&#039;s because other champions have the same &quot;no-counterplay&quot; yet are not changed/given counterplay.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s weird that champions like Annie has an instant nuke or champions, like Vayne can 2-hit you without you being able to retaliate at all, an Ahri who can blow you up while missing literally every skillshot she has cause of her targeted abilties or a lee-sin kicking you. There are loads of stuff which is annoying to play against or has barely any counterplay. I&#039;m not sure why assassins have to be treated differently. As I mentioned above, other solutions were possible. Pretty sure this game would get really stale if we remove all the high-action champions because they lack counterplay.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sad that one of my beloved, high-speed, high-action champion was removed because she didn&#039;t have counterplay yet other abusers of the &quot;no counterplay&quot; tag get to keep on abusing their mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2016-12-05T20:23:37.765+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yeah, burst isnt the only thing that makes an assassin but assassins are still supposed to have actual burst. \nSo if mages/some \"fighters\" that arent even supposed to have that much burst (like Lux, Viktor or even stuff like Xerath) are allowed to instantly oneshot someone but assassins cant, theres probably something wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-12-05T20:25:41.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, and it'll probably be fixed in their respective reworks (or with mages, nerfs.
