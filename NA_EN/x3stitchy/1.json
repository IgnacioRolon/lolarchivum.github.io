A few days ago I was playing league just fine. When I opened League today, nothing happened when I clicked on it. I proceeded to Google and many websites said to delete the lol_launcher folder (I'm on mac btw) so as to force League to repatch itself. Then, when I tried to re download League, errors often occurred, e.g. Unspecified error occurred please check your logs for more information, and sometimes when it is at 99%, after waiting for an hour, a bug splat occurs. Sometimes, the bug splat occurs halfway through as well. Either way, I am unable to get League downloaded ever since that event. I would really appreciate some help as I really enjoy playing the game. Thanks a lot! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T00:22:15.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issues during patching that you're experiencing are typically the result of certain network settings preventing your patcher from staying connected to our patching servers.
