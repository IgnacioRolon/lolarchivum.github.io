The next day, when I clicked on the app, nothing happened. So I checked LoL Forums and it said to delete the folder named lol_launcher. I did as told only to realise that it still does not work, and now I am missing an essential component in the app. I tried to delete and reinstall, but most of the time it tells me that a bugsplat occured and it crashes, or unspecified error occured, making me unable to download the app. Help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"x3Stitchy","date":"2016-11-12T03:11:37.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried the Hextech repair tool already, didn't seem to be of any use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T22:53:01.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think deleting files would be a solid plan unless specified, so you might now be getting these splats because it can't load files.  I recommend grabbing our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and running a fresh reinstall to restore your game to a clean state.  Hope that helps fix things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terror Jr","date":"2016-11-11T15:04:07.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same exact problem, posting to see a Rioter's reply. I took the same steps as you; After re-installing, the game opened and patched to 99% before giving me an error. Now when I try to open the launcher, the PvP.net Patcher Kernel stops responding and I can't even get the launcher open.","replies":[]}]}
