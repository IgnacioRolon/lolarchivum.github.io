Having an AI isn't fair. It can be a disadvantage or an advantage based on how good the AI is so really hard to tell.\n\nHere is a great idea I've posted. please read and share it if you agree.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/OE07M5Ni-the-best-possible-afk-management-riot-needs-to-implement","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2015-05-18T06:58:02.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have an AI script for HotS.

First let's not address the punishment side of things as I'm sure Riot has gone over it again and again.  What I instead propose is a reduced LP loss for games where a teammate is afk for a significant amount of time.  Here is what I propose and why.\n\n1) When a player in ranked solo q goes afk for set amount of time during game, all of that players teammates should have their LP loss reduced to 25% the normal LP loss amount (minimum 5).  I reason this way because unfortunately a loss is a loss and regardless of the reason I don't believe loss prevention should be in place. There are too many external factors to controlling this.  Luck is part of the game, it’s inevitable, and I guarantee I'm one of the most unlucky guys in league.  Summation: If I would lose 15 LP, and one of my teammates goes afk at 8 minutes and never returns, I shouldn't be punished as though I lost a normal game, because I didn't lose a normal game. It's kind of like betting odds in which the payout is based on risk/reward.  I should lose 5 LP instead.\n\n2) If the player who goes AFK during the game is on your friends list, you should lose the full amount of LP that you would normally lose. This is to prevent players from quitting games so their friends will lose less LP.\n\n3) Players encouraging teammates to leave the game should be considered a type of verbal abuse and treated under the same guidelines as the rest of Riots code of conduct.  Basically any coercion or intentional leave in order to reduce LP loss for oneself or another person should be punished.\n\n4) If you win a game 4v5 even though you had a leaver on your team, you LP gains should go unchanged.  It's good that a person stayed and stuck it out, but you should be leaving anyway.  It is still very possible to win those games 4v5, to win after the AFKer comes back 15 minutes later, or to get a little lucky.  Players don't need an extra reward for doing what they should be doing anyway.\n*Please tell me why this wouldn't be a satisfactory solution as I am completely open to getting a discussion to fix the plague that is moody brats whining and going afk because it makes them feel like they BEAT their teammates instead of helping them.\n\n\nI also have another idea for the afk system.  I'm sure a join in progress has been beaten until it is dead but here is something I believe to be a little new.  What if Riot were to add and join in progress feature with these specs and limitations.\n\n1) When a player joins a ranked game in progress, regardless of time expired in game, they can only receive a maximum of say 4-8 LP for a win and would lose 0-4 LP for a loss.  A player should not gain full amount LP for a game they were not involved in its entirety.  The 2-1 LP factor should be enough incentive for a player to try and get their last 4 LP before promotional match etc.\n\n2)  Players who joined in progress, who are also negatively reported, should get double feedback on those reports.  (If 4 players report you for joining and trolling it should count as though 8 players reported you) This will help to discourage trolls, even though you will never be able to completely be rid of all of them. However, even if the team gets trolled, it is very likely they were already going to lose because they had AFKer anyways.\n\n3) The amount of Join in Progress (JIP) allowed per player per week should be capped fairly low for several reasons.  \n        i) Players spamming JIP feature could likely climb the ladders due to the 2-1 LP net gains.  Maybe allow a max of 5 JIP's per week or something else pretty low.  \n       ii) The opportunity for a troll to infect people's games would be limited.\n      iii)  We do not want to discourage players from queuing up the normal way because they want to mitigate their risk.\n\n4)  A possible spec to JIP would be immunity to MMR changes.  If MMR works in a way I theorize it does, I don't believe you could mathematically alter the value of MMR gain/loss for this JIP mode only. If that is the case it shouldn't be affected at all for the JIP player.  All other players MMR should be affected as though no one left the game in the first place.  This would allow for minimal complications for the match made ranking system.\n\nPlease bump this post in order to get discussion on this topic.  While this draft doesn’t need to be law, I do believe it has ideas which could help benefit the League of Legends community as a whole.  People play league for many reasons, but I believe the 2 biggest reason for which people play league is heavily because of their competitiveness or because it is fun to play. (Or both)  Levers are directly a detriment to at least these 2 values.  I am an extremely positive player, and I have had games where 5 straight times I’ve had people AFK at the start of or early in the game, never to return.  After spending several hours climbing the ladder this can be very frustrating. But it doesn’t have to be.   In the very least, that frustration could be reduced a great deal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camphene","date":"2015-03-18T00:25:36.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd support this idea.","replies":[]}]}
