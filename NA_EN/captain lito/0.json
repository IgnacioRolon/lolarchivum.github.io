If Riot Game put out another game, everyone here would buy it just because we're that faithful.

We love this game and will fully support any project Riot decides to take on in the future. \n\nBut... say it was up to you, Meddler, on what type of game you guys started developing. Something with a immersive story? Would you keep it in the world of League? Kind of a broad question, but what kind of game would you like to develop outside of League?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thanotos Omega","date":"2015-06-29T14:08:06.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance on bringing back that Cho'Gath game? i never got to play it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tourian","date":"2015-06-29T14:01:02.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've always wondered why it's called Riot Games rather than Riot Game (or Gaming if it was to make more sense).","replies":[]}]}
