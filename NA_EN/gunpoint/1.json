Now she can snare the big monster at each camp, potentially saving her a huge amount of HP, and she can combo in her catmode damage against the Hunted target. \n\nHer kit innately has a bunch of things that are really nice for junglers: \n-Wall-hopping (mobility in general, really)\n-Sustain (dat random heal on her kit)\n-Gank potential (speed boost and gapcloser toward hunted targets)\n-Pressure (people need to worry about her spears 24/7)\n\nShe also has a few things that aren't essential, but REALLY set her apart from the standard Lee/Jarvan:\n-No-obligation damage. Passing through midlane? Chuck a spear at the enemy champion. \n-Vision traps. A clever Nid will be pretty tough to invade.\n-She's a ranged jungler!!! YES\n\nThe fact is that as long as they keep the Hunted monsters buff, Nidalee will be capable of jungling. But now that they've managed to amp up her strength in one area, it would be nice if they could reduce the impact of some of the stuff that pisses people off.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Love","date":"2015-02-17T18:43:27.610+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EnvyDragon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VyGGYAoL,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-17T18:38:10.445+0000)\n>\n> But...\n\nI'm not arguing with you.\nI'm just saying Riot probably sees her as \"close enough to balanced\" to leave her as is rather than deal with the infinite backlash they'd get over nerfing the only new jungler to appear post warwickgeddon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-02-17T19:57:31.501+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EnvyDragon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VyGGYAoL,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-02-17T17:25:40.204+0000)\n>\n> They don't have to *undo* that change, but they could make a couple of smaller changes that make her easier to deal with... like reducing her spears' range scaling, or nerfing her self-heal.\n> \n> You know, the shit that people have hated about her since literally forever.\n\nThey've done both of those with her rework.

Yeah. It was overtuned, but when Nidalee focuses on AD she inherently ends up with more counterplay. You can plan around the fact that she needs to burst you down as a cat, and you worry about spears more because they give her a window of strength (with Hunt) than because they rip your health bar in half.\n\nI also think she'd have been a lot easier to deal with without her whenever-it's-up heal. In human mode, she's built to wear down the enemy with traps and long-range spears. In cat mode, she's built to dash in, burst, and escape with tons of mobility. Neither of those should include a targeted heal, and in fact the free sustain it grants ends up eliminating a lot of her weaknesses in both forms.\n\n> \n> So let me ask, how would you balance Nidalee?

Then they widened it to roughly what it was before. I would put the hitbox back to where it was - smoking a target at close range means you get a reliable Hunt mark, but if you can hit the spear at long range despite the thin hitbox, you deserve the reward. Plus, a thinner hitbox makes it easier to thread the needle between minions for those really clutch shots everyone loves to see. The counterplay for a long-range skillshot should be to dodge it, not to hide behind minions.\n\nI'd also rework her E entirely. Targeted heals have no place on her kit, and the attack speed doesn't fit with her human form playstyle. To replace it, I'd do something like this:\n\n* Self-buff only; press E and it instantly applies on Nidalee.\n\n* Low mana cost (40ish?) and moderate cooldown (maybe 14/13/12/11/10). Gives Nidalee a whole bunch of spellvamp for 2 seconds, with the heal doubled vs champions or Hunted targets. Cooldown reduced by 1 second each time Nidalee autoattacks.\n\n* Allows Nidalee to \"call her shots\", in a sense. She throws spears willy-nilly, and that's fine; that's a huge part of her identity. But if you pay close attention and activate this just before a spear lands, or just as the enemy walks into a trap, you get a huge reward in terms of sustain. In a pinch it also means she can fire this off, go catmode, and use her full combo on a minion wave to top herself off... but that won't heal as much as a max-range spear to the enemy laner's face.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Nidalee is the way she has so much effectiveness without really needing to interact. Her heal means damage doesn't stick to her. Her mobility means she doesn't have to stay to fight you. Her spears cost her practically nothing and the punishment for being hit by one is absurd. \n\nI don't mind that she has all that safety, but she needs to be made to put forth an effort if she wants to recover from a misplay.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-02-17T21:58:33.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When her rework went live, her spears had a TINY hitbox.

Also the spear is still thinner, it's about 2/3rds of what it was before the rework (it was 60 before, cut to 30 with the rework, then buffed to 40).\n\n> I'd also rework her E entirely.

I have two general concerns though:\n\n1. The ability doesn't seem impactful on it's own, though I could also argue the other side (ie. she's a form change champion, thus her abilities aren't necessarily as strong as a non-form change champion. In Nidalee's case, most of her human form power budget seems to be funneled into her spear. Also having skills dependent on another skill isn't foreign to the game; Azir's Q and E do nothing without his W, for example, though his W is still very powerful on it's own)\n2. I would argue that the attack speed buff is actually pretty important to AD Nidalee, probably the most important part about her kit for AD Nidalee, since she maxes it first.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-02-17T21:36:15.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Take Nidalee's damage out of her human form and put it in her cougar form. Buff Cougar form's damage across the board but reduce the spear damage (remove the distance scaling and nerf base numbers, leave scaling alone). Remove the heal and give Nidalee a different ability in that slot that synergizes with her kit more, or hell, leave it alone (and remove the ASPD buff) but give it a lower mana cost. Make Nidalee's play pattern depend on Cougar instead of just using it very well most of the time but still having insane poke. It's not difficult - with the current Nidalee kit, her kit feels lopsided anyway. She can poke you down and chunk you from full range and then jump in and finish you off. It's not a healthy play pattern. But if you nerf her spear damage you can give the current jungle/assassin Nidalee some nice buffs - nerf the spear damage and you can give her more width on her spear again. When her poke isn't toxic her assassination potential doesn't feel so overwhelming, because there's actually ways to stop Nidalee from killing you (and if she jumps on your head and you use a defensive cooldown or something she's stuck in your team). This is a much healthier kit (in my opinion) than the current Nidalee, who chucks a spear at you for 1/3rd health and then can basically pounce on you with increased range + execute + lichbane.

A single hit spear isn't a won lane, and generally isn't a kill until the game gets later on (assuming she has done OK up until that point). You can take multiple spears in laning without being forced to go back, and while having the chance to respond with your own harass (which is much easier to hit than a spear).\n\nNid's spears are scary late but I dislike it when people say \"It doesn't matter how many spears you dodge\". Every spear Nid misses in lane sets her back further and further and she really cannot afford the mana to be chucking one every time it's off cooldown. \"Dodge the spears\" is used as one of the big \"haha what terrible advice\" examples but it really does help against her - dodge a couple of spears and respond in kind with the much easier to land harass that most other mid laners have and you will win lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Antemos Xaos","date":"2015-02-18T18:08:31.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that even the easiest to hit skills are much harder to hit Nid with because mana-less Cat Jumps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kilane","date":"2015-02-17T19:39:25.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"People land spears in LCS because they are good.

Raka has to bleed for her heals and has to land Qs in order to be a reliable HP battery for her team. Granted, the same thing could be said of Kayle's heal (240+45% AP for 100 mana plus a bunch of temporary MS), but the rest of her kit lacks Nid's poke and escape.","replies":[]}]}
