No need to be patronizing about it. I'm mentioning it because it _helps_ you get closer. I realize it's not Trist's passive that gives range, but it does help with her range.

For example: Urgot, Lucian, Graves.   These 3 ADCs (If you can call Urgot an ADC) all have shorter than 550 range for rather good reasons. Urgot: 425 range, Buff his auto range from 425 and you're gonna start seeing just how scary he is since he won't have to rely on Q as much. Lucian: 500 range, Very bursty with abilities that have moderate range to them (R has a good range, Q can be used to poke through minions).     Graves:  525 range, Very reliant on his burst damage in order to destroy his opponents. Though he does have some poke with his buckshot and smoke, his ability to output very high quantities of burst damage is what made him 525.\n\nNow let's look at the ADCs that were built for poke: Caitlyn, Varus, Ashe (Ashe and Varus both have above 550 range and have at least one ability with a great range that's very poke based): Caitlyn, though she has 650 range, doesn't have any attack speed steroids or damage buffs other than her every once in a while passive headshot. Caitlyn also has very long range poke abilities that focus much more on keeping the enemies from getting near her, and slowly taking down the enemies' healths, though for this, she lost her ability to be as strong as some of the lower ranged ADCs in a prolonged battle.   Ashe: 600 range, Immensely powerful with her good ability to poke with her volley shot and lock down enemies in one area. Ashe has an attack speed steroid, a slow, a stun, and a scouting ability that all help her to dominate her opponents from her positioning. What's the down side? She lost all of her mobility to do this. She's immensely powerful but can be deleted more easily than a more mobile champion. This lack of mobility makes her much more vulnerable than Cait.    Varus: 575 range, Very similar to Ashe in terms of abilities what with his poke, attack speed steroid, magic damage steroid, slow, and root. Varus lost some of his range in comparison to Ashe because of his ability to poke through minion waves much more easily since his his arrow can pierce straight through the enemies' minions and still hit the enemy. In contrast to Ashe, however, he has no instant stun ability to help him, but he has considerably higher possible damage output, and an ultimate that can root more than just one person. His balance is his entire lack of mobility as well.\n\nNow, let's compare two of what I believe to be very similar champs except for very different points in the game: Draven and Vayne.\n(Though I can't say Draven falls off in the right hands, he tends to be noticeably less effective at destroying tanks late game if he cannot catch his axes.)\nDraven and Vayne are both heavy all-in ADCs that lack any forms of poke (Unless you really wish to call Draven's ultimate or his stand aside ability poke, he has NONE) They both have 550 range. They both thrive in a prolonged battle (Unless Draven drops his axes), and both of them have the ability to chase their opponents. Both champions are forced to all-in in order to fight since they lack the ability to poke their enemies down. Both have an ability that can move an enemy champion from their current position(which stuns temporarily), but one is a skillshot and can hit multiple targets while the other is single target, but can yield a longer stun. Both have insane damage outputs in duels. Two major differences between these two though: Draven sacrifices some of his dueling potential for burstiness with his ultimate and spinning axes(If you fail to catch), while Vayne sacrifies burstiness for massive sustained damage and outplaying abilities to fight against bursty champs (Stealth with ult + damage bonus). The next difference is that between the two, Draven is much easier to punish for each of his mistakes. Draven drops his axes, or puts one in a bad spot, and he's either lost that damage output bonus or he's getting dog piled by the enemy team. As for Vayne, her knockback is specific against one person, and her stealth can get her out of the majority of small positioning mistakes that she might make.\n\nIf you ask me, I feel like Vayne and Draven are practically the same style of champion. They both have oppressively strong all-in potential and damage outputs, however, with the proper comprehension on how to keep them and their  teams from getting the hard engages that they want, these champions become much less of a threat. Poke champions tend to do well in taking down the health bars of these two champs, but they can still heal it back, right? Well, if you wish to actually be able to fight them better in teamfights and control their ability to thrive there, zone control oriented mages will have to be used.

Nope, too safe.\n\nToo safe? She has no ranged farming skill. She can only autoattack to get creeps. If you get ahead of her by poking her out or just bursting her down, then she can be completely zoned from farm. She can also be pushed in easily if you can't kill her, which lets you take the tower early and deny farm.. Ganking can be a bit difficult, but the low distance her Q takes her means that can be closed in on without too much trouble. She is not very safe in lane. She's one of the more unsafe carries.\n\n> The resources required to keep her behind are comparable to a f*ing Nasus.\n\nNo they aren't. That is a massive exaggeration. She's easier to set behind than most other AD carries. This is not such an unreasonable task as you present it.\n\n>Trying to duel her to set her behind? Good luck.\n\nSure, you don't duel her past level 6. So what? You don't have to duel her to set her behind. You can outfight her if you don't try to fight 1v1. She is not good in early skirmishes. Even in later teamfights, she's not just an unstoppable god. A zone control mage can force her to spend large amounts of a fight not attacking through threat of instant deletion, and CC champions can usually find good opportunities to lock her down given that she can't easily fight from outside their threat radius.\n\n>Building tanky? A huge portion of it gets negated, and she scales off from your tankiness.\n\nPeople worry too much about this. She does the vast majority of her damage as physical. Build against that, and build attack speed slows to lower her true damage (these hurt her more than other carries because she does all of her damage with autoattacks and almost none with abilities).\n\nShe is strong right now. Arguably a bit too strong. A nerf might be justified, but just giving her a huge range reduction is not an effective solution.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2015-07-11T17:26:14.551+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"kog with w on and twitch ulting also outrange her.

My biggest issue is simply that her ultimate was buffed during a time when it was (sort of, but not completely) necessary. Now that time is over and her ultimate steroid has excessive power. They regularly shift Corki's damage for this reason every season, so I fail to see why Vayne (or any other ADC for that matter) should be any different.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gaston du Coteau","date":"2015-07-14T16:05:17.216+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're a mongo who doesn't realize every ADC except her have skills with range beyond 550.

Vayne is a champion that lives and dies by her auto attack range which isn't that great. Stop trying to look only at auto attack ranges if you have no idea what \"short range\" means. That's like saying that Xerath or Lux are short range mages because their auto attack ranges aren't great","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jari","date":"2015-07-12T05:49:05.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's with this attacking any champ that can scale nowadays. Vayne's fine. She's mechanically hard to play, has nothing to use that is farther than her auto attack range, is squishy as fuck, and has the worst laning phase for all adc's. If the complaint is that she has 550, well then why do other champs with 550 range get to have their range that far? Most of them can extend farther than 550.","replies":[{"poster":"Shockforce","date":"2015-07-12T11:28:23.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think {{champion:96}}  has a slightly worse laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Jari","date":"2015-07-14T01:54:42.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who has played both, Vayne has a worse laning Phase simple because Kog'maw can get the range he needs from his W, which also can help him against the tanky bot lane.\n\nNot saying he has a good laning phase, it's still shit.
