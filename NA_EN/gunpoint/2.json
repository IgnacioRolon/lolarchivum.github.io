He's crazy? so what.. and the game's plot is heavenly watered down to make him win. The point where he actually \"wins\" was extremely forced in the story line. I mean think about it, magic didn't work there right? so why didn't your samurai, lancer, barbarian or Karate master kill kefla and the emperor before anything? If anything why did they even trust the empire in the first place after they tried to use you the whole game? wtf is wrong with that plot.. there was just nothing better at the time so people feel like it's the best.","replies":[{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2015-02-21T21:01:02.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RainbowIcee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LHjemfOE,comment-id=00040000000000000001,timestamp=2015-02-21T19:49:22.701+0000)\n>\n> Why is he the most badass? he doesn't technically put any effort at all.. he doesn't even have a correct personality he's just a joker clone.
