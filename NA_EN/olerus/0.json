Everything she does feels clunky\r\n**\r\nYou want to move through jungle.  Random surges of speed.\r\nYou want to heal an ally.  Get punched in the face.\r\nHealing again.  Too bad, they weren't in lap-dance range.\r\nTrying to land a Q or E?  Sorry, opponents have a brain.  \r\n\r\nEvery skill except her ultimate has a noticeable, and annoying drawback.  Her Q and E are near impossible to land against a conscious enemy because of the massive delay.  Her heal is ridiculously limited; arguably the worst in the game.  If an ally is near death and 10 feet away, they die.  If you are at low life, you die.  Her passive is just random, and only needs to exist because the heal is so short ranged.  The snare on her E may as well not exist for how often it lands.  \r\n\r\n**2.  Next to zero out-play potential\r\n**\r\nNo character relies on their teammates as much as Soraka.  If your ADC is bad, Soraka is by default going to be bad.  Other supports can land a skillshot to set up a kill or use a signature skill like Morgana's Black Shield to change a fight.  Soraka has none of that.  ALL she can do is heal, Q, heal, Q, hope E lands, Heal, Q.  \r\n\r\nThis means in teamfights she does less than pretty much any other support to change the enemy teams gameplan.  The game becomes 5 versus slightly tougher 4, rather than a true 5v5.  And even then, Soraka's heal hurts her more than it helps her allies, so the illusion of toughness is just that.  Soraka is entirely dependent on her teammates making the plays to win any teamfight.  \r\n\r\n**3.  No correct build path\r\n**\r\nSupport items - Suicide\r\nAP items - Suicide\r\nTank - Alive, but useless\r\nADC? - Well she'd at least do damage and have lifesteal for her W\r\n\r\n**4.  Playing against her**\r\nCan you kill her?  Yes/No.  If yes, she is useless.  If no, her team seems much tougher.  She's binary and offers very little outplay for opponents as well.  Her poke doesn't really matter, but she makes games feel grindy for both sides.\r\n\r\n**4.  Conclusion**\r\n\r\nPlaying Soraka isn't playing League, it is spectating in a very annoying way.  She can only heal, and she does THAT worse than almost every other healing character in the game.  Her buildpaths and skills are clunky and nothing she does is satisfying.  Thresh can land a pull, Sona can ult an entire team.  Soraka can heal herself to death, or watch a teammate die.  Her clunkiness, ineptitude, and sheer lack of individual impact make her fundamentally unfun to play.  She is also pretty unfun to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"M4nTiCoR3","date":"2014-11-02T18:05:02.691+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not my experience at all so far. I will admit I was concerned and skeptical with this kit as I've been playing soraka casualy since she was still fugly pre-season one. I've found if anything her play is stronger in some respects.  The biggest change with her is going from all auto target to all aoe skill shots for her damage output and cc. That's a big change if your not comfortable with landing them. I don't think they are a ton worse than landing a Nami bubble or other similar spells though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"killd0zer","date":"2014-11-02T18:03:03.876+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only issue I have with new Soraka is that she is really feast of famine.

New Soraka is a fantastic team fight champ and a decent laner.\n\nFirst, you need to practice hard to use her abilities to their full potential. You can't just spam out the Q because bad placement makes it easily dodgeable, and you'll run out of mana because of the high cost of Q. You also need to frequently use her abilities for their zoning potential. You are a herder of sheep, you have to give them consequences for going their preferred direction, and make them go the wrong way to avoid your spells.\n\nYou can also do some really interesting things with the silence, but you have to tailor your usage very closely to the type of enemy champions you have. For instance, if you have an enemy ryze, save it for any time he Rune Prisons a teammate of yours. Then you drop the silence immediately and he'll just stand there like a clown. If there's an enemy Rengar, you have to save it until he pounces on someone, and then you entirely erase his burst and your team destroys him. For most burst champs, this ground-placed silence gives you tremendous out-play ability. If you can at any time remove their entire ability to burst, you will make them shit their pants. \n\nOne trick is to drop the silence, and then *stop running*. You stand in one spot so that **they can auto-attack you while they stand on the silence circle**. This typically tricks them into standing on the silence for the full duration, while you hit them with precisely aimed Qs at short range. Your Q will more than compensate for any autos you receive from them, and you're guaranteed to receive no spellcasts from them. Then at the end, they get rooted, and you continue running away, dropping Q bombs from the heavens as you go.\n\nAnother aspect of outplaying assassins as Soraka is to build like a drain tank. You should spend your money on Armor and MR over health, so that each heal from your Q will be a larger percent of your total, and their damage does less. Combined with this is the healing enhancement of Spirit Visage, which is a tremendously valuable item on Soraka. With a SV and a frozen heart, and then any AP item, you're basically unkillable 1v1. You can also add AP on top of this for more sustain. \n\nAlternatively, Mikael's is also a fantastic Soraka item, since it gets you out of tight spots when you've spent too much on healing and perhaps missed some Qs. You might be zoned from hitting your Qs too easily because you have low health, but then a quick Mikael's active will get you back in the game and easily sustaining yourself again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrDrBudd","date":"2014-11-02T22:11:00.019+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You think landing an E is hard??? thats funny the skill might as well be a point and click.

The reason being is Soraka has 1) poke 2) Massive Sustain 3) Burst and consistent damage. \n\nAfter heer rework soraka gained a poke that damages you and heals her while still having a strong heal and this is really strong because previously her Q which had massive consistent damage early game you had to do it close enough to the enemy to get punished. But now she can do an extended trade with you and win becuse of her burst then sustain and poke from a far range and auto win lane. Soraka I believe can win most 2v2's and her main weakness is ganks. The reason being is you can kill her or her teamate really fast and then she does nothing and has no escape to get out of a gank.\n\nAlso if your trying to play her a solo lane then I'll just say the reason they reworked her was because people were abusing her in solo lanes and was more toxic then Ryze. Because at least Ryze keeps the even more toxic bruisers like renekton and shyv/mundo out of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-11-02T19:40:09.451+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm not sure frustrating is the right word, but I'm not happy with the rework at all and I've played her a grand total of twice since it happen (she used to be a main).  Her mid lane was gutted.  Her heal doesn't have range.  Her passive doesn't kick in soon enough and when it does, you are still being kited by your ally and it's too late to save them.  Her E lost its free poke which really killed her core gameplay.  Her E also lost its mana gift.  Her Q is only satifying if you can hit it and the other guy doesn't walk out.\n\nDespite having a slightly higher win rate, she just feels worse than pre-rework soraka to play. This and things like screwing up champs (Cass) are why I've got no faith in the champ team right now.\n\nTo be fair, a number of people like the new version but riot basically told everyone who solo laned with her and a fair sized minority of her support players to go screw off.  She became more than what riot wanted so instead of letting her grow and supporting her as a better champ, they killed her for morello's screwed up idea that he stole from GW without understanding why it worked in that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"J GrÃ­d","date":"2014-11-02T22:10:36.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think she has a good rework honestly.

To me, healing someone from 100 hp to 2000 in 4-6 seconds is extremely impactful.\n\nShe's also not binary. In order to heal, she always has to put herself at risk due to short range and self-damage on the heals. There is always a chance to kill her, and she can almost always fine a way to heal safely if she can dodge enemy abilities and stay on the outskirts of fights. That's not binary by any definition. Binary is when a champion has only 2 outcomes and there is no way for either them or their opponents to change it if they're on the wrong side. Soraka being squishy and vulnerable means enemies can always respond, and she can always respond by staying outside of the fight and silencing before throwing a good number of heals. You may not like Soraka's gameplay, but binary does not apply to her. It's just a buzzword here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jerradwolf","date":"2014-11-03T18:55:36.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you get into a team fight and you aoe silence a whole team...op as hell. same with her super low cd on her heal. i've kept an anivia who was below 45% health alive through a full health rengar and syndra. i love the new rework. so many \"OMG THANK YOU SORAKA YOU ARE A GOD\" save moments. it really makes me feel like im doing some awesome stuff as a support aside from just warding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2014-11-02T22:54:55.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Her kit is different. I don't feel like her kit is clunky, she just plays differently.\n2. It depends on who you end up with. Every time I play Soraka rework, my ADC plays smart and doesn't let themselves get hit too much. Soraka may not have kill potential outside of E, but at the same time, her lane is not that easy to kill either. Unless you are using E to poke (which you shouldn't) you can bait out enemies into your E to stop them from being aggressive. I've had Thresh, Blitzcrank, and junglers try to position themselves for a kill, only for me to throw a silence on them/in their path, giving us ample time to reposition away from their crosshairs while their plan fizzles.\n3. She has an extremely versatile build path. And usually you'll build a mix of stats (I build AP and tank items, and am able to heal a good amount and stay alive)\n4. That's what the rework was for: Make her THE ultimate healer (and she does that very well) and one way to counter that is murder her face.\n\nAs for Q and E being hard to hit, understandable they have a lot of power behind them. Q is a semi-decent poke ability AND it heals Soraka, so she can heal her lane partner, and they can ousustain your lane. E is already very powerful in that it's an AoE silence field. Even if you never root them at all, you can severely disrupt one of their champions by forcing them to reposition. She counters all in champions pretty hard  (such as Xin Zhao, Amumu, Talon, Akali, Katarina.) She's also a dangerous combo with anyone that has AoE CC, or an AoE trap such as Veigar's E or Jarvan IV's Ultimate (also works against him as well.)","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2014-11-03T10:59:54.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 2.

She was very oppressive pre-rework and pre-nerfs, but now she has the ability to be just as oppressive but you actually need skill to do it. \n\nYou say she feels clunky, but in all honesty the AoE on her Q and E are very worth the slower cast time. Most melee champs won't be able to farm against Raka, and ranged champions have a hard time dealing with silence(especially a nice sized circle of it). As for being a support, your whole goal is to zone and be able to heal. Suppraka is great with 2 support items having hpregen(medallion pref by me) and locket is staple and gives further regen, so with this you can heal all day and your silence is still a bitch and can disrupt whole enemy teamfights AND get in extra chain locks. Your q on suppraka becomes only a peel tool, for when those pesky melee's try and get your carry, or it helps catch out and zone an out of position champion.\n\nYou say she relies on her teammates too much, but she doesn't. When i solo lane raka, my w is just emergency saves(passive soooooo good) during teamfights, otherwise i'm building AP and spamming my 2 second Q and 4 second E. She has excellent kiting potential and I've turned ganks on top lane many times, especially since her Q heal SCALES OFF AP!! That Q heal saves your ass, especially on cocky players who like to dive. Overall, i almost never have a lame laning experience when i play soraka, cuz even if they are the stronger laner soraka still has good farming potential AND kiting potential. \n\nas for build paths, it's easy. early game farm game while you get tear&chalice(for a rough lane or you just plan to stay out as long as you can and farm) and once you get your rabs your set for damage. I do like rylais on her too, it gives her AoE silence a slow at cast and on snare. If her Q misses center it still slows. For magic pen you can get either or both, they both work wonders. Like how is build paths a problem? LOL HER SELF HEAL SCALES OFF OF AP!!! GET ALL OF IT xD\n\nI've actually never seen a raka on top or mid lane in forever. I think J4 could give her a run for her money. Lissandra is sick on top lane right now, and raka doesn't like to be held down like that ;_; So there are still plenty of champs that can really bum out a raka player. At the same time, raka has a lot of potential to avoid ganks and outplay and turn unfavorable match ups. With a slow and silence, Raka has a good time in lane still, I think she's a lot of fun personally. \n\nMy conclusion of the rework, was that it made raka a good teammate,and a great teamfighter WITHOUT her being oppressively strong and still gives her a really good spot on the league roster.\n\nGive her a go, and work on landing your skill shots and you'll see what is REALLY up with LaneRaka right now. :D\n\ncheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Jethzk","date":"2014-11-02T21:50:26.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Soraka seems more like the Riven of supports.

In other words, I use her as the best healer in the game. \nI don't use her when I like going aggressive. I go sona for that. And I can tell you, Sona's heal is a band-aid compared to soraka's. soraka has a bunch more sustain then sona because of her Q. Sona, however, is much better to make a fight yours. So soraka: keep all my team alive. Sona: hope to dear god they're mildly smart and you can land your ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AetherKingdom","date":"2014-11-02T20:26:52.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you think her E is easy to miss or dodge, you're doing something wrong","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-11-02T20:22:21.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"*against\n\nHoly shit I hate facing her.

It just does too little for the price.  Also, yes, the only viable build on Soraka atm is AD Soraka.  And even then you have to build friggin essence reaver on her because her mana never really stops being an issue, unless you build her as a support, which is pretty dang useless.  Let's compare this to another champion that I play as a support:  {{champion:41}}.\n\n\nPut down the pitchforks and torches and listen.  Soraka has 4 builds.  Gangplank has 4 builds.  All of Soraka's builds kick you in the dick somewhere in the kit.  If you build AP, you have no sustain.  If you build support, you have no power.  If you build tank, you have no support capabilities.  If you build AD, you're completely going against why you picked Soraka in the first place.  Gangplank on the other hand has no real tradeoffs to any of his builds that directly inhibit his playstyle.  If you build him Critplank, you're not as tanky, but your W picks up the slack, and you'll be too busy doing 1200 damage to carries to care about sustained dueling.  If you build him APlank, he's not going to hit as hard, but his Q will still hurt, he will completely heal away all damage on him, and his ultimate becomes a lot more terrifying (not a particularly great build, but it's better than what Soraka's got to offer.)  If you build him as TankPlank, he becomes nigh impossible to lock down and kill, rivialing Singed with his disengage.  And finally, what would have been his worst build, but still works better than Soraka:  his support build, SupPlank.  What does SupPlank do?  It heals, harasses, and allows him to just be a downright pain in the ass if anyone goes in on the carry, because Gangplank will be wailing on them too.  By the time the damage drops off late-game, he'll have enough tank items to frontline for the carry so that they can engage safely from the back.\n\nSo let's compare Soraka and Gangplank.\n\n* Soraka:  3 bad builds, 1 off-build that doesn't highlight her main foucs.\n\n* Gangplank:  2 awesome bulids.  1 off-build that gets the job done, and 1-off build that still isn't complete bollocks.\n\nI feel like Riot's so worried about giving these reworked champions \"counterplay\" that they forget to actually give them power in return.  Case and point:  {{champion:69}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}}","replies":[]}]}
