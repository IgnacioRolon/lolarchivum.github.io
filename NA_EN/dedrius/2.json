These are a few reasons why I believe he is a bit too strong right now:\n\n1. People say he has a weak laning phase but anyone who has played against an Azir knows it is very difficult to not get poked down when trying to CS. At level 3 his Q+E combo can also allow him to have a pretty good escape making him much more mobile than some other midlaners.\n\n2. His ability to siege is great due to his ability to create towers and his W damage on enemy towers. He can also zone enemies using his soldiers rather than damaging the tower.\n\n3. His ult is game changing and does not take that much skill to use. Am I saying that anyone can make insec look bronze with some flashy ult plays? No, of course not, but using his ult as a disruptive tool to peel or disrupt enemy engages is not a very difficult task.\n\n4. His late game DPS is very very high. A champion with a good early game should not be able to scale into the late game as hard as Azir does.\n\nYes I do think Azir is a difficult champion to master and play very well and this post is not stemming from getting crushed by an Azir lately I just believe that his power at higher levels of play is a little too much.\n\nLet me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-06-16T15:57:19.267+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's also:\n\nSquishy as fuck\nIncredibly susceptible to ganks as his only escape is a dash that needs positioning with his Q\nMana Hungry\nCan only get an auto off if he can hit his rather slow moving Q to slow an enemy\nHas to be in melee range to ult\nUlt can be flashed over\nPassive can be a gold feed to enemies if used wrong\nHis dash can be meat shielded against by a tank\nHe has a hard time staying at a safe range if he wants to finish of an enemy, as his combo is generally poke with Q and autos then E into them and Ult which is hard to do while staying safe.\nPushes lane quite heavy while using soldiers making him, once again, extremely susceptible to ganks.\n\nWe do not need to kill Azir again, play dive heavy champs or high range champs and know when to all-in (When he uses his E, Q or places down max soldiers) please remember Azir is a:\n\nHypercarry\nA Teamfight Mage\nBiggest tool is Zoning and splitting up teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2015-06-16T16:22:08.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He is actually not that squishy compared to other mids (has higher base health, health at 18, and health per level). He is more mobile than a lot of other mids, yes he needs to have a little more skill to escape but he does have a built in escape. Yes he is mana hungry but so are plenty of other mid laners (Lux, Talon, Kass, Anivia, Kog). \n\nI could go on with some of the other things that you have said but his success in higher level play kind of speaks for itself. He is a major pick/ban in LCS and high elo and has a deceptively low overall winrate due to inexperienced players playing him, which is why he has around a 57-58% winrate on players with 125 games played on him.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-06-16T17:19:39.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If he has a high success in high ELO and LCS, good, he's a hard to play champion and his pay out should also be good, having a \"Built in escape\" means nothing when it's very easily countered through meatshielding, is slow to pull off, and is needed to be offensive, that's why champs such as {{champion:91}} {{champion:107}} ect are regarded as having healthy mobility and mana is a problem with him, yes other midlaners have a problem with mana too but a weakness is a weakness non the less, having a higher base health at lvl 18 doesn't mean much given the fact he is a hypercarry so of course his stats are going to be above average at lvl 18. There is ample counterplay to his kit, it relies heavily on picking the right opportunity and baiting him into mistakes, or abusing how easily gankable he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2015-06-16T18:19:30.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Judging by your responses I would assume you are an Azir main and are going to continue to defend him no matter what I say which I respect :p All I am saying is yes he is hard to master, and those who have mastered him deserve to be rewarded but he is not hard to play effectively. His escape is way better than you are making it out to be, maybe he can't get a clear shot back to his tower but he can easily use it to create a good amount of distance. It is also not really needed to be offensive due to his poke being able to oppress most enemy laners (that aren't massive range like xerath/ziggs).\n\nI only added the part about his health because you said he is squishy but he is still less squishy than other mids. Yes a weakness is a weakness none the less, but if his weaknesses are not very apparent compared to other mids then they are not very hindering weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-06-16T19:19:31.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes I am an Azir main, but the thing is Azir doesn't have one crippling weakness, instead he has quite a few hindering ones.\n\nAnd no, his escape isn't as good as you make it out to be, a jungler can meatshield him, it's unlikely to close any gaps, and is unlikely to get him far enough away from an enemy that you couldn't just walk to in the time it takes to place a soldier, dash it, then E to it, the only exception to this is if he goes over a wall, which, if he's playing risky and overextending then he won't have one to go over.\n\nAzir has only ever had one problem and that was his towerpushing power, but that got nerfed. But I'm not likely to convince you anyway, atleast, by the looks of your post's score, no one else agrees with you either.","replies":[{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2015-06-16T20:01:02.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can pretty simply run the direction that the jungler is not coming from and dash over the side wall in the river.\n\nI am not fishing for upvotes with my post, I am merely just stating my opinion on a champion. I have been downvoted for similar posts about leblanc and later she became a permaban mid and was nerfed so who knows what will happen with azir. I am simply trying to discuss a champion and my stance and I appreciate your responses.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-06-16T19:30:56.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he harasses with Q then his escape is very small, assuming he has a soldier he can WE for about ~250 range which is less than a single Riven hop.  Leaving Q up for an escape option really isn't feasible for Azir unless he's got good warding and spots the enemy jungler nearby.  His Q is very important for positioning soldiers when farming and harassing.  Later in the game I'd say he has pretty good mobility once he has 35%+ CDR and mana isn't an issue anymore, but if you're talking about in-lane Azir he's just as gankable as your average mid.\n\nFurthermore, you can actually stop Azir's mobility by standing in front of it.  The dash will knock you up but he will stop where he hits you and gets a small shield instead.  So champions with gapclosers can abuse that mechanic to prevent Azir from escaping with his E.\n\nYou're correct that his lane phase is not weak, but it is not that strong either.  He has the ability to bully you out of lane much like any poke champion (Xerath and Ziggs are both *better* at this than Azir, btw) but Azir also has the same weakness of Xerath/Ziggs that his roam is very weak and if he gets caught away from his tower at lower levels he is sure to die without help from his team.  So while you may be focused on him poking you out of lane and shoving waves into turret, remember that you can probably win a duel with him away from turret range and use that ability to roam to your advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2015-06-16T19:57:43.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good response, I agree with a lot of your points I just feel his early phase of the game is a bit too strong for how strong he is late game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-06-16T19:30:53.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Azir does need changes, but more of a power shift of his damage then anything. If I remember correctly, he's suppose to be a sustained DPS champion. As it stands right now though, people use him largely for burst damage. (W-Q-E-R) Not that I fault them, the way Riot has designed Azir, its really the only way to play him effectively. \n\nHis burst isn't high, but coupled with his outstanding zone control, it becomes fairly easy to set up a situation where you can get your burst off to kill your target.\n\nBeing successful in the execution though...that's another entirely different thing. But overall I think the damage needs to shift from less burst to more sustained. He's fine the way he is otherwise. I never had a problem with anything else in his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Dedrius","date":"2015-06-16T19:56:29.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could agree with that, thank you for the response.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-06-16T16:03:57.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4scF1ogXcB4","replies":[]}]}
