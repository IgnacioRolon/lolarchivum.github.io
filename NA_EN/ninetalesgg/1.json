Everything else works fine, but when I try to install League it completely freezes my computer during the installation if there's anything running in the background (YouTube, just the browser even). So I tried again with nothing open in the background and the installation would still freeze completely like it's lagging horribly or something ('cause it would still go up every 10 minutes or so but freeze again but also make me unable to open any tabs / applications because my computer would freeze also). The files would stop going up / down so it's not an internet issue since it also affects my whole computer negatively. It's like my computer is running 1000 things at the same time, that's how terrible it is. Forces me to use forced shut down on the whole machine. I'm using a laptop, less than a year old, completely capable of running League before, but now I can't even install it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-26T16:55:42.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your security settings may have changed with the restore, and not allowing your game to repair properly.  Run through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that access is being allowed.\n\nI then recommend downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and performing a clean reinstall to repair any files that may have confused the patcher as a result of the restore.

Did you reinstall/update all drivers and get your computer up to date? I had to restart my computer dozens of times before it was finally completely caught up. Update your Internet Explorer to the highest version your computer supports? I ran into an issue where IE needed to be up to date when installing one of my programs. Are you on wifi or hard lined?","replies":[{"poster":"NinetalesGG","date":"2017-07-26T07:31:26.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't a complete factory reset nor a backup restore. It was a restore where it basically just deleted all my files / users, because I had an issue with Windows 10. Anyways, I updated everything I could so far and reinstalled what I needed. Drivers are up-to-date. I'm on wi-fi. I don't think IE needs an update and I also don't think it's the issue here.\n\nedit. ~~would it be possible to move my League files etc from OneDrive? I think I have them there. Or would it still have to install something?~~ Nvm, it's just Highlights and Replays there.","replies":[]}]}]}
