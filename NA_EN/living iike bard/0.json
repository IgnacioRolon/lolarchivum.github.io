As I login to my account I am absolutely shocked to see that i have been permabanned due to negative chat logs. I am a very passive guy and i have not touched the game in 6 months, so Immediately begin to think it is a mistake. I then read the chat long and notice that the spelling and grammar is abusive and rather childish. I first am convinced it was hacked and could not believe it happened until i begin to tell my little brother what happened. Mid way through my story he begins to cry and apologize for getting my account banned. The 6 months i have been gone for school he apparently figure out my password and got various bans and then finally a permabanned. I could not believe what i was hearing and i was so upset, but i am honestly just banking on the League community for support. He told me that he has sent repeated emails in attempt to recover the account before i came home. Clearly, this is partially my fault for letting my password be seen and therefore i should be punished. However i have had this account for years and the amount of champions, and skins i have attained over the years would takes years to acquire. I know there are no Riot Employees on this but maybe if we can get enough views and comments we may get lucky. Please help me out, I am begging. If you don,t want to help me out becasue you don,t know me, help me out because I&#039;m gator;D  \\\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nLiving Iike Bard: im afk\r\nLiving Iike Bard: im bad league\r\nLiving Iike Bard: im scarecrow actgually\r\nLiving Iike Bard: im gay %%%\r\nLiving Iike Bard: fuck ur red dude\r\nLiving Iike Bard: UCK U\r\nLiving Iike Bard: i just wanna know why the fiddlesticks top has the only kill\r\nLiving Iike Bard: BROKEN!\r\nLiving Iike Bard: fuck nub\r\nLiving Iike Bard: ping shitty %%%\r\nLiving Iike Bard: fking nub\r\nLiving Iike Bard: lev game\r\nLiving Iike Bard: u bosted fat\r\nLiving Iike Bard: grt good\r\nLiving Iike Bard: fk this lane im done\r\nLiving Iike Bard: noob team\r\nLiving Iike Bard: wish i could play noob champions\r\nLiving Iike Bard: noob team\r\nLiving Iike Bard: carrying u\r\nLiving Iike Bard: wtf u noob died to my lane\r\nLiving Iike Bard: fking noobs\r\nLiving Iike Bard: 1/6\r\nLiving Iike Bard: 1/6\r\nLiving Iike Bard: 1/6\r\nLiving Iike Bard: 1/6\r\nLiving Iike Bard: 1/6\r\nLiving Iike Bard: &quot;we can win this guys&quot;\r\nLiving Iike Bard: BACKDOOR\r\nLiving Iike Bard: NOOOO","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-07-12T22:15:59.305+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"We've seen *soooo* many people type this exact same story that it's long since been written off as a terribly unoriginal deception to try and get accounts back at this point.\n\n* \"I was away at college, and it was a tough semester where I didn't play a single game\"\n* \"My little brother was on the computer I use to play on\"\n* \"My little brother guessed my password\"\n* \"My little brother just happens to be one of the most vile pieces of crap to ever type on the internet.

Additionally, it sounds like his account may have gone through the 14-day ban already (from what it says in the post), so it just depends on what Support decides from here. Account security is pretty important, and if two-factor authentication were on the table, I'd advocate hard for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-07-12T22:39:53.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the correction, Wuks.

If your in college this obviously isnt you writing this lol, the way its being written is like that of a child 'u bosted fat', repeatidly saying only FU. Its really unfortunate riot permabans accounts that have a lot of champions, skins exc. Its understandable to permaban accounts from people like tyler1 who used to tell people 'kys' and intentionally feed ranked games constantly, but getting a permaban for saying FU a lot is harsh. Again, Im not sure how many games your little brother has played and the level of toxicity he had in games besides this one but theres one thing I can say: it must feel awful to have your whole collection of champions and skins taken away from you :(. Riot rarely goes back on punishments so I can only imagine how bad this all must feel. Sorry for the loss but maybe by some miracle riot will revert the ban. Best of luck in the future man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ethan Allen","date":"2017-07-12T23:13:42.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean you were already breaking TOS by sharing your account info with your bro.
