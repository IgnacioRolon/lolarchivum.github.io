I get through champ select, loading screen acts like it starts, and then the League of Legends symbol pops up. My loading screen then closes, and I get an error message saying that \"An unknown DirectX error has occurred and League of Legends cannot start. Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer.\" I checked everything, its all up to date.
