He has the strongest dueling potential especially with his insane mixed damage from w and if you build  {{item:3718}}  and smite the enemy they can't hurt you or run from you since his dueling is of the charts thanks to troll poll. Over all on a scale of 1-10 he is an 18 in power in the jungle thanks to his passive meaning he takes no damage from monsters so can clear safely and then kill everyone without dying. No risk high reward is the way to win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheXioniX","date":"2015-03-04T06:26:34.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing Fizz forever, and, all I can say is... Just don't go AP Fizz anymore. Its not worth it AT ALL. The Q does negative damage (Damage at level 5 is less than Ziggs Q base damage at level 1). Pick any other champion - Ziggs, Lux, Nidalee - build Lich Bane as blast enemies from a mile away without getting into any sort of danger. Don't bother with having to hit ult etc... which is very hard if not impossible to land on carries once team fights start. \n\nOn the other hand his superior mobility and his mechanics make him a very good AD champ. Q is an auto attack reset which means you can outtrade almost any champ in the game level 1 and level 2. And his base attack damage is one of the highest in the game. Triforce botrk means you can bring even maokai to half health with Q Auto W. From there build varies. I like to throw in FH and Abyssal for cooldown and the W proc.\n\nHTH","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-03-01T00:32:04.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are both different play styles, AD is more of a sustained damage bruiser where AP is a burst 100-0 CD reliant assassin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dixie RÃªkt","date":"2015-02-28T08:49:35.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say ad if top or ap if mid, personally I still prefer ap mid but that's all it is is a preference, I believe you can have success with bot.
