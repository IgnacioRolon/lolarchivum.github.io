This games is suppose to be at the head of the market and Riot can't even get their game to work. You guys spend millions to get tournements set up and you cant even get you servers to work properly. Over the holiday season, Riot severs are totally impossible it get into. I keep getting notifcations that is my problem or that its on my end but I follow all the instructions that I am told by Riot and it still does not work. \"Check you firewall, check your connection..etc\" my connection is fine, your servers need to be fixed. League of legends should not have this problem. You guys say you are working on it? well how come Blizzard can fix their stuff and you can't? Oh wait, Blizzard cares about its players. Riot, you guys don't even try and apologize about how broken your game is. If anyone at Riot reads this, I doubt they will take it seriously. They will probably have a machine answer it or ignore it. IF they do respond to it, it will probably get me banned from the game because they don't want to hear how bad they are. There is a standard that you have to follow and you guys are way below it. So many of companies have problems as well but you guys, you guys don't even try. Hopefully other players will read this and agree because it should take hours to try and log in. this game should be giving me hours of fun, not hours of waiting.\nGo ahead and take this post down if you want but it will just prove that you would rather shut out the truth from an actual player then acknowledge you guys need to get your stuff fixed.
