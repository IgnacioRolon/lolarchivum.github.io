I wanna change it, but it cost so damn much, and I don't want to change it that way. *YOU CAN BUY MANY CHAMPS* Paying real money? No. Like... If I play this game A LOT I'll pay.

There is an equivalent IP value you can gain just through playing the game.  We don't provide free name changes, but I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
