You are then penalized, portrayed as a que doger,\nand thereby punished.\n\nAn alternate solution:\nPrior to entering a que, you select your champion, hence problem, is solved,\nthe resulting change will result in a long cue of people, who all want to play a game with\nthe same champion, but of course they can choose to wait it out, if they desire.\nA new option, you can see the que of games for the first time. You can see lets say 50 games, where everyone wants to be teemo. In this cue you can also change your guy, and jump into one of those games immediately. over cue problem solved. all parties should be happy.\n\nPoint in case:\nIt is not fair to lock someone into a scenario, and when they choose to leave it, are punished.\nif your character is chosen, you dont wanna play in that game as another, this should clearly be.. understood by all, and should not result in a punishment.\n\n2.  something happened in the game prior to the 15 minute surrender, where you need to leave. Or, after the 15  minute mark, you wanted to leave and they did not.\nI personally believe this is simply part of the game. People often wanna leave early for whatever reason. I have a very easy and simply solution.\n A. dont punish, simply give no essence points. to person who left.\n B. give the players still in the game a choice, to receive, an intermediate AI bot, if everyone agrees,\nto be at the same lvl that person who left was in.\nSome might say this is bad, but hey I would say:\n    1. its better than nothing.\n    2. some intermediate AI are better than most regular players. that intermediate AI designed by riot, is a quite excellent bot.\n\npoint in case: there are always circumstances where one might want to leave. Ever since I have started playing this game more than 7 years ago.. riot has always tried to punish people. Punishing people does not help them change behavior. So please lets get creative do a small redesign.. and.. get players playing games as smoothly as possible. You have got to change your &quot;punishment&quot; system. This is an equivalent to using violence against someone, because they didn&#039;t do what you said. I think instead of siding with the whiners and complainers, and trying to punish people, its time for you to spend 1 year siding with the people who were fully justified in leaving a game early for whatever reason they chose. \nRiot the gauntlet has been laid down. Now i expect to see some changes because i have lived with this horrible previous system, for years now, so lets flip the script please!","replies":[{"poster":"Bettnachleger","date":"2018-04-06T12:01:46.587+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> some intermediate AI are better than most regular players. that intermediate AI designed by riot, is a quite excellent bot.\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"FLOL game suck","date":"2018-04-06T09:18:08.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you waste other peoples time regardless of what you do you need to be penalized.

Think about it, most people who feel forced to play play worse and some even int, why punish them wasting the 4 minute champion select vs them wasting 20-40 minutes of your time in game because they couldn't dodge. ON top of this the 20 minute wait timer doesn't feel justified because it's only a 3 minute champion select.  Why should i have to wait 20 minutes because i dodged because someone literally declared they were gonna int?","replies":[{"poster":"FLOL game suck","date":"2018-04-06T09:27:24.004+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because there is no way to tell whether a person dodgeing was justified.

No, the only time i dodge is when i have an asshole on my team, or someone purposely banned my champion on my team. I don't even dodge when someone locks something trolly, because who knows maybe they have it planned out. It's not a matter of thinking your wrong, it's a matter of opinions, and mine is that Riot can def find something better or ease up on the punishments for dodging. Almost everything else i disagree with the OP on, So im downvoting regardless. I didn't claim to have all the answers, that it does seem more tilting to me to have someone int in game because they felt they couldn't dodge due to timer. I personally rather they dodge in champion select and me not have to deal with them.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-04-06T11:54:33.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Riot can def find something better or ease up on the punishments for dodging.\n\nWhen people originally started using queue dodge penalties to drop to bronze, Riot removed the (original) Elo penalty on dodging until they had a better idea (which is the LP penalty now).\n\nJust to be clear: The time penalties were still there. All the removed was the impact it had on your rank.\n\nThe result: You'd have to go through the entire pick/ban phase 3-5 times easily, before a game would actually start without somebody dodging the game. And that was with me being at the time gold Elo, which is fairly well populated, making the queue times themselves fairly short.\n\nSo no. Riot can't ease up on the punishments. Not if they don't want people to wait for a game longer than they actually play it.\nIs there a better solution? Maybe. I honestly don't know. And it's plausible that Riot, too, simply has no idea for a working alternative.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FLOL game suck","date":"2018-04-06T11:26:29.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your opinion is a hopeless dream at best.

If its a almost 80 minute game then i can understand, but it's a mutually agreed thing in the community that league is normally a 20-40 minute ordeal and that you should make sure you have that amount of time at least before you even enter champion select. If someone 'had' to go pre 15 minutes normally they didn't account for this. \n\nON another note, i would agree with the bot thing except that riot has absolutely garbage AI for the bots. They've been neglected so fucking long. Since ryze was reworked his bot just walks into towers and lets them kill him. I have friends im trying to teach out to play the game that stomp the hell out of intermediates, they are jokes. It can honestly barely be called league of legends gameplay. I feel bad enough that we force new players to integrate and migrate into pvp using such shit tools of learning. They don't simulate players almost at all. HoTs and almost any other moba completely destroys riots bots. It's because riot basicly hasn't touched them since they were introduced. If they were to rework their AI i would agree, if they would somehow be able to have an AI simulate some kind of MMR. For god sake the bots don't ever touch jungling. which is an entire role thats untouched until you get to pvp. No wonder many new players don't really know it's a objective based game since they are literally force fed 20 kills and never have to get dragon or baron\n\nI do agree that we shouldn't be penalized as heavy for dodging in champion select, i rather someone waste 3-4 minutes of my time in champion select than int in my game and possibley waste 20-45\n\nYour whole picking a champion before you get into champion select at first sounds like a good idea, and is from a fantasy perspective, if i que up for a specfic champion, and can get it every time, that'd be nice, but that kind of throws away too many good ideas for it to work. One: Counter picking enemie champions which is essential for league, can't counter pick if i selected before i saw any of them. 2: the ban system which we so begged for 10 of. You can't ban champions if everyone picks before they get there\n3: You can't really trade champions to secure picks anymore.\n4: Much less time to pick runes and sums, and forget about emotes and wards.\n5: if a new rework or champion is out, the que times will skyrocket due to everyone picking this champion to play, noone will get into game.\nA counter point, i feel as though a system where we'd be able to rank our best roles in the lobby and have the system default to that when autofilling so you don't get something you can't play. Say im queing\nI main adc/ jungle, i can play top and i can play support, but im garbage mid. \nso i would have the option to number the roles incase it needs to fill me from priority to least playablity\nfor me it would like 1:ADC\n2:Jungle\n3:Top\n4:Support\n5:Mid\nIt would give you a little bit of choice some of the time in which role your being filled\nIt can pluck you into a game where it requires said role ","replies":[{"poster":"Icantcreateasumm","date":"2018-04-07T15:55:34.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"in 3v3 there are no bans. \nif your char is banned during bans,\nthen your SOL, maybe just close game and try again at that point.\nIf you enter champ select you have a second final chance to lock in\nor change champs based on strategy.\non.. choosing.. games..\nthere was a prior system that allowed you to choose your roles prior.\nthis was a step in the right direction but..\nlet people choose what kind of loading system they want.\nOh i want this que loading style, or just fast match,\nthen let people also see all the open games.. and join,\nwhichever they choose.\ngive many different options, dont just lock us into 1.\nalso if you can choose the game make the start time auto,\ndont allow player kicks etc..","replies":[{"poster":"GeminiRune","date":"2018-04-07T18:09:47.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Icantcreateasumm,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AbzX4jj5,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2018-04-07T15:55:34.238+0000)\n>\n> in 3v3 there are no bans. \n\nThat's false. Flex 3s have a ban/pick phase. Difference is there's no concrete metagame to know what's a necessary ban in the mode however.\n\nThen again, 3s never really have a thorough role allocation either. You're either a laner with a matchup or a supportive entity (jungle or support).
