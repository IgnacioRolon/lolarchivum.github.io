She quickly fell off as my main but she was my first ever legendary.\r\n\r\nSeason 4: {{champion:157}} Yasuo was released and he was the most broken garbage at the time. So i though, Hey, Im also broken and garbage. I should play him. It felt pretty great to 1v5 at baron and come out with a pentakill. I finished the season with a 69%(giggity) winrate and thats when i started tanking ranked alot more seriously, i made it up to gold.\r\n\r\nSeason 5: {{champion:92}} Broken, Garbage. Just like me. I shot up insanely high in season 5 up to Plat IV where i am today. I studied rivens combos night in and night out. I have at least 500 games played on her and I loved the outplay potential and the micro intensive skillcap that she requires. I decided that near the end of season 5 i had reached my highest potential with riven and decided to move on in order to keep the game interesting.\r\n\r\nSeason 6: {{champion:35}} If you haven't downvoted yet for yasuo or riven, then surely you'll downvote for my boi shaco. Shaco is the first champion i've played that taught me how important the macro of a game is. Shaco makes you look at the big picture. Also, its pretty fun to constantly destroy the enemy jungler with high rates of success. My favorite thing my far though, is to find the rager on the enemy team and kill him/her over and over. I used to rage, but now my rage comes in the form of tilted enemies. \r\n\r\nTL;DR Im a peice of shit and feel free to send me bleach for my choice in mains.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-08-22T12:15:59.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm...

After rework I just really enjoyed playing him\n{{champion:421}} was extremely excited when I saw her preview and knew I had to have her\n{{champion:223}} Just a giant ball of fat that nobody could kill. Was just extremely fun to play. Not so much anymore after some nerfs and changes though\n{{champion:202}} Became my main ADC after playing him. There's just a sophistication to his craziness\n{{champion:122}} Became my favorite fighter when i first got him and soon became my main top after juggernaut rework\n{{champion:102}} My current and probably my #1 main for the rest of time.

Quit maining her when Rito removed smile from her splash arts.\nThen order may be messed up, but still\n{{champion:76}} - Oneshot spears were pretty fun.\n{{champion:79}} - Innervating Locket Gragas, never forget.\n{{champion:101}} - Had pretty cool animation and feel pre-rework, then was kinda sucky, but in the mage update got some tweaks to ult bomb radius and now it doesn't feel like i throw tiny shits to people, so nowadays i main him again!\n{{champion:44}} - You can't resist gems.\n{{champion:78}} - AP poppy Q = 80% of your hp. Yes, that was perfect!\n{{champion:16}} - I either silence those Zeds that were every fucking game or just give their target 90 armor. Fuck zed :3\nAnd now the time i can continue a bit more organized:\nSeason 4:\n{{champion:43}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:115}} most played with Karma\nSeason 5:\n{{champion:143}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:63}} I think i really stormed with Brand this season\nSeason 6:\n{{champion:432}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:101}}  Pretty poor performance on everyone except xerath, but Bard is too fun to resist. Left brand after his rework, maybe next couple of games i will try to pick up him again, currently I just can't stop hating his ult, because it feels useless, and his laning phase became garbage from being one of the best, especially to counter Fizz or Yasuo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killer of Poros","date":"2016-08-22T20:31:59.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:80}} because I'm unskilled af when it comes to skillshots.\n{{champion:83}} because I hate my lane opponents","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2016-08-22T14:24:55.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first main was {{champion:7}}, because I had spent ages trying to get good at DotA1 so I could play it with my friends but all I could play with any consistancy was Puck, His combo and Leblancs combo was very similar. Jump in, silence, chain. LB has since been changed.\n\nI then moved onto {{champion:50}}, playing exclusively mages.\n\nThen something in the league community changed and calling your roles in champ select became the norm, which meant I basically never got mid lane. In fact I have never got used to calling roles and still can't do it... hence.. I am a Fill main.\n\nSo that basically meant support every game. {{champion:40}} primarily, I liked being completely uncatchable but I also played Old {{champion:43}}  quite a lot. I gradually moved onto the popular {{champion:117}}, with a lot of support tools at my disposal. One day the newest support champ was released riot had constantly screwed up making support champions in the past so I didn't have my hopes up.... that champion was... {{champion:267}}. I played her in her free week and she was just amazing, i was just having so much fun with the champion, I saved up that 6300 ip quick smart... {{champion:267}} .. the perfect support. \n\nAs a Fill main I was also often asked to play Jungle, I started as a {{champion:31}} jungler as he was simple enough, well actually I tried {{champion:84}}  first because I liked assians to begin with, leveraging my superior skills over newbs as a former (but bad) DotA player. I could also play {{champion:9}}  but I found people never seemed to pick tanks in thier teams so {{champion:31}} it was. {{champion:57}}  was realeased and at the time the jungle was a harsh place. I had heard like for {{champion:84}} you needed a special rune page for him so I resisted at first. eventually I gave him a go using my {{champion:84}} jungle rune page of all things since he needed more AP to do it. I quite liked him with a point and click snare but he wasn't the fastest or safest jungler... then they changed the jungle to be much easier and now AoE junglers were king... and {{champion:57}} was suddenly great and his snare more important than survivability.\n\nas for other roles... I am a {{champion:22}} main in ADC. Used to play {{champion:51}} but there is something about {{champion:22}} auto attack that just clicks for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KonJoo","date":"2016-08-22T14:20:27.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice post. :)  here's mine: \n\ni started playling lol in season 3.  some Frieds showed me.

I'm still trying to get even better with him considering the meta doesn't favor him, but if I get going... You don't want to get in my way with the lich.\n\nNow as for {{champion:412}} I struggled with him when I was new because he was difficult, but now with him at Mastery 6.

I played him mid before I knew he was a jungler, most of time.This shit is OP as fuck, fearing/ silencing you for ten hours, which lets him the time to deal you 3000+ damages to you and your team -ult that can't be stopped because he has Zhonya-. \n\n{{champion:55}} As for Kat, well, I started playing her because she scared me. I mean, how can a champ -who doesn't need mana- can jump on you and run so fast during laning phase, and then melt your entire team in 2,5 seconds under a turret, after what she'll just jump away on a ward? Well, now I'm the one who melts teams. \nI have my own customized buid -depending on the game- which includes: Liche's bane + Duskblade (AD + sheen makes a good combo for pushing hard early, and help me backdooring open inhibs later), after all she scales on AD too, juste make sure to AA your target when you jump on it. And also, Luden's, because Duskblade's + Luden's move speed makes you super fast! \n\nAnyways, I overextended (why? because I can) but here are my two mainly played champions.
