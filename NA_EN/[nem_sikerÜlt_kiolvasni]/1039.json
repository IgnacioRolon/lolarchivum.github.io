Communication is clearly lacking sometimes at crucial points in the game, these teams with language barriers often aren't given the time to truly overcome them when such high expectations are placed on them from the time of their formation. Oh and if kid and kitties don't stop being the worst bot lane in the group they don't have a chance of making it out.
