I then closed and reopened league and it told me to 'reconnect to game' when I was not in one, I clicked it anyways and then the game kept crashing so I restarted my comp, restarted my modem and it still isn't working and continually doing the same thing over and over again. I have gone through this process many times. Can someone please help me, I would like to play. \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T18:01:22.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like what you experienced was what we refer to as a \"ghost game\". This typically happens when the game server didn't properly send the signal that the match was over and results were recorded. It generally won't last more than a few hours at most, but please let me know if you're still seeing this issue.","replies":[]}]}
