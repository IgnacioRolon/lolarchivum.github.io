Calling out artists that use digital tools is kind of rude. Their art is just as valid as someone else's, whether that is traditional, digital, a sketch, painting, or anything else.\r\nAlso, I managed to get in the top 30 by sketching out my drawing on paper more than once, uploading it to my computer once I was satisfied with my traditional piece, outlining it and coloring it digitally. This took around a week and was by no means easy.
