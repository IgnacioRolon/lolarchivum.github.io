C9 is often praised for their ability to quickly adapt. Like that is one of the things people praise them for the most. Casters and other teams talk about it all the time, I don't know how you haven't heard this before. \r\n\r\nOne recent example of their ability to adapt is their performance at worlds, just look at how they were able to find weaknesses in top korean teams. Granted it wasn't enough because there was a severe skill discrepancy in some lanes but they more than proved their adaptability in the way they turned what should have been one sided matches into having the winners barely holding on to their nexus. One flukey bo5 doesn't take away a trait they show consistently in their play. As you said, c9 doesn't usually need to resort to this skill as they have historically 3-0'd most of their competition in NA.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RIP my Qs","date":"2015-01-14T22:35:53.865+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":15,"body":"C9 #1","replies":[{"poster":"NsEternal","date":"2015-01-15T02:23:07.529+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":9,"body":"C9 all the way\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"FyreNinja","date":"2015-01-15T02:28:19.118+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":9,"body":"Nice logo you got there :)","replies":[{"poster":"dabs 4 jezus","date":"2015-01-15T02:40:45.170+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":9,"body":"C9 HYPE!","replies":[{"poster":"SVG PLAGUE","date":"2015-01-15T04:01:24.322+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":6,"body":"TURN UP","replies":[]},{"poster":"super sp4rt4n","date":"2015-01-15T06:28:30.379+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":8,"body":"C9 Whats That?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Englishh","date":"2015-01-15T05:01:01.141+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"GO Gentlemen Poros! they should be at #1 ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BARKBARKBARKBARK","date":"2015-01-14T23:26:39.805+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"UNICORNS OF LOVE","replies":[{"poster":"webbstaz","date":"2015-01-15T00:43:10.253+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw one game of them against TSM they wooped us :P\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Stirnae","date":"2015-01-15T06:06:39.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but they are going to nerf range junglers next patch so it will be a nerf to uol","replies":[{"poster":"TheTrumpCard","date":"2015-01-16T02:32:12.380+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You underestimate them... they don't just do ranged junglers, they have 3 players that play all kinds of fun weird picks, and the mechanical skill and teamwork that merit respect without the off-meta fun stuff.\r\n\r\nChanging to only 5 soft leashes before a hard leash is just nerfing that one odd stratergy of theirs, they have PLENTY more, and will contrinue to practice new ones as long as it's possible (which it always will be).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hi Im Shoggy","date":"2015-01-15T04:07:14.903+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yep top 3 NA teams this year C9 CLG and Curse\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Englishh","date":"2015-01-15T05:03:49.459+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"Sir, i think you accidentaly typed Curse instead of TSM, but it's fine we all make mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"PieRuler","date":"2015-01-15T12:30:19.983+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"TSM is NOT going to be better than Curse this split.","replies":[{"poster":"bykO1pLqxJ","date":"2015-01-15T17:55:08.400+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gonna be really hard for TSM to be worse than a team that doesn't exist.
