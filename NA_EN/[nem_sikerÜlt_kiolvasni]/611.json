They reminded him him of a fully stacked Cho'Gath after Lulu (487 RP) used his ult on him.\r\n\r\nAs he remembered this, he suddenly saw a strange, floating circle in the distance. He approached it with caution, one fireball on each hand. If he had learnt something after surviving in this hell for so many years was that he could never be \"too careful\".\r\n\r\nThe circle levitated, slowly and gently bobbing up and down, as the radioactive sand whirled around it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I know you,\" said Brand, his voice muffled behind his mask, \"I haven't seen you since season 2... Zilean\".\r\n\r\nShurima Desert Zilean (487 RP) turned around. He looked as old as always.\r\n\r\n\"Brand,\" he said in a slow, boring voice, \"it's been so many years.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can travel through time... Why didn't you stop all this from happening?\"\r\n\r\nZilean twisted his old, dusty lips into a smile.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Brand... You can't change the past.\"\r\n\r\nBrand suddenly felt lost. He finally met another human after so many years of wandering alone... And not just a human, but a person who could travel through time... Only to be told that their situation was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"Can you at least send me back? To a better place... And a better time?\"\r\n\r\nZilean shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No. But I can send you somewhere else. You see, there's one tree left in this world... Two people are trying to plant it, but they haven't succeeded yet. If you help them out, then maybe... Just maybe... You can save the world.\"\r\n\r\nZilean put Brand into some sort of magical bubble, and everything around him faded away.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Brand was standing in the middle of an empty sand field. A different one from where he had been. All these years had taught him to identify even the slightest difference in ground and sand colour.\r\n\r\nThen he saw someone who had been feared as being \"too OP\" back in the day.\r\n\r\n\"Ka... Kassadin?\" He whispered to Deep One Kassadin (260 RP), who stood in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"What the... Where did you come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's ok, I'm here to help. You need to plant a tree, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Morgana (292 RP) has been trying to root him for a while, but he keeps dodging her Q.\"\r\n\r\nBrand began wondering many things in that moment. What was wrong with Kassadin? Did all these years make him crazy? None of what he had just said made any sense at all.\r\n\r\nBut then it all did.\r\n\r\nMaokai (440 RP) was running around, zig zagging, as Morgana kept trying to bind him with her spell.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh, you've gotta be kidding me,\" said Brand as he rolled his eyes, and really quickly comboed Maokai and stunned him.\r\n\r\n\"NOW!\" Yelled Kassadin, and Morgana cast her Dark Binding.\r\n\r\n\"NOOO!!! You idiots!!! Leave me alone!\" Yelled Maokai, as his feet clasped the ground, roots coming out of them and deep into the soil.\r\n\r\nKassadin tossed a bucket of water at him, to extinguish Brand's flames (it would've been pretty funny if Brand had burnt the last tree on earth).\r\n\r\nMaokai fought for a while, but he eventually gave up and stood there, motionless as a tree.\r\n\r\n\"What now?\" Asked Brand.\r\n\r\n\"Now... We wait.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Chodmeister","date":"2014-06-05T14:51:20.199+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":8,"body":"All hail Lord Moriuz, may he someday quit his job as a teacher and work at Rito in the Lore department.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Bidentra","date":"2014-06-05T20:00:04.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Kenki","date":"2014-06-05T20:05:54.520+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"hm... let me see... right click on link, inspect element, it says unsafe/proxy link. go fk yourself and maybe you'll learn.","replies":[{"poster":"SladeXD","date":"2014-06-06T07:05:46.192+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"it says that for every link put on here. riot has a safety message they bring up no matter what you click so therefore its coded into every link posted","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whoadats Cray","date":"2014-06-05T20:13:19.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"any confirmation if this is legit or now?","replies":[{"poster":"Repugnancy","date":"2014-06-05T20:31:55.712+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"ye lele\r\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"fiveslash","date":"2014-06-05T14:47:20.471+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"your stories are too op!
