So far, you've done a fairly good job of taking care of the situation (Katarina, Poppy, Sion) but I believe that this situation is quite a bit more dire than some skin splash arts that are a little outdated. I believe this because the number of times people will see those outdated skins are far outnumbered by the number of times people will see the bland basic splash arts. Simply my opinion, hope someone from Riot sees this and gets back to me on the situation.
