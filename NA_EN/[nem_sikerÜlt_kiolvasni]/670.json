Mid-season is in NA, so the NA team is hosting it. EU team is hosting their finals abroad. I would wager that the next time an international event happens in EU, their local regional event will happen at the studio. \n\nIt's not just about money though, it's expensive in TIME too. Planning two events like this that close together would be an absurd burden and lead to the events likely being shoddy which none of us want. That's why they're doing ONE abroad event for each of the two largest regions during this time.

Second MSI is a international event not a NA event.
