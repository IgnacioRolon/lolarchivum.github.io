However in trying to gain an advantage over Shen Zed learns the way of the shadow. I thought it would be a cool idea for Zed to start off the game in white monk/ninja like robes and a sword like Shen but golden. He would throw white ninja stars and his shadow slash would be a 360 sword slash (also golden). Not much changes at level 6, only his shadow doesn't follow his exact movements anymore. Once he hits level 11 his robes become torn and his face is visible. He now throws dark shadows mixed with light instead of ninja stars. His shadow slash is also dark mixed with gold. Then at level 16 he literally becomes completely dark, a shadow of his former self.\r\nStage Voice Changes: Level 1: Calm voice, words of wisdom and justice.\r\nLevel 6: Confused powerful voice, voice changes between his shadow and himself\r\nLevel 11: Conflicting voice, dialogue of him battling his Shadow\r\nLevel 16: Angry voice, messages of silent destruction and death.\r\nLiving Shadow:\r\nLevel 1-5: Summons Shen (since this would be before their conflict) also this Shen would look different than the Champion Shen we see in games, because this would be before Shen became the Eye of Twilight.\r\nLevel 6-10: Summons a dark/gold shadow of himself\r\nLevel 11 - 15: Summons a ghostly shadow of his former self\r\nLevel 16 - 18: Summons a ghostly shadow of his current form\r\nTransformations:\r\nLevel 6: Zed roars and his shadow behind him comes alive\r\nLevel 11: Darkness tears at his robes\r\nLevel 16: Darkness Surges up from the ground and engulfs Zed. His Shadow laughs.","replies":[{"poster":"Dante Beleren","date":"2014-09-02T17:22:42.791+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made this for you.
