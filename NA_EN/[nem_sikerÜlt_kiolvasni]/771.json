Flame would beat a Jarvan in lane, and would farm like mad against a pure tank like Mao. \nSvenskeren must dedicate his attention to top and mid. There be monsters bot, and he will have more success if he coordinates with the solo lanes. \nDLift and Bjerg both need to bring a lot of damage if Xmithie and Olleh play tanky play makers. Galio or Tali mid won't cut it. \nDLift must push hard and pressure any time Olleh is gone from vision to draw him back to his ADC and keep the rest if their team safe from plays. \nBio must babysit Dlift all match and keep him alive. He's not a good play maker, so he MUST keep the backline safe or it's over. \nIf TSM loses vision and Olleh has room to roam and help Pobelter or Xmithie, GG. \n\nFor IMT to win, it's almost the opposite. \nFlame should take a decent champ top and just farm his heart away. Don't extend, keep that TP ready, and don't fall prey to a gank. \nPobelter needs to keep his head on a swivel. Watch for Sven, Xmithie, Olleh, and keep Bjerg occupied without dying. \nXmithie should endeavor to track Sven as much as possible, and look for opportunities to coordinate with Olleh and Cody. Bio will be tanky and DLift is dangerous, but early pressure can give them room to dive and take a lead. \nCody needs to simply stay near his team, let them protect him like they have been, and fire away. \nOlleh must take any opportunity to roam and make TSM fear him. He's almost like a second jungler if he's out of vision, And just by roaming can force everyone to freeze in a safe position until he is spotted. \n\nThe last time they played, Hauntzer was a big factor with Kled, the ults setting up teamfights and disrupting IMTs backline, but with the shift in the tank meta, I suspect this will be more difficult. \n\nI pick IMT to win, as they can be more flexible with who can set up plays around the map. Either way, this match-up is interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Archäen","date":"2017-08-30T19:34:02.610+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's hard to take your analysis seriously when you say this: \"Bio ...He's not a good play maker...\" ","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-08-30T21:29:41.108+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't follow Biofrost religiously or watch every TSM game, but I can say with confidence that Bio is a reactionary support. \nHe isn't like Olleh or Aphromoo where they make plays that force a fight and get picks.

It might be worth one attempt though. \nPlaying a carry top against Flame is a risky chance. The Flame Horizon happens when you survive exchanges against his Jarvan or Renekton, you limp away while he freely feasts....if you get away. Again, it MAY be worth trying because he hasn't looked as dominant lately as he did early in the split. \nIf Lee finally returns to Lee Sin, that would be a dangerous wild card. \n\nStill, champ select aside, I think the best way TSM will find success is to force plays in top and mid and not risk forcing plays against IMTs bot duo. \nSo...naturally as an IMT fan I hope they throw themselves into reckless dives in bot.","replies":[{"poster":"DEN15 512","date":"2017-08-31T04:46:45.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"faker played fizz a few weeks ago (don't remember the game)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahjistair","date":"2017-08-31T05:12:26.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait why are you acting like you are better than these guys when you are literally bronze 4 lol","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-08-31T16:08:35.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never claimed I was better.
