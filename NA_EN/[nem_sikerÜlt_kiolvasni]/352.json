While \"North America\" is sometimes shorthand for **Canada + the United States** or **Canada + the United States + Mexico**, most of Central America and several island nations are technically part of the North America continent. Not an uncommon slip-up though, 'cause the fact that we often call one North America and one Central America does sort of confuse things.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot swimbananas","date":"2019-07-23T03:53:46.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but for Riot regions its always been only US and Canada :P ","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-07-23T04:26:50.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot swimbananas,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=kcg9hig2,comment-id=000c000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-23T03:53:46.083+0000)\n>\n> Yes, but for Riot regions its always been only US and Canada :P\n\nEven *more* definitions!
