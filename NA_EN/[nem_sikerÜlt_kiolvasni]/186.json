It feels really weird to have these big Looney Tunes-esque effects next to characters like Talon who are very stiff and serious or even Garen, who is exaggerated in a way that doesn't feel intentionally silly. Even Jinx, arguably the most cartoony character in the roster to date, has animations that are very much grounded in a real feel, and that \"real\"ness is a big part of League's overall aesthetic.\r\n\r\nIt feels wrong for the game to have spent the better part of seasons 1-5 removing things like the original cel-shaded champ icons and summoner icons, releasing violent and gritty lore like Blood and Fortune, and then suddenly this one character is so out of place with silly animations.","replies":[{"poster":"Partiest Cat","date":"2015-12-15T19:59:08.580+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel you!  \r\n\r\nThe general \"League style\" has trended more towards exaggeration as time has gone on, but in different ways for different champs.

The only thing that could be heard was the voice of an excited yordle in the woods.\r\n\r\n“... but I’ve been using the hammer.” Poppy{{champion:78}}  said, chattering one-sidedly to a lazy and rather placid nearby squirrel. “It’s meant for the hero, I hope he doesn’t mind.” She had been waiting patiently for a long time. The hero was rumored, by a reliable source, to make an appearance in these woods. “Today’s the day I find that hero! I can’t stop thinking about how amazing … sigh, talking to a squirrel, Lulu{{champion:117}}  would be proud” she said, rolling her eyes.\r\n\r\nWith this she continued waiting in silence, which was significantly more boring. She didn’t do it for long though, before she heard a startling yell; a distant voice harshly screamed command.\r\n\r\nPoppy{{champion:78}}  quickly sprang into action, dashing towards the source of the noise. She found herself at the base of a sharp incline; a rigid mountain. She hid herself in a brush as she looked all around for the source of the noise. She saw a tiny figure approach, a young boy. Doubtful that he was capable of the aforementioned ugly scream, she remained hidden.\r\n\r\n*Crack*\r\n\r\nBefore Poppy{{champion:78}}  even had time to think, she found herself springing into action once more, instantly reacting to an incoming boulder, and tackling the boy out of harm’s way mere seconds before he was flattened. Once again she found herself necessitating another quick reflex as she was now directly under the rapidly approaching boulder.\r\n\r\n(Read the rest here: https://www.facebook.com/mikeshortstories/posts/322059801250951 )","replies":[{"poster":"MildRetaliation","date":"2015-12-15T23:47:08.786+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool story!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2015-12-15T19:37:29.654+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you guys do an animation blog on Zac at some point?","replies":[{"poster":"Partiest Cat","date":"2015-12-15T19:47:27.595+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't get a chance to work on Zac, but I'll pass it along to the guys that did!","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2015-12-15T19:51:42.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man.
