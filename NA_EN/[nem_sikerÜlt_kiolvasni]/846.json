If everyone was super op, no one would care about lore at all, it wouldn't make sense, and it wouldn't be a good or believable world. \r\nAnd even if there was a power differential, you realize that the premise of lol is that the fights take place in an arena heavily altered by magic and the combatants are summoned by summoners who wield a limited amount of the combatants power. If it wasn't like that, yeah gragas would lose to darkin, but aurelion sol would just snap twice and kill everyone.

Talon also has lots of lore currently to work with. After all, if you look into the lore of Cassiopia and Katarina, you will find out that Swain and LeBlanc know where General Du Couteau has disappeared too. It's implied that they killed him since in Talon's reveal, it shows two twin roses(LeBlanc) choking a fallen blade(General Du Couteau) while a three-eyed bird is perched on top(Swain).\r\n\r\n     As for your second point, while Cassiopia and Katarina are sisters, Talon is not related to them and just works for their dad (General Du Couteau). While Talon and Katarina may work together from time to time, Cassiopia prefers to stay secluded after the cursed serpent sword turned her from a beautiful woman into the snake woman she is now(LORE CHANGES BE DAMMED!!!). As a result, she doesn't even let her own father near here, so why would she let her sister(Katarina) or some guy she hears about from the chatter of her personal guards(Talon) near her to strike up a conversation and create the bond that would lead to that voice line interaction.\r\n\r\n     Overall, Talon doesn't need a lore rework or a voice rework. Riot just needs to put back the original lore into the game for all to see since learning how to navigate the lore pages on the site here is a major pain. You truly are The Devil for saying something so evil like lore being changed, especially for Talon who has such a rich lore if you willing to look for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ahripink","date":"2019-02-05T20:19:44.123+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can you please update the lore of Sona, she is from Demacia and we don’t know her current status, I would appreciate it!","replies":[{"poster":"Beeee","date":"2019-02-05T20:34:57.517+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"We know Lux is Sona's \"biggest fan\" and that Lux \"even knows what an Etwahl is\" ;) what more do you need to know? \r\n{{sticker:sg-jinx}} \r\n\r\nI'm kidding, I agree, an update would be nice for Sona {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kit DoubleEdge","date":"2019-02-07T00:21:23.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't her magic secret?
