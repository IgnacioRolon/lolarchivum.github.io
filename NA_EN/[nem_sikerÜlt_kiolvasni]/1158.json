Wonder where he went? Oh well it doesn't matter to me. What matters is getting his next date going. Today is Leona. And to make sure it doesn't end like his date with Lux, I have told her in advance about not blinding him and to be aware of that dragon lady. **\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} Thanks for taking me here to eat tonight. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}} It's no problem. I am actually curious about this place as I have never been here before. \r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} Oh it great. And the cook is amazing. In fact her he comes now. \r\n\r\n{{champion:80}} Welcome to Targon, the restaurant with food from Mount Targon itself.  \r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} I will have my usual. \r\n\r\n{{champion:80}} Very well and for the Gentleman I recommend our steak. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}} That sounds good. Haven't had one in a long time. \r\n\r\n{{champion:80}} Excellent. And for dessert I recommend our 'If you do anything to make her cry I will break your back, throw you down a well, and skywall in after you' soufflé. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}} *gulp* Ok sir. \r\n\r\n{{champion:80}} Excellent. I will be back later with your food.\r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} *giggle* It ok if this is a one time date. I usually just make guys bring me here for the food. I love it but it is expensive for me. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}} Oh thank god. \r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} Yeah let us just enjoy this night without anyone trying to kill us. Speaking of which, I don't see that dragon lady I was warned about. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}} She at the doctor today. She wasn't feeling well this morning. \r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} Oh my I hope it not serious. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}}  Nah she probably just caught a cold from the weather changing so much lately. \r\n\r\n{{champion:80}} A drink for you Leona, compliments from that person at the bar. \r\n\r\n{{champion:131}} *waves seductively*\r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} Oh dear god. Can't you do anything about her please?\r\n\r\n{{champion:80}} Can't. She owns this place. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}} Umm..am I missing something?\r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} We were...drunk during News Years..stuff happen. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}} Oh....OH.\r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} Let's change the subject. Unless you want to talk about what happen to you on New Years. \r\n\r\n{{champion:59}} Nope. \r\n\r\n\r\n*At the Doctor*\r\n\r\n{{champion:102}} So is everything alright. \r\n\r\n{{champion:85}} I am not sure.
