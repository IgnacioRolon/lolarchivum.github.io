I'm hoping right behind them will be Dignitas and CLG; I want those three teams to represent North America at World's.

I like the other teams, but these 2 have play styles that I find fun to watch, as opposed to having someone AMAZING like Bjergson or DoubleLift, and 4 other players who have to try and keep up with their incredible talents.

I realize it's only a small amount now, but it just keeps growing and soon there won't even be an American in the NA league anymore. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking just get rid of the leagues then and have World league only if this is what they want to do.
