Could anybody help me solve a problem about downloading the game?\r\nThis morning, I went to the download page of LOL, and I pressed the download bottom. After doing so, I began to setup. However, I met a problem that my setup program was block at the status which was extracting prerequisite software. Now, my setup program still sticks at that status and I still cannot setup the game.\r\nThat's very weird. I really want to play the game. Could anybody who knows the solution for this problem helps me?
