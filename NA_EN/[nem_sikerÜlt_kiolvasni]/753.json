So by keeping URFs appearance short it piques interest without establishing behavior that would cause a player to do poorly (and thus quit) once they went away from URF.\r\n\r\nOn that note though, It would be awesome to keep it around, but URF would evolve into something less than fun if it was put through the wringer as a permanent gamemode.\r\n\r\nSo enjoy it for now!
