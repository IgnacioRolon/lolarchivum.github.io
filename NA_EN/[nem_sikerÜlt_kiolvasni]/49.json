This is also unfair matchmaking. And I'll bet that the data would also show these matchups winning more often as well. \r\n\r\n2: There are issues in low elo as well. As you go up the ladder, people get more consistently even in skill level. People may make more positioning mistakes or just plain poor choices. \r\n\r\nHowever, in low elo, the skill discrepancy can be HUGE even between bronze 3 and silver 5.  and again from silver 5 to silver 2. With people ebing able to queue together between bronze 3 and silver 3, that opens a single game up to incredibly uneven fights that can win or lose a game just because a person cannot hold his own weight in a game due to everyone else in the game being above his individual skill level. \r\n\r\nMatchmaking needs to tighten up for fairer games.

They're not. Role selection is a feature that DQ uses. DQ can exist without role selection and role selection can exist without DQ.\n\nPersonally, my problem has nothing to do with role selection. All of my problems are with the fact solo queue and premades are ranked together:\n\nThey \"rank\" two different things. I don't want to win against a premade team because I'm playing against a premade of worse players. That isn't a valuable experience at all to me. Just because you quantified the value of their \"premade-ness\" and adjusted for it doesn't mean we're equally skilled. It means the thing I care about in solo queue (mechanical skill, strategy, adaptation and coordination with strangers) plus this adjustment beats what I care about in a premade queue (mechanical skill and strategy given perfect communication tools) results in an equal win rate. Congrats, you quantified it. I don't give a shit. I don't want to see how good I am with that adjustment.\n\nIn regards to the video, Riot spent half an hour trying to justify their decision when it's based off assumptions. For one assume they can project their values onto other people. Example: You're willing to trade these ladder issues to quell in game harassment. I'm not. For the most part I straight up don't care about in game harassment (no, I don't flame people at all). I'm not interested in everybody getting along; I'm interested in winning. Part of winning is being able to overcome those issues, which premades teams (shouldn't) have an issue with. You're implying you don't value that as a skill, so you're just going to adjust for it in your matchmaking. Don't pretend you know what I want, because you've been getting it wrong for years now.\n\nYou also mention how you're trying to balance all these different levers (quality, time, etc.), yet the two people in the room that aren't from Riot disagree with what they want. You will never find one solution to satisfy us all. If you try to do so you're going to end up with the lowest common denominator and nobody will be very happy. If I care about my role then let me pick one role. I'll wait for the queue. If I care about time let me queue for more than two roles. Let me tell you what I want, not the other way around.\n\nAlso, you're falling into the \"when all you have is a hammer\" problem: You're trying to fix a bunch of issues solely based on matchmaking. Look at the role selection chart you have. I'm sure you're aware, but it's inversely proportional to how many people want to play that role. Support has fundamental issues that you have no plans to fix any time soon. ADCs and supports are frustrated that they get 5 man turret dove constantly, and that their roles are way more team reliant than other roles. Just start by fixing the support role and I'm sure you'll put a pretty good dent in your precious queue times.\n\nAfter you look at the chart maybe realize why premades were so frustrated. You have one game mode that you give a damn about and it's 5v5. Maybe give Twisted Treeline some love and 3 man premades will be happier. And by \"some love\" I mean you treat SR and TT as equals. Dragon has been fundamentally changed and re-tweaked repeatedly for the last few years. Vilemaw hasn't been touched since it was added. You would never add an item to TT that would break SR, yet you've been doing the inverse for years. Personal anecdote: I've had three friends and all the time I think \"Maybe we should play on TT,\" which is quickly followed by, \"Fuck that, it's broken as hell.\" I would _love_ to play on a balanced TT. Too bad you made the decision for us that League of Legends is nothing but 5v5 on SR.\n\nI don't know if it's pride, putting too much faith into statistics, or what, but you can't seem to admit that you should undo your mistakes. You have this \"roll forward\" attitude that just digs you you into a deeper hole. I started playing LoL less and less over the course of season 6. I love some of the new skins, but my wallet has been closed to you for the past couple months. Now I have Overwatch installed and I'm having a blast.

People should be able to opt into 1 role selection knowing that their queue time may be longer. Don't wanna wait for mid queue times? That's the price of playing only mid. Pick a secondary or a different role if you can't handle that. \r\n\r\nAs far as teams vs solos, I've said it 100 times but teams should never fight solo players. MMR difference can never make up for the strength of coordination without stacking the MMR so in favor of the solo guys that it feels unfair for the 5 man. Why can't 5 man teams just fight 5 man teams and so on? We don't have to have instant queue times. We just want fair games and agency over our roles we play.
