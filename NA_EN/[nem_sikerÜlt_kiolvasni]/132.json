It's possible that the patcher may have been stopped at some point during the download.  If t here's an interruption or it closes out, then the patcher needs to recan files to make sure nothing is corrupt.  Once the scan is complete, it can resume with downloading the patch.  Unless you have any error messages, your best bet is to just let it do its thing without any interruptions.  Hang tight until it's done!","replies":[]}]}
