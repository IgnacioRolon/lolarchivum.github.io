The only reason I can think of is that maybe your just unhappy about your rank and want to go through provisionals again to maybe obtain a higher rank. Besides that I don't see why people care. I personally enjoy the new DynamicQ due to being able to queue up with more then one friend and because of the fact that we can now add teammates along the way. For example, lets say I am duoing with a support main as an ADC and we encounter a good jungler in one of our games, boom, we can add them to the queue and build up a team like that.

It's really frustrating when I try to get an S on her for champion mastery, and I played really well, but I don't get a good grade because I didn't do damage or heal a bunch since most of Janna's kit is utility from her constant shielding and her disengage.
