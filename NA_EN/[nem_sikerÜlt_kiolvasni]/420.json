Evelynn can go anywhere and not be seen, but he is almost always seen no matter what he does. To me that seems unfair to Aurelion Sol. You want to recall in a bush, nope because the enemy Lee Sin will know exactly where to Q and hit you based on the stars. Any other champion would have a chance to recall safely.","replies":[{"poster":"Pastor Noodles","date":"2016-03-16T21:14:51.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Just think if an enemy champion was close enough to a bush to be hit by his stars, they would be taking damage from an invisible source and that would be incredibly unfair","replies":[{"poster":"ValiantDogFood","date":"2016-03-16T22:17:40.184+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"After the first hit he would be revealed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaruTheDoggo","date":"2016-03-17T02:58:34.503+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes because being hit be invisible things isn't in the game {{champion:20}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:20}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheCauthonater","date":"2016-03-16T23:56:35.537+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps, but trying to flash juke when your being chased can be pretty instrumental in surviving, but that's a large element of game play he simply can do, and they can see it from much further away.

Why does his ultimate feel so anti-climatic. To me it feels as if his ultimate doesn't make sense with his character or his kit as a whole.

His whole kit kind of revolves around his stars whether it be expanding their range, throwing one, or sucking them up and flying as one, then his ult is like... huh? No stars, not tied to his kit at all. Its very anticlimactic, it really doesn't feel \"dragon-y\" Its almost supporty rather than powerful.

A black hole is a dead star, he'd never kill his own work. The reason his Q is what it is, is because of balance. He needs that stun on a short CD, and it was made with comboing with E in mind. THE ult fits in the kit due to the fact that it works with W.
