In this season however, there are 2 types of ranked games (solo/duo and flex). My question is: after the end of the 2017 season, when you play normals or aram, which border will appear around your character? (from solo/duo or from flex?)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-15T19:05:03.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We updated the [Preseason FAQ ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/231832207-Preseason-FAQ)to give details on border visual based on your queue.  There are a lot of queues involved, but here are the ones specific to your question:\n\nRanked Solo/Duo - 2016 Dynamic Queue\nRanked Flex 5v5 - Best of 2016 Dynamic Queue or Ranked 5s (not available until Patch 6.23)\nRanked Flex 3v3 - 2016 Ranked 3s (not available until Patch 6.23)\nNormal Summoner's Rift - Best of 2016 Dynamic Queue or Ranked 5s\nNormal Twisted Treeline - Best of 2016 Dynamic Queue or Ranked 3s\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2016-11-13T02:40:31.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two corrections.\n1. Iirc, in previous seasons, borders have been based on your highest rank out of the three ranked queues. Gold 3s, Silver Solo, and Bronze 5s would display a Gold border in general. However, queuing for a ranked queue would display the specific border for that queue (e.g. Silver border in Solo queue in that previous example).\n2. There's three types of ranked games this season:  SR Solo/Duo, SR Flex,, and TT Flex.\n\nAs to your question, Riot probably hasn't decided on how ranked rewards will work yet. Borders will probably continue to be based on highest rank in any queue, but it's not definite.","replies":[]}]}
