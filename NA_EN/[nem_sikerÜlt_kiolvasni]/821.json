There are over 100+ pages to go through and Riot sincerely expects fair voting for entries? It's absurd, to say the least. It will blatantly end up being a popularity contest because no one besides people who care for art or feel sorry for the people getting the short end of the stick will vote sincerely using the site. People are relying on making threads/social media posts to boost their votes up because \"woobox\" has a terrible set up for such a contest, ultimately leading up to this being a popularity contest instead of people just genuinely voting for entries.\r\nIt's poor taste to set up a contest and have fans wade through dozens of entries FOR Riot, especially with how badly spread out the entries are. Only 21 entries per page in a contest that was globally promoted? And you expect people to just go through most or all of them? You sincerely can't expect this fanbase to sift through entries for Riot just so they can cherry pick at the end of it all. It's unfair to almost everyone who entered. Especially since the community itself are the ones who are policing the entries and not Riot/Woobox.\r\nAnd as for the link? It isn't common sense to save a randomly thrown out link. There was no indication that the link was needed. All the confirmation page showed was that the entry was submitted and a random link next to it, that ultimately lead to nothing at the time if you actually went to said link. The website itself doesn't even have accounts that people could use to save their submissions in or grab from later on. It isn't a sign of caring enough or not to hold on to a random link that did nothing at the time and had no signs of doing anything for future events because there was no clear indication of so.\r\nAll in all, the idea of this contest was in the right area.
