TSM had a few slip ups early game which caused them to fall into their base. TL still played great and was an amazing game to watch. Just enjoy the game for what it is and dont get so bitchy over it.

TSM was in control at the end. Liquid had all the buffs in the world; 5 dragons, baron, red/blue buff, all 3 lanes of baron-buffed super-minions... and couldn't finish the game. Not only was TSM winning those teamfights at the end, they were winning them CONVINCINGLY, often losing just one guy for an ace.\r\n\r\nTSM needed to wait til that top inhib respawned so that the Nexus was invulnerable and couldn't be backdoored. One more ace would have seriously swung the game, because with no super-minions pushing into the base, TSM would be free to take at least 1 inhib from Liquid with the death timers being that long.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether they felt greedy, or forgot about Rek'Sai's ult, but TSM made that crucial mistake of sending too many people out of base to get baron. The only thing Liquid did that \"won\" the game.. was take advantage of a TSM mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"Ah Já","date":"2015-02-26T01:28:31.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is absolute and utter bull****. TSM had practically no control over any objective throughout the game. Mainly due to TL's vision game and crucial out-rotations and ganks. They were able to put a good fight at the end, yes, but that was because jinx is a late-game monster, and TL's team didn't scale particularly well at all: it was a mid game comp. And they won the mid game so hard, that they could afford to have a much inferior late-game comp. TSM got outplayed this time, regardless of them being a much better team in general.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"spillproof26","date":"2015-02-24T16:26:43.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so if you won a game back dooring the team you are playing means you dont deserve it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cybersurgeon","date":"2015-02-23T21:02:43.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The team that won is the team that deserves to win.

A loss is a loss, but this article makes it sound like they won NA or something lol. Not to mention, the end of the game was anything, but smooth. This article just feels over the top for me.

Idk what you're on about, wouldn't you feel accomplished if you took out the number one team in the LCS/Region? That's why they're called KingSlayers in this article. Because it is a great accomplishment. It doesn't matter if the ending wasn't smooth because as the article said they methodically took all three inhibitors. That means they outplayed them on the entire map prior to their end game team fight blunders. Cool Wildturtle got a penta, Cool Dyrus ninja'd the second Penta. It was entertaining man, if you don't right an upbeat article about a team giving TSM their first loss of the season what do you write an article about then? People will always find something to complain about and my god, it's annoying.

Yes, it resulted in their loss, but in the position they were in, it was either make their move or stand next to the Winions as they slam the nexus.  The game was lost so much earlier than that; they weren't able to take any objectives, and Liquid starved them out.

I'm more annoyed with how this article portrays the victory like Dominate and Liquid did something amazing to win. They had the better early game, got objectives, and then couldn't end the game with like 7 dragons and 3 barons. They won in the end, but it was nothing spectacular. \r\n\r\nThe fact that this article even exists, like Liquid did some spectacular feat, just hurts my brain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaSmurff","date":"2015-02-25T04:15:31.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I read these comments and wonder, do people look at turret counts? anyone?
