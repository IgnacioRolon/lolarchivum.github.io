While the timers will make the jungle more accessible to inexperienced players--which is, actually, almost always a good thing from a design perspective and only bad from a crotchety old man's \"get-off-my-lawn\" perspective--there is still a world of difference between somebody who has to look for the timers and then react and somebody who has them memorized and is already moving into position based on available information. This is the difference between the actual skill--jungling--and the \"skill\"--memorizing timers.\r\n\r\nAlso, this discussion completely ignores the fact that many people have been using non-CV third-party programs to track jungle timers for ages, in no small part because there are so many camps to keep track of that it legitimately might not be possible for some players otherwise.
