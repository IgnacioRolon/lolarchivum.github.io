It is sometimes a pain to have to keep switching clients because of the benefits of each client.\r\n\r\nInstead of an account button to change summoner name and switch servers, it would be ascetically and functionally more convenient for it to be a main tab under store. \r\n\r\nLast thing. I see Riot is striving to give the summoner all the information from a game via replays and enhanced amount of stats straight from the match history than to go on a web browser. But it would be nice to see what the old client did which gave us stats on certain champions in ranked. I used to try to up my CS per game to look at my average or to see how much i have played then and how well i did with a single champion. With the new client, it only tells us games played and win ratio. Which in my case, doesn't do much. \r\n\r\nSorry for the ramble. Those are things that I feel would help make the client better and more useful for everyone. By implementing some ideas from the old client to the new one!\r\n\r\nHoped this helped out a bit!\r\n\r\nThanks for listening\r\n\r\n-InfernoFoxxx","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Grumbles","date":"2016-12-08T02:33:31.896+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have some updates to the shop planned for early next year that will make the shop smoother.\r\n\r\nWe added support for rotating game modes to the updated client with 6.24.
