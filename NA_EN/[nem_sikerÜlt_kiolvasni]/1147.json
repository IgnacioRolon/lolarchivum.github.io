Not only does this help your team's cohesion (which is most important for enjoying the game, if not for winning) because you can pick and counterpick for any role, but it means you can understand, to a degree, the way your teammates think and your opponents think.

Go even in lane? Don't feed? That's asking quite a lot of a person who might be playing their least capable role against a laner who might MAIN that role. You cannot expect a person who is weak at support to be able to \"do their job\" against a support main. They are gonna get REKT and then get blamed for the loss, even though they gave it their best.\r\n\r\nI always hate when people say you need to be able to play all roles \"well\" or \"do your job\" or whatever, because to me it sounds like \"I expect you to either win lane or go even in lane no matter what role you play or who you are up against\" and that isn't exactly an easy task. I guarantee you the people saying this couldn't actually do it either.\r\n\r\nThere's also a thing with time commitment where not everyone can commit hundreds of hours to learn 15+ champs well enough to \"do their job\". It's better focus on ONE role and ONE champion and get extremely good with them. You are more of an asset to your team that way, than if you were just \"doing your job\" in 3 roles.\r\n\r\nIn the end it's all just a random juggle... maybe you get the dream team of 5 mains who all get their role. Maybe you get 3 top mains, or maybe you get the lame duck team of 5 people who are only mildly okay in their lanes, and they get screwed because one guy on the enemy team actually mains a single champ and gets super fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Olath Quortek","date":"2015-03-14T13:46:10.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion \"you have to at least be able to do your job\" means losing as slow as you can and dying as little as you can so that the people who got the positions they actually wanted can carry... you don't have to be a strong top laner, but at least take telleport, farm top, and try to show up mid to late game without having fed your opponent too much...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EmoMummy","date":"2015-03-11T04:26:31.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"nicoli","date":"2015-03-09T08:03:45.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The MOST annoying thing when it comes to ranked queues are the people who have lets say 3rd pick on blue team.  Therefore, you pick at the same time as the 2nd pick on blue team.  Therefore, although you know that the second pick has pick order over you, but you want to be a dick, you autolock whatever you want, then be like \"we pick at the same time\".  Just no, anyone who does that really needs to understand that 2nd pick is before 3rd pick, no matter what time your picks take place, and need to respect pick order.  With that being said, you need to be able to play each role, and play a champion atleast close to the meta in the game that day.  This means if you can't play thresh or morgana support effectively, atleast play a support like janna, or taric, don't sit there and grab teemo because you don't know how to support.  If you can't play an actual support effectively, go queue up some team builder before you play ranked.  This will make you more effective for your team, and make you have a better shot at winning the game overall.  Just because you learn how to play support for instance, doesn't mean you have to play it if you don't want to.  If you have pick order and get a more desired role, play it, but don't completely not learn a different role because you're better at one.  Also, if someone on your team tells you their prefered role, and you aren't the best at that role, bite the bullet and play another role, you may get carried.  Nothing is more annoying then being 3rd pick, and ending up top jungle or adc, while mid lane(my best role) is taken by the guy who had first pick, who ends up with 40 cs at 25 minutes.

How are you deciding who is 2nd and 3rd pick then? Both players immediately get to pick champs, but one might be in the top right corner of the screen and one in the bottom left... One might be to the left of the other, or above the other, etc...\r\n\r\nIt's only your own PERSONAL RULE that because you are ABOVE the person, you come first. That's silly. Going by the GAME'S rule, it goes \"person at top picks first, then two people below that person pick, then final two people pick\". There is no 2nd and 3rd, and no 4th and 5th picks.\r\n\r\nHow about this... my personal rule is that when the game lets two people pick, the person at the bottom gets to pick first. Everyone should follow this rule because I said so.","replies":[{"poster":"Konidias","date":"2015-03-09T20:09:31.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can take it one step further:\r\n\r\nIf Riot REALLY wanted there to be specific pick order, they could have easily made it so only one player could pick at a time, and still allow 2 players on one side to pick before 2 players on the other side can pick. But this is not the case. They allow 2 players to pick AT THE SAME EXACT TIME. Why? Because they aren't constraining the pick order from top to bottom. They are merely grouping the pick time into segments of the team.\r\n\r\n1 guy gets to pick first, then 2 people, then the final 2 people. There is no \"1st pick goes, then 2nd, then 3rd, then 4th...\"\r\n\r\nWhat if they started first pick at the bottom? Would you just say bottom to top is the final pick order then?

It simply makes sense to go from top to bottom.  Your place in the line is determined randomly, and people need to respect that you won't always be as high on the list as you want.\r\n\r\nThe 2 players picking at the exact same time is for convenience.  It would take far too long to wait a full minute for every player in the match to pick their champion.\r\n\r\nAlso, the first person picks first, the last person picks last.  This is how champion select works.  It only makes sense that the other players in the lobby follow a similar rule.  If it were bottom to top, unintuitive though that may be, then it would go backwards.  If they were strewn around the screen, which would be ridiculous, then it would be a madhouse anyways and we'd worry about the UI more than second pick and third pick.\r\n\r\nYou're not always going to be on top in life.  Just accept that being third in line means that the two people above you get the roles they want before you do.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AtlanticQuake","date":"2015-03-07T03:42:59.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have never been less exited for a new champ.
