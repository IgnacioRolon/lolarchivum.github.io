NO, just no.\r\n\r\nthey're keeping it from getting balanced and that's what's making it stale. even now for most roles the meta is heavily constrained at top level and even for lower levels you have to work 2x as hard or be 2x as good to make a non-meta pick work out as well. let's say someone goes Trundle JG... easy effective, good scaling, good from behind, you go Ekko or Diana or some other shit like Fiddlesticks and Wukong. You're useless by comparison unless you pop off hard. They're useful all game and in all situations. if this game were truly balanced, it would be so much richer, more expressive, more interesting and more fun than any of the changes they can make to shake things up. and the meta would still change anyway but it would do so organically not because 4 more patches happened and now they want to make all your theorycrafted effort and builds useless again.. now yet again you have to find what you enjoy/if anything etc. it's like if someone took your girlfriend every few months and then gave you a random new girl with the same name. \r\n\r\nI don't mind the changes if they lead somewhere but I expect them to actually \"finish\" this game at some point and have balance after that. this game's most successful seasons and its height of popularity I think was probably S4 and they changed it far less during those times. it also felt like you were less dependent on the meta to carry and win. now even in mid MMR I have to go fairly meta picks or undiscovered but strong picks or I can't carry. and in general, being so team dependent creates a cancerous environment. no shit people rage when they feel that that they're so dependent on others for their own performance. give people the tools to hard carry any game if good enough and no one would bother berating their team. they'd realize that it's all up to them so it's just a waste of energy. now, you really need your team and even the best jg picks are team reliant. it's horrible and feels unfair but maybe it's because I wanted league to be a skill game more than a team game.","replies":[{"poster":"YareYareÐaze","date":"2018-05-08T00:07:06.067+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":6,"body":"Have you ever heard of Arcsecond?!

We probably won't see the full impact until they get some work in on some problem support classes, but even with just this, ADCs builds are going to slow down significantly (at least crit ones are) - and that should cause a meta shift away from win bot win game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Joshtheliberator","date":"2018-05-07T19:00:25.699+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a Master Yi main's favorite dream, items that are just like his ult {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} Let the fun begin","replies":[{"poster":"SmokityHerbman","date":"2018-05-07T19:04:12.165+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"As a Master Yi main with half a million exp on the champ I can say I'm super pumped.
