Look firstly just at the level of play in NA and you can see a huge improvement, but even in other regions lots of teams have been really stepping it up and this worlds I'd say there wasn't a huge skill gap between most of the teams (with a few exceptions). While NA is out now :( they made a much better showing than last year and I'm looking forward to a close finals (fingers crossed). A lot of people see a game where say Hai has 5 less kills than his opponent mid laner and say \"Oh see? that guy's so inferior\" but really at this high level play, they're all pretty close in skill and it really comes down to the champs, teams, communication, and split second decision. So while scores may vary widely I felt that very few games showed one side far and away better than the other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toxi IRL","date":"2014-10-11T06:06:52.904+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I cant belive this OMG beats Fnatic :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gado Dylan","date":"2014-10-10T12:28:56.896+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too bad C9 didn't make it they did amazing!","replies":[]},{"poster":"im Cris","date":"2014-10-10T04:16:36.816+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"OMG <3 China's time to shine.

Like in physical sports (soccer etc) its about support,funding and promotion. Asia is the number one continent for e-sport talent- support,funding and promotion.

They even got hospitals for addictive gaming behaviour. Im not saying thats a positive thing. It just shows how intense the gaming culture is in Asia. \r\n\r\nSo how fix the problem ?
