Make sure that you're downloading League from the [official site](https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload), and that your PC has permissions to read and write the installation.  Best way to make sure is by going through the steps in our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to give access. Hopefully that will get you fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
