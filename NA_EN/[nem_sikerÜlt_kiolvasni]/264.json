I was the one that suggested we bring Kay to campus and promote her work. I wanted to do that because of how positive, and geninuninly fun to watch her streams are. While yes, while painting she is not wearing much, its due to the nature of bodypainting as an art form (an art that is very different than cosplay, and isnt cosplay). Her streams focus on positvity and bringing up her community, something I wanted to share wih our larger league community as well. \r\n\r\nCorrect me if I’m wrong, but it sounds like you are upset about the “hey, we might have made Kai’Sa too revealing for her character type” announcement and how that feels very opposite of what is happening here. I can 100% see how that feels like we are saying two different things at the same time. However, I just ask that you dont take it out on our league community member, who did this paint out of passion. As a company we wanted to promote the postivity of her stream, something I saw cery clearly when watching it for the first time. We are always trying to experiment with ways to celebrate our creative community, and are still finding the best way to do that. \r\n\r\nI’m personally sorry that you feel this was a little weird given our statement, and I wanted to say thankyou for being willing to jump in and express how it felt a little off. I still stand by my decison to suggest Kay for this project, as I personally think she is a great artist, a positive member of our community, and an all around amazing human.

I was especially happy to hear Riot Jynx comment that the room was toasty, because I've watched Kay through 2 winters now and I know how getting cold causes her pain. So it felt like they were actually catering to her health as well for this, and that is AWESOME because so many people just dismiss an artist's state of being and concentrate only on their final products instead.
