Def Not Dominion quite frankly sucks compared to old Dominion. \r\n\r\nThe removal of the bottom towers was the worst possible thing you could have done. Before, if you couldn't hold top, you could contest towers elsewhere. Mobile champs could backdoor towers for their team. Champs that were better 1v1 could go bot.\r\n\r\nNow, the mode is just a constant 5v5 at the top point. If you can't hold it, well, prepare to get stomped. There's nothing you can do at that point. At least if bot was opened up, you could use it as a backdoor path for the enemy's tower. But not only was it closed off, but they also gave permanent vision of the only backdoor route.\r\n\r\nEssentially what this has come down to is a half circle shaped ARAM map with capture points that just ensure that no comebacks are ever possible.\r\n\r\nThanks Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLikepoopiee","date":"2016-10-08T02:59:34.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"ATTENTION EVERYONE! {{champion:63}} Is the BEST against the Doom Bots of Doom!
