There is no reason they would lower it that much (less than legendary).  People who buy ultimate skins either have the money to spare or are good with that champ.  I'll be getting it because I play Sona ranked before this was even revealed.  It would be nice for a small discount like hte 25% but I doubt it and if they did it would only be that way for a day or 2 max.","replies":[{"poster":"AG63","date":"2015-02-23T23:28:41.070+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":7,"body":"I mean, they did it for Ez and Udyr, so why not for Sona?\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Dracobalt","date":"2015-02-24T06:46:03.800+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":12,"body":"Ez and Udyr were done because it would still bring enough profit to Riot even at that low of a price. They basically just evolve. Ez just goes pulsefire and ends up futuristic which is nice. Udyr's skills make him look for like that animal spirit based on how many points per skill. Sona has 3 forms which have a song each...these 3 forms have a different effect on each of her auras as well as skill animations...uncluding auto attacks. The songs evolve as she levels up her ultimate is what I've heard though haven't tested that one out myself. All teammates have the option of being included and listening to the song of Sona's current form. Yes...obviously Sona deserves to be down at around 50% value like Udyr and Ez because they all had the same amount of work done...Funny! I would love to have it at 50% off but I also don't see how it would be fair to Riot at all. If we want to enjoy ALL the work they've put into this skin...I say their price is actually quite fair though that's more out of my wallet...but hey! a lot of work truly was put into this skin. If you want it then price looks fair. If you don't think so or don't like the skin...no need to buy it :D easy as that!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2015-02-23T23:53:23.891+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":15,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AG63,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=P0OXgkd5,comment-id=0025000000010000,timestamp=2015-02-23T23:28:41.070+0000)\n>\n> I mean, they did it for Ez and Udyr, so why not for Sona?\n\nDid PFE or SGU involve 6 different music production groups under various record labels?  PFE and SGU were likely done completely in-house, while DJS may have a smaller percentage of its sales as revenue for Riot.  Did they pay the producers/publishers a flat fee?  Are they paying flat royalties?  Percentage royalties?  Did each group agree to different financial terms?  We don't know.

Like, 3 hours of audio is months upon months of practice, tweaking, recording, rerecording, more tweaking, coding it into the game, retweaking for better cohesion between the skin and songs, and Shurima knows what else. \r\nLike, we get it: you all want free stuff. But believe you me, even if they decided not to do a discount, the RP price is well worth the person hours that were put into this skin. (As well as all the skins, but that's another soapbox)\r\nLook at the level of detail behind this skin. Look at the amount of care these people (REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL EMOTIONS AND REAL FEELINGS GUISE) put into making this skin. Each form of Sona is unique. Each song is unique, upgrading after the first use of her ult.\r\nThis skin is slick as fuck. How dare you guys assume that Riot \"OWES\" us a discount.

It would look too crowded if all three were there, and think to SGU. Only one of his forms is used in his splash art and I believe it'd be more important to show all of his as opposed to all of DJ Sona's. Another reason is that I find Kinetic to be the \"middle\" skin, so while it isn't super calm and relaxed like Ethereal but it isn't overly energetic like Concussive. \r\n\r\nThat's just me but otherwise I'd love to hear what Riot has to say on your questions, especially 5! It'd be kind of cool if they made it so there were like \"Song Packs\" you could buy/they would give if you owned DJ Sona that you could mix and match.
