It had been five hours since she left Noxus, which meant that Swain's boat had left for the Shadow Isles. The old Corporate building stood as if it had never been burned down in the first place. As she stepped closer to the entrance, her memories with Corporate Gnar, Warwick and countless others flashed by. Tears began to flow down her cheeks as she became more emotional about it. But, it was no time to cry about the past. Soraka wiped away her tears and entered the building. The first floor was spread with rubble and the walls were all stained with burn marks. The stairs to the actual office were gone with only the top two stair steps remaining. However, something was very different. There was never an open entrance to the basement. It looked like a burrow was dug to go down there. Soraka, knowing that the cure to the curse was down there crawled down through the burrow and tumbled onto the basement floor. Soraka got up and felt for the nearest wall since it was so dark. She then inched her way forward until she saw purple lightning forming a monster's body. The lightning kept moving around the body, which began to move now._\r\n\r\n{{champion:421}}_angrily_ \"HOW DID YOU FIND ME?!?!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"I had no idea you were here, I promise.
