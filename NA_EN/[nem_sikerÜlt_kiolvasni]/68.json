These days many things are changed just because of change, not because it's better, which is a very bad direction to head in. Getting rid of the old client and replacing it with a new one that is lacking features is **not** better, it's just **different** for the user. And to be real here, I don't give a poop about visuals etc., yeah they look cool when you first see them, but after a few days they have lost their excitement and you just wanna have the features available.\r\n\r\nI've been using item sets since its release and I see no point in browsing a gazillion items everytime I open the shop hoping I find something useful to buy because I don't have my item set for that specific champion to look at.\r\n\r\nI know that the item sets will still be there in the game, but what about when a patch comes along and items that were a must-buy are suddenly almost worthless and need to get removed from the item set? What about new champions? What about just adjusting your item set because you found a better build or you have to change items in 100+ item sets because Riot decides the internal ID of the pink ward has to be a different one than the control ward, even though the pink ward has been taken out of the game? (thanks for that...)\r\n\r\nThe #1 goal here **has** to be that the new client **primarily** has the **full functionality** of the old one - like you Rioters say is the case with the performance. That's absolutely correct, but it's not only about the performance, it's about the features as well. Features like the item set editor in the client or being able to check your detailed seasonal ranked stats (current and previous seasons) are essential parts of the client feature set and are not to be handled the Duke Nukem Forever \"when it's done\"-way but are to be in the new client when users get forced to use it. Because let's be honest here, your track record when it comes to bringing features into the client wasn't great in the past years.\r\n\r\nI'd rather use the old client instead of the new one until full functionality is given, even though bugs in there haven't been fixed for ages - like the \"after checking some profiles you can't click on your own or any other profile anymore and have to restart the client\"-bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Soul of Stone","date":"2017-02-23T23:49:00.310+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"the thing is the new client is not just a visual update like you think, they said in their post that theyre switching the client for developmental reasons. so if they switch everyone over, they wont have to worry about the slow old client and put all their effort into giving you that functionality you want in the new one much faster. your wait time overall will be less","replies":[{"poster":"IHonkForYordles","date":"2017-02-24T01:16:24.823+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"The old client isn't slow.

You have my sympathy, and I hope they'll slow down and take the time to TRULY get the new client up to snuff before seriously trying to replace the old one with it. It needs the item set creator, it needs to be able to run lighter so it doesn't take more CPU and RAM, etc. Don't forget to take the poll when it comes up and express your feelings there. If you don't feel you'll be able to play League after the new client takes over, make sure they know in no uncertain terms that it's _extremely likely to cost them players._ If they were to obsolete the legacy client today, I'd definitely quit League and never look back, personally, because the new client just isn't where it needs to be on features and performance.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TSM Shurima","date":"2017-02-22T21:52:05.732+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not just this, but in the old Client, I can see my stats from every ranked passed so far from 2014. with my characther stats, accomplishement, win stats, penta and quadra kill, etc. I wish this would being transfered aswell on the new client.

Might want to make sure if gets some dust build up on the inside for that authentic player experience. I used to run League on a pc that IIRC barely met those specs, and dust was the true game killer (aside from like, being anywhere near Leblanc when she dashes or in the same game as a Wildefire Zyra, crash to desktop those were). And I mean like, less than a year ago was my upgrade, to something a short step north of those specs....\n\nThat said, while I totally agree the AIR Client is preeeeetty bad, it is still entirely functional. When I watch streams or chat with friends, all I see and hear is how _un_ funtional the Updated Client is. Yes, it's shiny. Yes, it's got room to grow. But that doesn't fill some of us with faith.\n\nThe (or any) game client is like the front lobby of a movie theater. If it's in shambles, that sticks with you when you go in to enjoy your entertainment. The mushy wads of popcorn in the corners and underfoot, someone's barf behind a table, a baby diaper discarded in a trashcan that catches the sunlight in just the right way as too heat up and fill the space with desolate funk....\n\nEveryone has to use the lobby/client. It's the \"front door\" and face of League and Riot.\n\n.... basically what I'm getting at is the chat boxes look too small, everywhere. Your UI / UX teams must have great eyesight. It's like it was decided Steam friend messenger chatbox size was the way to go, but at least with those they're automatically their own window and resizable. I let it slide in the updated Champ Select because there was promises of a new Client on the horizon. Bigger chatbox, everywhere. Please. Especially in Party, Lobby, and Post Game. Everything fits just fine in the AIR Client, I don't understand how chat lost so much ground.\n\n(I am an ARAM/RGM only player, so these Blood Moon weekends have been my only time really interacting with the new Party and Lobby screens, and I don't think I have ever missed UI customization in a game more than I did trying to power through it.... by the grace of all the fluffy kittens in the world and by all the demons in Hell, put UI Customization on your To-do List)\n\nAnd with all THAT said I really, _**really**_ suggest getting a video or series of videos out about the new client as you're releasing it to show what's changed and where to find things and hopefully WHY certain things where changed in position and layout. Get Phreak to voice it, everyone loves Phreak. I trust Phreak. I even trust Phreak to be able to catch me from falling off a ladder or roof. And then I'd trust him to make a pun about it. So, pretty much like Tom Hanks in the Simpson's movie.
