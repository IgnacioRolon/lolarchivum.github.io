There are 134 champions, and an average ofâ€¦say, 5 skins each. Cait only has 4 available skins (Legacy skins can't be on sale, because they can't be sold!). So that's a 1/134+1/133+1/132+1/131, or 3%, chance of even being on-sale, (assuming equal weighting), and a 4/670+4/669+4/668+4/667 (around 2%) chance of one of Cait's skins going on sale (I didn't account for the fact that a champ can't have 2 skins on sale at once, except in special cases, but I'm pretty close, anyways). That means Cait has a 5% chance to be in one part of the sale (about 1 in every 20 weeks), and a meager .07%, that's seven _hundredths of a percent_, chance to both have a skin on sale _and_ to be on sale herself _at the same time_. That means that both will happen about once every 1428 sales, or _once every **27.5 years**_. League hasn't even _existed_ that long. The odds of _any_ champion having this happen are statistically only going to happen twice in your entire _life_. So, instead of crying because Cait didn't have both happen, be happy you saw this miracle.","replies":[{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-05-06T21:35:22.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The math is great (I guess, I don't know math), but here's the problem with your response: they aren't random. Everything is not equally weighted because Riot picks and chooses what is going on sale. \nSo in a completely randomized scenario, your math would be on point, but it doesn't apply here. \n\nLast sale they had Xerath and a skin. Now it is Anivia and a skin. Next week might be more of the same. Maybe Riot believes that by doing this they can sell a champion and skin during the same sale and boost profits, I don't know. But it's not random.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solar Vox","date":"2017-05-04T16:54:25.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx for all the math I'll prob just wait ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜£","replies":[{"poster":"West Bishop","date":"2017-05-04T18:35:29.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ironically though, this has happened twice in a row.
