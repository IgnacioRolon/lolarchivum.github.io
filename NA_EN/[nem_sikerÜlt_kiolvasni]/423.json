Due to a schedule, which I won't explain, I can generally play on the weekends every other week, sometimes not even then, meaning that I will miss many game modes. And frankly, from what I've heard, I'm not the only person with this problem. The problem of, due to schedule, missing the game modes you really want to play, (For me it is URF), and feeling really upset and slightly forgotten about it. I know I'm kinda ranting here, but I just wanted to put this out, in the hope that someone would see it, because it is really frustrating hearing all my friends talking about how much fun they are having in these game modes, when generally I can't play them.\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is that I love the idea of rotating game mode, but I feel that many people will miss the game modes they love.","replies":[]},{"poster":"drevilcyborg","date":"2016-05-13T19:55:37.184+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"What about doombots????\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} ","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2016-05-13T20:07:13.286+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude it going to be a while for Doombots.
