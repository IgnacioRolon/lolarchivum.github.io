Riot proceeds to force us to use it on the first camp with a smaller leash even though you'll be nearly full hp (3/4ish) and wasting our smite to use it on the insane birds that will leave you at 1/6th of your hp..... GOOD CHOICES RIOT, GOOD CHOICES......\r\n\r\nI was actually going to post something on the boards saying how you cant give a proper leash because no matter what youll miss minions when you go back to lane... they just made it worse....\r\n\r\nWolves dont give level 2, birds give it before u finish the camp, jungle was reinvented to give diversity to clear paths so that it isnt one \"ideal\" path for any/all champs and yet they are restricting two camps from spawning, as i said wolves dont give lvl 2, you cant start birds in case someone take sthe creep \"accidentally\" so u have to start at the buffs... Poor decision making, i used to be a jg main, i hate the jg now, (make notice that im not complaining about plants, thats cuz that was the only decent thing they came up with [smite heal too but they just made it useless early])\r\n\r\nAnd by ading all these monsters in the preseason, they made the hit boxes for them very small to click on, i play the game on 18 average fps, so you can understand that, that is very frustrating when i cant click on camps because they are too small. \r\n\r\nIF RIOT DIDNT WANT SMITELESS LEASHES< THEN THEY SHOULDNT HAVE MADE SMITE GIVE HP, which is useless on the first camp and more effective on the second or third.\r\n\r\nVision wouldnt be an issue if the champions tehy came out with now a days didnt have everything in their kits.... MAKE WEAKNESSES, camille has sustain, dmg, basic attack amplifier, mobility, aoe, weak and hard cc (three total [slow, stun and her ult]), and many other champs are similar. Jglers wouldnt be overpowering early game if the champions were more balanced for everyone's enjoyment. \r\n\r\nSUGGESTION: instead of later camp times, give everyone two wards on purchase, instead of just the one. (simpler solution, changes much less, and is overall more positive [u get more, not less])\r\n\r\nAlso, honeyfruit is usable by everyone, if they dont want the jglers to take it, they cant take it themselves, at about 5-6 min they should be low-ish on mana or health. delaying their spawn time is reducing the efficiency of ap junglers/ ap champs that are going to the jg. Many ap junglers benefited from these juice-filled plants in order to sustain through the jg dmg since they lack sustain (unlike most recent ad champs u released.......)\r\n\r\nThis all said, the jg has now become an AOE battlefield restrciting your choices further...\r\n\r\nThis game is supposed to be progressing .... not regressing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkensus","date":"2017-01-24T19:42:26.923+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":5,"body":"Didn't disagree with a single change while scrolling through, but then I noticed I had reached the end and Jayce wasn't even acknowledged.
