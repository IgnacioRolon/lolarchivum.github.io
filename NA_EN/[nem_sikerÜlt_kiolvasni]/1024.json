The alpha was 100000% better in my opinion. This is just another ARAM. In the alpha objectives were more spread out, so junglers could skirmish, while laners square off against one another. Now the buffs are packed right next to the lanes so its just a 5v5 fiesta the whole time. I wanted a quicker mode that had potential to use other strategies to win rather than just ramming heads over and over, and that is exactly what nexus blitz has become.

I thought ARAMs were bad enough with not allowing fairness, but this mode has far too much damage.  The games are decided within the first few kills.  Which happen very early.  I get it, it's Nexus _Blitz,_ it's meant to be fast, but I didn't expect it to be as fast as it is.  Then, once game is decided, the team that's ahead wins every event, yet it still takes another ten minutes for the game to end.  I'm glad folks are having fun with it; it looked like fun from the outside; but it's 0% fun for me.

And a \"deliberately unbalanced\" mode becomes a lot less fun when people \"solve\" it, and it really feels like a lot of people have started to \"solve\" Nexus Blitz like they did for URF.\nI even have to say it, Nexus Blitz was actually the mode that not only killed itself for me, but dragged the rest of the game with it. It was just that miserable a time that I'm about done.
