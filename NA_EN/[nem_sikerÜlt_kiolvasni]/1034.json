Is everything ok?\n\n{{champion:86}}  It’s that time isn’t it?\n\n{{champion:133}}  Is it really?\n\n{{champion:59}} Yes it is. \n\n{{champion:133}}  Wow…that went by fast.\n\n{{champion:5}}  I’ll say. I haven’t seen our King this nervous since his wedding to our Queen and that felt like only a week ago.\n\n{{champion:86}} Ahh what a wedding it was for Demacia. You know I was worried how the people would react to the bride but she became really popular. No one spoke out against her marrying Jarvan. \n\n{{champion:133}} I think that’s because they were afraid of getting eaten by her.\n\n{{champion:86}} Ohh…well she popular now…right?\n\n{{champion:133}} Yes Garen.\n\n{{champion:59}} Guys please I am trying to calm down here. \n\n{{champion:85}}  You know I could bring some medicine to calm said nerves. \n\n{{champion:59}}  Doctor Kennen? Why are you here?\n\n{{champion:85}}  Akali told me that today is the day so I came over with the birth and naming records \n\n{{champion:59}} Akali? \n\n{{champion:84}} Hey.\n\n{{champion:59}} AHHHH!!! God Akali one more time and I will have you arrested. \n\n{{champion:84}}  Sorry. Just here to say that the egg finally hatched and Shyvana is bringing your kids here.\n\n{{champion:59}} Well I’m glad nothing went wrong with-KIDS!!!?\n\n{{champion:84}} Yeah…you have twin boys.\n\n{{champion:59}} I feel like I am going to faint.\n\n{{champion:102}}  Not until you see them honey. \n\n{{champion:59}} My sons. \n\n{{champion:85}}  Mmm…both look really healthy and I see one of them already has dragon scales and is growing a tail. Looks like this one will be more dragon-like while this one will be more human. Which one will be Jarvan V?\n\n{{champion:102}} Well our 'human' looking one came out the egg first so I guess that makes him the eldest one right?\n\n{{champion:59}} Then he shall carry the name of Jarvan V.  \n\n{{champion:85}}  Very well, then what about the other one?\n\n{{champion:59}}  I think you should name him.\n\n{{champion:102}}  Really? \n\n{{champion:59}}  Yeah. I can tell you already have a name for him. \n\n{{champion:102}}  Thanks \n\n{{champion:85}}  So what is his name going to be?\n\n{{champion:102}} He shall be name after a dragon of legend. His name shall be: **Ao Shin**\n\n\n**THE END**\n\n\nNote: Thank you all for reading and enjoying my story. I will be taking a week break before starting a new story.
