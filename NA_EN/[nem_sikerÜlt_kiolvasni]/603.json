I really like how cho works and everything he does but he needs a VU bad maybe some new skill effects but not changes to his actually skills. My point with cho is hes supposed to be some menacing monster from the void who strikes fear into his enemys. Right now he doesnt look all that menacing and I cant even tell what hes supposed to be tbh. He just seems like some ant eater monster or something he just looks terrible and outdated. He should look more evil and more VOID like. And his abilitys should display that hes from the void like his Q could open a ripple in the void and have monsters from the void deal the dmg instead of spikes or something of the sort.
