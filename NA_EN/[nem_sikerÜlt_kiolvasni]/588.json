What is in the champ mastery formula\nA. Uhh... just play normal\n\nThat seriously doesn't help the people asking this question. I don't think it has occurred to Riot that the reason why this is such a popular question is that the grade you receive at the end of the match almost never matches expectations and seems arbitrary. Which is why people want to know what categories to perform well in because playing normally doesn't equate to you getting an S.\n\nNow Riot can keep saying they won't tell anyone because then people will try to play for stats (as if playing for good stats isn't a good thing), but the alternative is people play for stats based on popular theories on what helps. So Riot believes it would be problematic for someone to pick a champ and know what averages they need to beat in order to get an S, and then work toward that goal in game, because maybe someone decides to afk farm for a bit to hit a cs quota. The problem is Riot gives people incentives to care about the ratings and so people will go into games with the end goal of getting an S rather than winning anyway. Only instead of knowing what averages they need to beat, they do the same thing Riot thinks people will only do if they knew the exact formula, which is play for stats that are popularly believed to increase rating. \nAn example of this is a recent gbay video where he is trying to get mastery level 7 on irelia. After failing to get an S by playing normally, he looks around for popular theories on what gets you an S and decides to afk farm away from his team as much as possible, and ks at every given opportunity because to the best of his knowledge kills contribute to your rating far better than assists.\n\nSo instead of giving people the rubric on what they are being graded on (like any actually legitimate test giver who wants to be taken seriously), people resort to playing for stats regardless if their goal is centered on mastery rank. Only instead of trying to beat an average of 8 kills or something specific for their champion, they will just attempt to ks all game long, or extend the game to farm kills/cs.\nGood way to encourage unhealthy gameplay.\n\nEDIT: Glad to see the post generating a discussion (120+ comments so far) but keep in mind a couple things\n1. Different roles do in fact have different rating criteria (saw a bunch of comments wondering if this was the case)\n2. The issue I mostly discuss in this comment is how despite Riot not divulging the formula, players nonetheless play for stats but to a greater extent than they would if Riot was more transparent.\n3.

It's true for every role but especially true for supports because their entire identity is that they give up their own kills, damage, items, etc in favor of the team.

I will say that the popularized tricks for getting an S generally aren't the right way to go about it.  AFK farming, kill stealing, and other popular notions are flawed methods for achieving an S grade.  You might say you got an S in a game you AFK farmed, but I'm telling you that AFK farming might not have been your best option in that game!\n\nYou might think that to get the S grade you have to stat chase.  I often get S grades and I do not stat chase.  I also think that this is really a bad way to go about it and can even hurt your chances.  While I'm on the topic of things that really hurt your chances for an S grade, I'm going to let you know one of the worst ways to hurt your chances of an S grade: dying.  Obviously there is more to getting an S than having 0 deaths, but dying is probably the easiest way to drop your grade to an A+.  You can have a great game, but if you die once to the wrong opponent that can be the difference between an S and an A.\nTo me this highlights one of the flaws in thinking you have to stat chase to get an S by AFK farming or kill stealing.  Mostly it's the opposite, and not dying is much much more important.\n\nTL;DR If you think you have to stat chase to get an S grade, then rethink your strategy.  It's less about securing stats for yourself and more about making sure you don't give up stats to the opponent.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fourthfifth","date":"2016-07-01T02:16:21.192+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":76,"body":"I dont understand why everyone on here is crying? i am a support main and get S+,S and S- nearly every game i win.

That is what the champion mastery system lacks, because when players are driven to earn a certain grade but have no idea the specific criteria to earn that grade then they will play not to win the game but to try to get the grade regardless of the win, or getting better at the champion.
