Can you tell me the reason? its so frustrating to start the download again from 33%.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T23:55:53.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are stuck at 33% for a fairly long period or crashing after this period, then it's likely your network is having problems connecting to the patching servers.  Your best bet would be to use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is tuned up for League.
