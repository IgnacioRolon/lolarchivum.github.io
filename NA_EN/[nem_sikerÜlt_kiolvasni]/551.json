I'm pretty sure that's not boosting. If anything, it's lowering my elo. Most of my wins are actually me going into solo games and stomping face with some randoms that see my match history of mostly wins, or my level 7 masteries, or my overall performance with my champions and know they have a good player on their team. It's surprising how effective just having your team know someone on their team is good can get you places.\r\n\r\nRiot is implementing this because players like me have no incentive to always play solo. It either feels unfair, or downright has odds stacked against us. Now with this, and hopefully future changes to load screen and things like ward skins (or less excitingly; summoner icons,) we can flaunt that we got to our rank through our own skill. Leading back to what I said above, showing your team: \"Hey, I'm a good player. You don't have to worry about me. I can get your back.\" Dynamic Queue was a step to make Ranked a more enjoyable setting for low elo players who have no care to become high elo imo. Or even new players getting into Ranked. But for players who want the challenge, the intensity of being good at the game; Solo Queueing just helps you know you're good. But without something like this, there was no incentive to climb solo.

The ranks lose meaning because it isn't clear anymore what they're even measuring.\r\n\r\nA shiny badge for solo-only players doesn't even begin to address this issue at all.
