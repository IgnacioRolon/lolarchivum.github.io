Maybe Renekton was right, I am just a bad king.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:223}} \"Hold up, you aren't a king anymore, you are a CEO of a great investigation firm! Plus, killing an innocent kid is a bad thing and you should feel bad, so you are even closer to becoming a good person!\"\r\n\r\n_A guard wolf kicks the door open._\r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} \"RED ALERT!!!

That can't be good!\"\r\n\r\n_Azir walks towards the window and lifts up the blinds and gasps._\r\n\r\n{{champion:223}} \"What is it? Who are they?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:268}} _grabbing his staff_ \"You stay here. I need to take care of these two.\"\r\n\r\n_Outside of the building...._\r\n\r\n{{champion:75}} \"What is taking him so long?!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:15}} \"Be patient! I am sure he is taking his time to digest the fact that you're still alive.\"\r\n\r\n_Azir walks out of the building and rushes over to them._\r\n\r\n{{champion:268}} _with a cowboy accent_ \"Well I'll be damned!

The axe hit Azir's back and gave him a deep gash, which would still keep him alive for a few more hours._\r\n\r\n{{champion:75}} \"It's about time I see my brother's killer dead! Do you have any idea how long it took me to find you?!
