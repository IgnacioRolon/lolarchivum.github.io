Remove collision between little legends during drafts. Some people go out of their way to try and make your little legend path around theirs and end up picking something that you were not aiming for.

Thus it can’t be completely random, but it can’t be completely fixed either. This makes it a non trivial problem. As for items, having played with the new system on the pbe, I will say it feels much better than the old drop system.
