I like to try and remain positive and think optimistically when I see something you all do. After all, you constantly talk about how you want to do what is best for the players and improve the game, and I honestly believe that is your intention. However, I cannot under any circumstance conceive how not carrying over item sets, something everyone from noobs to pros use, is a good idea. \n\nI use them. \n\nEvery one of my friends use them.\n\nEvery streamer and YouTuber I have ever watched uses them. \n\nThis does not sound like a minority. \n\nPerhaps from a statistical standpoint the users of it are a minority; after all, there are unused accounts and people who haven't even figured out what masteries are by lvl 30. Against that, however, you all also insist that you do not balance around new or low ranked players, but pros and high ranking players who most likely do use this. Let's not forget pros are the minority, so by this idea we should balance for everyone in silver, bronze, and gold and ignore challenger, master, and diamond entirely. They're the minority, right?\n\n\nThis makes no sense by yours or anyone's logic, and to encourage third party software is a cop out at best. Heck, the ones I have seen suggested are TERRIBLE. Championify doesn't allow you to customize to what you want, and it's what you all seem so adamant to support. \n\nAs an alpha tester(with limited time) I did notice the lack of item customization, but I assumed like any logical person that it would be added like in the current client. \n\n\nMy question in the end is a big \"why\"? Why is this a good idea? How is this supporting players? How is this helping make games more dynamic and encourage new things? How does this HELP people? \n\nIt does not support player, and takes away a tool that does.\n\nIt does not encourage build diversity or dynamic play, and makes it take longer to manage the shop. \n\nIt does not help anyone. Not pros. Not new players. Not anyone in between.\n\n\n\nWhat it does do is piss off everyone and make people question what you guys are thinking even more than they were after smite buffs being removed was announced. I like that you guys are trying new things and doing some cool stuff, but this is nothing shy of bashing players in the face and telling them to screw off. \n\nThis is something, that before you MAKE an announcement on, you NEED to run focus group and ASK players(that are not the internal testing group) what they think, because I can surely tell you that if you asked you would not have such terrible relations issues right now with all the angry people pretty much ready to get the pitchforks and riot(pun intended).\n\n\nIf anything, that last point is what you guys need to work on. Stop making big \"we are doing this big and most likely controversial change based solely on what we think is best without even bringing it up to see how people might react and get some ideas on how to improve it\" statements. Players LOVE reveals. Players LOVE to feel like they make an impact. So instead of saying \"we're doing this\", say \"we're considering doing this and want thoughts to improve it before we push it out\". Even if you decide to stay the course, it makes people feel less backed into a corner and screwed over. I KNOW for a fact nobody would have responded positively to this, but if you had offered it as a possibility and ran some feedback tests you could have avoided this entirely. Heck, send out a thousand email polls for the alpha testers and see what they think, or even make a poll discussion bringing up the item set use. Look at that, player feedback and discussion without pissing everyone and their cousin off. \n\nLastly, you need to not make excuses such as \"third party exists\". Nobody liked that for replays.

Could build out a system where you can design back timings basically, where you get the \"event\" popups for back timings for new builds, new champ, new players. Could let the community build these out aggressively per-matchup, per-playstyle, per-person. Would help everyone from new players to veterans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kabegami","date":"2016-10-18T19:01:27.431+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"are there any benefits for the alpha testers?\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"WUVCdisPp2","date":"2016-10-18T19:26:06.363+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you want, an icon?

You've  said that you dont want players to have need 3rd party programs to play league, and indirectly insulted other game companies for doing so, and now you are advocating the use of one because one feature isnt important enough to include in the new client?  Really bad form, riot.\n\nItems are CRUCIAL to the game. You cannot win without them. Itemization is incredibly important. Its the difference between winning and losing every game.  Using a recommended item set to play is not going to get the win every game. There is only so much you can do with recommended or uploaded item sets.\n\nAlso, i thought riot wanted the game to be LESS \"optimal builds are OP so everyone will use them\" and more \"there is more than one way to play this champ\"?  Isnt removing the item set creator from the game moving in the **opposite** direction from this? \n\nThis just seems to be extremely opposed to the narrative riot has laid out so far.  If the custom item sets issue is ignored by riot, i will be extremely disappointed in them.  I have thought that they **arent **all about making money from people, and disregarding whatever doesnt make the most money.  This would cause me to believe they arent as interested in making a fun game as they have claimed. I hope they realize the importance of this decision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Last Zica","date":"2016-10-18T20:18:19.979+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really, really want the item set creation feature kept or a fully equivalent very well supported open source 3rd party alternative that Riot actively and explicitly works with to ensure it's always current and usable.\r\n\r\nThis feature is far more important to me than you seem to think, and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone here!

These sets are stored currently in the appropriate champion folders in  RIOT_ItemSet_X.json files. Will these files be still available and usable, or will they be deleted? Championify creates similar files (except no RIOT in the name) so I am assuming that you will keep those champion folders, so the Championify files can be stored. Anyway, I would suggest anyone who is using itemsets, to back them up before the client update. They can be modified by a text editor if necessary to be compatible with the new client (similar to Championify files). You just no longer will be able to modify them in the client. \n\nAnother question to RIOT. Will you be able to release the source code for the Item Set Generator, so someone could create a stand alone item set generator for the general public? I am not into APIs, but I believe there are some competent people out there. Last year, I believe there was an API for this reason, but that does not seem to be updated. Maybe RIOT could support that API as a stand alone tool, so we could still generate custom item sets.\n\nYou are supposed to go to battle fully prepared. With your runes, masteries and weapons (item sets).\n\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lylet Cook","date":"2016-10-18T19:54:34.045+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait what, Item set creator is going away?
