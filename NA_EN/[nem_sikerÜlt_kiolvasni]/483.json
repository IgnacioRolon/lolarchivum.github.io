I think kindred is really complicated. To me, her lore is in need of rewriting. So, how can she be an essence of death, and also had been a human...that turned into a lamb and a wolf? If she was not at some point alive...and died with her kindred spirit so to speak...which is why I think someone needs to clarify in riot...what exactly is going on with kindred. Is she actually the essence of life or death on the battlefield? Or is that what she became...as a legend. The actuality of what she is has yet to be explained in my opinion. I think, she was a restless spirit that died too soon, and somehow became a vengeful spirit...that hunts for revenge purposes. With, the husband or boyfriend who killed her prematurely in a crime of passion...like a murder suicide. Whichh does seem to be explained somewhat in the lore of magga...I don't know though? which is why I think riot should clarify what the hell kindred and wolf are...and if there's anything out there like them or not.
