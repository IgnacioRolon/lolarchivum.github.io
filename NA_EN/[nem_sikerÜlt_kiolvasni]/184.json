It lags or bugs out every time, even on my desktop.\n\nThis is all assuming the new champion select stuff is coming over to the new client, but regardless of any changes, I'd prefer a non-animated option.

The removal of solo queue hit us hard enough, and should be reverted, since you for one cannot see how many people are premades in each team and secondly, I simply want to have a fair game in which each solo player has the same chances to give proof of his skills. Stop shoving socialising features down our throats, if one wants to see his friendslist all the time, make it optional, that way, everybody feels satisfied. Besides, looking at about every single other gaming platform (Steam, Origin, BattleNet, UPlay, ...), each of those has a friendslist which can be minimised, it is a standard one should not change, LoL is not a social media platform.\n\nRegards\nD.P.\n\nPS: Regarding the premade aspect, take a look at Overwatch which after the most recent patch, displays premades perfectly and would allow clarity concerning the fairness of a match. Additionally, when a ranked game reaches the loading screen, you should be able to see each player's rank/MMR, because it gives transperency and most people look up stats like that on 3rd party programs anyway. If you want to improve the game, start with including the most commonly used features of 3rd party websites regarding statistics and general information.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2016-08-02T12:39:56.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it has some issues with NVIDIA Optimus at the moment.
