You can't punish people based on hearsay and circumstance. There was no proof that TDK and REN had a behind-the-scenes merge (like Riot was accusing), but Riot punished them because they traded players. Heck, if you want to punish team for trading players, look no further than TSM and Liquid. TSM needed to push Wildturtle back in Season 5 (and potentially replace him), so Liquid gave TSM Keith (who had been having good showings at the time). Then this season, TSM gave Liquid DoubleLift. It's no secret that Liquid and TSM have a good relationship together, but I would be foolish to suggest that they had a behind-the-scenes merger. Teams that are friendly trading among each other isn't proof of against the rules colluding.","replies":[{"poster":"KromeKrome","date":"2017-04-13T14:52:33.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"TDK-REN were punished for player trading because they continued to pay their former player months after the trade with the former team.

And how about the constant MISTREATING of the manager, is that not a concern? They were working for $750 for the split and wanted the team to succeed and if you look at the logs, the way she was mistreated is terrible. Does that not bother you? Do you want managers working for teams or not?\n\nCmon Riot, this a sham. A contract is a contract and when previously you said that Riot would have zero tolerance on players being mistreated as in the case with Team Immunity in 2015, where is that zero tolerance now? Those players should have been released immediately when Tainted Minds voided their own contract. Holding players ransom to the global database for such a long time is also unacceptable, as is Tainted Minds having 13 players contracted, more than your own rules of 10 maximum.\n\nJust because a certain Riot OCE employee is good friends with the Tainted Minds investor should have no bearing on the case at all. The Tainted Mind organisation needs to be kicked, just like Riot NA kicked Renegades. Do you have any consistency whatsoever, or a rulings just made haphazardly to what benefits Riot the most?\n\nJust because you are Judge, Jury and Executioner in this instance does not mean your actions will not affect you. Look after the community and they will look after you. Tainted Minds had a very good shot of WINNING the OPL this season but that was taken away by mismanagement and then Riot sweeping things under the carpet. When you also take into consideration that OCE is a very small region and that pro players get paid roughly $7k a YEAR compare that to what LCS players get, you are biting the hand that feeds. Your broadcast stream used to get over 3k views back in 2015, now you barely can hit 1.5k views IN THE FINALS SERIES. I seriously advise you to weed out those people in the organisation that are not serious about promoting LOL eSports in Oceania and are only about protecting their pay packets, we don't need those people at all. FIRE THEM for the good of the community.\n\nOne more thing, OCE accounts cannot post on the main page for this ruling. Should any of the OCE community wish to post you will have to go via the NA boards. Link is https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports/U66k32ql-competitive-ruling-tainted-minds.
