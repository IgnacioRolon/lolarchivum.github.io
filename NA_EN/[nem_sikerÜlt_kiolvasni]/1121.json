It's not a damage buff, it's a different way of calculating scaling. They changed it from being 50% total AD to 30% total + 20% bonus. Total is the total amount of AD you have (base + items + other e.g. Janna shield), while bonus is ONLY the extra AD you have on top of your base (items + other). So while before, if rengar had 80 base ad and 120 from items, his 8 would do 100 damage. But now, it would do 84 (60 (30% total) + 24 (20% bonus)).\r\n\r\nHowever, the difference becomes less significant the higher total AD he gets, as the difference of the base AD becomes a smaller percentage. So basically, this is a bigger nerf to his early game, preventing excessive snowballing, while not punishing him too hard if he does get ahead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CallMeQwert","date":"2016-01-27T21:10:39.304+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we get timers for ARAM health relics?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zwindler Neeg","date":"2016-01-27T20:30:12.887+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot clogged my frog again{{champion:223}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"bluebreeze52","date":"2016-01-27T19:39:53.835+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":7,"body":"Nunu does NOT need that low of a cooldown on snowball.
