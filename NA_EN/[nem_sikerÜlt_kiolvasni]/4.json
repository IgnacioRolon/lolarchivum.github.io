People were crying for perma-bans on champions in the queue. Riot has said themselves that one of the main reasons that featured game modes arent permanent is because they don't want the data from these games to affect game balancing. Imagine being a Sona main, while URF queue is permanent, and coming to find out that they upped her cooldowns because its an \"apparent problem\" within the game. I don't know about you, but tailoring balance to also include URF mode (imagine the ever-growing list of perma-bans) sounds pretty crappy.

They'd still be present, especially in lower ranking of ranked because it has the biggest impact on people.\r\n\r\nPutting out all of the game modes would severely reduce the number of people playing SR at any given time. People like myself, who play without trolling ever; would simply migrate between game modes so frequently SR would see less play. This is fact. People would still play SR, yes; but it would be a serious hit on numbers.\r\n\r\nAs for trolls.. You can't get rid of them by giving them variety. Trolls troll because they find harming other people's good time to be fun. SR is the best place to do that, plain and simple. It's why there's less trolls in other modes generally (They're still there of course, just not as omnipresent. There's just less reason for them to troll modes that aren't taken as seriously).\r\n\r\nI genuinely wish releasing all the game modes 'wouldn't' hurt Rito/LoL.
