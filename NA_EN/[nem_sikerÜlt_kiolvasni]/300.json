It has been a while since I last played the game, but when i went to log into the game, none of my information worked. I am now freaking out, because my password will not work, any support email I try to have sent to me will not show up, and I cannot get any reply from my support ticket, to even check it it needed me to sign in. I have so much on my account, and I will be devastated if I lose it. My friend checked me on his friends list, and the last game played was the one by me back in August, and I do not have my credit card saved to the game, so what would someone get from having my account? Please help, I am really desperate!","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-09-26T16:28:15.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should go ahead and use this account that you have made to submit a ticket since now you should have an email that you can receive notifications on when they reply.\n\nas for what someone could get from your account:\n-any potential RP to gift themselves skins\n-the use of a throw-away account that they can get in trouble wish and not care\n-attempt to sell the account for money\n-try to trick anyone on your friend list into a fake/scam website and then steal THEIR accounts to do any of the listed things, including scam more accounts with this same method.","replies":[{"poster":"DoobySwagginz","date":"2016-09-28T04:25:42.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes, some people out there, you know?
