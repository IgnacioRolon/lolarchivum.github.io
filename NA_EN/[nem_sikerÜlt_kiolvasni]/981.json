Part of the fascination I have had with League is watching the whole esports scene develop.Those early years tours of a team house- all I could think was 'man, these guys need a den mother to make sure they eat right'. I am glad to see that an infrastructure is developing to support the players- although there has also been an increase in players being interchangeable parts, they certainly aren't the ones running the show anymore. As for player longevity, I think Jatt should take into account not only decreased reflex speed, but repetitive use injury. I am (way) older than the average player and it didn't take long for right hand, tricep, and shoulder pain to limit my play time. I briefly spoke to Scarra about  educating /helping players invest their earnings wisely- can pro players set up a SEP-IRA? Are they considered employees or private contractors or what?","replies":[{"poster":"adPrimusAeternum","date":"2016-02-22T23:07:16.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually studies show that reflex times only increase **very** slowly until your early fifties, after that they increase markedly. So what Jatt says definitely holds true, but what your saying also holds true but at a much later age than what Jatt considered.","replies":[{"poster":"zycanthus","date":"2016-02-23T01:22:17.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still- the 14 hours a day scarra was practicing cant be good for you- on top of being way too sedentary. At least old age and treachery will beat youth and exuberance ie game experience from objective control, lane swapping, champion synergy etc will compensate for slight differences in reflex time","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ItsMyTimeToChime","date":"2016-02-20T10:55:31.528+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love listening to Scarra talk about his struggles. 5/7 podcast","replies":[]},{"poster":"liortheking123","date":"2016-02-18T20:42:44.942+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"i now have cancer","replies":[{"poster":"StealthyZergling","date":"2016-02-18T21:45:44.634+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too :D{{champion:6}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Ninjazz01","date":"2016-02-22T18:16:29.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rip mana pots :( for all those ap mages and ezreals mains  out there :(","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dekutanoth","date":"2016-02-20T20:19:54.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I put this on at work, because it's Saturday, and all of my normal shows are on cooldown, so I thought, why not try it. I'm now 5 in a row deep, and I must say, I'm hard pressed to choose a favorite between hearing all of the insider tech talk with the QA/dev team, and the personal accounts from the professional players. The interviews with Scarra and Darshawn were eye opening; you always think of them as just \"the pros,\" they never really seem human, in the same sense that it's hard to imagine Adele or Cam Newton being actual normal people, but hearing them talk about their experiences was awesome, it made them seem incredibly relatable.\r\n\r\nThis is a great series; I look forward to hearing more!
