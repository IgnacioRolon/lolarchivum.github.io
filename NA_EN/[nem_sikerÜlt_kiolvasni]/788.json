Soraka did.\r\nHear me out now:\r\nAhri is popular, yes. But she has so many skins with a theme to it, one of them already being pink. It's already slightly shocking she is getting a Star Guardian skin. I'm sure a lot of people are very happy about it, and I wouldn't argue that.\r\nBut I believe Soraka deserved the Legendary skin title more. Her skin looks very beautiful compared to Ahri's. I just wanted to say my opinion, I really don't want haters. Real talk, I despise Soraka and ban her every game.
