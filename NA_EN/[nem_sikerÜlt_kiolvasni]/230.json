She already was sitting at a perfectly normal 50% winrate and you STILL decided to gut her? These changes are completely missing their point, you claim you're trying to weaken her lanephase and yet those nerfs greatly affect her lategame aswell.\n\nInfact her lategame already has a lower winrate than her midgame, how about you finally give her better lategame scaling as a compensation? Well, that sustain of hers? It'll never be as good at lv18 as it used to be after these changes. Her miasma? It'll permanently remain out of reach to catch anyone with after those changes. Didn't you know that her W was THE big selling factor for this champ after the MYM update? Well, you just took away from the only redeeming aspect of her kit.\n\nYou've blatantly neglected this champion for far too long and when she finally sees some play you immediately start *gutting* her. You know how people used to say \"Better nerf Irelia\"? Well, at this point it might aswell be \"Better nerf Cass\", considering how often you've done it to her since the day she came out back in 2010. \n\nThis has happened multiple times so far and EVERY TIME it ended up with her being an obscure and irrelevant champion who's out of touch with the meta and desperately waiting for another rework while rotting away. To make matters worse, you're outright ignoring her when it comes to skins (3.5 years since the last one), lore (reduced to 3 lines of text back in 2014 and never touched again) and other kinds of content.\n\nShe's by far the most neglected female champion in the entire game. I doubt you'd be even capable of selling a skin for her with those marketing and balancing choices of yours, considering how much harm you've done to her already - and it just keeps adding up.\n\n**When will you finally learn from your mistakes, Riot?**","replies":[{"poster":"usernameisnull","date":"2016-09-21T03:16:35.934+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a cassio Main with a winrate of 63% over 112 games, the very thought that cassio isn't broken is preposterous, there is definitely excess power in her kit, which has been discussed in depth on the cass mains subreddit. these nerfs are fair, as her laning is getting to be oppressive with few openings in some matchups especially.

Why can we ping the enemy summoner spells and see the cooldown? That is absurd in my opinion. Junglers can ping before they gank just to see if you have them or a mid lane roamer. I already did not like the jungle timers that are given because it requires less skill. Now you are giving timers on summoner spells that you use to outplay one another (i.e. flashing an important ability to avoid certain death). Even if you don't give the exact time of the cooldown I still don't like this idea because it takes away from the player that can see that you used a summoner spell and say okay they don't have flash until x time. Now people can just ping and see it before they try to all in you?

It was always your job to say in chat \"this person flashed.\" And now, they allowed you to press tab and click the spell and it says for example \"X Player: (Champ) - Flash.\" It doesn't give a timer but what it does give is an easy way to communicate with your team that they flashed. And smart players should always have timestamp on, which means they know when too. This change was brilliant and a great use of the new pinging system. And in a team situation it works even better. People can say in voice comms \"X player used X Summoner\" and the shot caller (ie: normally jungle or support) can relay that in the chat through the ping while the others focus on laning. I can see where you're going with it, but you're also making it sound like it gives a timer. This change was solely a clarity buff and nothing else. It takes more time for someone to type \"Cass F\" than it does to \"tab + ctrl + click summoner\" And even bigger of a time gap for the nice, clear formatting that the ping uses.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Davethewave7","date":"2016-09-22T23:56:16.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:16}} As a Soraka main, this gives me so much salt.
