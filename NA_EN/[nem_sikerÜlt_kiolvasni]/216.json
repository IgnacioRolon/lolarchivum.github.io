I've been there. But you're attacking riot without any info to back what you're saying that most players hate DQ, Most players don't hate DQ. And It is a step in the right direction, One reason a few people dislike the DQ is because people can Climb the ladder easier with playing in a premade, That being said, Giving players emblems. You will know what players earned their rank by climbing alone or climbed by being in a 5 man group. And no Emblems will not let players \"know who is solo\". Them emblem is factoring your past 25 games and how often you were grouped to not grouped. Just because a player has the solo emblem does not mean that player is alone every game. The emblem will not make your game turn into a gangbang on the solo players. And you do not fight premades that often. Don't say it happens 1/10 games or anything. Unless the player is around Diamond+ its a very rare occasion. Premades fight other premades 99% of the time. The main reason I brought up your rank is because it does not make sense that you;re so frustrated with Premades if you never fight them. I'm looking for a link to the article about premades fighting premades**couldn't find the main article but here, http://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/ranked-improvements.html, at the start of the season was 95% and has gotten to around 98%.

It can be a number of things but DQ has been hated or disliked for the majority of posts I've seen.\n\nI have been playing with lots of premades. Even today I've had some duos on my team, who played awful. But I've had many games where I've been stomped by fucking 3+ premades, and camped ridiculously hard by them. \n\nAnd yes, the emblem will let premades see that a solo player is solo. They will attack that person harder because they know they are a solo player and can take advantage of it. Not all of them will do, but most premades have that intention. So yes, I have the frustration of premades in my rank. I fucking lost my s5 promos to them. \n\nAnd no, DQ is not better at all. I climbed better in SQ. I was able to have more fun in SQ.

See, solo queing in dynamic queue is absolutely the pits, not just because of communication (although a built in Dota esque voice system could be cool) but because of friends. Don't get me wrong friends are cool too. But going from the same principle as the honor system, as said in its post, its easy to be nice to friends. Ergo honors from people on your friends list mean like nada. The same logic applies here, when you solo you usually end up with a team of four friends, (and thanks to the new system I congratulate you on) against a team of four friends and another solo. Now, I propose this. If that team of four carries, and play together all the time, they will do well. If the team of four on your side don't, they will not. And worst of all you end up in the middle of it. So they won't really listen to you and the enemy team just bulldozes your nexus. Anyone can work well with good friends. But if you don't have any, you have to rely on your own power and attempts to reach out to them to get anything done. The point is this: as the system stands, it enforces a \"Bring friends or go home.\" sort of issue. I want to be able to play alone and not have to worry about their entire team deathbushing the whole map because no one will listen to me or ward, and their team is on point with it. When you play with people you know, VoIP isn't always necessary, because you know how the support thresh, for example, will always flay them into you and ult if he lands a hook. If I solo adc, I don't know anything about that thresh. And if I manage to climb and do well in spite of that, that should mean something. Now, I do respect the badge system for displaying this, and I appreciate the effort Riot puts out to its toxic players XD. I just wanted to bring another perspective as I continue to weep and mourn solo queue.

The premade is coming into the game with knowledge of their teammates, playstyle, champ pool, stuff like that and can build around it to make a more effective team comp and such. On top of that, the premade will have more cooperation, coordination, and often times a voice chat set up so that they can relay information quicker, more precisely, and without the risk of getting attacked while typing. \r\n\r\n2. Premades make it much easier to boost your friends thus drastically unbalancing ranks and matchmaking. For instance, my brother and his friends boosted somebody who was fresh 30 and new from bronze 5 who had a 32% winrate in bronze to gold by playing as a 5 man group and carrying him.\r\n\r\n3. This is a personal gripe with Dynamic queue however I cant be the only person this happens to. When I end up on the same team as a 3 or 4 man premade, I am consistently forced to deal with being ignored or flat out screwed over by the premade. In Mid lane, especially when the premade has the same clan tag, the other team will notice if only one person does not have the same name as the rest of the group, I check for this every game as well so that we can take advantage of it, and leads to constant camping while the premade jungler only ganks for the premade. However it is much worse as a Jungler. I have had issues ranging from the premade refusing to leash for me to taking smite themselves and stealing my buffs at level 1 and 2 leaving me very far behind.
