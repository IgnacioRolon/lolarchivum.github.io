Aposiopesis is the use of an ellipsis to trail off into silence—for example: \"But I thought he was . . .\" When placed at the beginning or end of a sentence, the ellipsis can also inspire a feeling of melancholy or longing.\n\nThe most common form of an ellipsis is a row of three periods or full stops (. . .) or a precomposed triple-dot glyph (…). The usage of the em dash (—) can overlap the usage of the ellipsis, especially in dialogue. Style guides often have their own rules governing the use of ellipses. For example, the Chicago Manual of Style recommends that an ellipsis be formed by typing three periods, each with a space on both sides.\n\nHERE IS THE PART FOR YOU TO LEARN FROM\n\n\"Some believe that the use of four or more dots or simply two dots, which is often referred to as being more 'informal' instead of the well established three dots, is acceptable as an ellipsis.\"\n\nHope this makes you never want to be that guy and point out the FACT that an ellipsis is three dots, not two or five, because you may find out that it is not a FACT .... but an opinion ... and .. you are indeed wrong .. and ... that you just made an ass of yourself ..... but nice try.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunderbird330","date":"2015-08-31T01:15:34.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, so _typically_ three dots...I genuinely did not know that.
