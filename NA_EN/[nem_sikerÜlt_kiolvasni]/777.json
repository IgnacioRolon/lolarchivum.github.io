Any marksman that does two or more of those too well is just way too good at their jobs in general, and having a clear weakness against one of those three situations on every marksman in the game will more clearly lay out what to pick and how to play around them - or against them.","replies":[{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2016-04-18T23:05:24.551+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":4,"body":"I like this, possibly go with:\r\nScouts: Use tactical positioning and well placed and timed auto attacks and/or spells to weaken the enemy team. \r\nGunslingers: Use above average survivability and various tricks to win fights at close range.\r\nSeigers: Specialize in objective control and applying continuous pressure to specific locations on the map.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth though, a decent number of the Marksmen can be played in one or more of these ways based on how you choose to build.
