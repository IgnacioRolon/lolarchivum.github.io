A decent number of players share your opinion, for sure. We were pretty confident that the people who just want solo/duo queue back wouldn't be overly hyped about the emblems. It's not exactly the same thing, right?\r\n\r\nThe thing is, everything we're seeing tells us although some people are super mad that there's no solo queue (we read the threads after all), the game overall is still better if we let people group up in ranked. We did surveys asking players \"do you like the ability to queue with any number of people in ranked\" and in most regions the majority of players (over 70%) said yes, they do. ~10% didn't care, another ~7.5% sort of didn't like it, and the rest (something like ~7.5%) of players REALLY didn't like it. Those are rough numbers, but they're all pretty close. Someone on the dynamic queue team will probably come throw something at me if I'm off by a point or two. \r\n\r\nI have a solid guess about which group you fall into, and I actually feel where you're coming from. If I had to place myself in one of the groups, I'd probably land closer to the ~7.5% who feels like dynamic queue is slightly worse than solo/duo. But that's mainly because I don't like queueing up with more than one person, and I dislike being expected to put my rank on the line to play with a big group of friends who might be feeders (genuine apologies to my coworkers, I love you guys lmao).\r\n\r\nMost players who are really vocally against dynamic queue feel like it takes away from the meaning of their rank (since people could theoretically get a ranked boost from their smurfing friends). But the truth is that dynamic queue is working for most people, and we generally like it. It could use some improvements, but we think we're gonna get there. \r\n\r\nIf emblems aren't making solo players feel satisfied, we'll keep coming up with other ways for people to express individual skill (spitballing here, but what if we showed you your rank on every champion? Like \"you're the #3 Singed player in EUW\" sort of stuff?). There's a lot of ideas we have, but we just wanted to try out this emblems thing first as a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nHope that addresses some of your concerns.

You say you're reading threads, you're listening, youre trying to find a solution for solo players. Here's the fucking solution: BRING BACK SOLOQ. There is no solution outside of that. There is nothing you can do to make this player base happy while forcing us into games with premades. SoloQers are likely the most competitive players for the game and ditching competitive integrity for the sake of numbers is not acceptable to the biggest competitors. If a few more casuals are clogging silver, cool, but why fuck over highly competitive players so less competitive players feel more comfortable in ranked? If it's a competitive queue, I'd imagine the #1 priority demographic is the more competitive playerbase. \r\n\r\npeople who were playing ranked before dynamicQ were playing ranked because they were competitive players. If casual players didn't play ranked because they didn't feel like fitting in the parameters of solo/duo and ranked 5's, awesome! They clearly didn't give enough shits to jump into the competitive environment. If more casuals are playing ranked, then what is ranked for? What are normals for? You guys wanted more numbers so you took a solid foundation to a competitive environment, smashed it into oblivion, and created a fluid environment that abandons integrity. Competitive integrity absolutely requires strict and solid design, of which there is no longer. \r\n\r\n2 ladders won't solve anything because a solos rank still represents their skill on a dynamic ladder. There's nothing different, you're just filtering ranks into 2 categories but the process is the same. I know this sounds fucking wild, it's unbelievable really, I don't think anyone has thought of this, but maybe the solution is BRING BACK SOLOQ. I haven't played league in weeks because I have nothing to motivate me now. I don't care about getting better for ranked because ranked doesn't mean shit, and I'm obviously not alone. I'd love to see the numbers on how many players have gone dark because of Overwatch saving them from the atrocity of dynamic queue and riots ignorance. \r\n\r\nYou guys are desperately trying to find ways to make this work but the reality that you are denying is that dynamic queue is inherently awful as a standalone ranked queue. It simply cannot fill the space that 2 queues previously held. Yes, you have more normal players in ranked, good job on those numbers, thanks for making bronze and silver even more excruciating to climb through.

They&#039;re vastly different experiences and don&#039;t belong on the same ladder in a competitive game. It would be similarly misguided to average out doubles and singles rankings for tennis in order to provide a unified ranking. Just like in DQ&#039;s case, this would only create an ambiguous ranking which fails to be a good indicator for either format.\n\nFor a ladder to be valid, it has to operate under controlled conditions which are consistent for all its members. DQ adds a myriad of new variables which greatly increase the difficulty in isolating individual skill while also [dramatically increasing variance](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/xxpEcw81-dynamic-que-variance-is-a-btch) and leading to a feeling of reduced individual control in outcomes (for both directions). Worst of all, many of the variables are not only unequal but also unknowable (voice communication, smurfs boosting friends, well-practiced pre-game plans and strategies etc.). Unknowable variables are especially problematic because it&#039;s impossible to perfectly compensate for their absence/presence and their influence can be wildly different from game to game. \n\nWhen you can&#039;t accurately compare players of the same ranking due to potentially huge queue configuration differences, you know the ranking system is broken at its core. These are not just matchmaking or queue time issues. This is about the very legitimacy of ranked and as long as such inconsistent experiences are aggregated on the same ladder, it will always fail in this dimension. Even the best voodoo math cannot change the fact that the fundamentals directly oppose key premises of a viable ladder and such attempts will always lack transparency for laymen anyway. \n\nAs ranked is further devalued, motivation to pursue the game seriously will dampen and the primary engine behind the game&#039;s growth will eventually stall. When people no longer respect and trust the ranked system, they&#039;ll be less driven by self-improvement through streams, guides, as well as watching LCS or absorbing other LoL content.\n\nForsaking ranked integrity in the hope of attracting more casuals is akin to plunging a dagger through your heart to cure high blood pressure. As the blood pressure first drops, it may seem that cardiovascular health is better but the cruel truth eventually manifests itself. Most of what makes LoL a vibrant game comes from its hardcore fans who make art, create websites, stream, preach to their friends, post on forums, etc. The casuals don&#039;t care all that much whether it&#039;s normals or ranked anyway and tend to follow the trendsetters from game to game. Even if ranked is more accessible to them, they may never become that &quot;ideal ranked player&quot; who buys a lot of skins and champions. It&rsquo;s not worth losing the goodwill of the community and frustrating those who actually do care about ranked.\n\nWhile SQ would be ideal, Riot seems unwilling to let their customers choose which queue will live so I&rsquo;ve come up with a few compromises. The first would be to simply not allow anything beyond duo queue in Platinum and above. The most vociferous opposition to DQ comes from dedicated players in these ranks and larger premades also lengthen queue times. Since it&rsquo;s generally accepted that anyone can reach Gold with some effort, allowing DQ and its distortions upon the ranked system only below Platinum is an easier pill to swallow.\n\nAnother idea would be to keep DQ but segregate out solo performance almost as if it was a separate queue. This would still be higher variance than a true SQ due to premades but at least all solo players would be exposed to the same variables over sufficient games. Unlike the current system, it would have internal validity and it also wouldn&rsquo;t kill 4s like a solo ladder probably would.","replies":[{"poster":"SergeantScuttler","date":"2016-06-17T21:39:06.477+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":3,"body":"I realize emblems are a way to address some of the issues I posted but they're way too small of a step.

Since you can't see true MMR, it's open to abuse. They'd have to perform at ~Gold 5 level to drop out of Platinum. To others, it will appear that they reached Platinum through their own efforts even if their skill is unchanged. Moreover, it's too easy to get it.

That place on the SOLO Q ladder has my name on it.

You simply cannot beat that with pings and stopping to type.\r\n\r\nNothing gets on my nerves more when im in jungle and the next thing you know im being invaded by 2-3 people working together in comms.

Why cant we have separate MMR's for grouping and the solo grind?\r\n\r\nAn emblem is not going to combat any of these problems I listed. Even with Voice chat coming in the future. Its no guarantee everyone will use it. And are you guys going to listen to each game to see who was toxic or not?\r\n\r\nMaybe its time to reduce LP gained for people grouping. And give extra LP for people going Solo. We can all operate on the same ladder this way. Because for the soloQ player it gets really one sided. Its not like it was in season 2 anymore. One mistake from your own team could end the game, And it sucks because you dont have the same communication they do.\r\n\r\nBefore in Solo Q, You used to be able to read what the person was going to do with a series of movements and pings.
