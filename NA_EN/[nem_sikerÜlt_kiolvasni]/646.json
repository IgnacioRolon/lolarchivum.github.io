It's just not as large as other positions. We have to be careful not to completely change what Support means, because then we're just potentially abandoning one community in the hopes of growing another, larger one. So in that respect we aren't trying to redesign Support.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, the biggest problems playing Support is that it's hard to see your influence on the game, and likewise hard for the rest of the dudes in the game to tell if you really had an impact by playing a stellar Support game. The KDA doesn't really show that. Gold probably doesn't really show that. Planting the most wards isn't a super exciting score. That's the kind of thing we want to address. Some of it we can move (hopefully) just by changing numbers, because more experience means more individual power to shape outcomes and so on.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-06-16T23:01:04.880+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a support player, I do feel like you could do more fundamental stuff. Stuff like itemisation improvements are huge boons to people who already like the role but nobody who doesn't main support is gonna be looking at the new Grail or the buffed Censer/Crucible and thinking \"Yes, this will make support so much more fun\"! Fun items are nice to have if you already like the basics of the role but people don't like the basics. To be honest, I don't think the role will ever be as popular as one would like until all of these issues are addressed:\n\n1. XP - biggest one. Being under-levelled is just crappy. I realise you guys are making changes but unless my experience in games next patch surprises me, I think the changes will be very small. Supports will still be under-levelled which automatically makes them feel like the weakest champions on the map and there's no reason that has to be the case. You guys can afford to push support XP much more aggressively than you are doing, as I don't think anyone could come up with a realistic problem arising from supports having the same or higher level as the rest of their team.\n2. Gold - not much to say about this that isn't obvious, but as with XP there is room to push gold income for supps higher. Personally I feel that putting a \"X% increased passive gold generation from items\" passive on Sightstone would go a long way to increasing support income while elegantly managing to avoid buffing the item for junglers or creating any must-buy items for other laners.\n3. Freedom of map movement - Sightstone's design is a problem that will always lead to bad feelings. Supports have their map movement restricted massively by the vision game and often the need to stick by allies as is - having to recall every 2 minutes for no reason other than needing to recharge Sightstone is the definition of feelsbadman. Other roles can spend ages on the map AFK clearing waves if they want - why do I need to recall instantly just because I wanted to put decent vision around dragon/baron? As a support main who loves almost everything about it, that bugs me. No other roles have crap like that handicapping them.\n\ntl;dr the role will be golden and at least somewhat popular if it isn't automatically comfortably the weakest role in any one team and if map presence isn't tied to being stingy with ward charges.","replies":[{"poster":"Invariel","date":"2016-06-16T23:05:28.573+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"I left a giant post on the boards a couple of months ago that included the suggestion that Sightstone and all of the items that build out of it should regenerate wards.

Once you buy it will have 0 stacks that gradually build. You'll have to wait so long before placing the 1st ward but it will continue to build after the first. \r\n\r\n   Also, instead of having a normal cooldown, you can make it add a ward stack every 90-120 (or whatever) seconds. I.E. If you have max stacks, You can wait till the timer gets to 85 seconds, place a ward, then when wait 5 more seconds(when the 90 seconds is up) you'll have max stacks again and essentially get a free ward. On the other hand, If you mistime it you could end up wasting wards. \r\n\r\nYou could also make the max stacks for sightstone like 2 or something for the sake of balance. (Which will emphasize making the most out of the constantly ticking cooldown) It'll work like the stealth trinket does now but except its essentially ALWAYS on cooldown (unlike the trinket which ONLY goes on cooldown AFTER you place your 2-stack ward).\r\n\r\n You could also make it where you cant get a ruby sightstone before lvl 9 (I'd give ruby sightstone 4 stacks instead of 5. Haveing 5, 4, or even 3 wards that constantly return can be frustrating when trying to ward clear so i'm not sure how that will work)\r\n\r\nOr... You could make different versions of sightstones similar to how the support items work.  Have one that has a short cooldown, but not many stacks, And another that has a long cooldown but more stacks.

New gameplay can attract more interest from people (speaking from experience, if you can't tell, I really like {{item:3303}} ), so I think this is the path to getting more people into the role, thereby solving a big problem with the queueing system.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Armegetton","date":"2016-06-19T19:24:41.104+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't agree more.\r\n\r\nI personally would enjoy seeing lower scale versions of the actives on all three forms of all the items.\r\n\r\nand as far as adding more interaction to the {{item:3301}} tree goes. it could be as easy as:\r\n- the gold it generates goes into a pool/buff (just a number)\r\n- half the pool is awarded to the support when using a spell on an ally or enemy\r\n- the stack has a limit of 50, and goes up either by player level (like +5 per), or only goes up via the 3 items in the tree (similar to the {{item:3303}} series)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EfficientDynamo","date":"2016-06-17T00:29:28.586+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may be helpful to tackle this problem from the champion mastery  viewpoint.

It is not narrow-minded to say, just mute them. That's why there's a mute button!!!!! The same thing can be applied to voice. Player on your team yelling in your ear? Mute him. Simple as that. You can still communicate via pings.\r\nMuting a player, halts the negativity coming your way. Afterwards, you report said muted player, and it goes to tribunal from there.(which by the way, STILL ISN'T UP AND RUNNING! (gotta get that working again riot.) The system currently in place isn't perfect, but it works, only if you use it.\r\nSo the next time you have a shitty game because someone was saying you don't know how to play/you suck/eat shit and die for missing that skill shot, mute them, and play on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-06-16T22:26:23.712+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":7,"body":"Is there any chance that Victorious Skins could be changed to a \"You got Gold this season, you can pick from the current Victorious Skin or a past year's skin.\"?\r\n\r\nFor example, lets say I main Jarvan IV, and I grind my way up to Gold 5, but the Victorious Skin is Victorious Urgot.

Same idea with victorious skins, people worked hard to get those, Victorious J4 is one of the rarest skins, showing skill at the early age of the game and veterancy.  I've seen that skin once and I'm fine with that, shows that he has game experience and playing for a long time.  If other people were able to earn it than it would be like you getting a super rare Pokemon card and 30%(using that # to show average people in gold+) of the people that also play just got it too.  It's one's own fault for joining the game later in date.  If you REALLY wanted a victorious skin than you should of started to play the game earlier.  As well as each victorious skin is for a season, being able to get any you wouldn't know if they got it for being gold season 1 or last season.

Those players went through a similar struggle that you went through to get the skin, they just choose Victorious Sivir instead of Victorious Urgot. \n\nIf that's the case, then what you're using to set the skin appart is it's age and how few people currently have it. My understanding is that King Bowser is being opened up with this change, so already the precedent is being set for skins that were only available to a select few being available to those determined enough to seek them. \n\n\n> It's one's own fault for joining the game later in date.
