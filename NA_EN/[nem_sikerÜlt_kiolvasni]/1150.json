One, Riot is going to compensate you. I had the original haunting Nocturne, and when he got re-released, I got a nifty little decoration on the loading screen for that skin. It's a way for Riot to give people old content while still acknowledging the legacy players. Two, some people didn't have the opportunity to buy the skin when they came out. Some of us were/are in the military and we're on deployment when these events happen. Should we be punished because we're serving? Maybe someone had a family emergency and didn't have a nickel to spare when the event started so they couldn't get the skin when it came out. Should they be punished for being responsible and understanding the value of a dollar when a crisis arose? \r\nIf you're really against players having another chance at getting content when Riot is still going to give you something to acknowledge you had it vintage, you're just downright selfish.
