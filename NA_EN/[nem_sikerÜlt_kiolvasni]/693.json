Riot nerfed him 6 times last season a q rework a w nerf an E nerf and rift walk nerf and raised his rift walk cooldown reset to 20 seconds. This season another q nerf and now on top of all of this you just come out and destroy his ultimate witch scales off of mana (for no reason at all). What are you giving back too this champion how do you expect anyone too be able too play him when he has no wave clear the only cc he has not only has a cd but also is dependent on spells cast in the area and his q and w cd's are both over 8 seconds. Second too balance ahri after the dfg rework you give her already broken spammable q a speed boost. Ahri has 1 spamable ability that gives a speedboost, heals, and does regular and true dmg. then instead of just leaving Veigar alone or giving him a slight speed boost or more hp too help his planning you change his kit. The q is interesting at least but the event horizon nerf makes no sense i'll just leave it at that. Back too kassiden you don't want him too roam thats ok, you don't want him too be able too jump teams like ahri and lb too get at adc's even though most of them have a support escapes and tons of items they can buy too help ok but don't leave him as a champion with 8 second cd's his only form of CC conditional on spells cast in the area .6 scaling on his abilities (sucks when you only get them every 8 seconds) and still have a 5 second cd. An Ultimate that scales off of mana as if he's ryze and makes it almost impossible too build him with any form of cdr because you have to spend 1-2 items just too get mana.","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-02-25T01:42:29.357+0000","up_votes":87,"down_votes":4,"body":"you make some good points but this is very hard \"too\" read :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-02-25T00:39:42.366+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"This should be a top comment instead of all the one line puns about revive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shandamon","date":"2015-02-24T21:13:08.399+0000","up_votes":217,"down_votes":27,"body":"RIP Revive {{summoner:10}} .

His main problem was always his mobility coupled with his high damage. So, it's only normal that the balance team fix one of those variables, perhaps both.\r\n\r\nSo, they started by tackling his damage, BUT they made him a mobility monster in the process (Decreasing his ult cooldown). Which I think was a really bad move. Kass could go in, deal good (nerfed) damage, zhonyas, and go out without any kind of possible retaliation.\r\n\r\nBecause of this Kass was never nerfed, but buffed. And so, we get to this point where he needs to be nerfed, but the range on his ult is a bad aproach.\r\n\r\nI think there are to variables to nerf him. Damage and Mobility.\r\n\r\nDamage is low as is now, except end game (via good ratios), which is good, because you feel good buying AP and setting aside some tankiness. (FUN ASPECT)\r\n\r\nMobility should be the tackled, but by increasing Riftwalk cooldoown, not by decreasing its range. I think you feel much better riftwalking 700 range every 6 secs than 450 every 3 secs (the duration of the ult now).\r\n\r\nThe numbers are just explanatory, my point is, that traveling further is much more satisfactory than travelling more often. \r\n\r\nIf good cooldown numbers are achieved, a cooldown long enough that make Kassadin a dead Kassadin if he riftwalk incorrectly then we don't need to decrease his range, a change which is horrible (ANTI-FUN perhaps?) for the Kassadin players and won't make a difference for his enemies.\r\n\r\nRiftwalk could remain as a \"think before act\" tool instead of another spamming ability.\r\n\r\n{{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"passıon","date":"2015-02-24T23:17:29.840+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":5,"body":"The new Katarina splash is bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProjectKronos","date":"2015-02-25T00:20:32.838+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":3,"body":"Here's a {{champion:38}} nerf:\r\nQ - heals enemies\r\nW - heals enemies\r\nE - heals enemies\r\nR - instantly kills allied champions and heals all enemy champions","replies":[]},{"poster":"Visigoth","date":"2015-02-24T21:20:30.224+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":3,"body":"Rest in Piece {{champion:38}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"DirtyDanish","date":"2015-02-24T21:26:08.919+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":17,"body":"Nerf Xerath stun but not Morgana snare?","replies":[{"poster":"BUNNNN","date":"2015-02-24T21:31:35.629+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":24,"body":"that's the only thing morgana has man cmon..","replies":[{"poster":"Viliant","date":"2015-02-25T00:02:02.205+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":5,"body":"is.. is this a joke?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Billlbert","date":"2015-02-24T21:43:32.536+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":13,"body":"because black shield is TOTALLY NOT OP","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leafybeans","date":"2015-02-24T21:22:54.583+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:75}} {{champion:26}}  will be a mean combo...","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhostDraggon","date":"2015-02-24T22:07:03.288+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh lord they KILLED Veigars stun -__- now any mid laner with any bit of reaction speed and mobility(most of them have some sort of mobility) will be able to completely avoid it.
