That's where the blue essence is supposed to come in. The \"Participation in matches\" part.\r\n\r\nYou get blue essence from boxes. Boxes you can only get once from each individual champion within a season (apart from buying them for rp). To get that box, you must also get something within the \"S\" family during that match, or be in a premade group with someone who made something within the \"S\" family during that match. In this case, the S is counted toward the champion you are playing and not the champion your teammate was playing, so you cannot get another box for the champion you were playing in that season.\r\n\r\nOh and Blue essence isn't even an auto drop from boxes (at least not the ones you get from the S games on champions.), so in theory, you could participate in many games, and get boxes because you have gotten Ss in those games, and have many mastery tokens, but not be able to upgrade because of lack of blue essence. \r\n\r\nI personally am sitting on several champions that I would be able to upgrade, but cannot because of lack of blue essence (even though I have participated in many many games).\r\n\r\nAllowing us to buy blue essence with IP (which you get for participation in every game) will bring more balance to this system I think and make the participation aspect of the system more about participation and less about RNG. \r\n\r\nAnother thing, I have found myself not wanting to play certain champs because I don't wanna get a mastery token on them that would be wasted/unusable. Maybe if something was added that gave you the option to disenchant mastery tokens into blue essence or something else, people could have a use for tokens they get aside from the ones needed to upgrade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ĘbbAndƒlowey","date":"2016-06-01T20:13:05.768+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, it shows that you were skilled enough with you champ to easily do better than your average champion's player by a LARGE extent.

And in my opinion, it does, but at a price.\r\n\r\nIn perfect Riot logic. \"We need moneez.\" You're banking on the fact that A. You can earn these chests through others or yourself. If you've already reached the maximum number of chests earned, than wait five days to get (hopefully) your blue essence and then mastery. or if you've played champs that were fun to you, you're now forced to pick champions that you just don't enjoy playing with, worse, you have to earn an S. Woo hoo. Don't even get me started on keys, I feel like the keys are a rarity earned nowadays (Last key shard was earned 2 weeks ago roughly...) And B. Chests are RNG based. You don't know if you're going to get champion or skins in the draw. How do you increase your chances of getting blue essence? Buy them in the shop of course!\r\n\r\nYou may as well have sold these mastery borders in the shop seperately, instead of making us pray that we get lucky with blue essence, at least then it would feel a bit more justified. Kinda, not really.\r\n\r\nAll in all, masteries 6/7 should have been given the same treatment as 4/5.

You state \"Triforce is not viable for many champs now\" when the example champions you listed like these changes.\r\n\r\nIf anything, Xin, Irelia, Darius, and Gnar benefit MORE from the changes than anything. The RNG-based Crit (that they DON'T build any more of) is tossed out for more AS (synergizes with their onhit components) and more CDR (synergizes  with them as casters). This also helps Gnar go into Stinger instead of Sheen as an intermediate item for TF instead of (again) tossing stats into a Zeal (crit and lower AS) that he doesn't optimally use.\r\n\r\nI just...don't understand. Fighters value this more, and even not crit-reliant ADCs ala Corki, Ezreal, Kog'Maw, and Vayne are going to give this a heavy consideration. We'll see TF moreso now than before. Crit-heavy builds prefer the other Zeal items anyway since TF was too expensive for the mere 20% Crit and low AD. We only saw TF when people were so far ahead that they wanted to style on the enemy.
