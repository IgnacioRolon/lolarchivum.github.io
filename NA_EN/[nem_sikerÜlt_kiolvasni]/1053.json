It deserves a VERY Special reward. Why not let Honor 5 players pick ANY skin ever made? Even special skins, not currently available, or one with a special requirement. Put H5 2019 or the Honor 5 ward WATERMARK somewhere on the skin ART... so those playing against that 'special skined' person KNOW they are an Honor 5 player and that they chose THAT SKIN as their favorite of ALL skins that year! The upshot for LOL is that you do not have to make ANY new skins... just watermark the one chosen with that year's watermark! The bonus for LOL players is that they can get ANY skin made EVER for a champion they play, love or just collect. The watermark will let all know this and preserve the integrity of the original skin requirements!\r\nWHAT A GREAT INCENTIVE TO MAKE IT TO THE HONOR 5 LEVEL EACH YEAR! ANY SKIN MADE... ONCE A YEAR after LOTS of positive playing at League! That's a great PLUS for league, all Honor 5 players and the League community in general.
