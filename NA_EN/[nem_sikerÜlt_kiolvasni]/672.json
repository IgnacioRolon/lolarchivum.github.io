Give Riot a break already.  \r\n  \r\nDynamic queue is exactly what people have been asking for, for years.  If you do not what to play ranked since your team will have a chance of being more coordinated(as a 4-man-premade-team) then before, then don't.  This has no downfall to your queue since after about 400 ranked games, most players are withing 1-2 divisions of me almost every game, meaning I would have a good chance to queue with them EVEN IN SoloQ.  PLUS having a whole other queue will increase queue times to more then 10m.

The roster changes are designed to make each member of the class feel unique and distinct to play. When I think of what a burst mage should be, I think of Annie or perhaps Leblanc. Annie is a fairly binary character who's unique ability/playstyle is centered in Tibbers. However, Tibbers doesnt feel impactful after that initial summon. Riot is looking to make Tibbers more frightening post-summon to highlight that iconic interaction. Syndra on the other hand is super unique. However, syndra doesnt see play becasue of her low ratios. Riot has her balanced this way because she is too good at evrything. When you have single or multitarget cc and tons of damage, somethings got to give. Riot has stated that they want to focus on the fantasy of her balls becoming more menacing over the course of the game. Hope this helps.
