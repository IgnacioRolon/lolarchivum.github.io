Jumping in for the NA LCS Events team, they've been exploring the concept of a fan loyalty rewards program (w/ frequent match visitor cards), as we recognize the importance and influence of our diehard and returning fans, and would like to reciprocate and show appreciation for their loyalty. However, the program has not yet come to fruition and will not be available on opening weekend. When we are closer to launch we will share more details with the NA LCS fans on Lolesports. Hope to see you at the NA LCS Studio!","replies":[{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2018-01-23T15:42:53.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have watched the last couple of ones.

Ignore the community who says that NA is now your cash cow. I predict that viewship numbers will be a lot lower since you decided to screw the community and not even respond to any comments, feedback, or complains about these controversial switch. It is all about money at this point, not the fans, not the players, money, pure and simple. Not one single comment from anyone about this switch from best of 3s to best of 1s. Zero feedback from anyone at riot or even an attempt to defend it. I won't be watching much this split because there is no reason to. NA is no longer competitive at worlds because you stripped them of playing the same number of games as the other major regions. I did this a while ago but NA plays less than half the number of games of Korea, China, and LMS per split. Otherwise known as the other major regions. All 5 of these regions including NA and EU have guaranteed slots at MSI and Worlds. Every other region must be in the play in. They are also the only major region to use best of ones. Only 5 regions use best of 1, NA (North America), LCL (Russia), LLN (Latin America North), CLS (Latin America South), and TCL (Turkey). Notice that even in those emerging regions, there are a lot that use best of 3. CBLOL (Brazil) Bo3, LJL (Japan) Bo3, and OPL (Oceania) Bo3. Why are NA and EU suddenly relegated to the best of 1 format?\r\n\r\nJust for the math, China (LPL), Korea (LCK), and Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macao (LMS) all use the best of 3 format. Each team in LPL and LCK, due to the fact there are 10 teams, will play 19 matches over the course of 10 weeks, with each match being the best of 3. That is at least 38 games per split (if every match is only 2 games) and up to 57 games (if every match is 3 games). LMS has only 8 teams but still a 10 week season, 14 matches, and at least 28 games and a max of 42. EU still has it's 10 week season so it has at least 20 games, still not enough. NA has a 9 week season with each team playing 2 games per weekend. That is 18. So that means that NA plays their full season in just over half of the rest of the major regions. So how is that fair to NA and EU teams and players? That means they have less time on stage to get not only used to the experience, but also to hone their skills on stage. Training and scims can only go so far. Not to mention the fan backlash when this was announced and no one seemed to want to comment on it so let's look at that.\r\n\r\nIt's funny but you read through the comments section for NA ( http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/na-lcs-format-update-2018 ) and EU ( https://eu.lolesports.com/en/articles/eu-lcs-in-2018-and-beyond ) when these changes were announced, there is hate everywhere. Just about no one likes it and no one who says that it is a bad idea gets a response. In fact, on both, there is literally no one from Riot who responded to the backlash. The NA article has over 500 comments, and the EU 80, and with few exceptions, few are positive of the change. Literally everyone says NA and EU will be less competitive now because they don't get as much experience on stage and don't play as many games as the rest of the major regions. There is NOT ONE RIOT DEV COMMENT ANYWHERE IN THOSE COMMENT SECTIONS! Not one attempt to respond or attempt to explain anything. Everyone just lashes on about what this is, nothing more than a money grab and to make NA and EU less competitive and degrade the teams. NA finally was having a good time, and so was EU, but with this decision, the teams will be relegated quickly. There are multiple accusations of riot not listening to their fans and that is just further confirmed when no one wants to talk about this, comment on it, or do anything with it. It's just a no go zone and no one seems to want to care.\r\n\r\nBring NA and EU up to the exact same standards as LCK, LPL, and LMS or put everyone on the same schedule. You are the one managing this fiasco and not giving everyone the same playing field is just wrong. You intentionally disenfranchise regions while promoting others. That isn't fair, and you should be ashamed of it. NA and EU are great regions, but because of their popularity you don't see them as competitive, rather as your cash cows.\r\n\r\nDownvote this all your want, but the truth is vital. NA is now back to being a joke and I will not be watching until riot actually starts doing what they say they do and listen to people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scorpius Kluge","date":"2018-01-19T23:39:12.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is Awesome !
