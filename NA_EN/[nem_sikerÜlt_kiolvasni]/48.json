There is a huge problem with giving Officers(or at least the second tier role up from basic member) the right to \"kick.\" In an MMORPG, it's not that big of a deal... because so much work and effort is put into those \"guilds,\" and so many benefits come with them; that people generally wont troll if they're given rights in a guild.\r\n\r\nHowever, I foresee YUGE problems with trolling in League clubs, as the whole perception is just so casual. As a club owner, I'd be waaaay to weary of giving people the right to kick.\r\n\r\nI propose:\r\n\r\nOwner> Obviously all the ownery stuff that comes with it.\r\nGeneral> THIS person should be allowed to KICK and RECRUIT.\r\nOfficer> This person should be allowed to **RECRUIT NEW MEMBERS ONLY** NOT kick.\r\nMember> Just a member.\r\n\r\nHaving only three roles makes promoting extremely delicate, and therefore less incentive in the longrun for members. As a new club owner, I'd like to promote all the early members to Officer, but not if they can easily just clear the whole club by kicking everyone. It'd be nice just to have some help recruiting though.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Damned","date":"2016-03-15T09:58:47.958+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Also, I recommend giving incentives, such as but not limited to:**\r\n\r\n**Daily Skin Boosts for club members.** > Give Officers+ rights to buy these for the club, or even just the owner if ya wanna be stingy xD\r\n**\r\nDaily IP Boosts for club members.** > If possible, make this separate to that of a daily skin boost.
