I mean, would you consider the Sion relaunch not an event? Riot thought it was a pretty big deal. Also those traditional skins were made Legacy in honor to the playerbase and those who previously owned them. Ask anyone who owns one of the traditional skins if said skin should be available to the public with ease of access. I guarantee the answer will be \"no\" and that's the polite way to say it. Those traditional skins hold a special meaning to the players and Riot saw and respected that.\n\nWhenever a skin is made into a Legacy, there is a reason for it. But instead of arguing back and forth about it, lets play a game.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Champion-Skin-Types#h1\n\nHere is a list of all the Legacy skins.

We got them for free owning the champion previously, they could still be in the store to buy for everyone else.  They have another traditional skin (Lee sin) who is always in the store and wasn't removed after his update, so why not him?\n\nThey could make a new category if they chose to, but I still don't see the skin as part of the Harrowing event as it was released afterwards and wasn't promoted as part of it.","replies":[{"poster":"eztarg3t","date":"2014-11-06T03:33:27.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first paragraph: You see it one way, a lot of people see it another.\n\nYour second paragraph: Again, you see it one way, and again, a lot of other people see it another.
