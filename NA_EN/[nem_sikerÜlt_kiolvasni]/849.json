It's kinda like how they refused to let Kled jungle, or modified Kindred's W so that it only really provides benefits for jungling. Or even how Yorick's goal is to splitpush, splitpush, splitpush.

Ultimately I believe that's up to player skill. I do agree that Riot has moved away from making jack of all trades but every champion they've made can be used in at least 2 roles. How good you are at using the champion outside of the role it was originally created for comes down to your skill with that champion.\r\n\r\nI can see Ivern working in top lane or even support as well, depends on the team comp though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MeBuffULongTime","date":"2016-09-20T21:06:48.052+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"First?","replies":[{"poster":"DeGibblets","date":"2016-09-20T21:07:54.004+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Second?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spidey Senses","date":"2016-09-20T21:20:18.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I.
