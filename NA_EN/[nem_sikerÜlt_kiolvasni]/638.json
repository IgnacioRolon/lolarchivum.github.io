Unfortunately, despite literally hundreds of man hours of testing, we were never able to find a 100% repro case (or even a 10% one) and claiming to fix something when you can't prove that it's fixed is a super negative player experience. All it takes is one failed fix that costs you a kill for you to stop trusting us when we say we fixed things (and that's not unreasonable).\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately, some of our awesome engineers and designers worked to create some engine and logging improvements so we could track this thing down and resolve it. If you still experience this issue, PLEASE let us know!

I was kind of inclined to agree the the OP (still think Riot is a bit too focused on competitive play at the expense of the casual crowd, but that's another discussion) and you raised a great point I didn't consider.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of issues that have bugged players forever...are there any plans to ever squash cases where you flash and die, but the flash should've saved you or you shouldn't have been able to flash in the first place due to being dead (example: flashing away from a melee ability like Garen Q and still having it hit) and end up losing your flash for nothing?  Or is this just a result of latency and the way the engine works that we have to deal with?  I'm sure this has been discussed before but I can't remember what the official word was.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"J9X","date":"2014-05-07T20:27:50.039+0000","up_votes":205,"down_votes":6,"body":"the new skin for {{champion:80}} looks bad ass..
