I think these changes disincentiveise early aggression out of Shyvana, with your increased E damage in Dragon, more reliable engage and lower overall synergy with flat HP I think that the build of choice will be Cinder>GA.

(read, if we feel funny enough we are going to deliver another stealth nerf, because she hadn't had enough so far since devourer made enemy bronze junglers ragequit and throw their keyboards on the ground).\nNot counting that going the defensive tree (which was a choice before, now it's mandatory, but hey, we talk a lot of \"choice and stuff\" just to throw some noise in the ears of the listener), shyvana is going to miss a lot of the damage she got from the thunderlords tree, and considering the HP from ult are situational, is nothing even close to what SOTA gave.\n\nWith the trail removal you can't pop most of the \"out of combat\" effcts, or create those paths that made it dangerous for someone at risk such as a low hp target or a support to walk across, the E is maybe funnier to shoot if you can detonate it mid air or launch it olaf style, but it has an extremely less AOE, so it means i won't be able to mark more targets at once and switch between them during a fight if i get kited unless the circle is at least big as much as the old E aoe, while the W size increase is unnoticeable unless it's massively increased, but in that case it would feel both weird and overpowered, not something i need.\nAlso the human form is straight up nerfed for no fucking reason, now i can hit multiple targets only if i'm ulting, so it means i can't hold it for gap closing or escaping and everybody can just stand in front of my target and laugh at me as my E goes wasted, and this is a pretty big fucking nerf.\n\nI explicitly asked you to leave shyvana alone once and for all, you say you're gonna look on her, i expect buffs, i receive nerfs. Masked as buffs.\nAnd then there are some sycophants that even praised those changes or people asking me and wondering why i'm so pissed at riot all the times.\nGood job riot, keep up the good work.\n\n-edit-\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/2TvutxOg-ability-update-shyvana?comment=0054","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-18T23:53:57.441+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":20,"body":"It's an okay change though.\n\nNo need to get so riled up.\n\nIt's only a nerf if you insist on playing her the exact same way.
