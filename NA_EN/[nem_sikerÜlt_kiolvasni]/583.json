One thing I think a lot of other games in the genre have is more emphasis on positioning and interesting ways to reach the backline.

All your units are basically just about delaying or disabling the enemy until your carry can ramp up and stomp hard.

RNG should only be used in dev when it enhances the game.  \r\n\r\nWith that as a given, ask this:  What is game enhancing about random opponents?  \r\n\r\nA round-robin opponent mode would be much better in that it would eliminate the streaky and un-enjoyable luck of facing the same OP opponent over and over, and it would enhance the skill in the game in that the player will have to pay attention to who they are fighting next and can then try to position their pieces accordingly.  Piece positioning as a skill can never be emphasized too much!\r\n\r\nEven if the argument is valid that facing an OP opponent over and over evens out in the end by you BEING that opponent, that's not the point here.  In fact, it's even more argument in favor of the round-robin because if everything just balances out with respect to opponent selection, then there REALLY is no point to the RNG.  In that case RNG only provides short term imbalance.  I haven't heard anyone say that enjoy that form of RNG in the game.\r\n\r\nPlease.  Kill the RNG opponent selection.  Add the ghost army when there's an odd number of opponents.  Easy day.
