It's not something you can use without the skin. Nevertheless, it's something I wanted until I did two seconds of research. The fact that you have to spend money on top of money to get the ability to grind up and HOPEFULLY get the chroma is just disgusting. Should you happen to buy the master pass and not manage to scrape together enough completed missions, for any reason, you're just out of luck. \"Sorry, friend\", says Riot, fanning themselves with the money you've tossed their way for literally no gain on your end. That's been my opinion on these passes from the beginning, but it couldn't be more obvious now, with all of these missions becoming more and more intrusive into the regular game.
