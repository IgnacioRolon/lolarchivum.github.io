Your overall score is determined from your Kills, Assists, Deaths, CS, Objective Participation, Wards Placed, Wards Destroyed, and Gold Earned. It also takes into consideration how well your teammates did that particular game. So if you are Support Soraka and you do much better than the average Support Soraka in your elo than you would get an S however if your entire team does exceedingly well then your grade will be lowered.
