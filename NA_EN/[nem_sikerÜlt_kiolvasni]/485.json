Locking so much exclusive content behind bundles just to up charge for content people don't want.

Yet the bundle costs 3086...did some calculation and 80% of 3840 is in fact 3072. On this page, the \"Lovebirds Ward\" is incorrectly listed as 650 RP when it's 640 in the client store. Even taking 20% off of 3850 isn't 3086 but rather 3080. Why is there an extra 14 RP charge? That would make the bundle more of 19.6% off, NOT 20% off as it states. 14 RP might be a small amount but it might be a difference in the future when you need that last 5 RP or something. \r\n\r\nTL;DR The Sweetheart Xayah and Rakan bundle is off by about 0.4% or 14 RP, please explain. {{sticker:sg-lux-2}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flame Storms","date":"2018-02-12T17:31:02.828+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will the older skins be available individually or just in a bundle?
