Splash art is beautiful. Model preview gif looks good, too! In-game screencap is both different AND flat-looking.  \r\n\r\nWhy is it that almost every skin has these problems? The 3 images above have 3 different sets of details.  For example:\r\n\r\n1) Splash has sheer pink open sleeves, other two are opaque and closed.\r\n2) Model preview has sheer white side panels, splash has pink, and in-game has opaque purple.\r\n\r\nAnd like virtually every other skin in the game, this one looks like it's shipped only after being stripped of contrast and color saturation. For example, the preview has obviously bright white edges on the weapon blades that just look dingy gray in-game. All the shadows are brightened to gray, and most of the highlights are dimmed to gray.\r\n\r\nAnd what's worse is that this is intentional. PBE skins tend to be more vibrant and detailed before they're sent through the \"shitify\" machine to remove anything more ornate than a gradient. (See Ezreal Ace of Spades).","replies":[{"poster":"Knightsundere","date":"2015-06-04T23:32:22.747+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The gradient being so low in contrast is intentional in that it has to match the surrounding enviroment; the map itself is much paler and less contrasted than the previous map (which, you may notice, influenced the skins of its time (forcing those skins to be re-worked/re-colored to better match the new map)). \r\n\r\nIf you have a difference in contrast between multiple textures, the overall game feel conflicts and it creates a conglomerate of varying textures that appear to be from different games entirely; not a good thing, from any perspective. The splash art is obviously going to be different than the ingame skin, as it's meant to shock and wow and be colorful; that's what any advertisement of any product would be like; ever notice how bland cereal looks in your bowl? You don't expect your Cheerio's to be busting with a gold shimmer and hue, do you?","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-06-05T14:52:11.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I understand that the splash art will look different than the in-game art because they are different mediums. I do not think that the DESIGN should be fundamentally different. For example, I think the Crimson Akali skin is ugly and very poor quality, but its design isn't noticeably different from its wonderful splash art.\n\nOther examples that spring to mind are Zyra's base skin. The in-game design has a completely different skin tone than the art where it starts to turn purple/blue around chest level down to her waist. I think Zyra's model and skins are some of the most beautiful in the game, so it's not a complaint about disliking it per se.\n\nFor another example, Blackthorn Morgana's art has a human skin tone. In game it's an undead blue.\n\nIn general, the desaturation still bothers me since it makes skins look cell-shaded, flat, and lifeless. Some of the particles are still bold, though, like torches, some auras, the nexus, and some vaulted skins. The disconnect you're talking about is still there.\n\nAnd it still makes no sense than the model gif, which is supposed to represent the in-game appearance, STILL looks very different from the actual screen shots in-game.

There isn't a \"hiding\" or \"stealth\" mechanic for champions where having cyan armor and magenta hair would completely conflict with the stealth system, if the champ is supposed to \"blend\" with the map they go invisible.\r\n\r\nGreater contrast and saturation would a great small step towards prettier graphics, I suppose Riot should also consider having a checkbox option to choose between shitty or appealing graphics, some people just don't want nice-looking things.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xXx28","date":"2015-06-05T15:46:32.623+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"so beautiful","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuwya","date":"2015-06-05T04:17:06.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now i gotta admit, this was not what i expected to make me buy rp finally but I'm really debating it now.
