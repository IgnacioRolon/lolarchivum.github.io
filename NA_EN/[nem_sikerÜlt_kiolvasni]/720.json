Anyone who plays it a lot understands that there are OP champs for that particular map and they embrace it. I usually ONLY play ARAM because the time it usually takes is considerably shorter than Summoners Rift, and is more exciting and unpredictable right from the start. Of course it has moments of the opposite from time to time, but overall, to me, it is just more fun in general than other maps. Forcing you to play champs you aren't too familiar with sometimes is amazing for newer players to practice with. Hell, its even good for the older players, as it gets them out of their \"META GROOVE\" and back to playing other champs they may be getting rusty with. Check out some of my ARAM highlights and full gameplays I just posted on Youtube. I have just starting to record and edit, but will have TONS more quality content as time goes on. Don't forget to help me out and spread the greatness of ARAM to ALL by leaving a LIKE, SHARE, and you can even Subscribe if you want! I do it all for LOVE.... of ARAM!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSnhd60e8kE\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"VinhDaCh1nKiLLa","date":"2018-07-21T03:53:59.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would LOVE ranked aram. Random champs mean the games are more fair, even though u get shitty teams sometimes, u will get good ones sometimes too so i doesnt matter. I am currently 12 wins and 1 loss in the last 13 games. all 5v5 random u cant tell me that means nothing. i think im the best lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"glokazun","date":"2017-10-07T06:30:13.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ARam is my jam ! want to play a round?{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TruMaverick","date":"2017-04-28T18:31:57.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"plZ!!

It has been an idea I have had for quite some time as well. Also I just posted about it a few days ago. \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/cMOkj3xa-more-champs-for-aram","replies":[]}]}
