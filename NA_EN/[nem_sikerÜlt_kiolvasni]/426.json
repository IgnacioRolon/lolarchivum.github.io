Reader discretion advised.)\r\n\r\nI main support Malphite (and climbed to diamond doing that :D). I've played him - again: as a support - with smite. I dropped the gold item and went straight for the jungle item as my first item. I smited gromp or the big krug for the jungler to make their life easy as pie AND give me a buff to abuse in lane (though gromp is remarkably better in this respect), then added in a hit before following the ADC to lane. I went back at 450 gold (if feasible!) to pick up chilling smite. It adds an okay amount of damage, a movement speed steal (not just a slow) that stacks with the steal on your Q, and a ton of dragon pressure. Its cooldown is also a LOT lower than exhaust's cooldown. If you manage to wait for both smite charges, you can smite twice in fifteen seconds. This can change fights, especially if it allows you to catch up to valuable enemy targets (like the ADC). No ADC runs from a Malphite who stole your movement speed not once, but **twice**. We don't need exhaust, since we have our E for the attack speed slow.\r\n\r\nDoing dragon - even with a non-premade jungler - is as easy as doubling up the damage on your smite and telling your jungler to smite at that point. Since you're (almost) always the lower level, you will never lack damage this way, but still outsmite the enemy. You're also no longer bound to the jungler to take objectives. While you'll likely be behind the enemy jungler in level, you can add in your ult to steal. You're also the one with the sightstone, so they won't outclear your wards. You'll see what they're doing, and you'll punish them for it. Last, but not least, you can easily help your ADC take a camp.\r\n\r\nI won't likely upgrade the stalker's blade fully, since I'm better off building CDR and raw team stats or utility (The obvious Sightstone, Frozen Heart to hamper the enemy, Locket of the Iron Solari to give my team MR, Randuin's Omen to facilitate engages, etc, depending on the game). By the time the game is won (or lost, nobody wins all the time), you will probably still not have an enchantment on your item. And that's okay. You don't need that much gold to function. You just have to spend it wisely. Get the gold - and the dragon buffs - on your team.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Support Malphite with chilling smite is a(n Unstoppable) Force to be reckoned with. You don't even need Cinderhulk (though it's nice), because you're better than the Hulk. You're a boulder. An unstoppable boulder.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Cat","date":"2015-04-24T12:57:07.143+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":16,"body":"First - you dont get gromp buff if you smite him after jungler. If you steal gromp buff from jungler - he is not going to thank you.\r\nSecond - malph is melee and too mana hungry, you cant harass as much as othe supports.\r\nThird - if you take hunter muchete first - it's same as you go on lane with no items, it's just retarded tactics.\r\n\r\nI watched your history game - you take exhaust when you play malph support. Why you bullshit honest people here?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Malph support with smite sucks, Kinaré is lying about getting to diamond like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lickytongue","date":"2015-04-24T15:44:49.476+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dear Wind Cat,\r\n\r\nThanks for responding! Before I'll reply to your points, I'd like to point out that it takes you little effort to accuse someone of lying, and also very little to call someone's approach retarded, their words bullshit, and their story a lie.\r\n\r\nNow, as for an actual point-by-point reply:\r\n\r\nFirst: As far as I know, you do both get a gromp buff if both people smite the gromp. If I've always been mistaken about this, then thank you for teaching me something new! I'll test it, because I don't like operating on what may be incorrect information. If I turn out to be wrong on this point, I feel no shame in admitting it. However - even if I would deny the jungler their gromp buff, losing next to zero health to their first camp and allowing them to almost instantly go for their second camp (or save smite for that second camp), will likely offset most of what losing your gromp buff means to your jungle route. And if what you say is true, I'll just make a point of smiting AFTER our jungler smited as well as informing him to smite first.\r\n\r\nSecond: Malph is melee and he is mana hungry _if you play him with a focus of harass_. I find it peculiar that you assume that I do without first asking me. The way I play Malphite, I don't harass. In fact - I hardly cast spells in lane at all. I'm there, catching skillshots that would otherwise hit my carry (I have a shield, he doesn't), and counter-engaging when they engage on him. For that purpose, I level my E first. I'm not there to harass the enemy, I'm there to ensure my carry stays safe and gets to farm. When they hard-on engage on him, I'm there to mess up the enemy ADC's attack speed and deal a surprisingly high amount of damage in the process. I'm rarely out of mana, and I rarely cast my Q unless the lane is in a state of perpetual fighting. I make it through laning phase just fine as well. Most of the time, I do not even have to use my potions.\r\n\r\nThird: I've done just that and won the lane. I do the aforementioned (written under 2.), and with my runes and masteries, I should be more than tanky enough to last through the first few levels. Two biscuits of total rejuvenation do a whole lot for you, as does your shield. If I think that the lane is going to be too tough to play with a hunter's machete in my pocket, I wouldn't pick smite. I'm not silly. That aside, it's not the equivalent of going to lane without items. It's an equivalent of going to lane with boots and potions: not everyone can do it, as it gives you no direct combat stats. But it certainly builds into something, and it will certainly serve a purpose.\r\n\r\nFourth: I am not bullshitting honest people. I'm an honest person myself, and I don't lie to myself either. I usually take exhaust when I play support Malphite. But I never said that I played every support Malphite game with smite. I said that \"I have played him as a support with smite\". I was stating that I have experience playing Malphite this way, and that all of my observations thus stemmed from this experience. The point I was making was also not that playing Malphite this way is the only way I'd play him, or even my absolute favorite. I was answering Bear Champion's inquiry: \"I really want to see a supp with smite... if you think about it, it's quite effective\". Most of the time, I certainly do take exhaust when I'm supporting! But this totally depends on the situation and the needs of my team as well as the composition of the enemy team.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Don't accuse someone of lying if you haven't given them the opportunity to address your doubts. It's a very bad form of arguing and quite frankly reminds me of populist politics. I did not state that I got to diamond spamming support Malphite with smite, I said that I got to diamond playing support Malphite, and that I have played support Malphite with smite. Last, but not least: Malph support with smite is awesome and really fun to play.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nKinaré","replies":[{"poster":"Lickytongue","date":"2015-04-24T16:48:42.550+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Note: I just tested it, and on the point of the buff, you're completely right!

A good top lane who can smite the gromp often enough has essentially a mini-thornmail, and even better, it screws the other jungler from clearing camps as quickly as they are missing the buff.  Gromp, challenging smite, and cinderhulk make someone like a Shyvana or Sion an absolute terror.\r\n\r\nYou also have to take into account the bonus health multiplier that cinderhulk gives, particularly with champs like Sion who build lots of health and also stack more and more of it with his W passive, 6k health Sion's are easy to build in any game that lasts 30 minutes now, not to mention he gets a challenging smite that pretty much helps him 1v1 almost anyone except maybe a fed vayne.\r\n\r\nExhaust also has a much longer cooldown, 210 seconds, smite is 75 seconds.  \r\n\r\nEach individual thing in and of itself isn't that powerful, but when you add it all up, it becomes a pretty big advantage.\r\n\r\nUntil Riot either buffs sunfire or nerfs cinderhulk even further, it's going to be a thing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"noaelectroman","date":"2015-04-22T19:55:11.949+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":33,"body":"Dear Riot, person with account NeverJokeToMe send me some kind of virus and with this he stole me my account and play with account one game and stole 1000influence points, i returned my account back with changing password.

If anything needs the nerf it is Skirmisher's, it needs its duration changed to 3/4 seconds so you can't have it up for an entire fight. I may not be a challenger player but i can tell you that if Skirmisher's gets a duration nerf it would honestly fix this problem of it being a necessity in pro play and messing with solo queue.

The problem is Cinderhulk,it is just way to OP in the jungle and makes Tank Jungler way to strong. Toplane people are just taking the only Smite that is usefull in Laneright now. If you would nerf Skirmishers they would just take a different Smite to get Cinderhulk.","replies":[{"poster":"A Dove Like You","date":"2015-04-23T15:47:03.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes but they would be giving up something to build it, right now all they give up is mobility in exchange for a very good offensive and defensive spell that allows them to fight anyone and win...  Laners should be able to build jungle items if they want and take smite if they want but they should have to give something up for it, Skirmishers makes it so you dont have to give anything up in fact you GAIN power by having skirmishers over flash.
