Ekko is a skirmisher who blows you up if you let him jump on you and you don't kill him first. Camille is a diver who waits around for a good opportunity to enter a fight, does so, and proceeds to chunk out everyone in sight. And don't say she's basically Vi or Hecarim or Irelia, because she's not. Her kit is different and requires different execution. She plays with precision and sorta embodies what it means to be a _diver_ over just a facemelter or a high damage initiator or a pseudo-assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"General Theritt","date":"2016-12-05T22:39:47.450+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agreed on your points there, but she's less precision and more... brute force. My friend played the PBE and claims her extremely simple, and overpowered, as she embodies quick assassination while building tanky, very similar the the characters mentioned. You can go on about her E being all unique, but her two other abilities are just brute force kicks and attacks, and her ult is a bigger jarvan ult, less focused on the burst in a zone and rather trapping out a single unit (once again, Irelia, Vi, or Hecarim can do the same things less efficiently, with only 1 of them having true damage).\r\n\r\nHer passive makes her scale in and provides a shield for problematic engages or encounters.  (Vi, Irelia (CC shielding)). \r\n\r\nHer Q is an easy triforce proc and provides true damage, which to be honest, is absolutely insane considering this is an bruiser/assassin/high damage initation, and there's a reason we don't provide assassins or initation with easy access to true damage besides specific abilities (usually with not even all that much) items or red buff. (Q being similar to Vi's E, Hecarim's Q, and Irelia's Q, W, E, with all of them being her primary resets for autos)\r\n\r\nHer W is simple, with % max HP damage and sustain no less, also providing a large slow (Vi's W, Hecarim's W, and Irelia's W, with more or less just better effects if hit on the outer ring)\r\n\r\nHer E is flat out ridiculous, providing extreme mobility and an long duration stun that is almost unnecessary considering she'll most likely aim for a bunch of targets grouped up since its an AOE stun. It also provides an extremely quick get away dash, and a secondary dash if needed, providing more than deemably strong mobility to an already ridiculous effect. And it provides attack speed. Yeah. (See Vi's Q+E combo, Irelia's Q+E+W combo, and hecarim's W+Q combo)\r\n\r\nHer ult was described earlier, but just to summarize: You are stuck. Camille's team gets to hail mary the zone and if you're the one target, screw you, because you aren't safe. All it takes is one target, and you're done, not even the other bruisers can burst you down, and usually don't have a trap zone to help, meaning even if I ult as Vi or hecarim, Camille has the ability to call for her team to mark down her target, while the others have to hope during a teamfight that their engage is recognized and is assassinated fast enough before their CC wears off. (See Hecarim's Ult, and Vi's ult)\r\n\r\nShe just does what all these tanks do... but just... better. Its disgusting how much they actually overloaded her kit and made a lot of iconic abilities for these champions. you'd pick these champions that had equal strengths but varying weaknesses, meaning you had to choose a situation where one was good over the other, and just place Camille as a multi-tool capable of doing their jobs for them with just a better kit. And don't tell me \"she's skill based\" because no offense, but AoE stuns aren't hard to land. Especially with 2 dashes, one that passes through a wall, and then a jarvan ult that your team can just walk through towards the target.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nepa","date":"2016-12-05T19:07:52.329+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:238}} My Blades are the deadliest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2016-12-05T21:12:08.416+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok Rito, I'm seriously curious tho....\n\nIs her leg-grappling hook inspired from \"**Attack on Titan**\"?
