Riot is giving you the chance to get free skins and all you do is complain. \"I want this skin, I wanted that skin. I don't even play Ezreal, why did you give me the stupid TPA skin?\" I am grateful for every single skin I have gotten, even if I don't play that champion. Hell, I even have a reason to learn that champ now. Don't like a skin? Disenchant it, or save it for a re-roll. Riot Games let's you play a free game and now gives you free skins and champions. You all throw a fit when your support takes the gold and cs, yet you get mad when Riot tries to make a little money for all the hard work they put into this game. You can earn Soulstealer Vayne in a normal chest, or with gem stones. Either way, you either need to learn to have the patience of a Lee Sin camping top lane, or just give up and take a chance in other lanes. I'd personally would like to thank Riot for giving someone like me; who can't afford skins, have the chance to receive such nice skins. I appreciate what you do for your players.","replies":[{"poster":"hi im blackbox","date":"2016-06-30T03:27:55.864+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"YES\r\n\r\nI am a {{champion:67}} main and I approve and completely agree.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2016-06-30T13:48:24.232+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":9,"body":"I think the main problem is theme consistency.
