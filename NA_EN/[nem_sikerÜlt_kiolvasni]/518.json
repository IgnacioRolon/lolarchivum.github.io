She's not Olaf and should never want to be low hp.\n\nWhile you're at it make Bushwhack and Swipe actually interesting skills that do something and give her a personal reason to have attackspeed on her Primal Surge. You removed AD Nidalee from the picture even though it made more sense than any other iteration of Nidalee thematically and kit wise.  You could have balanced AD and AP Nidalee into the game but made a decision to remove AD Nidalee as a viable secondary path.\n\nAlso why is she the only champion who's skillshots are balance so harshly by hitbox size??? The average skillshot size is 100 units while Nidalee's is 40 units.  The average projectile speed is 1800-2000 units per second(EX:Ashe ult and Ez Q) while Nidalee is at 1300(Lux and Morg are 1200) units per second. Her pre-rework Q used to be 120 units like current morganas which was/is ridiculous but the current size is just as ridiculous to play with as the old one was to play against.  We have to make perfectly aimed shots for high damage and potential dangerous all-ins while champions like Lux or morgana, etc have huge high damage skillshots that have huge hit boxes and provide powerful CC that not only they can act on but team mates as well.  How have strong CC's not gotten this hitbox treatment? Was the hitbox seriously that imba?

Hell I can admit that Nidalee can be unfun to play against but I've never considered her cancerous.  She's just been consistently poorly balanced by people that don't play her or fully understand her kit.  She needs people who understand her kit and have a broader view of the game and her role/performance to come up with balance ideas.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xareav","date":"2017-09-13T05:18:43.105+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"I gave up on jungle Nidalee.  She's entirely reliant on hitting qs which have a hit radius roughly the size of the dot on an i (40 units, apparently).  Her q is slow enough to dodge without seriously compromising your escape speed.  When compared to more dangerous skillshots like from a Morg/Lux gank - skillshots that are going to kill you in a gank, vs one that might - it's just too challenging to reliably land.  Added to that, whereas yes she can dive afterwards, if her burst fails to kill someone her extraction options all involve the fountain.\n\nI agree that the old hitbox was too big, but I don't feel like 60 is unreasonable.  The downside to this is that it would make it harder to snipe through minions.\n\nAnyway, rather than constantly playing with her e heal (is it really that big of a deal?  She's not going to win any sustained fight ever; she lands her q or moves on), how about a modest decaying burst of speed when she heals?  This would give her a slightly better disengage as well as enabling her to heal her front line/diving ally and allow them to continue an engage while she stayed back and set up another long range q.  This would effectively allow her to \"support gank\" so that failing to land her initial q didn't always involve an utterly failed and useless gank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2017-09-12T21:58:14.113+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":12,"body":"you can't argue using evidence from Lux and Morg, because they are not in the same class as Nidalee, and those abilities u referenced are used more for their utility than their dmg.

While other parts of ur argument are valid, this one section is not, if u find some better evidence to base ur argument off of, then u may have a better point\n\nAll three skills are designed to setup the rest of the champions kit providing the same fulfillment in different ways.  The difference is damage and utility.  I'd argue that the utility provided far outweighs the damage but your right.  For the most part they aren't the same role one utility/poke mage, one, utility team fight mage/support, and one poke support/assassin.  My big issue is that so many skillshots have so much power and out of all of them the only one that has been balanced specifically around hitbox size is Nidalee and it was done very aggressively.  Every skillshot hitbox in the game is 100+ units wide except Nidalee. Almost every skillshot in the game has a projectile speed of 2000 units per second with the exception of a few large AOE skillshots.  Ex: Ashe & Ez ults are like 1600-1800, Lux & Morg Q's are 1200, and Anivia Q is 800...\n\nNidalee's old Q used to be 120 and that was ridiculous to play against because it would hit when it visually never connected but the current 40 is ridiculous to play with.  It's so small you literally see people walk through it frequently without it connecting even though it does visually.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2017-09-12T21:22:34.121+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can ornn pls not be the deciding factor for when the upgrades happen?
