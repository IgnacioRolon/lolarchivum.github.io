There's so many god dang trolls on the rank, and afkers, its impossible for me to rank up, I learn from  my mistakes, but with other people, they hold me back, I dropped from s4 to b4 but almost b3 again, any tips for me?\n\nI wish there was one magical solution, but unfortunately, there's just a lot of very small things that come together. I can tell you what worked for me, and maybe that will be helpful?\n\nFirst and foremost, I had to stop caring about ranking up.  I think so many people tunnel in on every win and loss, that they aren't able to focus on actually improving what they're doing.  I went in to every game, not looking at my rank, or at anyone else's.  I ended every game by saying \"gg\", and then immediately hitting \"play again\".  Never look at LP loss or gains.  They don't matter. (side note: I honestly didn't realize I was in my gold promos until after my first win.)\n\nOnce I got myself into that mode, I started looking at what I was doing in the game.  I don't know if I mentioned this, but I'm a support main.  So I had to ask myself \"what is my primary objective?\"  Keeping the adc alive is a good one... positioning in lane... keeping the enemy off cs... trying to set up kills... etc.  I'd lump all of that into \"game basics\" in my role.  I set small goals like \"do not die, or let the enemy team kill my adc, for the first X minutes\".  Or \"Refuse at least one wave's worth of CS to the enemy adc by X minutes\".   And just practiced these things with a few different types of champs (mostly leona, braum, soraka, morg).  If you asked me at the beginning of the season, I would have told you I was a Leona main.  I do have MOST of my games with her still, and my mechanics with her are pretty good... but now I think it's healthier not to pick a main champion, because I found that I was trying to solve every problem with Leona's skills.  Real talk?  That got me out of bronze, but I could only pull that off for so long, because more skilled players know how to counter her.  Anyway, so learning matchups and having a big enough champ pool to counter, or at least face any opponent was critical.  Once I got to the point where I felt like I was able to help control the flow of most lane match-ups, I focused on practicing skills for mid/late game... peeling, shot calling... etc.  \n\nAnother important thing for me to do was to actually PLAY the other roles.  So, I no longer freak out if I don't get my role pref.  That was huge for me, and sometimes now, it's actually nice to get to play another lane.\n\nIf there's one thing you'll notice in everything I've mentioned above, I only talk about what ... I ... did.  So the absolute, MOST, important thing any player can do to rank up, is stop telling yourselves that the problem is the teams you're getting put on.  Yes, we all get shitty teams sometimes... it happens... but statistically, if you play a lot of games, and you're improving, and being a positive player yourself... you're going to rank up.  If you're too focused on how crappy your team is, then that's going to negatively impact your performance, and you'll end up dropping in rank as a result.  Carry your lane, play a LOT of games, and hope for the best\n\nAnyway, I hope that's helpful!  Good luck, have fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SHlTBUG","date":"2015-10-07T05:00:35.583+0000","up_votes":82,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Spyglass","date":"2015-10-07T18:19:06.609+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":3,"body":"More or less this - and I think the bronze parallel is spot on.

I was just stressed out one day and had one bad game. I got banned over that game and I'm 100% sure I haven't been excessively toxic since. I feel as though however spending all this time on the game, grinding and playing to get D5 and now suddenly being told I can't get my rewards isn't fair. If Riot had given a warning at the beginning of the season that players who are banned this season won't be receiving any rewards I'm sure almost half of the players who were banned wouldn't be. It would be a great solution and fair to those who were banned. Taking away rewards from my gameplay over a ban thats already been done is ridiculous imo, as you were already punished. Now being punished again months later over something you already reformed will obviously make people angry. Not all banned players are toxic, and honestly picking on the players who suddenly at the end of the season were banned just seems wrong to me. What about those at the beginning or middle? Sure they might've reformed but I'm sure some of the players who were banned within these 3 months have reformed. I don't know, I get they're trying to punish banned players more but this just makes me angry. Maybe my rant sounds stupid and that of course a \"toxic\" player would be saying this, but honestly through playing league for 5 years this was all I really wanted. Hitting diamond and being able to show everyone I did. It kind of makes me sad that I have to wait another year to do it again. I wish Riot would just give us the rewards later than other players, maybe if in another few months if the players who weren't given the rewards were given it because they weren't banned again. I don't know.. I just hope it doesn't stay like this all season.
