It was a good day, they were beating the enemy team by a lot, so he finally had some time to look at all the beautiful stuff around him.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't taking credit, of course. Gangplank (395 RP) was the hero of the day. He caught the whole enemy team in his ult, who didn't pay a lot of attention to it. That is, of course, until they saw that he had 6 Rabadon's deathcaps in his inventory. Cleaning up the dying enemies was an easy job after that. You know what they say: AP GP OP.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, out of the corner of his right eye, he noticed a rustling in the nearby bushes. He stopped walking and turned his head, wondering what could be hiding in there. Maybe it was the enemy jungler, Shyvana (440 RP), ready to pounce in her dragon form?\r\n\r\nWukong slowly grabbed his magical stick (not a euphemism), as the rustling in the bushes increased in speed and intensity.\r\n\r\n[\"SKAAAR!(260 RP)\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkDg2IrtZMA) Yelled a creature, as it jumped out of the bushes and towards Wukong.\r\n\r\nThe monkey looked at it with amusement.\r\n\r\n\"What are you?\" He asked, analysing the animal.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" He replied, \"I'm Skarner!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! He talks!\" exclaimed Wukong with amusement, \"he thinks it's people! So cute. Are you a Pokemon?\"\r\n\r\nSkarner's face went red. He had been released like 2 weeks after Wukong, how come he didn't recognize him?\r\n\r\nBefore he could reply, however, he was surrounded by some bubble and was lifted up in the air.\r\n\r\n\"I know it's not a poke-ball, but it'll do,\" said Nami (487 RP), \"how should we name it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said his name was Skar... Something...\" Wondered Wukong, \"Skarmory I guess?\"\r\n\r\nAs they were walking back to their base with the creature they had just caught, they were spotted by an enemy. They were so distracted that they didn't see how a bright red phoenix attacked them from behind.\r\n\r\n\"Look! Another Pokemon!\" Yelled Wukong with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Asked [Phoenix Quinn (487 RP)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_OuLj_cuzs) while in her Valor form, \"you don't recognize me either?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've never seen this one either,\" said Nami, \"it must be legendary! Maybe this is Moltres!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yeah! Let's catch it!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, wait, what the hell are you doing?\" Quinn's cries for help went unanswered as she got caught inside a bubble as well.\r\n\r\nWukong and Nami now had a Pokemon each. It was time to start their new journey. Who would beat the elite four first? Who would catch them all first? And, most importantly: Who would be the true champion in the end?\r\n\r\nBoth rivals looked at each other, with their new, loyal companion by their sides.\r\n\r\n\"It's on!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Moriuz","date":"2014-04-24T14:43:11.671+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":16,"body":"Guys, I have a question, hopefully you can help me out.\r\n\r\nI want to buy a new laptop.

I would go with the GE60 or 70 if you have the money for it and enjoy gaming.  They all can definitely play league but both of the GE laptops will be able to play games like skyrim battlefield etc.  Don't buy your computer right away put a lot of thought and research  into it so you can be 100% confident in your choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Moriuz","date":"2014-04-24T20:03:49.500+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the info!","replies":[{"poster":"iWalkWithLions","date":"2014-04-25T02:43:52.322+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upvoted just because its Moriuz","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ExiCane","date":"2014-04-24T15:19:31.152+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Need more information.
