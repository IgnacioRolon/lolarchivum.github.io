I am Master Ryze and come share a great discovery that I carried in my observatory. Thanks to a recent improvement made ​​in my telescope, I could identify new constellations - and I think it's a great opportunity to Homenagearmos Champions of our world.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this star chart, we have a training that leads to a growing and blue moon. Any objection to this we name Soraka Celestina ? 487 RP\r\n\r\nRight, what seemed to be a willingness to cross seems, in fact, a large anchor. AstroNautilus is my suggestion for this constellation. 675 RP\r\n\r\nGalactic Renekton is the only name that comes to mind for this one. Not so common so see something that looks so much like a crocodile in heaven, right? 260 RP\r\n\r\nThis large lion's head could be a little inspired name, but the arms of stars that refer to braids leave rengar as favorite time. 487 RP\r\n\r\nIntriguing: sets of star formation of shuriken. I'm sure Kennen love to be immortalized in this way. All agreed? 440 RP\r\n\r\nwo crossed axes such as Olaf ? This seems too perfect to be coincidence. I need to study this more in depth here. 395 RP\r\n\r\nAcademics, I close my talk here. Upon agreement, I will create a motion to ensure that these are the heroes who scientists, children, couples in love and browsers remember to look at the big infinity above us.
