Now we're just losing the release discounts altogether in favor of this new.......wait 4-6 months system. On paper it looks good because legendary skins will go on \"sale\" now and we have to wait a little less for 975 and 750 content.....but the reality of it is that they're holding the quality content, the 1350+ tier stuff, hostage to try and tempt people into spending that extra money to have them first because they know that's the stuff people want. If it were a true 50% sale that'd be one thing but what this is is them effectively eliminating the release discount. (that release \"discount\" for ultimate skins continues to go up and up....)\r\n\r\nI used to be totally supportive of buying full price skins back in 2012....I remember a rioter saying that quality would go up but 975 would stay the standard.... Then it all changed when they hired Hippalus and he started masking markups as deals (remember that atrocity when the 1350 tier was introduced and he tried to make it sound ok because all of these skins nobody buys are getting cheaper?)\r\n\r\nThe way it's looking now I will not be buying another skin at launch once 2016 hits.....I encourage other people to follow suit too but....apparently all it takes to change your minds is a loading screen border.","replies":[{"poster":"Stexe","date":"2015-11-13T06:50:21.040+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait, you're saying Hippalus, the guy who promised a survey for Limited Edition skin owners to express how they felt about them bringing the skins back and who hasn't delivered it for 2 years, lied?!
