She's like a sea goddess with tentacles...I mean come on, missed opportunity! Her tentacles could be pool noodles or exaggerated cartoony blue octopus tentacles, that ball she holds could be a beach ball. Have her dressed in a one piece bathing suit with Hawaiian patterned swim shorts on with a visor hat on. It's kinda butch, but it works for her.
