The air smelled like moist dust and I could hear the remaining water falling from the roofs and onto the streets, the last breathes of the dying rain.\r\n\r\nI saw her taking cover under an old roof. Her skin a light ochre, her hair pulled together into a hybrid of a braid and a pony tail. Such an exotic beauty, I thought as I saw her.\r\n\r\n[Headhunter Nidalee (487 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0euvbqQ_dE) they called her. A name which always caused confusion in me... Shouldn't it be Headhuntress Nidalee? I tried not to delve too much into those details, lest I figure out some bizarre implications.\r\n\r\n[Midnight Ahri (375 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysrTfCeT9eE) approached and greeted her. The infamous fox-lady, I wonder what she said.\r\n\r\nShe was feared and loathed, but Nidalee didn't seem bothered by her presence. No wonder, both of them were half woman and half animal. The difference, though, was that one of them hid it better than the other one.\r\n\r\nNot long after that, Ahri left. My target was alone again.\r\n\r\nI had no personal vendetta against her, but the Noxian High Command's orders were mine to follow, whether I liked them or not.\r\n\r\nI removed those notions of doubt from my head, clearing it completely. My mind became a blank canvas as my mental brush drew Nidalee's name in blood.\r\n\r\nI threw my knives around me as I stealthed. Nidalee noticed, but it would be too late by then. She tried fighting back against an invisible enemy, but I appeared behind her.\r\n\r\nMy hand covered her mouth, softly yet firmly. I whispered one single word into her ear just as my knives flew from the sky and into her stomach. I sliced her throat with my blade, some would say it was overkill, but I just wanted to be sure I had finished by job.\r\n\r\nI wiped away the blood from my weapon as I looked at her lifeless body. I don't know if my last word to her had brought her some comfort in her final moments, but I did know that my job was finally done.\r\n\r\nI walked a block or two, until I finally saw my contact's face hiding in the shadows. I didn't understand why Noxus wanted to deal with this creature, but their wishes weren't mine to dispute.\r\n\r\n[Void Nocturne (260 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqQpANqfOSg) asked me one question.\r\n\r\n\"Is it done, Talon? (440 RP)\"\r\n\r\nI nodded and replied with a question of my own.\r\n\r\n\"What now?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me and whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Darkness.\"\r\n\r\nIt happened so fast, I didn't even notice it. It was like, if in the blink of an eye, I was suddenly laying down on the floor, bleeding profusely, unable to move.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was of anger, that I had let my guard down and I was now dying in the stupidest way possible.\r\n\r\nBut then I realized, maybe this is what I wanted? Maybe I had grown so tired of everything that, subconsciously, I had asked for this?\r\n\r\nMy vision began going blurry. I felt some drops of water kiss my face, a last good bye from this world. Was it starting to rain again? Before the light went out of my eyes forever, I thought I saw a shape flying high above the ground. Anivia (395 RP) flew gracefully, as I realized those hadn't been raindrops, but Anivia's tears as my soul slowly left the human world. But wait... Was that... Lucian (487 RP) riding Anivia?\r\n\r\nMayhaps it was just my imagination playing a trick on me. But my lips formed one last smile as I laughed at the absurdity of it, closing my eyes forever.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsASmurf","date":"2014-05-29T14:19:06.092+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report Talon for feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"nonamewarrior","date":"2014-05-29T14:42:19.779+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:91}} You take my hood, you put me on sale, and now you report me.
