Most AP damage dealers rely on their abilities, which are not fully unlocked until after clearing 3 camps. While auto attacks have a ~1 second \"cooldown\" even at level 1, many abilities at level 1 have a cooldown of at least 5 seconds, making AP very inefficient at clearing the jungle in comparison to AD or tank. Especially at the earlier levels where the jungle hurts the most (relatively speaking), it's a struggle to get the standard camp-buff-buff without backing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many AP champions are carry-oriented. Xerath, Ziggs, etc cannot sustain themselves on the petty gold income of the jungle in comparison to the lane.

She's an assassin - and still potentially a dangerous one with the right build - but her kit makes no sense anymore. \r\n\r\nModern champions almost always get some kind of dash or teleport or burrow - {{champion:28}} is the only assassin in the league who can't engage/disengage from range. That is supposed to balance out her stealth mechanic. \r\n\r\nHer stealth is strong enough in the early game (or if she gets fed) that she requires the enemy team to buy pink wards: which means her real passive isn't so much stealth as it is \"passive enemy team gold drain\". If she falls off though, you can pretty much stop buying pink wards because a squishy {{champion:28}}  with no damage is free gold. \r\n\r\nHer ultimate is mess. It deals % Current HP as magic damage, so you need to hit someone with high HP and little MR.... so it's good for fighting... Vladimir pre-Spirit Visage/Abyssal Scepter? So really it's for the % slow - as a teamfight engage - but it's a weak/short slow until you Rank 3 it. \r\n\r\nShe's also a pretty bad duelist - she can't gank any split-pushers, she loses most jungler 1v1s, and she's easy to counter-jungle (because she's always at half-health, which is the {{champion:266}}  problem without his kit purpose-built for it). \r\n\r\nA good Eve is an early game threat, so you just don't overextend. She can show up to virtually every fight because she's fast and invisible - but that also means she has to face-check a lot of bushes: easy to intercept and bad at duels. She has good late game teamfight engage, but she's like the shittiest assassin at actually assassinating people. \r\n\r\nIf I had my way - I'd give Ravage a health-shield effect, that would help both her jungle clear and her dueling - and maybe reduce or remove the shield she gains from her ultimate. I think they also need to decide whether she's AP or AD and commit to that vision - on-hit physical Ravage is strong enough to AD build around, but it's out of place in an AP toolkit - and hybrid champions are always kind of mediocre.
