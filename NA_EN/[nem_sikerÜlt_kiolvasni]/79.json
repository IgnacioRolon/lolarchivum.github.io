The fact of is that on the northeast side of the map, heading southwest, your forward vision is limited. You can move the screen all you want, but there will always be an inconvenient hole in your screen at the bottom left. This is a distinct disadvantage for ~~purple~~ red side bot lane while they are defending the first turret. the side that a team is selected for should not determine a disadvantage, and this would mitigate any disadvantage based on screen layout. This pertains to Riot's design value of Clarity \"Players should fight their opponents, not the game\".\r\n\r\n\"But that would change the meaning of top and bot\"\r\n     People can figure out that those words relate to blue side and still go to the correct lane. Also, it would be an option you can toggle in your settings.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want my map flipped\"\r\n     It would be an option.\r\n\r\n\"Your bad! Learn to play the game!\" *Giant Squid of Anger*\r\n     It is not about skill. It is about neither side having a disadvantage based on screen layout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR We need a toggle-able option to flip the map layout for ~~purple~~ red side.","replies":[{"poster":"IonDragonX","date":"2014-06-06T04:18:27.963+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'd prefer that the screen on Red Side be turned 90 degrees clockwise instead of 180.

So dragon spawns at 6 minutes but the animation of it climbing on the walls and flying down will begin earlier at like 5:50 so when it touches down at 6 minutes you can attack it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot CaptainLx","date":"2014-06-05T19:06:09.039+0000","up_votes":323,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yes, this is correct. If Blue Buff currently spawns at 1:55 on SR, and if our spawn animation is 2 seconds long, then we will spawn Blue Sentinel at 1:53 min, so that you can attack it at 1:55. It's parity with what is on live.\r\n\r\nWe hope that spawn animations will help better time your initiation while maintaining parity with the gameplay on our current SR. This includes visibility (so, you can't see dragon if you don't have a ward in the dragon pit, even if he's running around on the rim of the pit).\r\n\r\nThere's a white flash that will tell the players when you can attack a creature, too.

The animations are wonderful for them all.  Though i am glad to see the  \"A Twist of Fate\" Barron Nashor.  \r\n\r\nFurther more I Like the fact it is red and blue rather than purple.  The tower visual differences per team are a very good touch.  It will help players know MORE about their surroundings to better help id escape or engage routs.

First of all, we wanted visual cohesion in all our camps - creatures that actually would belong into a magic forest on a mountain top - wraith felt much better in TT, in our opinion. Secondly, we wanted to clearly show how powerful the creature actually is. Putting in a big toad hopefully tells players that this camp has a lot of HP and is slow (doesn't walk far), for instance. And finally, it hopefully just looks nicer than copy+pasting a camp that we felt looks better on TT in the first place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sparkyfish","date":"2014-06-05T19:11:17.050+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":4,"body":"it also makes the jungle creeps look great! i think im gonna be playing jungle a lot more now XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reach4theSkylar","date":"2014-06-05T19:10:07.625+0000","up_votes":113,"down_votes":2,"body":"I addressed this in a lower but figured I'd repost it here for clarification.

They do however react to your presence with increased agitation/attention. Also the animations count backward from the spawn time and play pre-spawn as to not affect spawn timers.
