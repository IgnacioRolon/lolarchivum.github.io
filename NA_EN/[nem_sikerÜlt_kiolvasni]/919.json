No, he's not OP or really all that dominant....out of the laning phase. In the laning phase however he's so oppressive I've decided to ban him in every game cause, point blank, it's just not fun to play against him. Even if he falls off late game, early game he can pretty much 1v2/3 an entire team just by letting his turrets do all the work, and since he's ALWAYS got turrets up he's always going to win trades(I've yet to see him lose a trade even when the jungler ganks while he's in lane doing his thing). I don't know what the cooldown of those things are, but as soon as I'm able to get rid of one, another comes right back up almost instantly. Are they set on charges like Teemo's Shrooms/Zyra's plants? If so, I feel like with their enhancement when you reworked him that it might have been an oversight, cause no matter who I'm playing with against him I can't do anything against him in lane. Even Syndra, soon as I grab a turret, he's got another one up to replace it, making whatever counterplay there is against him(which is getting him away from his turrets) null and void. I want to re-iterate, I'm not saying the champion is OP, or that he's even in a healthy state(If anything I feel like he might be in an unhealthy state at the moment). What I'm saying is his laning phase is the oppressiveness that I feel you've stated you want to avoid, because as far as I can tell and have tried multiple times, there's simply no counterplay against him in lane, and again, key word here: In lane.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work though, enjoying(most) of what you guys put out.","replies":[{"poster":"Jag","date":"2015-10-14T20:59:53.993+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"With you that Heimer's lane play pattern can feel very oppressive.

Karthus has a very small delay and is limited by range and cooldowns (to produce continuous damage vs continuous attacking from turrets).Those other three all lose a potentially lane functional passives to live longer. Heim loses nothing to have post death play. He gets his normal laning passive and his R gives him long range poke, huge stun, or a mega turret that also has mega post death value.
