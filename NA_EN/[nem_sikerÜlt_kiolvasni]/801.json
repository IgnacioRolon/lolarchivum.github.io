I see you often times trying to squeeze in certain details about this week's free champions. While I admire the effort to stay true to the freeweek, your core story basis, giving essentially a greek myth-esque explanation for the mysteries of Riot Games, far surpasses the specific champions you feel obligated to mention. \r\n\r\nLike you said, you are even considering changing the title to better match your purpose. Why not completely jump the gap and write for the purpose of explaining the intricacies of the behind-the-scenes workings of ALL of riot games, not just free champions?\r\n\r\nI feel like such an upgrade would really free you and let you write about whatever you'd like to, and let you write more entertainingly and with more variety, unbound by such a narrow topic.

I may start writing stories in other posts, probably not the sales though, as lightdragoon has those covered.\r\n\r\nPeople might expect Corporate Gnar in my stories, so i'm not sure about doing something else here because people could be disappointed if i write about a different character.\r\n\r\nI would **really** like to hear what all you guys think on these, and what you really think should stay/what should go.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EcoStatic","date":"2015-03-09T18:58:07.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Great Job!!!
