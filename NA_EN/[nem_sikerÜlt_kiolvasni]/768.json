Peanut's gone, not that he was particularly effective last season. Wolf was the jungler for the first two weeks. They didn't pull Effort off support until they lost the first game to MVP in their fifth match. Even with Wolf back at support, apparently he's still mostly playing jungle in solo queue.\r\n\r\nBut \"star and savior\" is so off it sounds like you're poking fun at the struggles he had last season.

If you have watched their mic check, you will see Huni was \"the problem\" of SKT. I am not saying Huni is bad, but he is an aggressive top laner. (Same thing applies to peanut) SKT is a team that focus most of their resources on mid and bot (faker and bang). I rmb one of the mic check in world during the Ban phase, Huni confidently told KKoma he wants to pick GP, and he got focussed and smashed. At the backstage, Kkoma literally told Huni he didn't ask more from him, just stop pushing the lane and die, and he will find him a safe pick. They need a safe top laner, and supportive jungler. It was obvious peanut and Huni did not fit into SKT's play style, and that's why they kind of struggle last year.

The meta is/was unclear at the time.  2. Riot said and set up themselves in their minds the better teams to face each other at the start of the split to create hype, with 2 good teams games will be drawn out some.  \r\n  With the recent nerfs to such factors that resulted in 30% of the game lengths + calculating the mediocre scheduling now that it's week 4- I only see games being at the 33 min average now which is boring to me personally.  Nothing is more ignoring than to come home from work expecting to watch great games and to only watch 1 sided snoozes!   \r\n\r\nA couple of games ago Xmithie passed the 2,000 assist marker and currently stands at 2,051 assists in which I think it's #1 NA/EU current All-Time assist leader for junglers!

It is more because of Faker whos not able to keep up the pressure since he doesnt have that supporting jungler who is always by his side. Bengi was very good at that. Everytime bengi will make a play, it would most likely be mid lane, around Faker. Also, if seen in picks, Faker is usually the one who gives up the pick and ban phase in order to help other lanes, thus sacrificing his own lane control.
