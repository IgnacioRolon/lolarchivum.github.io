I play a ton of ARAM, and I don't want Kayle. Im sure there are plenty of people who appreciate the gift, but do not want the champion. I actively do not enjoy playing her, and play a game mode where I may have to. \n\nLike Gift everyone a chest with the champion shard, skin shard, and dust to craft them. Getting shards for the skin as a gift also makes less work for Riot. I'm sure there will be plenty of people opening support tickets to have it removed from their account. If we gets shards, we just dont have to use them, leaving support to get to more important tickets faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunder Butter","date":"2016-09-12T23:17:39.242+0000","up_votes":641,"down_votes":64,"body":"Wow, you are definitely one of the most entitled people i've seen in some time, congratulations mate.

People who avoid playing her on ARAM should have some option, as nobody else is being forced on anyone. It's only fair, to me.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think it shows a little ingenuity to implement other game systems into your gift, such as giving the champ shard, skin shard, and essences. Even if it were left to only essences, at least that is more customized than a flat gift that will backfire for a select few in the community.\r\n\r\nBack in the days of the free Corki or ranked rewards, this wasn't so much an issue because ARAM wasn't there, and when it was, you had to excel at ranked, so fewer ARAM players were effected. This will be a sweeping effect through all of ARAM, on the other hand, and one that some players build entire accounts around. In fact, the only way around this for those players would be reactivating an inactive account and smurfing. I dislike the idea of incentivizing such activities, even if helpful only to a select few in the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-09-14T04:27:48.258+0000","up_votes":97,"down_votes":23,"body":"Disliking a champion being gifted because of ARAM is the dumbest reason ever.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"What is a Smite","date":"2016-09-12T19:56:03.112+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":457,"body":"what the heck...who gets all the way to lvl 30 without even playing even one real match?","replies":[{"poster":"HomicidalThor","date":"2016-09-12T20:35:53.552+0000","up_votes":381,"down_votes":63,"body":"People who are new and too afraid of ruining other people's games.
