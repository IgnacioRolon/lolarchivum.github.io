Meanwhile, even 2.5% of 4000 HP is only 100. It had some niche cases to allow a few tank junglers to get and activate early Warmog's, but it was still a really low amount of extra health until really late. I'm not sure these changes really fix that problem, either.\r\n\r\nUltimate Hunter was terrible in comparison to Ravenous for damage-dealers, Ingenious for active item-users (e.g. Glacial Augment builds), and Relentless — well, it's a high amount of out-of-combat movement speed, so it's great for roamers, but not easy to really feel the value of unless you compare it very deliberaly. In comparison, 15% internal CDR on your ultimate, when most of the champions going into Domination end up at high CDR values anyways, and people at lower skill levels can rarely coordinate around punishing ults being on cooldown, just doesn't give that much value.","replies":[]},{"poster":"grarrrg","date":"2019-04-03T01:00:55.187+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didn't think Demolish was weak/strong so much as sometimes it was the ONLY choice that your champ could actually USE in that row.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MinccinoLuna","date":"2019-04-02T20:54:21.138+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Demolish and overgrowth, yeah, but ultimate hunter was always super week","replies":[{"poster":"Pimpinabox","date":"2019-04-03T07:08:32.426+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overgrowth was and will still be incredibly garbage.

The gold difference in value there is staggering, adaptive force gives ~504 gold value for an AD user and the overgrowth gave 400 gold value... Now it will give 470 ish. Still under powered unless you've got over 4k hp. Which at that point few champs need 180 more hp.\r\n\r\nI should mention we're comparing 500+ gold of value from some runes available 10-15 minutes sooner than the 400-470 gold value you get from overgrowth around the 30 minute mark.\r\n\r\nIt is a back end loaded rune that adds very little value to any situation for any class.

And I like the buff on cinderhulk, but I don't feel like it'll be on that impact without the same improvements to bami's. Reason being, that tank junglers generally have slower clears, especially on single monsters (like gromp) in the early game. When you have champs that are clearing rapidly at the top of the ranked ladder (Rek'Sai, Karthus, Vi, Udyr) AND have decent gank power to boot, it feels like most tank junglers don't really have a place in the meta (aside from Sej and Nunu, who have pretty good clear speeds because of their abilities having that single target damage).","replies":[{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2019-04-02T21:52:42.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They took out a lot of damage from Wit's End if you factor in the lack of MR shred.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkenwing4","date":"2019-04-03T07:11:23.073+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"less damage early but evens out late and  tons more sustain.
