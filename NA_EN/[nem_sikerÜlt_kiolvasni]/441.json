Better safe than crying that I missed the sale. On another note, I just think it's very confusing that it's called \"early sale\" if it's towards the end of the month. Similar to how armor pen easily is countered by armor unless you get last whisper and I don't consider that as armor pen as the stat specificallyed called armor penetration was usually a flat amount and not a percentage. So it's just funny that it's name is meant to penetrate armor, but you buy armor to counter armor penetration, hence why I think riot changed the name armor pen into lethality.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
