(or are you fine with players having such run in background?)\n\nI think you could get lot more information about players with linking like this (which could be relevant at targeting audiance especially about anything visual like skins, event designs etc.). On the other hand players could get more comfort by enjoying e-sport without the need to login on page.\n\nB) Actually I'm unsure if stream can be viewed in mobile app, but it would be nice if at least at mobiles for now there would be some connection between LoL and Yt app.\n\n\nC) As I see you'll c my region with having my post, can you inform us if having vote for player of game at LEC or whom to watch in POV stream could be done on other platfrom than twitter too? Is it sponsor or Riot related?
