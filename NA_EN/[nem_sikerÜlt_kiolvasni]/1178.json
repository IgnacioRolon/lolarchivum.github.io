To me I read, \"Gift yourself the 150 rp mystery icon and you can get something in the Champion, Champion Skins, Ward Skins, or Summoner Icon section worth 520 or more\". Except summoner icons don't go for more than 250 max so I don't think you can get an icon. So I gifted myself the icon in the hopes of getting a skin or something, but I didn't get the extra gift either. Just bought a mystery icon for 150 and that's it.

I could be wrong, you'd have to get someone else to confirm it. I think they saw the section and how it was confusing and fixed it up, because I had spent like 10 minutes reading it and rereading it over and over to make sure I wasn't crazy and when I read it again recently it wasn't confusing whatsoever to me and I understood it instantly. Called my brother to the room to read it and ask him if I was crazy (he maybe didn't pay attention not sure or he thought I was crazy and just went along) but I was almost certain it said that.
