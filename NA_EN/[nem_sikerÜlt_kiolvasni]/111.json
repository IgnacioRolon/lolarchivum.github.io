After I downloaded the game, I tried opening it and it says, \"Another instance of the launcher is running.  Do you want to terminate it?\" When I click \"okay\" it terminates everything. I dont know what to do. I looked at another board and they suggested two things... 1) Wait about 3-5 minutes for it to launch but it didnt work. 2) Try to open it several times but it still hasnt worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T19:36:08.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, I'd like to help!  It sounds to me like there's something, maybe a setting or program, isn't configured to give the patcher access to launch.  As a first stpe, go over the steps of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that the patcher is allowed to open.  If you also just installed the client, a solid restart of your pc may help as well.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
