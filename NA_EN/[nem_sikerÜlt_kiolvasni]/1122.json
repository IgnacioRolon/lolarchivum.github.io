Sure- it might get old, and is completely unbalanced, but the game-mode's biggest weaknesses are it's greatest strengths. Being able to flash on command, and spam abilities makes you feel empowered. If you think you should put away a fun game mode on the sole purpose of \"it gets old\" then I got something for you; don't play it if you're not in the mood to. The best course of action is to leave the game mode available just like the other game mode services. It's there when you want it, and for people that strictly play the game for Urf too. I know a lot of people play strictly bot games, and that's completely fine with me, and shouldn't be catered to only Summoner's Rift casual, and competitive players.
