They are responsible for Locodoco, one of the worst coaches, and never show up internationally. I think they'll give up game one, fumble in game two, and fail to come back in game three. It is going to be FLY vs C9 and to be completely honest I don't care which one wins. So long as TSM is kept from going to MSI I'm happy, if they do go to MSI prepare for NA to be the next wildcard region.","replies":[{"poster":"Thulious","date":"2017-04-11T20:16:38.282+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Best NA has done internationally is 2nd place this last MSI and 3rd place in the Season 1 \"Worlds\" where TSM placed 3rd.. I don't see C9 on any of that. NA has never really shown up at Worlds and there has only been 2 MSI's. Only difference is TSM has been consistent enough to go to every single worlds. No other team in the Worlds can say that. They just haven't been able to perform to that Standard in Worlds. Now don't give me the crap that at least C9 made it out of groups last year argument. Becuase, TSM and C9 had same record in groups. The difference is that while C9 had to play in same group as SKT (they didn't take a single game from SKT). TSM had RNG and SSG (they took one from SSG but RNG didn't drop one to them. So yay tie breaker.) Grant it if TSM beat RNG for that spot they probably woulda lost to SKT in first round of Knockouts. But, C9 got 3-0'd by SSG.","replies":[{"poster":"Delsoonbye","date":"2017-04-12T22:37:37.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TSM won IEM katowice vs Team WE and got 1st place.

Sure CLG performed well at MSI and took 2nd. But MSI is hardly worlds. Statistically when the number of opposing teams goes from 16 to 8,  or 5 really if you throw out: 1. How terrible EU was, 2.The IWC team, 3. CLG itself its no wonder they did so well.\r\n\r\nThe faithful of old C9 (Lemon,Balls,Hai,Meteos,Sneaky) believe that they can come through again and upset TSM. FlyQuest vs. P1!  Meteos vs. Moon all day!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Enlegacy","date":"2017-04-11T19:18:36.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TSM is the only organization to make it to every world championship.
