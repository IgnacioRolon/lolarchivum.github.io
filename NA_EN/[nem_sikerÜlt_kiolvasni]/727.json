Here me out, similar to blind pick format just for banning. Each player selects a champion to ban and locks it in to finalize said ban. Any champion could be picked-to-ban until it is finalized, to prevent someone from hovering a champion and changing it last second to not get banned.\r\n\r\nExample: A player hovers yasuo during the banning phase. Any other player could select yasuo, until one of those players finalizes yasuo as their ban. Thus blacking-out yasuo for every other player, and forcing anyone who had yasuo selected to pick another ban.)\r\n\r\nOnce the banning phase ends, simply start draft mode or whatever mode applicable.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lohith","date":"2017-01-05T23:25:10.167+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually really like this idea.
