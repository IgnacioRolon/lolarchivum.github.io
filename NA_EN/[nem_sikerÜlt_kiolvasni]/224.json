I think it's a really interesting skin for syndra, \"MASTER OF POWERRRRRRRRR\", to have. It shows a side of her that, in all honesty, I'm pretty sure doesnt actually exist. It's cool to see hyper-gritty, edgy champs get a less than serious skin, and I think syndra's skin fills a beautiful niche that gives you a glimpse of her that you would otherwise never even think about. And while her skin isn't a silly take on a serious champ, it's kind of nice to see something done with a champ that's not just a cop-out polar opposite take, kind of like watching an episode of a show where they give you the heartbreaking backstory of the villain!","replies":[{"poster":"BunnyTheGuy","date":"2015-12-16T12:10:09.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you there. I'm a huge Syndra fan. So any skin for her I will most likely love. But i would like to add something atop your excellent point. I actually think that \"A\" was the best choice. The Snowdown skins are fun, most of them are really upbeat and filled with that \"day off\" feeling. For Syndra however, there is this feeling and look of \"Yea, I'm outside but I'm really cold and people keep throwing snowballs at me.\" I love these skins and I'm really happy that they included Syndra. Not surprised as she throws balls of death literally. But happy none the less.
