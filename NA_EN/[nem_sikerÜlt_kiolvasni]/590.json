Yes I am aware he hasn't been on the rotation in over a year and a half, but he is undergoing some seriously needed changes.  And for all those people who keep asking why {{champion:83}}  isn't back yet, how many of you would ACTUALLY play him?  Honestly, I would maybe once or twice to see if I liked him.  His concept is really cool actually, with those ghouls helping him out and everything.  He just needs tweaking to improve his gameplay in order for him to be the terrifying force he was meant to be (yes I know the \"tweaking\" has been taking forever, but that was the only verb that came to mind).","replies":[{"poster":"Darfaller","date":"2016-03-16T03:41:23.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was carried by a yorick, ti was glorious to watch","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QuasiStickfigure","date":"2016-03-15T19:00:36.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah yes nami aka lemme waste my mana on missed bubbles and wonder why twitch didnt peel for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Top Really Sucks","date":"2016-03-15T18:14:39.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man i wonder when yorick is gonna b free\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2016-03-15T07:34:03.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I plan to play Riven, I feel like I'm going to need help learning to be a toxic piece of shit.
