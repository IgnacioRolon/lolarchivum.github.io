I don't understand Janna's changes.. why in the world would you increase her damage and hinder her shield? People that play that type of champions like the strategy, the disengage, saving the adc when they mess up, enhancing and debuffing, not poking the enemy. Simply put, we like the \"supporting\" aspect of playing a support, but it feels like they want to make every support offensive... I absolutely hate this trend of forcing supports contribute to damaging the enemy. At one point we are just going to have 5 carries attacking each other and whoever has the most damage wins. 0 strategy.

This wasn't some gimmick build abusing just an item here or there. His kit has AP scalings on everything and he was played bot since launch. It seems really unfair to keep it in such a state. He was much like Karma... being able to go both mid and bot but unlike her, the AP style was totally unique in its playstyle.

I would just like to say that, as a character that is not really in a strong spot, the nerfs to his kit aren't really good for the character.  What I am understanding is that these changes are supposed to emphasize on his mobility, but you reduce the range of his q, which actually hinders his mobility.  Also the reduced range on his active soldiers reduces how far he can jump with his e, so his mobility is even less.  While this isn't completely bad cause of his new w attack speed thing, for some reason his early game got a huge nerf (note that his new w attack speed won't be useful early game either), you remove his aoe attacks early on.  This character is a mess as of now, if you want to make him more mobile, decrease the cd on his e, and the new max distance thing is fine.  If you want him to have a balanced early game, he was pretty bad at that to begin with (not to mention the new range nerfs hurting it even more) so give him 100% aoe damage with soldiers at level 1.  Last of all, the ult change was completely unnecessary.","replies":[]}]}
