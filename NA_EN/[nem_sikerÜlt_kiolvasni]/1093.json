One is my fiance. We have very opposite playing styles, with my conservative patience and his ultra-aggressive, risky strats. And for some reason it always works out. We rarely play the same lane, but it's only so that we can keep the team cohesive and cooperative, so that we always know we have at least two out of four lanes in the bag. He can play any role, though I mostly play support. I admire the fact that he's played ranked on every champion that was released before December, and had positive scores on them all.\r\n\r\nMy other partner is fantastic. I met him in the gold-crunch of last season, and  he's an intensely amazing mentor. I've played better since I met him, and understood more about the game. We've exchanged skins, stories of our lives, plans for the future, and the joys and woes of all things internet. I only narrowly missed beta, and I've had thousands of good games and happy moments, but meeting this friend...this wonderful duo partner...might be the highlight of what League has given me.
