Another rune sheet allowed a +6 mana regain (double what I'd normally get at a game's start, which funded mana for my support through level 6). There are multiple other examples how someone can utilize the old runes/mastery system to see dramatic results, especially in the early game.\r\n\r\nThe new system, in my humble opinion, seems to streamline what was once a multi-choice system, into a smaller, simpler, moron-proof system that (again, in my opinion) seems to limit a summoner's creativity. Instead of being able to think outside the box, I can now only select 20 or so pre-designated choices, that will most likely match 20% of my opponents. Champs that were effective are no longer effective (in the way I had played them before). My only choice now is to 1) Not play or 2) change everything, and design my champs the same way everyone else designs theirs. I can no longer be different, creative or think outside the box. I now have to build my champs the way the professionals build theirs, because that seems to be what the new updates seem to cater too.\r\n\r\nIt's like changing a test from \"Open Answers\" questions to a \"Multiple Choice\" questions. Freedom and creativity have been removed to make things simple; which seems to be an ongoing theme. A theme that seemingly caters to the professional realm (earning foreign currency more aptly), rather than catering to the masses. The same thing that happened when developing the 5 positions. (Before you could see 4 people pushing a single lane for the win, but now it has become a standard to have top, mid, jgl, supp and marksman). I'm sure many of us have seen the boards, the youtube videos and the blogs of those who complained and were quickly disregarded and dismissed as people who don't want to change with the times. Dismissed or not, I think their points as a collective held merit.\r\n\r\nI suggest having a poll to see how the public masses enjoy this new change, and see which system is more desirable. However, I doubt a change would be made. I cannot foresee a company throwing away their hard work, unless it threatened their business's existence. If the masses just shrug their shoulders as usual, they will continue to do whatever they'd like.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that my love for the old system is just seen as \" I'm a bigot who doesn't like change and should go commit suicide because your view is different than mine\", or seen as a \" I dare to not suck the dong of RIOT!?\", but it is my opinion, and I am free to make it.

Even Shen got some Attack Speed when his Q is a 3-hit %-max health damage that's spammable whereas Tahm actually needs to hit stuff in order to deal his combo. Tahm's entire core relies on 3-stack empowered abilities. He falls off towards the late game so relying on the CS-rune that gives AS based on CS doesnt work well for Tahm.

I've used them a lot, they're gone now, and a lot of champions have significantly increased base armor.  It seems like the balance is going to be way off, and with the adaptive runes providing a lot of compensatory damage it also seems like it'll be much harder to build for hybrid damage.\r\n\r\nIt feels like the changes to champions' base stats assumed a particular set of old runes for them, whereas for my part I think I often used different runes than what most people did.  Thus, I expect my playstyles to be heavily marginalized.  For example, I think I could get something like 19.6 flat magic penetration for some mages through maxing it on the old runes (with an extra 7% from a mastery).  Now, I get 0.  Sure, the new runes will give some AP, but I just wonder how this is all going to work out, and if I might find some champions to be effectively unplayable in my style any more.  I see a lot of additional flexibility in the new runes; I'm hoping the reduced flexibility from losing the old runes and masteries isn't critical.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malcha","date":"2017-11-06T18:51:37.025+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"No atk speed for Xin?
