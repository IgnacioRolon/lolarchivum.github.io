I've played on the lowest scale and it's noticeably smaller while still making all the lettering and numerals legible.\n\n1) I don't have PBE access so I can't test this, but are champion portraits on the minimap (and jungle camp dots, minions dots, etc), as well as hp bars (not on the minimap) scale-able? Because on the current HUD, if you shrink your screen res (eg: 720p) your minimap champion portraits become HUGE. But if you increase your screen res to 4k resolution, they become tiny like ants. It would be great to finally be able to scale these to the size we want.\n\n2) Do you know when the new patch is going live?
