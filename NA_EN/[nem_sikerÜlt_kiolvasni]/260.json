Love the crowd, seeing the pros, the music, free swag, etc etc. Plus Daniel is just that positive force that kicks up the crowd! I also can't forget the staff, everyone there is friendly and sometimes they have some small talks about the upcoming matches and such. The food is great and your menu is very puny! I'm hoping some day ice cream can be added! Plus imagine adding burgers but calling them Teemo burgers because its spicy, that'll sting them for sure!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThyUnForgivable","date":"2017-03-06T21:13:34.026+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys i just wanted to post this thought.

My question is this. What does riot plan to do about the crowd during the NA LCS. They is a small group being very disruptive to attendees and anti-competitive towards teams when they attempt to and what seems like succeed at giving away enemy team information.

From my experience, most of them are just trying to have a good time and aren't aware how much they're impacting the experience for fans watching at home (or the studio). We can do a better job at curbing disruptive behavior faster and we'll be talking about that this week.\n\nFor the anti-competitive part, we had an issue with \"MOOOOON\" chants earlier this year but confirmed with both teams that it didn't impact their gameplay. We're confident in our audio solutions, have refs on-stage, and listen to team comms - we take competitive integrity seriously. \n\nYou can check out more re:audio solutions via [this piece from Yahoo Esports](https://esports.yahoo.com/how-riot-games-used-sports-technology-to-help-pro-players-communicate-in-tournaments-2-200056343.html).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2017-03-06T22:10:34.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't mind me I was just taking a peak to see if all Riot's attention on LCS(s) was Worth ignoring the actual game.

What I mean is, take Dignitas for example, they are owned by the 76ers who are located in Philadelphia which is closest to me as far as my local pro sports are concerned.  Is it at all in the works or talked about when it comes to making LoL esports a thing on the scale of the MLB or NFL where like, a TSM home game vs. Dig would be in San Francisco, and then next week TSM would fly to Philadelphia to play Dig.  Reason I'm asking is living in PA, I would love to go see the LCS on the weekend live, but would rather not spend the money to fly to the West Coast every weekend, coupled with the fact I've never been to the LCS regardless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Langyy","date":"2017-03-07T04:03:58.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im really interested in the process of how you hire referee's, are the full time riot employees that do other jobs when its not game days or are they just refs?
