She went to her new laptop, which she had recently bought from Orianna (440 RP) to look at the recipe and saw [Ezreal using internet explorer (375 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WlRx6rNgp4&feature=kp) to surf the web.\r\n\r\n\"Ewww, why do you use that web browser? Anyway, what are you searching for?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a new bundle! With all the new world cup skins!\"\r\n\r\nMorgana was surprised. She didn't care much about the world cup but she liked some of those skins.\r\n\r\n\"That's great! What's their discount?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess,\" smiled Ezreal.\r\n\r\n\"Hmmm, 25% off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope\"\r\n\r\n\"50% off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope\"\r\n\r\nMorgana was surprised, maybe the bundle had an amazing, never seen before discount!\r\n\r\n\"80% off?!?\" She asked, yelling.\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" replied the explorer, \"they are at full price!\"\r\n\r\nMorgana was confused. Why would they make a bundle at full price? Bundles are supposed to be for saving when buying everything at the same time, this didn't make any sense at all!\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure it's not a bug (487 RP)?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. If you buy the bundle you get the summoner icon and ward skin!\"\r\n\r\n\"So... The summoner icon that you can just buy with IP and a ward skin that isn't as cool as the Halloween one I already own?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yup!\"\r\n\r\nMorgana felt anger rising through her body. This was just ridiculous. It was time to kick this clown out of her bakery.\r\n\r\n\"URGOT! (395 RP)\" She yelled.\r\n\r\nA huge, disgusting creature came out of the back room.\r\n\r\nEzreal jumped off his chair with a gasp.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell is that?!\" He asked, pointing at it with a shaky finger, \"in all my years I've never seen that thing. Is he related to Yorick?\"\r\n\r\nUrgot roared, and Ezreal didn't get to hear the answer to his question as he sprinted quickly to the streets outside.","replies":[{"poster":"Chefjones","date":"2014-06-19T21:29:14.544+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot almost prom king amumu (260rp)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Moriuz","date":"2014-06-20T03:23:18.271+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the joke XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SuprSaiyanBadnik","date":"2014-06-19T17:46:24.692+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Ace is like \"dayum, I didn't think that'd actually work..\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"BDC Nisemono","date":"2014-06-19T18:15:43.109+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Are you sure it's not a bug (487 RP)?\" \r\n{{item:2044}} what you did {{summoner:2}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garthaw","date":"2014-06-19T21:21:45.903+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait… That summoning really worked?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"x Obsidian x","date":"2014-06-19T19:09:42.204+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"@The Ace \r\nAre you a wizard?","replies":[]},{"poster":"tamorrak","date":"2014-06-19T18:52:42.252+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"always glad to see you take the time to entertain us :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Forerunnerr","date":"2014-06-19T21:16:48.084+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ace, how does one obtain such magical powers, to summon Lord Moriuz with such ease?!?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrSerious1","date":"2014-06-19T14:44:33.504+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":8,"body":"more {{champion:154}} skins{{champion:154}} plz liek infernal or void {{champion:154}}  im begging you{{item:3073}} ","replies":[{"poster":"kãhuna","date":"2014-06-19T15:25:23.855+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":7,"body":"The next two people geting skins are\r\nSoul stealer {{champion:8}} \r\n Hazmat {{champion:74}} \r\nHead hunter {{champion:51}} \r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Vikky","date":"2014-06-19T15:38:16.275+0000","up_votes":75,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realize that's 3 people right?","replies":[{"poster":"BlackM13","date":"2014-06-19T15:51:26.893+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":0,"body":"so 2 truths and a lie which one is it................","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iMiniman","date":"2014-06-19T15:38:46.416+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":9,"body":"Dear Riot, Please make the skin idea i came up with: Frosted Kha'zix.\r\nHe would be snowy white, with icy light blue for particles, claws, etc. Make a new way his q would look (Not just color).
