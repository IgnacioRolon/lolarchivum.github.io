Over everything. It hung, limp, in the sky, taunting him with the glow that never quite shone the way. He cursed it, tears streaming down his face. The moon glowed that night, outlining the figure of a man who had nothing, had lost everything he cared for, ripped from his life as a beast would tear apart its prey. No mercy had been shown to the man this night. He staggered forward, spirits dancing before his eyes like the placid dreams he knew would never come again to ease his aching soul. At least he still had his. He laughed. A cold, dead laugh that chilled him to the core. He did not know his voice anymore. He did not know himself. But it did not matter. All that mattered to him was finding it. Blasting it into oblivion. And freeing her. New energy flooded his veins as he remembered what it had done to her. He ran now, sprinting through the undergrowth, only one, burning desire left within him. End it. Forever. He reached a clearing. The moon hung limp, staring at him in anticipation. The mist flooded over everything. A cry stung the air. A laugh pierced the darkness. A cruel, shrieking cackle, that shook the man to the bone. He had heard about this one. She came, riding on the souls of the damned, the souls of the vindicated. She stopped, her otherworldly glow basking the broken man in a feeble light. She spoke to him in whispers, rasping gusts that tore at him, shrouded him in the woes and hate of countless people from countless centuries. A deal. She would end it if he promised her what had been taken from his beloved. He fell, shocked, to his knees. The river that had streamed down his cheeks once again flowed free and clear. She placed a hand on his head, confident in her offer. But this time was different. She could feel it. He spoke not a word, but lifted his weapon to meet her head. He fired. She screamed in agony as the piercing light burned through her. He turned and wheeled to face her, the blue fire of retribution blazing in his eyes. He shook from the anger and resentment towards this abomination. She screamed and faced him as he raised his weapons once more. She pulled back, shielding herself. The man looked into her dead eyes, and she felt icy terror run through her. What was this? What was he? This demon? He smiled, and raised a beautifully crafted weapon marked with an S. She stumbled backwards, trying to escape as he slowly made his way to her. He placed a hand on her icy flesh and brought his hand down, smiling grimly. She knew nothing but the light. The Purifier rose again, looked up to the sky, and marched onward into the deathly gloom of the Shadow Isles, ceaselessly. Keep movin' on.
