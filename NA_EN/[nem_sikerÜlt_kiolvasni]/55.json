They could not enforce the law until the contract was breached, and took action when it was. At the time, they could not do anything more than fine them or give them some sort of in-league suspension without directly hurting the players as well, which they most likely wanted to avoid at all costs.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Domermac","date":"2018-03-02T13:36:02.362+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for putting this all into writing. A lot of people may not be satisfied with how things turned out but I think it says a lot that you still went ahead and set the story out for the community. This is a great start towards Esports transparency, a particularly interesting juggle since as a video game the community is not entitled to information but as a professional sports scene they are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hotarse","date":"2018-03-02T03:54:20.101+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"You're right that discussion on Renegades is never going to feel great because you HAVE NO EVIDENCE.

It makes perfect sense that they have to withhold evidence in order to protect those who gave statements and testimonies in that case. In fact, it's because of people like you that they have to do so. If half of the community wasn't witch-hunting the moment literally anything happened, it'd be much easier for Riot to deal with things.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDarkestShado","date":"2018-03-02T08:52:00.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, this is just the truth of fanbases.

The viewers/players of the game should by far outweigh the pros.  Transparency is of utmost importance in any en devour and being told \"trust us\" by a company that does not have a history of transparency carries absolutely no weight.  Seems like the issues were just mishandled from the beginning.  Kids playing lawyer and getting themselves in worse trouble for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Raventhor","date":"2018-03-04T19:34:54.233+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They addressed that though. Yes, the game is dependent on the average player, like you or me. However, this is a professional, contractual, career-based issue. If they reveal everything to us, they are specifically causing hardships for anyone involved. Like they said, if a pro player whistleblows and riot reveals it, BAM, that player is never making it on another team, and they will be mutilated for what they say by the community. Just look at the issues Link had after he left CLG. That's when someone does it willingly. That will be the common case if it's done unwillingly across all disputes.\r\n\r\nAnd because of that, then people just will not say anything. And they will suffer. And teammates will suffer. And performance will suffer, the league and team will suffer, the entire environment will suffer. This won't make it such that teams are worried about mistreating their players. No, they would get to say **\"you say anything to riot, and you'll never find yourself on another team again.\"**\r\n\r\nIn this circumstance, thank god Riot won't release their evidence and testimony. If people have to give testimony worried about how much they're going to be outed, or that they have to be careful of EVERY word they say or 'Rob Smith from Tennessee thinks you're an ***hole, OCE player', literally no one will ever be able to stand up for themselves unless there is SPECIFIC, INHERENT proof.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lotharstar","date":"2018-03-04T21:25:24.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good response overall.  It's important to note that literally every professional sports league has these types of arguments that require mediation and that fans will often paint one side or the other entirely at fault.  Work stoppages, fine amounts/suspension lengths, allowing players to compete in competitions not directly run by the organization (think the Olympics), etc. all are hotly debated with blame often being assigned to league coordinators.  Riot deserves a lot of credit for coming out and shouldering some of the blame here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IncrediPhiLL","date":"2018-03-03T20:03:47.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been very hard on RIOT in the past on how it handles it’s competetive community and it’s non-competetive community. After reading this post, I am glad to see that RIOT is making an effort to be as transparent as possible. I agree with the ruling and I agree with the fine. I appreciate the explanation and feel like RIOT has done a great job on explaining their actions for the first time in a long time. \r\n\r\nI also think the primary lesson to learn from this situation is not really RIOT related, but a simple reminder that when you do business with someone, you need to be on the same page and be very specific with what you want.

It would have been better to NOT post anything since you can't give the entirety of information.  TM sounds like a horrid organization that was backed by Riot for their foul treatment of players.  No AC?  Even on an 80 degree day that's going to raise temperatures in the house ( especially with computer equipment and people ) to levels that nobody should have to be in.  The dirty part....meh, kids need to learn to clean up after themselves.  \r\n\r\nHere's the biggest thing to me.  These kids playing this game are ignorant children when it comes to the ways of the world.  If Riot absolutely refuses to make sure they are taken care of then nobody will and they will continue to be abused such as this scenario.  This stinks of Riot trying to wash their hands of wrong doing.  What happened to the player union?  Oh, it's controlled by Riot and therefore does nothing.  That would be THE organization for players to go to that would have THEIR welfare as their top priority.  Riot stifled that by taking it over and then shoving them in a back office to be forgotten.  \r\n\r\nAll in all same ole Riot.  It's no surprise really with the head of Riot games making a jackass of himself numerous times in public ( i.e. Starlordlucian who he called a \"bully\" and accused him of harassment for using Riot's own in client tools ).  This reeks of a cover up for a bad organization by Riot.

If you want to be serious about all of this then you need to start acting like it.  Abase yourself of any misconceptions that could be done.  Be truly transparent ( i.e. The Starr Report, yes i'm showing my age here ) and you will find that those with true grievances will NOT be afraid to come forward and the only ones who don't support full transparency will be those with something to hide.  Until you are willing to do these things then there will NEVER be a true investigation with completely unbiased findings.
