Yes. But the amount they can get boosted by is limited. Elo boosting can result in a much higher amount of boosting and hurts the boosted player's teammates regardless of if they are in a premade or not. Theoretically, each ranked match is balanced in terms of overall skill among each team. Thus one team may be 2 gold 5 and 3 silver 3 while their opponent team may be 4 silver 1 and a silver 2. While the silver 2 might be facing a gold 5 in lane and be theoretically at a disadvantage, the teams overall are balanced. When you play in a premade, this doesn't affect finding opponents whose teamwide skill averages out to be the same as that of your premade team. When elo boosting though, you could have a diamond or a challenger that is factored in as a gold or bronze because the balancing program used by the game doesn't realize it isn't the gold or silver player using their account. Thus the teams are not theoretically balanced the way they would be in a premade and the team with the elo-booster is at a large advantage.\r\nI say \"theoretically\" with all this because anyone who has played a decent number of ranked games knows that some matches are well balanced and others are most definitely not balanced.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't make it completely clear, let me give you a theoretical scenario for each below (top, jungle, mid, bot, sup):\r\npremade scenario\r\nbronze 2 vs silver 4, bronze 1 vs silver 3, silver 4 vs bronze 1, silver 4 vs bronze 2, silver 5 vs bronze 3\r\nboosted scenario\r\ndiamond4 (seen as bronze 2 by matchmaking/balancing program) vs silver 4, bronze 1 vs silver 3, silver 4 vs bronze 1, silver 4 vs bronze 2, platinum 2 (seen as silver 5) vs bronze 3\r\n\r\nThus the silver 4 in toplane is actually at a SERIOUS disadvantage when they should have a decent advantage according to matchmaking/balancing. Similarly, the bronze 3 support is at a HUGE disadvantage when they should only have a MINOR disadvantage. That's how elo boosting differs from premades.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2016-06-30T21:17:21.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"DAE FUCK DYNAMIC BOOST","replies":[]}]}]}
