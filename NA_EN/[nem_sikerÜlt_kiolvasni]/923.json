I do have to agree that there isn't much grey in his ascension. I wish they had described his emotions more. It was literally: Azir frees him and embraces him as a brother - Xerath is to angry to care and kills Azir, stealing his power.......... they could have at least made him hesitate and show his anguish, which was the real reason his ascension was so wrong (you know, because you have to be worthy of ascension, and his guilt and pain threw it off and made it volatile, IDK.)

So if he couldn't beat Xerath in the past with help, when he was at his best, he wouldn't have a chance now that he's on his own.\n\nEDIT: Not to mention, Xerath had JUST ascended when Nasus first fought him: He's had plenty of time since then to get used to his Ascended body, and become more comfortable using the sheer amount of magic he possesses now.
