My friends at school say it might be because I have a bad computer: 8 GB of RAM, i5 intel processor, 60 gb on (C:) drive. It's a Windows 7, but I can't activate it because I don't have the product key or whatever it is so I can't update to Windows 10. Please help I've wanted to play this game really badly, but I keep running into the same problem over and over again. Thanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"EzioDaFirenze","date":"2016-09-05T05:18:51.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem !!
