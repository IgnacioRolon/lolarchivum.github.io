Lamb walked carefully with her bow drawn, while Wolf was floating around sniffing everything he could.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : **Look at this Lamb.** _Careful Wolf, we don't know what dwells in these woods._ **You think there's anything in here that can hurt me?** _There might be._\r\n(Wolf floated back to Lamb and the two navigated the forest.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : **Wait, where we going Lamb?** _To that fortress. I think that's where we'll find Karthus._ **You think he'll be alone in there?** _I sure hope so._\r\n(As they came into a small clearing in the woods, they found Karthus standing and waiting.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : **Look Lamb!** _Our prey comes to us._\r\n{{champion:30}} : Trust me, there's several other places I'd rather be now.\r\n{{champion:203}} : **Are you not going to run?**\r\n{{champion:30}} : No, I am the first line of defense the Shadow Isles has put up to fight you two. (He raised his staff and his book floated up and opened.) Sing my children and punish the spirits of death!\r\n(As he began to chant, souls flew from the book and started to attack Wolf and Lamb. Lamb spun around to avoid some of the souls as Wolf floated high up.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : **Once we kill you Karthus...** _...We'll take these souls to the afterlife..._ **...And make sure to take yours to the realm of suffering!** (Lamb shot an arrow toward Karthus. The arrow struck his book, and more souls began to pour from the puncture.)\r\n{{champion:30}} : Quickly my souls. Punish them!\r\n(Lamb dodged another onslaught of the souls, but she found herself unable to get a clean shot at Karthus. Wolf never had a chance to get to Karthus since he was leading a massive group of souls on a chase after him. All the while, souls continued to pour from the book ready to fight.)\r\n{{champion:203}} : **Lamb, if we can't kill him quickly, we're never going to get to him!** _I'm aware of this Wolf! I can't get a shot on him!_\r\n{{champion:30}} : Now my children, finish them off! (He raised his staff high, and the souls converged above his staff. Before Wolf or Lamb could react, he pointed the staff at them and the full force of the souls rushed at the Kindred. Before they could react, a shining golden light struck the ground at them, and Lamb and Wolf turned golden.)\r\n{{champion:30}} : What the? (Karthus's souls rushed through them and then scattered, leaving Wolf and Lamb unscathed. A gold portal opened near the Kindred as the stasis wore off.)\r\n{{item:3211}} : Take the portal! Get out of there! (Karthus's souls began to rally for another attack, so Lamb and Wolf quickly leapt into the portal. Karthus recalled the souls to his book. The portal lead Lamb and Wolf through the forest quickly until they came to the beach. There they found {{champion:432}}  and a very small {{champion:136}} .\r\n{{champion:203}} : **Who are you two?**\r\n{{champion:432}} : ...\r\n{{champion:136}} : You know who I am. I'm the only thing worshipped more than you two on this little planet.\r\n{{champion:203}} _Aurelion Sol, what brings you here?_\r\n{{champion:136}} : I got bored playing with stardust and needed some inspiration for my next project. Then I saw you two fighting that lich.\r\n{{champion:432}} : ... ...\r\n{{champion:136}} : Yes, and my caretaker Bard here said we should come down and help. So, to help, I offer you this one time deal. I'll call down a little meteorite to strike this island and wipe it off the face of this earth. If you agree quickly I can get one that only has a 30% chance of creating a planet-wide ice age.\r\n{{champion:432}} : !!!\r\n{{champion:203}} : **Sounds fun.** _But we can't destroy the island. We have to collect the souls to take them to the afterlife._\r\n{{champion:136}} : Shame, I was hoping to have some fun.\r\n{{champion:432}} : ... ...\r\n{{champion:136}} : You want to stay Bard?\r\n{{champion:432}} : ... ... :)\r\n{{champion:136}} : Makes sense. He says his flute music may be able to counter Karthus's song.\r\n{{champion:203}} : _Then we'll welcome your help Bard._ **C'mon, let's go get him now!**\r\n{{champion:136}} : I feel like being worshipped some. You kids go have fun, I'm going to go fly around Runeterra a bit. (Grows in size then launches himself with Comet of Legend. Lamb, Wolf, and Bard head back into the woods.)\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"YaJpTpOg4C","date":"2016-06-27T20:09:43.045+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god not SG Lux..
