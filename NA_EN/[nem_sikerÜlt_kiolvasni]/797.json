That being said, her ult is really cool, but seems kinda weird with the rest of her kit she definitely needs a teamfighting ult, but it feels a little lackluster as it doesn't really interact with the rest of her kit. Other supports with a lot of skirmish potential have ults that simultaneously cover a weak spot in the kit and fit in with it. Braum's ult gives him more instant cc and an effective way to stop assassins yet at the same time fits his stand behind theme, karma can gain more aoe shielding/speed/damage, and still feels kitey, bard can freeze as many people as can fit in his circle which also sets him up for his unique q, and more, but with morg being a more backline support, her frontline ult doesn't seem to fit. and it just doesn't seem like she can easily set it up without either her team initiating or flashing. I love morg, but this just feels a little akward (althought to be honest I haven't tried it with protobelt). Her passive also feels a little outdated, doesn't really fit well with her kit.
