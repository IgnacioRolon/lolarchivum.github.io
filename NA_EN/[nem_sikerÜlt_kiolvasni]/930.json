That is how TL has always been though, a roster filled with skill that should be able to beat everyone else in NA. But as they proved in the playoffs, they have no idea how to play the game once the clock hits 20 minutes. Even worse, they aren't able to get enough of an early game advantage to just flat out win. Between the total and complete collapse of GV and the suspension of TiP's star player, C9 actually has a really good shot at worlds with their ability to actually contest and trade objectives. More significantly, C9 has a chance to actually do something at worlds, while TL will get absolutely destroyed by every other team that has qualified as of now.","replies":[{"poster":"SloreDemon","date":"2015-08-29T02:24:19.607+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"They have a good shot at GOING to worlds.

Assuming all semifinalists were stronger, which isn't unreasonable, meaning that SSW, SSB, SHRC and OMG were stronger than C9. I also would say that EDG were stronger, going 3/2 in the quarters against finalists SHRC. TSM won the NA LCS split against C9, so arguably TSM was stronger than C9, however that's stretching somewhat, I'm not gonna watch the VODS just for the argument. Alliance, Whiteshield were both roughly equal to C9, from just their group performance, however if you take their results from the summer season, NJWS was stronger than C9, as was Alliance. NJWS having taken down summer regional champions, KT Arrows in the regional qualifier, who were the strongest team in Korea (their run through the playoffs was insane). However the way Korean teams qualified for worlds, meant they couldn't get there. The upset loss to Kabum by Alliance really was just an upset. \r\n\r\nSo: SSW, SSB, SHRC, OMG and EDG were definitely stronger, that's already 5 teams that are stronger, just at worlds, then you have KT Arrows and NJWS, who in a best of 5 most likely would have been stronger, having more experience from Champions in playing a series of games. Alliance may have been stronger, but they were probably equal.\r\n\r\nSo actually you might be right, claiming that C9 was top 5/6 at worlds is not a huge exaggeration, I personally wouldn't agree, placing both NJWS and KTA above them, but from the results, your argument does hold up (that and KTA weren't at worlds). I personally would have them tied for  8th with Alliance and Fnatic just underneath.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SAFFATLOL","date":"2015-08-29T00:17:19.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know all that, hence why I saud you would expect Tl to win it after having finished 3rd in the playoffs which included beating TiP and them having the most favourable seed.

But if it's just one crazy strat done five times, you're done for. They're also less useful if they're not solid enough to force a ban from the other team.\r\n\r\nAs for C9 chances specifically, I'm not really sure. Hai clearly wasn't that prepared for returning to the LCS initially. If he's got himself back into shape and re-integrated with the team, they may again be a serious force to reckon with.\r\n\r\nOf course there's also the question of Gravity getting back into their mid-season shape, which was just beautiful. I honestly don't understand what happened to them. They were doing everything right and just started to do everything wrong.\r\n\r\nIt's going to be a wild Gauntlet.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-08-29T03:59:45.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that crazy strats can win Bo5s very easily, I just don't think C9 has enough of them. 6-10 games is a whole lot, and after those, they're easy to pick/ban away.

C9 were definitely good enough last split to beat most teams without such craziness. A lot will depend on whether or not Gravity shows up.\r\n\r\nAlso, I didn't think about this until now, but TIP is probably going to be brutal. Rush is going to just abuse Hai in the jungle. I'm really curious if C9's trying to figure out a solution to that.
