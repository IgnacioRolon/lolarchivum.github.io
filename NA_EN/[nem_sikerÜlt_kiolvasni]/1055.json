At least for my experience (that is, the problems I try to solve for my friends), and what I read on the forum, there are more \"random bugs\" on the Windows client. Riot should really fix the foundations of both clients: I love the new one, but it' way buggier compared to the old client.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pixelsage","date":"2019-10-01T18:00:50.320+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.

Try both su and sudo: \"su xattr -cr /Applications/League\\ of\\ Legends.app\" or \"sudo xattr -cr /Applications/League\\ of\\ Legends.app\".
