Me and my group of 6 friends were under the assumption that if we played in a group of 5, that 1/100 or so games all the IP earned that game would be multiplied by x16. Which is a huge bounty, I mean 100 IP multiplied by x16 is enough to grab a new champ or a few runes! Sounds like a **REAL **Jackpot! Even if it was rare! We were freaking out playing at least 10 games a day for the past week or so never seeing this jackpot. That is until I just realized that after each game we would get about 1-4 bonus IP just for playing in a group, then just now my last game, that bonus jumped to 38 IP! and I realized that that \"x16 Jackpot\" only applied to that miniscule amount of IP you get for playing with friends. Whippdy do! I can possibly maybe get an extra 20-40 IP every 30 games... YAY! =.= we felt **VERY **let down and straight up like we were **lied** to. The system is great I guess, its some extra IP, but don't go flashing around your so called \"x6\" \"x8\" and \"x16\" bonus jackpots like they are some huge , well **JACKPOT** when in all respects they are just a fraction of the amount of IP you actually got FROM the game itself put on top, I got 120 IP last game, that means I got like 30% more IP with a so called \"x16 Jackpot\" That doesn't make any sense! Just please clarify what these events are and how they work next time? So we don't have as much confusion and anger over events such as these that advertise one thing and give another.

Thanks for trying out cool stuff like this that encourages people to do things that they should all be doing to maximize their enjoyment of this game anyways!\r\n\r\nWhile party rewards are super cool, it feels like the lower end of rewards is a little too consistent (e.g., 0-2 when playing in a 2 person group or 0-5ish when playing in a larger group). I know you have to carefully budget the IP you give out, but maybe the medium rewards could be a little more consistent and have smaller (or less frequent) large jackpots. Sometimes you only have time for one or two games and when they both turn up with 0-2 group bonus IP, it's kind of a let down. Seems like a lot of people here might agree.  Just my initial thoughts!\r\n\r\nThanks again!
