Fiora isn't as strong without items while Pantheon is strong without them and does well on early game budget stats (like early Long Sword spam or Serrated Dirk).\r\n\r\nWhy play if you'll consistently play a matchup where you have a 40% winrate (based mostly on your team's ability to carry you because you basically won't even be playing League of Legends in those games)?

It's a 5v5 and all your team needs is one hard CC to land on WW and his oh so OP R gets completely countered. Warwick only has single target damage. his kit is terrible for ARAM except the AOE atk speed when you have multiple ADCs.\n\nAre you saying that Sona and Ziggs have such high winrates because their play rate is really high? It would have to be the contrary. High winrate means that many people own the champ and don't reroll it. Warwick often gets rerolled when people don't like to play him. So a part of the players who don't feel comfortable on WW will not be playing him. \n\nYou're using Sona and Ziggs kits that are OP as an argument that they aren't actually OP outside of that? Again, ARAM is a 5v5 gamemode where poke, heals, shields and auras are OP.

If you don't like it, then you should either put up with it, or don't play it. It's pretty simple; it's not that black and white either. Learn to enjoy Summoners Rift and play Aram on occasion. That's what I used to do. People use it as a warmup alternative to just fool around. Until they add an Aram ranked which I doubt they'll do, you should get used to Aram being a casual game mode. I never see Twisted Treeline players complaining about this stuff. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places...\n2. You want an out of meta champion in norms/ranked to be nerfed because of a fun alternative game mode. It's just not going to happen and the reason you're getting downvoted is not because an unpopular opinion but because of the fact that you're just wrong and being selfish about the whole issue. You could say \"well just nerf ww for Aram then\" but then it's that whole thing of \"okay we did it for warwick now we have to do it for ______ (insert any champion here)\" and then it spirals into \"oh we have to do balance changes for Twisted Treeline players because we did it for Aram players\" and for a company that already is bad at balancing {{item:3094}} {{item:3070}} it's just not ethical for them to start changing Aram. \n3. Teamfighting in Aram is near the same as SR. Not entirely, but just about.  I've never had a problem with the Warwicks I played with when I used to play Aram and he hasn't changed at all since then so I don't really know what the problem is lol. Again maybe your teams are just bad?

My complaint is about Warwick getting strong with either AP, AD or tank items. See if you build AP on an AD champion it doesn't work or viceversa, if you are playing a tanker and build AP/AD you lose your tankiness and become incredibly squishy but that's not the case with Warwick, it doesn't mean he is OP or broken, it means he is outdated and math doesn't make sense anymore when it comes to his stats, or maybe that's how he is supposed to be? In that case RIP me.\n\nI'm not going to move to Summoner's Rift just becasue of that, i love ARAM, i really do, don't get me wrong i play a lot of normals too but  personally i think ARAM is funnier and that's the reason why we play games right? To have fun. Thanks for the advice tho.\n\nRegarding people disliking my post i don't really care, it is not like i'm going to be sad just becasue some people have a different opinion about it, one guy even said something like you are a bronze noob and your opinion is invalid, likes/dislikes it doesn't matter, i came here to leave my humble opinion because as a player i have the right to do it, that's how i see it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Joseph Gladstone","date":"2016-09-07T18:56:50.964+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Celenvala","date":"2016-09-07T19:24:51.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":52,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Kritty","date":"2016-09-07T19:59:20.727+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how they stated he isn't going to be active for Worlds, so him being untested doesn't matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Navarune","date":"2016-09-07T19:50:56.201+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yorick’s disabled for Worlds on account of being fresh-off-the-press.
