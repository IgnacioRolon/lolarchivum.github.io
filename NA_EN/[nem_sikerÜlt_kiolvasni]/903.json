I don't know your background in coding, but if you created an object for every active E on the map, it wouldn't be too hard to track things within it, such as which Champions had already interacted with the E and how many times. And the best way to keep track of a currently occurring displacement (as a guess) is to set a flag when the Champion is being displaced or dashing (which they probably also use to make sure you can't input any other movement while doing this). So they just check that while the Champion is in the minefield and if the flag is set it triggers the mines. It would be the same check happening when you're in Poppy's Steadfast Presence. Since it's all been done before it shouldn't be too hard to tweak.\r\n\r\nThis is all a guess though, just how I would have tried writing it as a first attempt and they probably have a more efficient way of doing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-05-12T07:38:12.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I did consider that method, but for the ult, they probably just used the same kind of thing for if a player uses a blink ability.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-05-11T18:47:02.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for fun, I'm going to guess that her E was the hardest to do.

When you thought of a Shuriman champion, what made you think \"stone mage?\" Unless you guys just want to cover all the elements, then that's understandable.\r\n\r\n2. How has Taliyah lasted so long in a world full of void creature invasions, sea krakens, and basically hellish weather? Do her powers give her innate durability, or is she just lucky?\r\n\r\n3. How would Taliyah react to seeing Malphite? Would she be able to tear off chunks of him and the like, or is Malphite covered in a rock-like material that doesn't inhibit the properties Taliyah requires to use her powers?\r\n\r\n4. What's with Shurima and walls these days? Seems like some hidden Trump card, if you ask me.\r\n\r\n5. Less of a question about Taliyah herself, more about Shurima's Xer'Sai infestation. Has Azir started cleaning that up, or is he focused on other things? And would Xerath take care of them around his own empire?\r\n\r\n6. Last question, I swear.
