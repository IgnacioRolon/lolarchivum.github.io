This seems like Masteries Remastered.... Again. \r\n\r\nThe thing that always made runes very different than masteries was that you could double down on a single strength or weakness at the cost of overall efficiency with your runes that were out of spec or you could balance your runes to get max power out of each of the three types.  You also had the flexibility to spec your power early or late game with flat or scaling runes.\r\n\r\nMasteries represented you specking into specific powers to fulfill your role, but you options were always very boxed in by the trees.  Runes were a sandbox where you could build whatever you wanted.  Albeit for most champs it didn't feel like much there was much sand, but it was YOUR sand.\r\n\r\nI am all for rebuilding the rune and mastery system if it yields better play patterns over all. However, I don't like how this just feels like fewer options to customize since we are going to be locked into one or two \"schools\" like we are with current masteries, while loosing out on the element of flexibility that runes represented.  I just want to keep some of the sand in the sandbox.  Or at least have so many choices that I feel like there is sand in there.\r\n\r\nAn idea to toss out there is that rather than there being only 3 schools of new runes, make four schools.  Three that you already named, and a fourth neutral school whose runes could speck into any school.  These would be versatile runes that any champ could pick from at any time, and would probably represent slightly less power than specialized runes in specific schools, but would mean that a champ would not be boxed into a smaller set of choices if none of the predetermined choices felt great.  This also would potentially allow for some of the doubling down that the current runes system allows.  I think that Panic! is a great example of what should be a neutral rune if its numbers were trimmed just a bit, as it could be slotted into nearly any build and be useful.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents, but Thanks for the hard work making a great game better.\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"DriedKiwi","date":"2017-06-02T18:01:05.094+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The thing that always made runes very different than masteries was that you could double down on a single strength or weakness at the cost of overall efficiency with your runes that were out of spec or you could balance your runes to get max power out of each of the three types.

It&#039;s nice to see that Riot actually is going in the direction that I, and many other players, were hoping for with the new rune system.\n>  \n>  However, as an avid league player who thoroughly enjoys customizing the way I play each champion individually -- and often times making multiple niche rune pages for one champion -- I have many, many questions, concerns, and suggestions.\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n***\n***\n&nbsp;\n\n#Runes Reforged --- SUGGESTIONS\n\n>  **1. The New Rune Page Thematic and Look**\nI know it&#039;s a WiP, but from taking a look at the [new rune page screen](https://youtu.be/bY67yCaGdno?t=1m40s), it really seems underwhelming and lacking any visual impact. I would like to see something similar to our [current rune page &quot;wheel&quot;](http://i.imgur.com/RFHPxYX.png), with the Keystone rune in the center of the wheel and the primary/secondary runes spread around it. You could even go fancy and make it look sort of three-dimensional and whatnot.\n>  \n\n***\n\n>  **2. Rune Naming Schema**\nI think you should move away from mythology based naming schemes altogether -- things like &quot;runes&quot;, &quot;marks&quot;, &quot;glyphs&quot; etc feel ancient (no pun intended) and really do not reflect the modernization of the new client and League overall. Not to mention it feels very ... unfocused, and can be confusing to new players as to what a &quot;rune&quot; is, et al\n>  \n I suggest a new naming schema: **Tokens** (Runes) -- **Force** (Marks), **Fortify** (Seals), **Augment** (Glyphs), **Enhance** (Quints).  Even if some or none of the original types of runes make it through the dev stage (i.e. quints becoming the &quot;keystone&quot;), you can still rename the new rune lines and what have you, for better clarity on what they accomplish.\n>  \n\n***\n\n>  **3. New Rune Keystones and Rune Variations/Types**\nIt&#039;s hard to tell what is going to be done with the existing rune types and how they translate over to the new system; it&#039;s clear though that there seems to be much less emphasis on &quot;number stat adjustments&quot; and more on &quot;big bold individual rune modifiers&quot;. As someone who really enjoys tweaking rune pages precisely, I hope you will find a way to bring that same level of minute tweaking with the new system, while adding even more variations on rune abilities.\n>  \nSomething I was in the process of writing up on my draft post for a new rune system, was the importance of **increasing rune variety** while also narrowing the power focus each type of rune has. For example, currently we have 9x runes of marks, glyphs and seals and 3x quints; although this seems gives a certain amount of expression in a full rune page, there actually isn&#039;t much in the way of variety given how the system is currently setup with min/max runes, and a lot of wasteful rune (gold/s, flat mana, exp, etc) -- not to mention the slew of just straight up _inefficient_ runes like Scaling AD marks/seals.\n>  \nIt would behoove the rune development team to completely remove these extraneous, practically useless runes, and replace them with more varietal runes; I understand the new **Rune Keystone** acts as a focal point (and I assume replaces &quot;quints&quot; in a way), but you should still include more variety of basic rune types, while keeping their power delineated into individual runes instead of the 9x set we have now.\n>  \n>  **_Example List of New Runes By Type:_**\n>  \n* ~~Marks (9 Slots)~~ **Force Tokens (3 Slots)**\n * 3x **Attack Speed** (~~+1.7%~~ *5.1% AS*)\n * **Scaling AS -- New!** (*14%/lvl18*)\n * 3x **Flat AD** (~~+0.95~~ *2.84 AD*)\n * 3x **Scaling AD -- Upgraded!** (~~2.43 AD/level18~~ *14.58 AD/level18*)\n * 3x **Flat AP -- Changed!** (Converted *+3.6 AP*)\n * 3x **Scaling AP -- Changed!** (Converted *+9.18AP/level18*)\n * **~~Magic Resist~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Scaling MR~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Flat Health~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Scaling Health~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Armor~~** (*Removed*)\n * 3x **Precision** (~~+1.13 Leth / +0.62 M.Pen~~ *+3.4 Leth / +1.86 M.Pen*)\n * 3x **Lethality** (~~+1.60 Lethality~~ *+4.8 Lethality*)\n * 3x **Magic Pen** (~~+0.87 M.Pen~~ *2.6 M.Pen*)\n * 3x **Crit Chance** (~~+0.93%~~ *2.8% Chance*)\n * 3x **Crit Damage** (~~+2.23%~~ *6.69% Damage*)\n * **~~CDR~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Mana~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Mana/level~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Mana Regen~~** (*Removed*)\n>  \n>  \n* ~~Seals (9 Slots)~~ **Fortify Tokens (3 Slots)**\n * 3x **Flat Health** (~~+8HP~~ *+24HP*)\n * 3x **Scaling Health** (~~+24HP/lvl18~~ *+72HP/lvl18*)\n * 3x **Percent Health** (~~+0.5%HP~~ *+1.5%HP*)\n * 3x **Health Regen/5sec** (~~+0.56/5s~~ *+1.68HP/5s*)\n * 3x **Scaling Health Regen/5sec** (~~+1.98/5s~~ *+5.94HP/5s*)\n * 3x **Flat Armor** (~~+1AR~~ *+3AR*)\n * 3x **Scaling Armor** (~~+3AR/lvl18~~ *+9AR/lvl18*)\n * **~~Attack Speed~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Flat AD~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Scaling AD~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Flat AP~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Scaling AP~~** (*Removed*)\n * 3x **Magic Resist -- Changed!** (*+4.02MR*)\n * 3x **Scaling MR -- Changed!** (*+9MR/level18*)\n * **~~Crit Chance~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Crit Damage~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~CDR~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Mana~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Mana/level~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Mana Regen~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Scaling Mana Regen~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Energy Regen~~** (*MOVED*)\n * **~~Scaling Energy Regen~~** (*MOVED*)\n * **~~Gold / 10sec~~** (*Removed*)\n>  \n>  \n* ~~Glyphs (9 Slots)~~ **Augment Tokens (3 Slots)**\n * **~~Attack Speed~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Flat AD~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Scaling AD~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Flat AP~~** (*Moved*)\n * **~~Scaling AP~~** (*Moved*)\n * **~~Magic Resist~~** (*Moved*)\n * **~~Scaling MR~~** (*Moved*)\n * **~~Flat Health~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Scaling Health~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Health Regen/5sec~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Armor~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Magic Pen~~* (*Removed*)\n * **~~Crit Chance~~** (*Removed*)\n * **~~Crit Damage~~** (*Removed*)\n * 3x **Flat CDR** (~~-0.83%CD~~ *-2.5%CD*)\n * 3x **Scaling CDR** (~~-1.67%CD/level18~~ *-5.01%CD/level18*)\n * 3x **Mana -- Upgraded!** (~~11.25 Mana~~ *+101 Mana*)\n * 3x **Scaling Mana -- Upgraded!** (~~+25.56 Mana/level18~~ *+213 Mana/level18*)\n * 3x **Mana Regen -- Upgraded!** (~~+0.33 Mana Regen/5s~~ *+3 Mana Regen/5sec*)\n * 3x **Scaling Mana Regen -- Upgraded!** (~~+1.2 Mana Regen/5s level18~~ *+4 Mana Regen/5s level18*)\n * 3x **Energy -- Upgraded!** (~~+2.2 Energy~~ *+40 Energy*)\n * 3x **Scaling Energy** (~~+2.89 Energy/level18~~ *+80 Energy/level18*)\n * 3x **Energy Regen -- Ugraded!** (~~+0.63 Energy Regen/5sec~~ *+2.1 Energy Regen/5sec*)\n * 3x **Scaling Energy Regen --  Upgraded!** (*~~+1.15 Energy Regen/5sec level18~~ *+4.2 Energy Regen/5sec level18**)\n>  \n>  \n* ~~Quints (3 Slots)~~ **Enhance Tokens (2 Slots)**\n * 2x **Life Steal** (*+3% LS*)\n * 2x **Spell Vamp** (*+4.2% SV*)\n * 2x **Move Speed** (*+3% MS*)\n * 2x **Immolate -- New!** (*DoT Burn Effect/5sec*)\n * 2x **Shred -

Rather than individual choices about each and every rune that we want, we're instead making a choice to go with one of four paths, and then making a choice for one of three runes in each tier on that path. When you limit options, you're increasing the odds that there is a \"correct\" choice for each champion along each path, and increasing the odds that there is a \"correct\" path for each champion to take.\r\n\r\nThis can be especially frustrating if a specific keystone has excellent synergy with a champion - you're now stuck on the path of that keystone, and your minor and major runes may be less exciting or fitting to your playstyle than those available in other paths.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of weird to think, but a Call of Duty-style \"Pick 10\" system might actually work better here.
