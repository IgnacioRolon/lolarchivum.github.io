I came across your comment today and it was one of the most genuine I've had in a long time. I've been struggling with my depression which turns into defensive anger It's hard to explain. I'm kind of like wolverine if you go watch the Logan movie. Very hard to express myself since I've faced a lot of challenges in life and I don't have a support group or close friends that I can talk too because I've distanced myself from them as well in an effort to not pick up some of their traits which are bad for me and I don't like to totally express my views especially if they hurt people. I'm just taking my life one day at a time. Thanks for being a cool person and sorry if I ever come off as a tough ass in game. I like to win more than having fun sometimes.

Like Halloween. Being serious, playing ranked, wanting to win: it's all good. But sometimes, as Gabriel Iglesias says: \"Have a little fun.\". \r\n\r\nYou know, how many of us are 'adults'? (+21). We play the game. We work. We go to school. We take life so serious.\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with looking through the eyes of a 5yo child for while, and enjoying life? Playing 'dress up'. Playing 'princess'? My daughter does it. Nothing wrong with it at all. We could all benefit from a little bit of fun.\r\n\r\nKudos to the Cosplayers, for helping me to remember what it's like to be a kid again.
