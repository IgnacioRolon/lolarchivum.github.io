So sometimes you might have to file a support ticket. If it says it can't find files, that means it's not referencing correctly or the files were not installed for some reason. (\"referencing\" meaning it can't find where you put the files on your computer when you start the program. An uninstall and reinstall usually fixes this. If not all files are being installed, same fix, but if that doesn't work, there's probably a more technical issue that might need a support ticket.) \n\nRelaunching gives a \"Close previous instance to relaunch\" and that's when the first instance displays the Dark Blue window of the client. It freezes and stops loading in-general after a point. No activity via the control panel, just that it's open.\n\nSpecifically opening the client opens the same launcher as last version. (Dunno if that's a different launcher now.) Post-clicking the Orange \"LAUNCH\" button gives the above results.\n\nOkay, after reviewing stuff written on the boards, it might be something to do with the Launcher not being replaced when upgrading. Which is to say the Desktop icon should be replaced and that the Launcher doesn't exist anymore.\n\nSo opening the client via the old Launcher is potentially causing the issue.\n\nSo try:\nThis PC> Windows (C:) > Riot Games > League of Legends\n(This is my pathing, your computer might use a different main drive depending on where you installed it.)\n\nLook for the **Circle** icon for League in that folder and create a Shortcut.\n(Create a shortcut via right-clicking on the icon and \"Create shortcut\", drag and drop shortcut where you want it to go, desktop or start-bar or etc...)\nOpen via the Circle icon.\n\nOtherwise: Reinstall can fix the issue according to some boards posts. :|\n\nLooks like it opened correctly via the new Launch icon.\n\nBUG being: Client not replacing old launcher icon upon installation.","replies":[{"poster":"ZombieThrasher","date":"2016-11-16T16:28:45.043+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"it worked for me doing it your way! :D\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Raithwell","date":"2016-11-16T11:51:56.915+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The window size is a little too large for my laptop screen, is there any way to adjust it?
