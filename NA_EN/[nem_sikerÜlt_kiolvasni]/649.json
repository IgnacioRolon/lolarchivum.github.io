Yes, this makes it harder for players to get offers from other teams while they're contracted by one specific team, but it is still possible for a player to \"explore\" options. Scarra could have asked HotShotGG or someone else on CLG whether they were looking for a coach if he really wanted to switch teams. As long as no one on CLG approached Scarra and explicitly offered him a job or asked him to end his contract with Dignitas, it wouldn't have broken any rules, but CLG *did* and they are being punished for it. Rules are rules.\r\n\r\nAmazing probably should have done more research before leaving TSM, if that was really his reasoning. He's completely free to ask other teams whether they expect to have open positions at the end of the season, unless that is specifically forbidden by his contract with TSM--which has little to do with Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Cookies Morgana","date":"2014-12-11T16:30:31.671+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just it, though, Scarra did approach Hotshot.\r\n\r\nHotshot just lied about it because he was scared of the consequences and denied any interaction between them. Now, I'm not saying Scarra walked straight up to Hotshot and told him that he wanted to coach for his team like a female in a dating sim, but what I am saying is that 10,000 is way too steep of a fine for CLG right now, and regardless of how badly George handled the situation, which, yes, he did. This isn't helping the eSports scene, and it's certainly not helping League of Legends. \r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, CLG has one of the most hardcore of hardcore-diehard communities out there. I guarantee you that they're going to come out positive through additional donations, and this is especially true if the story ends at Hotshot and Scarra's statements, because I'm going to be honest, it doesn't reflect good on Riot at all.\r\n\r\nSource for my blabbering crazy-talk:\r\nhttp://clgaming.net/news/626-official-statement-re-competitive-ruling-december-10-2014","replies":[{"poster":"xSaucekay","date":"2014-12-16T01:06:04.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fully disagree.
