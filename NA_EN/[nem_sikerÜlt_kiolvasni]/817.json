Similar is Nocturne, where you use the ult and move immediately after using it to your target, so there's no real time that you can issue the ping for it to be useful. However one thing I do believe should be implemented is \"on my way\" pings for {{summoner:12}} , so we know who's tp'ing in if two people have tele, and in the case they both go for that ward in the second bush in bot lane, both pings show up and gives us no reason to not go in.","replies":[{"poster":"Lannindar","date":"2015-02-11T03:19:32.000+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"But having Nocturne do a \"targeting\" ping would be helpful.

Is that removing his silence did not fix the problems to Kassadin, like massive amounts of feedback said wouldn't fix it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't understand the logic behind, 'Right now, our best method of 'gating' this guy (that is, trying to keep him from facerolling over the game) is by intentionally keeping his lane weak in the hopes of staving off what can feel like an inevitable riftwalking nightmare.\"\r\n\r\nThe *BEST* way? I have a better way of preventing him from steamrolling people late game, nerf his scalings. If he can't do faceroll damage, he can't faceroll. Why do you expect that nerfing his early game is going to fix his lategame? You've increased gold generation so much that late game comes immensely early anymore. There are many other issues with Kassadin that get ignored. For example, the synergy of his W with sheen and Lich bane make all of these base damage nerfs irrelevant.\r\n\r\nEven before the rework, the only thing that really needed to happen to Kassadin was reducing his scalings.\r\n\r\nInstead, you gutted half of his identity, and made him boring to play early game, removed build diversity, and didn't solve the initial problem that caused the rework, that is, the inability to react to Kassadin, because you nerfed the early game damage, on his range, and compacted his old dps-style W into an extra burst ability.\r\n\r\n{{champion:38}} Was created as a melee disabler, changed into an AP assassin by the community because of his high scalings, and you refuse to touch those scalings, you keep beating around the bush, ruining build diversity, and removing parts of his identity, (\"SILENCE!\" \"I tried to silence my mother once.\") instead of nerfing his damage.\r\n\r\nAlso, why bother removing the attack speed on his passive?","replies":[{"poster":"Byrden","date":"2015-02-11T02:59:26.671+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"Agreed.
