I have a Mac and after I downloaded the game, I tried opening it and it says, \"Another instance of the launcher is running. Do you want to terminate it?\" When I click \"okay\" it terminates everything. I dont know what to do. I looked at another board and they suggested two things... 1) Wait about 3-5 minutes for it to launch but it didnt work. 2) Try to open it several times but it still hasnt worked. I think something is wrong with the launcher. In some cases it tries to load the game and after the bar hits the end like it is ready to launch, it crashes and everything disappears.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T00:23:39.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The message you are receiving may be misleading, as there may have actually been another issue that's caused the client to crash and is just causing it to linger around without closing.  The very first thing I'd recommend in this case is to restart your PC.  If the issue comes up again, I'm betting that a more proper error notification will appear.  Let me know what you find!","replies":[]}]}
