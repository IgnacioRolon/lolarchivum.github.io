In the original Lore, the Summoners of the Institute of War were a collective to end the possible second coming of the Rune Wars. This was during the time Demacia and Noxus were at each others throats and Noxus decimated Ionia. From what I remember the Institute was meant to gather warriors from Runeterra and beyond in order to create another means of settling disputes that would not end in full scale war. Its how they ended the Noxus' control over Ionia ( {{item:3158}} ). \r\n   When they got rid of the Summoners and the Institute, they pretty much got rid of these champions reason for fighting in these battles in Summoners Rift. Which creates plot holes the size of manhole covers as to why Lucian would ever dare work side by side with Thresh (or any undead for that matter). With the Summoners they had the plot device that Summoners would have some manner of control of them during combat, as was shown in the first cinematic.\r\n   So it pretty much boils down to why? Why are allies working with bitter enemies one match, and allies fighting each other to the bitter end in another. Why would eldritch creatures like Kindred or Bard concern themselves with Summoners Rift or mortals at all? Without the Summoners or any replacement that would explain why they are fighting over the same land countless times, it just leaves one big massive plothole.","replies":[{"poster":"Crysi102","date":"2015-11-02T22:29:30.463+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":6,"body":"The way I see it since the Summoners and Institute were taken out of the Canon world may seem a bit silly, but it might help with mentioned plothole. Keep in mind, this is just a head-canon of mine that I felt like sharing since someone was talking about the Summoners and the lore change...\r\n\r\nWe, as players, are sort of like other worldly watchers (maybe the watchers from Lissandra lore? Though I think those watchers are canonically Voidlings of some sort...) and we are playing the game with copies of these legendary warriors that Riot is telling us about in the lore. The way I see it, we could be remnants of the Institute, or even god-like spirits who fight for power (or influence (points)) using clones of unsuspecting fighters that we enjoy. This allows for Summoner's Rift to remain a battlefield for us (potentially being a mountaintop religious location in Runeterra, someplace that normal mortals don't go), as well as allowing the Champions to develop as characters. This also could explain the existence of lore based characters like Kindred or Bard... The characters living in the world might not know if they truly exist, but We, as otherworldly spirits overseeing the whole world from the outside, would be able to see these creatures and use them in our battles for power, influence, amusement... whatever you want to think we're doing fighting with clones of various fighters.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR: Summoners are just spirits fighting with clones of fighters they choose from Valoran, allowing for Players (Summoners) to fight on the Rift while also having the story happen undisturbed.**\r\n\r\nI know it's kinda silly, but it's the best way I've come to terms with the lore change. (I really enjoyed the old lore with the Institute and whatnot... I was really sad when I found out it was gone...) I've been meaning to ask someone what they think of that idea for a while... sorry for kinda barging into the tiny conversation you guys were having.

It is still stated in Kayle's  lore that she offered to serve in the league for 1,000 years for power and the same for Morgana. There are several other examples of champions joining the League which makes it improbable that they are \"clones\" whether it states why a certain champion decided to join the League Of Legends or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Crysi102","date":"2015-11-04T22:50:34.216+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ezreal's in-client lore has actually changed... but, even if we go off of old/original lore for him, the amulet he found may cause him to be in one of the fights (as you said) randomly. This means that any given Summoner-spirit could be using the ACTUAL Ezreal completely on accident. The fact that he found and began using the amulet is what made him a Champion... imagine him showing up one day without warning in Champion Select... and his continued use of it is what keeps him a Champion that Summoners can use. No issue that I see here.\n\nAs for Kayle and Morgana, who says they're even says they're from Runeterra? It says in Kayle's in-client lore \"In a world far away...\" This says to me that she's not from Valoran or Runeterra at all. Moragana and Kayle are clearly not human. Morgana's lore states the same type of thing. This other race of theirs' could be a race that can communicate with the Summoner-spirits directly. We can say this is true because Morgana cut a deal with the League--which, in our case, is the overarching term for all Summoner-spirits at once--for power. Kayle and Morg are serving as Champions, allowing themselves to be used in these Summoners' games in return for POWER. The Summoner-spirits are giving them POWER. The reason they haven't returned to their fighting (as of yet) is because they're still receiving their power, still mastering it, from the Summoners who are giving it to them. \n\nAs for the other Champions who specifically joined the League (I can think of a few off the top of my head... Jax, Xin, and a few others), the first thing to remember is that the Champion lores haven't been updated completely yet. Riot has only done a few, Miss Fortune, Gangplank, and a few of the Shadow Isles Champions at this point. The only REAL lore update we've gotten is the fact that Summoners don't technically exist in a physical form like we assume they had previously. Proving/disproving ANYTHING based on Champion lore right now  is not logically possible, as not all of them are up-to-date and relevant at this time, sadly.\n\nTo address the issue, however (I find it rude not to reply to something as important as this), I mentioned that the League, Rift, and Summoners could be some kind of religion in Valoran. The Rift (Riot has said they wanted to have the feel of a mountain-top battleground) could be exactly that: an ancient mountain-top battleground the Summoners project their battles onto. However, no normal mortal could SEE these battles, and the mountain itself would likely be seen as a religious place. People who are powerful may choose to go on a pilgrimage to dedicate themselves to these Summoners and ancient battles waged by other-worldly spirits. These Champions who joined the League by choice may have done exactly that: traveled to the mountain that holds the Rift and asked the Summoners to take them as a Champion. At this point, the Summoners may choose to accept the Champion, using their fighting essence in their battles, or they may turn them down entirely. Who knows, there may be people on Runeterra who have tried becoming Champions but didn't make it for one reason or another. \n\nAgain, though, not all of the Champion lores are updated at all, so we really can't go judging the Summoners' place in all of this based on Champ lore. Only a few have been updated since the lore change, and I expect the rest are soon to follow. Until all of it is updated, however, there are ways to explain what we have right now.\n\nIs that a suitable counter-example for your worries?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SHlTBUG","date":"2015-11-03T20:39:36.631+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"By voidling I think you mean Voidborn","replies":[{"poster":"Crysi102","date":"2015-11-04T01:36:20.553+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for correcting me.

Realistically, we gotta remember that Riot decided to make this lore change four years _after_ the initial imagination and creation of the game. If Riot really decided that a lore revamp was necessary for the game to move forward as something exciting and imaginative, which they did, I'd imagine they would be faced with two options: 1) Shut down the servers for an extended period of time while they have the lore and game developers redesign the entire game so both aspects mesh well together; or 2) do what they have done and have lore focus on creating an immersive story and gameplay focus on creating fun gameplay, with some connections in between champion and their skill sets.

Here's the boards post explaining it: [http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/fPoi9TfZ-about-the-harrowing](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/fPoi9TfZ-about-the-harrowing)\r\n\r\nCopy-paste:\r\n> Some of you have questions around the Harrowing this year, and we wanted to give you a quick update:\r\n> \r\n> In October, we shared that the Harrowing (and other seasonal events) are changing. You can check out [the PBE Boards post here](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/Grefbrd1-a-note-about-the-harrowing?sort_type=recent) (sorry we didn’t post it to the main Boards as well, our bad).\r\n> \r\n> In short: We’re releasing Legacy skins from past Harrowing events later this week. Zombie / Slayer skins are also rolling out soon, so get those chainsaws ready. We wanted to get you in the mood with a dark and terrifying tale of the unliving, “Shadow and Fortune: A Harrowing Story,” as well as updated biographies for some of our Shadow Isles champions.\r\n> \r\n> And if you’re wondering about Snowdown, we have some great stuff in our bag of goodies that’ll look a little different from what you’ve previously seen. So hold on for info on that, we’ll share more once we have all the details sorted out.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!\r\n","replies":[]}]}]}
