RAF is pretty \"easy\", just fix how players are rewarded for referring friends. Tribunal on the other hand... You have to make a good incentive for players to participate, but still have a system that punishes those who need to be punished. You also have to take into account what the offense was. For instance a player may have been reported for feeding and the players score seems like they were feeding, but the in game chat and footage may show differently. Things like that is why it's probably taking longer. Also I would imagine there's wayyy more coding...

I heard talk of some sort of special loading screen border or icon or splash given to people who earned these skins before the change. Is this happening?\n\nI spent a long time putting ads out for league on all sorts of forums to get those referrals and Grey Warwick used to feel like a very special and rare reward for that. But it's pretty cheap and easy to get now. I understand and support why the change was made, and I understand that a large majority of people that earned it in the old system were cheating. But as someone who wasn't, it feels pretty crappy to not have a unique reward anymore. Even just the token of a special watermark or something on the splash would feel like an acknowledgement of the effort I put in. \n\nNow with all that said, I can't complain too much, because I got most of my referrals in the first system, so I got them AGAIN in the second system, and now I'm getting rewarded a THIRD time at least for the first 5. So I can't say I didn't get my fair share.
