Sorry if I forgot any other ultimate skins.\r\n (Im not trying to be rude, I apologize if it came out that way.)\r\n**Unless** this is just a legendary.

But i don't like that either because it takes from plusefire ezreal.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, i don't like that by the same concept \"plusefire\" have in various champions when they relased plusefire ez, because it was susposed to be unique and it's just as if they didn't had enough ideas for cait and use the plusefire ez as theme.\r\n\r\nI have 3 ultimate skins (the DJ sona, Elementalist Lux and Spirit Guard Udyr) and i think that these ultimate skins should be stayed with ther \"unique theme\" and not be used for another champion's theme.\r\n\r\nFor example, I wouldn't like to see DJ Bard (JUST AN EXAMPLE), i don't care if it were just a legendary skin or not some cool animations, etc. Is the visual representation between DJ sona and DJ bard. It's just a joke/insult for the wonderful DJ sona skin wich her theme were taken to make DJ bard, making lose the \"unique\" theme that was made specifically for sona. (specially when i spent money on it, DJ bard is like the cheap version of DJ sona and it's sad)\r\n\r\nThis is just an example but it has the same feeling that with plusefire ezreal and plusefire caitlyn (In the visual representation and the RP difference that they have)\r\n\r\nI'm so sorry if i offended anyone with that, it's just my opinion.\r\n\r\nPD: It's ok when a RARE/LEGENDARY SKIN theme has various champions involved; like star guardian, dark star, pool party, arcade, etc. But it's not OK to use an ULTIMATE SKIN that is being used for more champions when they were made to be UNIQUE for a specific champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Dreamwalker","date":"2017-05-27T02:50:31.085+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"While Riot did take the skin and give it to another champion, the idea behind the theme is different. Ezreal is a time-travelling fugitive, and Caitlyn is a time traveling officer. I mean, instead of thinking about the negative of Riot giving the unique idea to someone else. Think of the positive, Riot increased the Pulsefire line of uniqueness. Pulsefire is the only line with two people, with a large backstory, and possible lore. DJ has Sona, Spirit Guard Udyr, and Lux is the Elementalist. Neither of those skin lines has something more. Ezreal has an enemy, and so does Caitlyn. So, really, they made the Pulsefire line better by giving it this unique background.
