This only comes from the pattern seen in the previous year, where Kindred was released around this exact time prior to the marksman rework (this year the assassin rework is to follow the release of Ivern). Illaoi came around November (patch 5.23, marksman rework was 5.22, and Kindred was released on patch 5.20), and thus I believe that a new champ should shortly be released a patch after the asssassin rework, sometime in late November/early December.","replies":[{"poster":"Beedle","date":"2016-10-07T20:15:14.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ivern is most likely the last new champ this year.
