Wow, it took me a few days before I was able to post. I guess my account was bugged for a bit. HI!! I'M RIN! Nice to meet you guys! And thank you all SO MUCH for liking the drawing I made for this!\r\n\r\nAlso, IM REALLY SORRY FOR ANY OF YOU WHO GOT CONFUSED ABOUT RIN IN THE CORNER! I was encouraged to put her in, so I went for it. She's not a Tristana PAX skin, sorry! Nor is she Braum's awesome looking mech girl sketch that IronStylus made a while back!\r\n\r\nI've had Rin for a total of 6 years now. [She's Heimerdinger's assistant, with a knack for hextechnology, specifically for her glider wings she's making.](http://rintheyordle.deviantart.com/art/To-the-skies-Rin-s-Wings-599207330) I use to be a lot more active on tumblr in the ask blogs, drawing little comics back, but it's since been a little slow. She actually started as a joke, but it stuck with me so I kept going with it, and eventually changed my name on league to \"RinTheYordle\" to play along with the fun! (though, I'd still highly encourage anyone who wants to write to, or make a blog on tumblr to do so! The ask blogs are fun and the artists and story writers there are AMAZING!)\r\n\r\nAnyways, short story aside, I really, sincerely, am humbled that I'm getting to go to this event. This is my first PAX ever!! I'm really excited to meet you guys there! :D If you know me, and I'm able, I usually give hugs out of excitement, so uh, I HOPE THAT'S OKAY!\r\n\r\nAnyways, for those of you going, hope to see you soon!!!! And if you aren't, I hope I get to see you guys at other conventions or events later on that I will be attending! (on my own that is, nothing with Riot! Like Summoner's Con! :D)\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"MauzeKing","date":"2016-04-12T05:39:43.032+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should make a champ Rin The Yordle or at least a skin if you were ok with riot doing such a thing. your work is awesome and making a skin for tris or even a whole champ would be a great way to pay tribute to one of leagues great artist!
