What type of information do you like to put in a note? Maybe we can think of other solutions that better give you the info you want too :)\n\nHi, thanks for the prompt response! I like to put how I met a friend (for example, if it was via a game, then I'll put my score and my Champion so that I can quickly find the match via Match History), what the friend likes to do, the friend's name if I know him or her in real life, and the friend's old Summoner Name if the friend changes his or her name to something else. I don't edit the notes frequently but sometimes something just comes up that I feel like I should note down, then I will do that. The Legacy Client made it easier than the Beta Client to do editing.\nI like writing Notes so that if the person changes his or her name I'll still know who he or she is, and if I leave League and come back, I will still know who all my friends are. In the unfortunate situation where I forget a friend, I can always just refer back to my handy notes and say \"oh right, that was the game where we met, now it's coming back to me, this guy really likes X Champions and is a generally pretty friendly person.\"","replies":[{"poster":"ChocChipCookie","date":"2017-04-24T20:33:57.203+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is cool insight and some stuff we've talked about showing for you (like when a name changes) down the line.
