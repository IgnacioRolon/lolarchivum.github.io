For each champion you have unlocked you can further unlock a rune page attached to them, including each having their own mastery page of course.\n\n I feel this would feel cleaner than just having a bunch of random generalized rune pages and masteries in a list and instead you have access to specific masteries and runes by clicking on the champion you are going to play. I often switch roles a lot and never really stick to just one lane so having so many different types of masteries and rune pages crammed in a single list can be confusing even if you can name them.\n\nIn my opinion, this way champions will also feel more personal and more customisable. I suppose if it isn't an attractive idea to some you can also make it optional? Have a separate rune and mastery tab but have to option to attach them to champions so that they would only show when in champion select. Mind you it would also allow us to have greater number of 20 mastery pages and runes without having absurdly long drop menu.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheEdgeOfDestiny","date":"2016-08-04T07:47:43.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idea with big videos is awesome! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vauntless Clair","date":"2016-07-27T03:45:34.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a specific champion bio brings (visible) information relating to another champion, any way we can add in-client hotlinks to that champions Bio?\n\nReasons I thought it would be cool is it'd make the exploration an adventure, instead of a \"IOT\" multiple tabs feel.\nIE: Read Sivir's bio, notice azir, click out of sivir then click into azir feel less of an adventure as to say => Read sivir's bio, notice azir and a highlight and be like... hmmmm o_o *click* \"Oh snap it's referring to azir\". \n\nCould this be a thing?
