I'd appreciate it if anyone has suggestions to mitigate that issue.","replies":[{"poster":"zerocontext","date":"2016-06-29T18:56:52.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Lotharstar.  Just to be clear, the changes that we're making right now are to settings that are accessible within the AIR client... outside of the actual game, which is where mouse settings currently live.   And just to be highly ambiguous :-) we're only in the initial stages of what I think we can do with settings, as a general concept.\n\nI think you described a pretty common challenge that many players, myself included, have to contend with.  And I agree we should be thinking about these sorts of problems as we (and future teams) keep iterating on how we approach settings.","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Rajah","date":"2016-06-29T20:03:40.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I would say the single most important change you could possibly make to settings is to allow the in game settings to be altered from the client. That has always been a major pain point for me personally, and many other players I know. I understand the difficulty of it since they are currently totally separate, and I'm not expecting it soon, but wouldn't it be possible for the client to simply create a file listing the settings and for when the game client opens for it to check for changes to that file and apply them to its own settings? Or something of that nature? Or something completely different that accomplishes the same goal? I'm not picky.","replies":[{"poster":"zerocontext","date":"2016-06-29T20:29:36.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear ya.  Alas, that's pretty much all I can say at this stage -- what you're describing is definitely something we know players are asking for. I know that's not super satisfying to hear, but stay tuned and please keep sharing your feedback and ideas for additional changes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-06-29T13:44:45.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i saw the link for this on surrender at 20 i thought this was about a new champion(Moobeat wrote it out as Up next Champion details XD).

I'm wary of giving you an exact date because there're a lot of moving pieces with the alpha and I don't want to create an expectation that we may not be able to deliver on. We're monitoring server load very carefully and since the alpha connects to live servers, we are being very cautious with inviting more players if there's a risk it may affect live server performance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sh00t3rman","date":"2016-06-29T14:27:45.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are the new champion details done in a way that the same information is shown on the web and in the client?

But if you could make it work properly would be really good, way better than clicking A, also its going to be a bit anoying for the people that have customized attack move in left click not being able to do it since will be in server side.\n\nThanks for your time, hoping for an answer!","replies":[]}]}
