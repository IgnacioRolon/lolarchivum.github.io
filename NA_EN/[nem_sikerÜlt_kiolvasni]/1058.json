I'm currently plat (ended there last season as well after climbing from silver) and the mentality difference is really staggering. Plat has a huge ego (myself included as a Yas OT) and everyone approaches the game with the idea of carrying individually. Gold was much more team oriented. The best way to describe plat is Diamond mechanics + middle school mentality.\r\n\r\nEDIT: In defense of plat players though, a lot of gold games at least for me, came down to my individual performance in clutch situations. Thats what determined if I could climb or not. If thats the same for everyone, then getting to plat conditions you to be the hero of the game. At the same time, that philosophy also makes you very arrogant and entitled.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Crossbow1701","date":"2019-05-13T20:39:09.476+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only thing I dont like about these kind of events is we loose the special stuff we unlock.
