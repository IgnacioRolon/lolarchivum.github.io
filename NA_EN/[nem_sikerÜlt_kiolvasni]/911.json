Riot I beg you: Please stop adding stupid changes to the game, such as the Elemental dragons. I understand that you want to create \"innovation\" or bring something new to the game. Fine, I get it, you want to change things up to keep us interested, but don't bring change at the cost of ruining the game, which actually ironically drives us away. The specific changes I'm referring to are the dragon changes. The dragons are too based on RNG and in the first place, and the stats they give completely ruin the current game dynamics. Water Dragon = people that actually win and dominate their lane get punished. Fire Dragon = Welcome to the league of Jhin and Veigar. Both I and various challenger players agree that the dragon rework is literally the stupidest thing introduced as of yet. If you're down dragons, especially those that are important in achieving objectives or winning teamfights such as the Earth or Fire dragon, it is basically impossible to win the game while playing from behind. As someone that is literally in the top 150 of players that play the game in NA as well as someone that genuinely loves League, I can guarantee that if you keep adding unnecessary and game-breaking changes like this, the game will die. There will be no future for League of Legends. Please, hire an actual balance team that knows how to realistically develop and balance the game rather than creative developers that wanna get their ideas out at the cost of the game's enjoyability factor.","replies":[{"poster":"Pristinelyssia","date":"2016-04-21T12:19:47.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"you put Riot in a position where they have find a middle ground or fear your doomsay, because you think how much you've been playing (and the small populous with you) deserves more significant say than those who don't compare in rankings (yet).\n\ni promise you those in the entire challenger tier \"pay less\" at this point (as they are both outnumbered and 'saturated' economically) by the combination of all remaining Tiers plus norms.\n\nwith this understanding shared, i will address the validity of your detest for the dragons...\n\nthe dragons randomly spawning is a good thing, not a bad:\n\nQ: why?\n\nA: because it puts more pressure on jungle and causes teamwork the need for creativity and innovation.\n\nQ: havent the advantaged obtained by killing dragons always been too extreme?\n\nA: yes; my argument here with Riot as that they need to find supreme balance for their game; overall.\n\nBut, first, i must have you know.

Stating an obvious trend is not blackmail - League has been losing their playerbase since about season 4, although we are not given the exact data of how many players have left. Although I don't know if balance changes are the main cause of this, this dragon rework will obviously contribute to it as well as simplifying game mechanics such as jungle timers (which pro junglers like Crumbz and Amazing have publicly spoken out against on social media). I do not claim to love Riot Games - I love the game of League of Legends otherwise I couldn't play it for hours upon hours.\r\nLeague of legends is both a competitive game and an MMO - Riot wants to cater to the general MMO audience whilst sacrificing the quality of conpetitive play by dumbing things down like the jungle timers as I said before. In addition, Dynamic queue has been very harmful to the competitive environment - although I exclusively solo queue, numerous dynamic queue abusers have made it into higher ranks, and boosting has been made much easier for those in that detestable business since they can boost five accounts at once. Its a system that seems good in the short term but can have damaging long term effects as solo queue talent is replaced by those that abuse dynamic queue. For example, when I queue at 3 AM - 8 AM, my queue times are guaranteed to be about 30 minutes to an hour. I get on a team with four randoms, and the enemy team has 5 challengers in dynamic queue. Obviously a 5 man coordinated challenger team will defeat a mix of soloing challengers, masters, and diamonds. But are challengers and other high elo players that abuse the system like this actually challenger? Do their individual skills and decisionmaking match up to the standards?\r\nRegardless, Riot needs to take the advice of pros and challengers because we understand the game in a much more logical scope than their developers - cool concepts are not acceptable if they come at the cost of the quality of gameplay. We are high elo because we UNDERSTAND and KNOW the game inside out - making dragon a bit more rewarding is fine, but these changes are making the game REVOLVE entirely around dragon such that if you lose an important dragon, you're basically screwed. Dragon is meant to HELP teams that are ahead, not singlehandedly win the game for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Strompest","date":"2016-04-21T14:05:55.145+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry that you have to resort to ad hominem and can't keep up a civilized discussion about this topic.
