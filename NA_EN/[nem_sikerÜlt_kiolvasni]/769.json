And with teams on both sides now in splits that may be more competitive than we thought  G2 has lost two already, Unicorns 1, Fnatic 1,  TSM 2, P1 winless, C-9 3, what if some teams didn't take it seriously using the time to concentrate on practice.  It easily could have ended with a team or even two not playing a single game. That's not to mention if someone were a Unicorns fan, bought tickets, and they didn't get to play would be disappointed.

Bo1s are certainly more volatile but the consequences of teams' results in these Bo1s were correspondingly less extreme.  No team was kicked out but the order could only have a minor influence on how the final went.  The Bo1s, less for hashing out a tier list, were meant to give teams an idea of what they were up against in preparation for the final.\r\n\r\nThe new format is more competitive for sure but as a competitive event leaves something to be desired.  The participants were not chosen carefully to compromise between consistently great teams and hot teams like they are for worlds and the knockout stage is only one series meaning teams cannot afford to have a mediocre group stage before they show their true quality.\r\n\r\nMoving the format closer to that of a competitive event might seem like a better compromise, but we're now left with a pale imitation when we could have had something original and exciting.","replies":[{"poster":"Kritty","date":"2017-07-04T16:52:01.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem that would have arisen is the travel expenses for teams that may not have even ended up playing.

What even is the point of a \"competition\" like this irrelevant of the format? Hey look, (Insert any other region here) is better than NA! \r\n\r\nWhen it is little more than bragging rights that are on the line, the whole thing is an exhibition. I might watch it out of curious speculation online, but with little interest since there is nothing on the line. If NA could take the EU #1 worlds seed away by winning this competition however. Now you would have my interest as this becomes something relevant. As it stands now, it feels like little more than a cash grab during a scheduled break period in the respective LCS calendars. Why not just have an all-star exhibition game or something equally meaningless to the standings that does not have to involve such a time commitment or travel? Just my opinion here, but i find this whole Rift Rivals uninteresting at the base level since there is nothing on the line.","replies":[{"poster":"Kritty","date":"2017-07-04T16:55:12.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize that every non-season event has started out as just a friendly competition, then evolved into something more, right?
