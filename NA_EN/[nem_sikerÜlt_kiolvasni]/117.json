I recommend using the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to run a clean reinstall for a fresh slate.  Make sure your brother is also logged into the correct region on the patch, located on the top right.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
