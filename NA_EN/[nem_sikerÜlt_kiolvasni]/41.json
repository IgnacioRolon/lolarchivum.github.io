Something like Fallen Knight Yorick, where he is covered in shattered pieces of armor, or a cool sounding skin like Shade Seed Yorick, where he could be part of the fallen isles sorcerer cult. He could even continue on the \"Deep Sea\" thresh skin and be another drowned hero who summons a Kraken! You're creative Rito!
