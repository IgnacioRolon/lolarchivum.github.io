You there! Stop biting him. No! You can't eat that. You can't eat me either. I hate bring your Poro to work day.\"\n\n{{champion:16}} \"Ahhh, come on boss, they are so cute. Besides, what else are we going to use this playground outside the office for. You know, you should really get a poro, i bet he would be adorable in a little suit like yours.\"\n\n{{champion:150}} \"No thanks, they are a lot of work. You have to feed them, but not too much, otherwise you end up like Sejuani and her Poro.\"\n\n{{champion:16}} \"Yeah, but you can bring them to events like this, have them meet other Poros and become friends with them. Which could also let you be friends with said Poro's owner.\"\n\n{{champion:150}} \"You sure about that. Because right now, Sona Poro is playing a song while your poro is doing some dance with her little moon staff. They seem to real good friends now.\"\n\n{{champion:16}} \"What! Come here Snookems, we don't hang out with that one, it is a bad influence on us.\"\n\n{{champion:150}} \"Rumble Poro, don't you dare turn that flamethrower on. Zed Poro, NO! you can not assassinate Ashe Poro. Hey, i told you not to turn that on, you are going to burn somebody. Stay out of the sandbox with that thing, you will turn it to glass. Oh sure, do the exact opposite of that i told you, well now you have no sandbox.\"\n\nA mini sand tornado started rising from the sandbox, in it, 4 figures appeared.\n\n{{champion:101}} **\"Back away from the sand!\"**\n\n{{summoner:31}}{{champion:68}} *\"No\"*\n\n{{champion:101}} **\"INFIDEL!

Those are other guardians, whose name makes no sense at all.\"\n\n{{champion:16}} \"So, you are related to those owl thingys right?\n\n{{champion:72}} \"Well, i guess some of us bear slight resemblance to a bird.

Like i always say, change is good.\"\n\n{{champion:101}} \"We don't care about your opinion, you are lucky you even get to be one of us.\"\n\n{{champion:16}} \"Yeah, why is Kha'zix one of you? The rest of you are from Shurima, so i get it.
