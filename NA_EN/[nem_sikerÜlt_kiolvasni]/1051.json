This is prevalent in many games with taxing, stealing camps, stealing kills, and so on. \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever this is far from the truth in solo queue(once you can consistently climb most tiers). It's no coincidence that the majority of higher tier players recognize that it is a team game, that they aren't the baddest ones out there, and that the only way to climb is through humility and understanding that there is always room for growth.\r\n\r\nThat is the ideal mindset.\r\n\r\nIt is also no coincidence that the players with the \"1v9\" mindset, biggest ego problems, or are hardstuck are often times plat/high gold. Ofcourse some players can climb higher with such a flawed mentality, but it's an idealism that never criticizes itself.
