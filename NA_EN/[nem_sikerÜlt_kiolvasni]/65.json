I often want to play with some of those players or check out their match history/ranking but I am unable to because \"Recently Played\" is no longer in that section. I have to now go to my match history, look at the players name and remember it as i type it in either \"Invite\" or \"Search for Summoner.\"  In reality, I'm more likely to be directed away from the League Client and head to op.gg for my recently played opponents/teammates stats because I dont have to type in a name there\r\n\r\nPlease resinstate that function into the Beta Client (ability to invite/view recently played).\r\nAlso, why cant I view my friends list and chat with people (other than the boxes i already had open) once I enter champ select? \r\n\r\nThanks!!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Zallamance","date":"2017-01-11T00:11:17.533+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"On the right side where all your friends are listed, there should be an icon near the top to add friends.

I've been following this this topic pretty diligently, and the closest, legitimate word from riot I have found relating to what you just said is that the item set feature was just slapped onto the legacy client. Since they did a brand new client, they have to make a brand new program and implement it in order for players to use it on the new client as the old program is not compatible. Also, they said they would like to input it into the new client, but as many other things are more of a priority, it probably won't come out till it is out of beta and the legacy client is no longer being used.

Finally someone else agrees. \r\n\r\nPretty much, as any JG (except graves seems to be the opposite) it is an awful idea to try to kill raptors. If you take red buff, you lose about 1/3hp with a good leash. Then you smite to get back to ~full hp. Then you go to krugs, and lose maybe another 1/3(without smite). But those raptors. Omg. Even with 2/3 hp, if you don't have smite, you're dead. Literally. \r\n\r\nI usually skip raptors entirely. The little ones do too much dmg and aren't worth any gold. Sometimes I try to kill the big one real quick for the gold boost, but you still take too much free dmg for the 60 gold. I'd rather heal up on Rift Scuttle for more gold. I think the attack speed, damage, and hp on the small raptors is just stupid. That being said, the AS, dmg, and hp on the big one needs to go up. With any other jg monster, at any particular point in the game, smite will typically deal like 1/3-1/4 of its HP. At any level, Smite does almost 85% of the big raptor's hp.
