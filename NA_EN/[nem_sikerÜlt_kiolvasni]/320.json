You can't exactly pick up where you left off if you close the client, so leaving it running overnight can sometimes be the best move if it's taking a while. Sometimes I do this when I download/install games overnight because I don't want to hog all the network bandwidth during the hours my roommates are watching Netflix or playing games. \n\nLet me know if you run into any issues during the patching process.","replies":[]}]}
