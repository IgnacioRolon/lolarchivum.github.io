I'd say Doom bots was a good idea and definitely worth trying. But I have to say that URF was worth keeping permanently. Because of URF, different champions had new versatility and new strategies to be learned. Some people found these quickly which resulted in heavy bans on Kassadin, Karthus, Hecarim, Soraka and I saw a few people terrified of Zilean because of his incredible utility. URF was a game in it's own. It brought the teamfights of ARAM to the Rift where classic strategies further evolved. I saw fragile champions dominating the jungle. Champions that people often scoff at finally being appreciated. URF was a good thing. \r\n\r\nPlease bring it back Riot. Perhaps, quarterly if not permanently?

I understand you can;t keep them all permanently because queues for all game modes would suffer resulting in long wait times. but not many people play dominion anymore. so lets remove that and add it it with doom bots, URF, and All for one and then whenever you guys patch the game just swap out the files for say dominion for the files for say URF. that way it is fresh all the time and gives people that just want to have fun a way to get away from all the competitive garbage. I like to play with my wife, she isn;lt very good at video games period and even less now that we have a baby and she is going to school so we never play because she gets upset when people are assholes to her because she fed or did something wrong. the only time i can get her to play is when a featured game mode designed for fun and not pro gamers is available. PLEASE Riot make 1 featured game mode available at all times and dominion is fun but wait times are pretty long and not many people enjoy it anymore so pull it for a while and add it back in. I hope you take my advice as I believe it will add a lot more steady players to your player base.

Now, before I begin ranting, I will admit the initial thrill was there for me. I enjoyed smashing the first difficulty, saying \"bring it on,\" only to be annihilated during my first try at five bombs. However, the fun quickly diminished for me from there. I learned that splitpushing was key, only certain champs (good lane pushers) were viable, and that grouping up to fight the bots was a terrible idea. The games focused on *avoiding* the bots that we had queued up to fight. It wasn't a game mode that really struck me as awfully fun. I played it along with two longtime friends in one of their living rooms, and at the end of our game vs five bomb difficulty we all sighed, said glad that's over, let's never play it again. Now here I sit, ranting about Doom Bots of Doom, having beaten the hardest difficulty twice and never desiring to play it again since its release day. I don't mean to turn this into yet another \"bring back URF post,\" but I strongly feel that URF brought out the best of what a featured game mode is meant to be. The rules were ridiculous, the team fights out of control, and the fun never ending. I played URF mode every day I logged in. While I may be an advocate for the eventual return of URF, I'd be happy with any game mode with the same premise: an absolutely absurd set of rules that you can get into a game and laugh at. Doom Bots just wasn't that for me, and from what I've read fell similarly short to others. My suggestion is to focus on fun, ridiculous game modes rather than challenging ones. As you guys at Riot know, the modes are very popular and quickly stagnate over the two weeks they're released. Doom Bots ran their course faster than any other Featured Mode thus far for me, and I have high hopes the development team will come out swinging for the next one.
