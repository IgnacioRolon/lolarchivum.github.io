The fact that I was restricted from jungling made the task seem daunting and really complex so I didn't put the time in to learn it until I had been level 30 for quite a while. I missed out on the opportunity to play what is now my favorite role because the current system overemphasized the difficulty of jungling. In retrospect, learning to jungle wasn't that hard. I wish I had known that when I first unlocked smite. I wish I had known that from before I unlocked smite. That's why smite needs to be available from level 1 (or level 5).\nThis applies to runes and rune pages, too. I'm glad they intend to fix these things, but I don't understand why it takes so long. They should just lower the costs of runes and give everyone 3 (maybe 4) rune pages instead of just 2. \n\nThe high costs of runes themselves is ridiculous. It doesn't incentivize players to experiment, and just feels like a way for Riot to drain our IP and push us to purchase RP. I can understand that Riot may want to profit off of rune _pages_, but additional rune pages should be for people that want to have many champion-specific rune pages. Two rune pages doesn't allow a player to have enough runes to cover the standard AP, ADC, Tank, and Support setups. It takes money to have enough rune pages, and it takes too much time to fill them.","replies":[{"poster":"urgaypwned","date":"2016-10-15T03:24:04.172+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention there's no real explanation of the advantages of having a jungler.

If you dump people with everything from the beginning they will not know what to pick and will get overwhelmed with all the information. Someone else suggested that Riot make tutorial videos on how to use all the variables in the game, that is not a good way to teach players. Tutorials should be presented a little bit of information at a time, and players should learn by doing, not by watching an information dump before going into your first game. \r\n\r\nUnlocking summoner spells, rune slots, and mastery points allows new players to focus on one thing at a time and provides a streamline for learning. The incentive to level up is also important. Rewarding players with icons or other meaningless trinkets that do not affect gameplay are not good rewards. While a sum of IP or IP boosts are incentivizing, they create a situation where players may be overwhelmed even further, ironically by their own purchases. You might ask why buying things with RP is allowed then for new players, and that is less of an issue because most new players do not buy RP and even if they do, they will most likely not spend it all on champions, runes, and rune pages. Therefore a very small minority of new players in the current system overwhelm themselves based on their RP purchases. In the system you are suggesting, EVERY new player would have access to all the customization options before they even play one game. This is not acceptable as it would greatly overwhelm most players and hinder progression incentives. Even though the current system is not perfect and could use reformation, unlocking everything at level 1 is not a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Doppio Vinegar","date":"2016-10-14T02:03:55.398+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"another example that shows why you shouldn't necessarily give everything to a beginner player is with Dota 2.\r\nwhen I first started that game I had no idea who to play or what to do because there was this huge cast of characters and there was no difficulty ranking for them which lead to a lot of trial, error, and frustration","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2016-10-14T01:24:08.685+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":5,"body":"I remember when I started playing League back in early S4.
