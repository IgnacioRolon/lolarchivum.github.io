The fact that it's a difference means that people who heal AND burn for 10K each are grouped with people who NEITHER heal or burn at all, if you want to use it as a comparative tool, so it's not really relevant. If you use it only to evaluate what's the \"main\" role of a champ **independently of other champs**, it's less strange, but I'm not sure I understand the point, because the fact that Bard deals more damage than he heals doesn't really mean he is allowed to misplay its shrines, they are still an important part of its power budget, even if less than the half.\n\nMy gut feeling here is that a scatter plot with amount healed on one axis and damage dealt on the other, and then a very basic clustering method (maybe K-means with manually trying 2 or 3 values? You have only 25 champs after all, it's fast) would be much more useful and not much more complicated, so a better return on time spent overall.\n\n(I hope this doesn't come out as arrogant or anything ^^ I'm just really interested in this kind of data-analysis, so I try to participate, just my 2 cents ;) )\n\nEDIT: On a related note, how did you clustered the 4 kinds of supports (Baby-sitter, care-taker, play-maker, bard) in the roaming part?\nEDIT2: Ah, this was already answered: 4 buckets of 8.

The point of the BBI is just to understand a support's primary output in terms of damage and healing.

For example, we can assume that Lulu contributes 17k worth of non-damage utility since she averages that much less damage.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that a lot of the big numbers come from AOE. Soraka gets a global heal and Sona gets aoe damage and heals, and Brand and Zyra can slum dunk an entire team with their ult.

It's a common problem with classification algorithm/machine learning that they reach good solutions but can't explain why they are good. Like how, on a whole different scale, AlphaGo manages to beat the world champion but cannot **teach** you why its moves are good.\n\nAnyway, that was a very interesting article+forum thread, hope there will be more like this one or like the warding one soon ;)\nStuff like Flash-key are fun but more anecdotal, I think ^^'","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ruy","date":"2016-03-21T19:41:00.957+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lets pretend to talk like Bard.
