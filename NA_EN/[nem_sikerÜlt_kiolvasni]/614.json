The east coast has been having insanely high ping for how long???  Some have gotten over 200 ping and now because you have 60 its such a big deal?  I am a west coast player from Canada and I find the people appalling who are talking about quitting because of the ping.  Suck it up and play because this isn't an unfair move, it was the best thing riot could have done for the community and I am grateful for that.  I can live with 60 ping...

I'm east coast and went from 120 ping for TWO YEARS to 60 ping and i consider the 60 ping to be a godsend.  This is the best ping I've ever had in my entire history of league and i don't understand how anybody could complain about anything above 100.  I'm missing skill shots because i'm so used to the lag but it's great because now my aim actually determines whether the skill hits and i don't have to guess half a second ahead of time anymore.  To all of those with \"high ping\" right now on the west coast, i've had higher than that since the beginning of league and this is a very welcome change for my side of the US.  Also, your ping is still better than mine was before the new server.
