An example of this is the 2015 Summer CLG where they were garbage during the spring split but were actually really good in the summer and won the playoffs but a team that was consistent during the whole year and not just in 1 split TSM got the # 2 seed. \n  The logic of which ever team is hot at the time has the best chance at winning worlds for their respective region; so why not just have the splits combined in 1 long season and which ever team wins the \"summer\" split gets the # 1 seed the runner up # 2 and the 3rd place winners the # 3 seed.","replies":[{"poster":"Natural2020","date":"2017-02-27T18:12:49.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey III BAKURYU III,\r\n\r\nInteresting ideas.

Makes the playoffs(twice a year) less and less entertaining at least for me.  It's like having the NBA playoffs twice a year it will soon become boring which shouldn't happen for such an important tournament as it decides Worlds.   The Finals(2x) a year are like the superbowl but with 2 finals each year they will just become the feeling of just \"another game\" \n\n2. Teams can just slump through the spring split but buckle down in the summer and win the summer to be the #1 seed against teams that have actually been good for a full year.  \n\nSpring Split/Playoffs - January to Late April while Summer Split/Playoffs are from May to Late August. \n  IDK abotu schools around the world but for most of NA January to April everyone are in school until near the middle of April for start of Easter break which is for 1 week but the problem is most people are/SHOULD be \nputting their time and efforts in education/school and less time about the LCS instead. \n  So why not have The start of the LCS from April to late August with the continuous \"Split/Playoffs\" during a time where most of the viewers of this game( 10-20 year old's) are off during Spring/Summer break and not during January to March for the first half of the Split?\n    Here are just my thoughts/ideas \n\nJANUARY - FEBRUARY - MARCH ( Can be the off season for the LCS players as well as IEM tournaments etc placing most of these tournaments during a span of 3 months will get people to watch them as it's the only League as well as giving everyone a much needed rest/ patches/updates etc \n\nAPRIL - MAY - JUNE - JULY - AUGUST ( Can be the Start of the LCS with Playoffs being in August.  Like I said placing the bulk of the majority of the attention from viewers during this time will get their attention as most viewers are out of school for not just 1 break(April) but 2 breaks( June-August).  More free time for people to play League of Legends as well as getting their attention to be able to book tickets to see live events. \n\nSEPTEMBER  ( Can be a break for the players after finishing their season) \n\nOCTOBER ( ALL STAR, Placing All Stars before Worlds in my opinion is much better than after Worlds) \n1. Before Worlds players/teams will be too caught up with needing to win Worlds/pressure etc that it does hinder their performances but by placing All Stars before Worlds will give them an event to just relax and have fun before Worlds.  Think of it as recess.  \n  You don't tell kids/LCS players about a test(Worlds) and get them too caught up without something to ease their anxiety or pressure so by having All Stars before Worlds gives them time to play the game and able to see their opponents without the pressure.  \n\nNOVEMBER - DECEMBER ( Worlds - Another break for most of the LCS # viewers as most of the viewers are not on just 1 break during the bulk of the attention to the LCS Worlds but are on 2 breaks ( Thanksgiving Break and Christmas Break)","replies":[{"poster":"Katow Jo","date":"2017-03-01T22:26:31.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting proposal, here are my two cents on a couple of issues with your proposed format though;\r\n\r\nThe main problem with 1 long league for LoL is because unlike professional sports such as the NBA, the state of the game changes drastically through patches, whereas in traditional sports, the nature of the game consistently stays the same. Because it's an eSports game, League inevitably gets patched a lot and these changes can affect how teams perform (think of how some teams benefit a lot from a teamfight heavy meta or a objective-centric meta, or even when an individual player's signature champion gets buffed, etc.). Because of this, the 2 splits format adds 2 nice checkpoints where the game hasn't gone through 5-6 major patches and giving a bit more relevance to the winners of each split. \r\n\r\nNext up, while I think the intentions of your All-Star being placed before world's are well intended, in practice this wouldn't work very well. If you place All-Stars, which is a fun, non-competitive invitational event, a lot of players would refuse going, just because they'd rather be preparing for World's through a bootcamp or something of the sort, you can never get enough practice after all. \r\n\r\nI do agree with your point on how the Spring Split is way less valuable than the Summer Split though, and though MSI has helped that situation a bit, like you said, a slumping Spring team can still very well qualify as the #1 seed in the Summer, which isn't a very good system in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-03-02T03:23:21.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for commenting. \n\n\n\" The main problem with 1 long league for LoL is because unlike professional sports such as the NBA, the state of the game changes drastically through patches\". \n\n- Indeed 10/10 however, whats the difference between spring split winner and the summer split winner when there are 5-10 patches during the span of those splits as well as the Spring split winning team has a 8/10 chance of making it to Worlds, even if they bomb during the summer split because of the amount of points they racked up during the spring split.  \n  That spring split team could have just been good at 1 meta and the other meta they could be good awful and not recover but yet they still have a 80% chance to making it big. \n  Either way you slice it teams will be up and down during both splits either splitting the season in 2 splits(spring/Summer) as well as a long season with both splits combined. \n - With the proposal of a longer combined season it's identical to the 2 splits as if they weren't combined to begin with; if Riot needs to make changes or patches they still have from April-August to do patches as well as having a week play, next week off type of style for the players/teams to figure out certain metas.  \n  Meta is important no doubt but look at when Riot totally mixed the meta about 2 weeks before Worlds in 2015.  The biggest tournament in League and the result of hardwork from those certain teams to reach Worlds and they get bombed with a new meta/patch right before the tournament. \n  \n\n\" Next up, while I think the intentions of your All-Star being placed before world's are well intended, in practice this wouldn't work very well.

These are pretty much celebrities but yet we don't see them at all, they don't do any labor or hardwork, they sit on a computer gaining cheap $ from people who do want to see them, hear from them and yet they can't show up to an event that's fun, takes the ease before Worlds, and to just see fans without needing $ to do so. \n\n\n\" I do agree with your point on how the Spring Split is way less valuable than the Summer Split though, and though MSI has helped that situation a bit, like you said, a slumping Spring team can still very well qualify as the #1 seed in the Summer, which isn't a very good system in my opinion\". \n - Indeed, I sent e-mails to Riot back in 2013 about the Spring split being useless other than just a split not to get relegated from but with no reason to win it.  \n Thank god Riot changed it in 2015 with the point system because it wasn't smart having a 3rd place summer split winner > Winner of Spring split.  \n\nOverall I read your post and have thought about a few things but I still stand by my post/reasons as well as respecting yours in the process.  \nThank you again for your time and thoughts.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cobozco","date":"2017-02-25T00:57:07.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will there merch? :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Natural2020","date":"2017-02-25T01:33:54.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Cobozco,\r\n\r\nThere will.
