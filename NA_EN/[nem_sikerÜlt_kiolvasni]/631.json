This has happened many times (I've seen at least twenty of these scams since I joined). \nThe person likely puts it as a reply to the top comment to get the most views, upvotes the post with the unused accounts/bots to make it seem popular, has some unused accounts/bots comment that the site is totally legitimate and \"it works fine, I got PAX Sivir! so happy\" and has bots upvote _those_ comments too, and then downvotes any replies (with bots) that call the site out on its scam.\n\nLuckily, we have excellent moderation here. When the post gets reported, it normally disappears within minutes. One just needs to know _how_ to report, because the News view doesn't show how.\nIn order to report, one must visit the Boards and go to the [Announcements board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official), which contains links to all Announcements threads. You can visit a thread and report the offending posts in it by using the Report function of the Boards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SuppsNeedFarmToo","date":"2017-01-11T19:16:17.879+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":3,"body":"Will you be able to play with your friends or is it just solo?","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2017-01-11T19:48:16.745+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":22,"body":"It's a single-player tool.
