Basically, there is going to be no episode this week since I am taking this weekend and next weekend to perfect the season finale. Many of you have questions as to whether this story will stay or not during season 2, and the answer is the story will continue for as long as it can (or until I get bored). So, I am sorry for any inconvenience I might have caused and thank you for taking your time every week to come here and read both Dellron and I's stories. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow, for season 2 to be green lit, Dellron has to approve it. \r\n\r\nTo Dellron: You can take as much time as you need to... just let me know by replying back to me when you might have your decision. \r\n\r\nThank you all and hope you're having a fun memorial day!!  \r\n","replies":[{"poster":"King Dellron","date":"2016-06-08T16:50:28.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for replying so late, been a hectic week.\r\nYou don't need my permission to do this.
