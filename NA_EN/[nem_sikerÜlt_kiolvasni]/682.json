I have seen Monte be rude to C9 publicly on multiple occasions since 2014. His rant about C9 being a \"bad team\" at the start of worlds before they played was absolutely hilarious. It was so disrespectful not only towards C9 but to NA as a whole. He attempted to discredit the whole thing by saying that C9 was a bad team, and also went on to say the teams they faced were weak. I don't think so. C9 is absolutely _KILLING_ it right now. NA and EU are looking like much more competitive regions overall than both Korea and China (although I still think the top two teams are SKT/EDG). Liquid, TIP? Both solid teams in their own right IMO and well fought by C9. It's true, they grow stronger every match, but they looked good still even in the gauntlet. The best part? I'm right.

Are they trying to give more time to practice for a specific team. Or is it due to the days the groups didn't play/team scheduling? Or is it just a roll of the dice? \r\n_Group A_ played day _1,2,4 _ _Group B_ played on day _1,3,4_ _Group C_ played day _1,2,3_ and _Group D_ played _2,3,4_ so I don't know if that has any play. Why not just make the groups play on the days they had off this week next week, that is something that would make sense to me Day 1-D, Day 2-B, Day 3-A, Day 4-C\r\n\r\nEdit: ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ C9 take my energy༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ","replies":[{"poster":"MrMTB","date":"2015-10-05T07:29:03.598+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a conspiracy.
