Now in terms of scripting or when u get banned for it riot tells absolutely nothing. Flat out say we won't share information on what u got banned for just 3rd party programs/scripting/account sharing,cut and dry u cheated get over it. No help no information and no effort to try to sort it out.

Their response was \"Nope, This was you.\" I was treated pretty much the exact same way as you bro. I have always played fair in every game ive ever played, been avidly against hackers as they ruin everyone else's fun. Not only this but I'm a very trashy player, I'm VERY bad at the game and yet they claim I'm a hacker. Like do my scores and games reflect someone who's hacking? like half the games ive been in ive been negative. Not only was I doing poorly but I hadn't played league in the period of time they said I was. I was falsely PERMANENTLY banned for something I had never done, I did use Discord and Communication programs but they claim that's not why I was banned. Eventually I just said what the fuck ever when they said they WILL not be refuting this ban or even remotely willing to hear me out. Apparently no proof I give them will help if they won't tell me what program I'm being suspected in using. I was a model player who never really trash talked anyone. Never was toxic, and pretty much made friends with almost everyone I talked to in game. Yet I got permanently banned. Some of the little assholes in this game never get banned for being toxic or punished in the slightest yet I never do anything warranting banning, and I'm the one banned. Not to mention I also roamed the forums and answered questions, got several friends into league and bought hundreds of $ worth of skins. All to be treated by riot support like it's a done deal and not even willing to tell me what it was over.\r\n To this day I wonder what I was banned for.

So I could never and probably never will understand why this would be done to me, I never even had a chat ban or anything remotely to that, so I considered myself as a model player.\r\n\r\nBut I did understand that they couldn't give me details to my ban, for the reasons you guys mentioned, but that just added onto the frustration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bick Jivas","date":"2016-10-01T21:16:32.321+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is unacceptable, RIOT FIX THIS PROCESS, BANNED PEOPLE DESERVE MORE COMMUNICATION REGARDING THEIR BAN, HOW DARE YOU THROW AWAY THEIR MONEY AND TIME FOR A CRIME THEY DIDN'T COMMIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"AriesTheVirgo","date":"2016-09-30T02:00:41.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also says exploit, so using those in games is against the rules.
