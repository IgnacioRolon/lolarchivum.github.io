It's easy to pink your jungle and hard to pink the enemy's jungle, and in the early game trinket wards are so short that it's not worth the risk of running around in the enemy's jungle.\r\n\r\nYou can only ward aggressively with pinks in the enemy's jungle if you've got all the map pressure already,  which makes even defensive warding hard for the losing team. This takes away a key strategic tool for losing teams to stabilize and recover. If this is true the warding patterns we see in the post should be even more extreme based on whether the team is winning or losing. It's a part of I think an excessive move towards snowballiness in the preseason.\r\n\r\nEven if we don't get green wards back in the shop, yellow trinket needs to act more like old upgraded yellow trinket and give longer duration wards earlier in the game. Wards being more vulnerable and more like mini-objectives makes sense as a design goal, but I think that can be served by cheaper pinks and no infinite purchaseable green wards, and putting some power back in yellow trinket.","replies":[{"poster":"Jean WiT RaZoR","date":"2015-11-19T00:12:47.462+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, i hate the way trinkets were changed.
