(similar to attrox's passive) If an ally would take fatal damage during this time they will tap into the pool of extra hp to keep them alive. (pool reserve can be around 200hp-300hp-400hp) While tapped into this extra pool they gain extra attack damage and movement speed. (This means while they are below 0% hp remaining) At the end of the time any ally who is under 0% will die. Also regardless of lifesteal or spellvamp once you are under 0% hp you cannot go back above it.\r\n\r\nJust some ideas, I believe this ult would make him unique and also it is based off his lore (inspiring solders to turn the odds in battle)\r\n{{champion:266}} Tell me what you guys think ","replies":[{"poster":"Enlegacy","date":"2016-09-15T23:46:01.158+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":5,"body":"I feel like his e needs more changes than that.

In my opinion the Taric rework was one of the best rework Riot has done to date. It took the essence of what Taric was and kept what his kit did (Q is a heal, W is armor/shield, E was a stun) and the only thing they really changed was his ult. I think Aatrox needs the same kind of kit revamp. The only thing I think they should really really hold to is the Q since its oddly iconic to him (Like Poppy's E) and his healing (But in some more interactive way). His ult feels lackluster most of the time, his E is OK, but isn't fun or interesting to use. The charge system you brought up was pretty good, but I feel it should do something different. Since Riot generally has a problem with free healing, they like to give some kind of window that people can make use of/play around. So like how Vlad's non-empowered Q's do very little, but his empowered Q heals a ton. So maybe an Aatrox player could get 3 empowered healing autos if he lands his Q on a champion, or that he could have increased healing if he hit someone with his E. But Tl;dr his kit needs to be modernized and they need to give a conditional window that he can heal in.","replies":[{"poster":"syssun","date":"2016-09-16T00:28:09.647+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe his E could open wounds on a champ and then when attacking the champ he would heal from their blood?

That's really annoying that you can disrupt it when it has a 10 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nW- I like the life steal on his W. Simple as that. You can increase it early game, but keep it around the same late game, because it could potentially be too OP if you add too much Lifesteal late game. When you proc it, I think you should receieve a short attack speed burst with a small cooldown. You can't really dual with most champions early game with his current kit, so I find myself mostly poking away and by the time I get them down to low hp, my Bloodpool is almost out, and I really don't have the HP to win a fight.\r\n\r\nE- Leave it the same. If you want to do anything with his E then take away the magic damage bonus, and add in a slight higher AD increase. The slow could probably be increased by atleast .5 seconds. Non any higher, because it'd be too long.\r\n\r\nR- I agree with syssun's idea on his ultimate. That would be a really good idea, since Aatrox doesn't really bring much to the table with his Ult. To be quite honest, I only use it when I absolutely need it, because all it gives is attack speed, and does magic damage (remove this please). The attack speed really isn't anything to brag about if I'm being 100% honest here, so I believe it should be buffed just a little bit. \r\n\r\nKEEP HIS BLOODPOOL!

Its a similar treatment to what Fiora got (although I don't think Fiora should have gotten it). His lore makes it quite clear, his biggest moment is to turn the tide of battle, not through his own dominance, but through inspiring those he is aiding.\r\n\r\nPersonally I want to see aatrox have something that further incentivizes buying lifesteal/attack speed. Maybe something with a new E, since his current E feels the most disjointed and at odds with his character. I tend to think of him as attack quickly, with less powerful strikes to sustain himself through trades, not as a real heavy hitter, or sitting back poking with range. \r\n\r\nI am most concerned with him ending up too bursty, or with base damages too high (allowing him to build tank)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also I agree with NoNamesAlowed - Words of Courage is not a fitting name for the skill. but otherwise its great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Hambooglar","date":"2016-09-15T23:58:43.804+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think your ult is a very great idea, BUT remember, Aatrox's main role is a SPLIT PUSHER/Duelist, who takes charge of sustain and wins off by sustain.

Yes, nobody likes change, but as much as nobody likes it, change is good.\n\n I can speak as one of those I-play-an-unpopular-champion people. I really like playing Galio (although I'm not a Galio main), his ultimate is awesome, he's got a great backstory, but I know that he's outdated and he's looking forward to a rework. So the best thing I can do is to not sweat it and be optimistic about the Galio rework up in the future.\n\nNow when I heard of the Yorick rework, I decided to try out the old Yorick Mori before he's changed and I found out something interesting: he sucked and I didn't like him. His kit was odd, even more odd than Singed or Teemo. But when I played him after they reworked him, I really enjoyed it. He was better at laning, better at teamfights, very adapted to the meta, and he just looked and sounded really cool.\n\nObviously there's some few people out there who liked the old, outdated, weird Yorick. But he didn't fit, and Riot helped him adjust to the current League of Legends. And another really big example is Sion. A **ton** of people liked the old Sion, now personally, I just thought he was ugly. But the old Sion was even more odd than Yorick, it doesn't make much sense for a full AP champ to all of a sudden gain 100% lifesteal, and that's just part of his kit. Sure, it worked out just fine in his day, but his day is long past and he changed with it. Now he's made a mark on the world of League of Legends with his signature \"COWARDS!\" (and, btw, old Sion mains, don't be cowards who can't accept change).\n\nWe, as players, should probably look for the best or we're always going to find the worst. Riot's run the world's most popular computer game **in the world** for just slightly over 10 years! And they aren't stopping anytime soon. We should give them some credit, they've managed to keep this game going strong for so long and how? Change.

Here were his issues though: He was literally impossible to win a 1v1 trade with the moment he got a manamune, because it provided him insane sustain for spamming ghouls, he didn't have to build but 1-2 tank items and the passive 5% damage reduction-per-ghoul summoned, along with being able to clone himself to effectively 2v1 at most any time, and late game ult hyper carries for double lives (Cassiopia was the favored back in S2, but has also been used on Kog'Maw, Caitlyn, Vayne etc.) The issue, is Yorick was both incredibly boring and linear to play, and also very one or the other. If you could oppress yorick, he just stopped bringing anything but an ultimate to the table. If you didn't, your entire team couldn't trade with him, because he'd likely gotten too much CDR (Usually frozen heart spirit visage) so that you could just continue to spam ghouls, and stay tanky, stay healthy because his E ghoul was like a 5s cool down, and life-stole for you from a distance. \r\n\r\nWith new Yorick, there are clear periods where you should and should not look to trade with Yorick, his success depends solely on how you choose to play him in lane, as well as how your opponents play against him, and he's impressively balanced in terms of what he does (I think he's a bit on the strong side overall, but the new kit isn't stupid easy to use for the power gain) The way they were able to keep the speed up from ghouls, as well as lane sustain, and some time of AA reset still, but in a different way, and shifting power of all of his skills around was a great balance. I think the wall of souls is an amazingly versatile skill, using it as a trap, just as general terrain, locking your opponents into an arena with you, blocking jungle paths, etc. Tons of uses, as well as clear counter play, although I think they could make the opponents readability of the wall better. The ability to control your ghouls to an extent via use of your E is awesome, and the maiden of the mist (Ult summon) gives Yorick a powerful ult summon still, but in a very different way. At first it was a little wonky to understand how to control the thing, but I realized like ALL Yorick's ghoul control is done via E. It's actually been a really fun kit to use so far.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"set435","date":"2016-09-15T23:21:25.413+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":49,"body":"The moment we trust Riot is when URF is back","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonism","date":"2016-09-15T23:24:37.586+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":3,"body":"URF should be coming back in about 2 weeks","replies":[{"poster":"Mootisma","date":"2016-09-15T23:30:12.742+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":53,"body":"all random isnt the same","replies":[{"poster":"miniZergling","date":"2016-09-15T23:37:31.452+0000","up_votes":75,"down_votes":12,"body":"It's not.

You either do exceptional with him, or you go 0/5 and get flamed at. His kit is original, and it fits well with his lore, the problem about him is that it's very easy to shut him down. The fact that his heal and damage on both his w and his damage on his e was reduced cut him down hard, especially the fact that his cooldowns are way too damn high. Take q at level 3 and then dont level it up until level 13 basically means you're stuck with one of the smallest gap closers that can be interrupted by everything on a 16 second cool down. You go in, you get bursted, and then you cant even dark flight out when you come back from your passive. His ultimate is beautiful, i have no quarrels with it. His e is a hard skillshot to land if you aren't using darkflight to engage to use it at pointblank. The thing with this skillshot is it gets narrower when you use it, but it doesn't do more damage depending on how far it travels (considering it gets harder to hit the narrower it gets it should be a risk/reward thing) you miss it, you lose health, you hit it, you do some low magic damage and get a 3 second slow max rank. which is also on a 9 second cooldown.  I love aatrox with his theme, but his kit either needs hardcore damage buffs or you should rework him. The only thing i suggest is that you keep his core identity, which is that he is a blood god of battle, Keep him as a drain tank, but do something on his other skills so they aren't completely worthless.

The biggest problems with his kit are underlying problems such as a slow animation for his Q- which combined with being easily telegraphed and interruptible makes for a poor ability with too easy counter play. His W demands he is constantly in combat which in laning phase means he will be pushing the wave quickly if he wishes to sustain. His E is his most reliable ability, but even that is plagued with being boring/lackluster and also encourages pushing the wave. Aatrox isn't a really bad kit, but he isn't good against competent opponents. So here are some changes I recommend as a former Aatrox main...\r\n\r\n**GOAL**: Create a rework Aatrox kit that is good in current, but still good and viable in future seasons in addition to bringing more variety of playstyle. NOTE: Values of abilities are up to change from balance department.\r\n\r\n**TL:DR** Passive stays the same. Q stays the same with much buff. His W, E,and Ultimate are reworked. Q and E still cost health but to be determined by balance team by Riot.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: Stays the same\r\n\r\n**Q:ACTIVE: Cost Health on cast:** Faster animation and possibly slightly increased range as it levels. This gives more incentive to level the ability based on the game and role (top vs jungle aatrox). With long base cooldowns and still remaining interruptible (but faster animation than pre-rework) makes it a balanced ability with counterplay and a lot of utility.** COST**: Health\r\n\r\n**W: PASSIVE:** Flat hp gain plus scaling lifesteal based from bonus AD- the ability scaling in potency. Example at lv 1: on hit gain 10 hp + .3 bonus lifesteal (5% of bonus ad). 5% bonus ad for lifesteal does not sound a lot, but late game it rewards heavily to squishy AD heavy builds, while not encouraging pushing the wave too hard in laning phase and doesn't overly reward Aatrox for playing passive.\r\n   ** ACTIVE: Cost Health on cast:** Aatrox swings his blade in a 3 strike flurry. Each hit dealing additional physical damage. Animation being faster based off attack speed.\r\n\r\n**E: ACTIVE: Cost Health on cast:** Aatrox cleaves the area in front of him twice in a cone swinging from side to side dealing physical damage. If a target is hit by both swings they are slowed by 30% for 1.25 seconds. Animation being faster based off attack speed.\r\n\r\n**R: ACTIVE: No cost:** Aatrox bursts into a fury fearing enemies in a nearby (short radius) for 1 second doing damage (base) plus his half current bloodwell. Aatrox and nearby allies also gain 20% attack speed (medium radius).
