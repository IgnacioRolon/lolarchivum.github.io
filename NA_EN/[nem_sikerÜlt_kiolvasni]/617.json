Oh dear, she is such a vital part to this story. After all, we must have our share of females in this story or the sexism claims will shut down our offices! Last time we saw her (Season 2/Episode 8), she was seen with Ekko and she had started her journey to Sector 19. This is where the time flask was located. However, she fell in love with Ekko after a day of traveling with him. Ekko had never been loved before and he had certainly never seen a girl more intriguing. So, they committed adultery a few times a day for the next week or so..._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:245}} _waking up_ \"Oh man... the sky is so.. bright!\"\r\n\r\n_Ekko looks to the left of where he had slept. Soraka is not there._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} _appearing out of a bush_ \"Hey there, baby. Good morning!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:245}} _rubbing his forehead_ \"What the hell happened...?\" \r\n\r\n_He looks a little south of the equator and sees no pants._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:245}} _freaking out_ \"OH MY GOSH. OH F**K. WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Did you just do it with me without even knowing that you were doing it?\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:245}} \"No, no, no, NO! You do NOT understand! I just committed adultery!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"You're just realizing this? By the way, I don't have feelings for you. I'm just using you to escape this crappy life on this stupid island.\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:245}} _suddenly backing up_ \"Holy s**t! This would be my ninth time committing the same crime! AHH!\"\r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Annnnd, this is where I leave you alone.... forever.\" \r\n\r\n{{champion:245}} _moving forward suddenly_ \"What are you talking about?\"\r\n\r\n_Ekko's expression changes and looks like a completely different person. Soraka, who has now dealt with these kinds of people, realizes that he is suffering from the multiple personality disorder._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Fascinating! It seems as if you cannot survive without this time flask. We have to hurry. I don't think you can live for much longer without it.\" \r\n\r\n_Soraka gathers her belongings and helps Ekko up. They both start to walk towards the destination at a decent pace. Soraka grabs Ekko's hand and starts to lead him in the right direction. However, Ekko keeps getting distracted by environment around him. He then lets go of Soraka and backs away, reaching for his timewinder._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:245}} _disgruntled_ \"I hate you so much. How dare you.... you... grab my hand and force me around. I have had enough of this... this... BULLS**T!\"\r\n\r\n_Ekko phase dives toward Soraka and lifts his timewinder up inorder to smack her down with it. However, Soraka swings out her staff with really fast reflexes and blocks his move. They both continue to struggle as one tries to input more force on the collision to knock the other off balance._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:16}} \"Nice try, Ekko: B**ch Edition. I've trained for much longer than you have.\" \r\n\r\n_Soraka smirks and then slides out in between Ekko's legs. She then charges  towards Ekko._ \r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the battlefield...\r\n\r\n{{champion:122}} _killing a nearby soldier_ \"ARRGH!\"\r\n\r\n_Darius stabs the void soldier with his axe and then rips the axe out, causing blood to splurge everywhere. Before moving on to the next soldier, Darius looks at the sky and sniffs twice._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:122}} \"Strange. That can't be right... Hey! We need to get out of here like RIGHT NOW!\"\r\n\r\n_Everyone started moving away from the void ship as they performed their last kills. Then together, they started to run away from the ship to take cover._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:90}} \"Huh? Why is everyone running? Have we really won the battle?\"\r\n\r\n_He looks around._\r\n\r\n{{champion:90}} \"No. That's not it.\"\r\n\r\n_A loud sound can be heard as bomber planes circle the void ship in the sky._\r\n\r\n{{champion:90}} \"Ah. That's why..... OH F**K! THAT'S WHY!\"\r\n\r\n_Before Malzahar could move, the bomber planes dropped tons and tons of bombs at the ship. The explosions rang throughout the island. The big impacts had started mini fires all along the circumference of the impact. Darius looked behind as he ran. He saw the big orange plumes of fire and he could feel the heat of the blasts._ \r\n\r\n{{champion:122}} _panting_ \"Keep running!
