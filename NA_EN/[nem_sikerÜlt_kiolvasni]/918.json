For example: We made Nami identical to Sona and then pushed her ahead in patch 3.14.  When this wasn't enough, we decided to just remove Sona from the game entirely in 4.13.  Later on we made Bard as a copy of Nami and into yet another copy of Sona and after buffs in 4 consecutive patches pushed him ahead of Nami.\"\r\n\r\nDarius - Bottom Line: Nerfed\r\nWhat they said: \" In reality, he’d build damage and die before posing a huge threat (often trading his life for a low-priority target), or stack defenses and become the Wet Noodle of Noxus.\"\r\nWhat they meant: \"We prefer Darius wielding a wet noodle, so we've buffed his tankiness and moved all his damage into a locked passive that is both difficult to use and will be hindered by his teammates' actions.\"\r\nP: Bleeding nerfed, mobility removed\r\nQ: Dmg nerfed, cast time nerfed, bleed nerfed\r\nW: Slow nerfed, Dmg nerfed, CDR nerfed\r\nE: Removed bug = nerfed\r\nR: I hesitate to say this was buffed, as is true of most \"buffs\" Riot does, they make a trade-off that may be potentially heavier than what they give.  Some Riot employee seems to be too fanatical about FMA's 'Equal Exchange', when truth is the balance team doesn't know what \"equal\" looks like.\r\n\r\nGaren - Bottom Line: Nerfed\r\nStats: HP down/Armor up; in other words magic dmg will hurt more now.\r\nQ: CC Duration nerfed, MS duration nerfed\r\nW: Bonus Armor/MR nerfed, Tenacity removed\r\nE: Dmg nerfed\r\nR: Got buffed, but considering his entire kit got gutted, was it rilly rilly worth it?\r\n\r\nSkarner - Bottom Line: Um, what?\r\nP: Riot's attempt at getting players more interested in Dominion, now having a Skarner on your team forces you to play it on Rift.\r\nQ: Damage nerfed\r\nW: Early game nerfed, late game buffed.  This may make jungling difficult, I smell support Skarner A La Nautilus\r\nE: This may actually be a buff as it now applies a stun, but that's probably just a holdover from his old passive\r\nR: Mana cost got buffed, no other notable change\r\n\r\nMordekaiser - Bottom Line: Nerfs from Hell itself\r\nWhat they said: \"while optimizing him as the farming half in a duo-lane.\"\r\nWhat they meant: \"Our writer for this section of the patch notes wrote it while under a rotten seafood-induced nightmare.\"\r\nStats: Overall a nerf\r\nP: Shield strength nerfed, Generation % nerfed\r\nQ: Dmg nerfed, maybe the scaling buff makes up for it? but probably not...\r\nW: Omg, wtf is this?  This change either traps him in the support role permanently or else becomes that one skill you never take until laning ends.\r\nE: Not very noteworthy, it tries to compensate for the nerf to his passive, which it does not.\r\nR: Dmg nerfed, but now you can enslave the dragon, which is cool and all considering he may very well be a support from now on.\r\n\r\nAhri: Riot does what Riot is best known for: nerfing weak champions.  She's already had her dmg nerfed thrice this season and spell ranges nerfed twice, she's become a 2nd-tier champion and I believe the casters of LCS said it right, \"She's not good anymore, just sorta decent.  Only old pros that played her in past seasons will even bother picking her anymore.\"\r\n\r\nLee Sin: Buffs.  Never a good idea for the blind monk.  Mark my words, \"This will not end well.\"\r\n\r\nLucian: Some much-needed buffs.  In the last week of July the 2nd-least banned champ was Sona.  Who was 1st-least?  Lucian.  He's in a bad place and he's gonna need more than just this to get back in the game.\r\n\r\nNami: Buffed as an attempt to catch up to Bard in playability.  Meanwhile Sona remains the unplayable inspiration for both said champions.\r\n\r\nTeemo: Riot swallowed their pride for once and admitted they nerfed him last patch.  The buffs this patch do not make up for those.\r\n\r\nAegis/Locket/Banner: In Riot's continued quest to be the only game in existence that discriminates against auras, it should be to noone's surprise that these 3 items recieve heavy unjustified nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kekyoin347","date":"2015-08-19T20:08:19.614+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"in all honesty as a level 4 {{champion:122}} player personally I am rather annoyed by some these changes. The way it was put was that you either built damage on him and got blown up or you built tank on him and did no damage. I find this very inaccurate because yes, if you go full damage or full tank than one of these might happen, but myself along with many other Darius players I've seen usually build some of both. Early game (unless I am losing lane badly) I usually go for a Hydra, followed by a Sunfire. After that I look at their comp and decide whether my remaining 4 items should be more focused on being tanky or more focused on being damage. With the new Darius, I just feel like they changed some things that either didn't need to be changed or they just nerfed stuff despite the fact that Darius isn't op, although I'm sure low elo will cry otherwise (just like low elo seems to cry that any champion that doesn't take hours of mastery to do well with is clearly op. oh btw I am low elo, but I just get fed up with seeing this shit spewed by other people for no reason). Sure, the Bloodlust passive is useful and I agree that it's a nice buff, but they nerfed the base damage of his q, his primary poking tool, pretty hard. 105 damage to 20 damage, and 50% of that damage for hitting them with the handle? Legit now his q is basically just \"press it to heal yourself but do practically no damage\" instead of \"press it to do good poke damage\". That, and the removal of a bleed stack on hit with handle is another semi-bad nerf. Now, when you e someone in and q, you won't get ANY BLEED STACKS because the e will pull them next to you (unless you aa them, in which case you'll get one stack). The only way now to get a q stack if you pull someone in with e is you have to wait and watch until they are exactly in range of the blade and then q, hoping that they don't just use a gap closer to get out quickly. Yes, he got a heal on q, but I don't think that compensates for all the other crap they pushed to the ground on him. Anyways, now I'll be moving on to his w, in all honesty the main thing I have to say about this one is there's pretty much no point in even maxing it now. At every single rank it does the same thing with no changes. Old w the amount of damage done increased per rank, so there was a reason to rank it up. But now, legit there's pretty much no difference between his w at rank one and at rank five. At the very least they did give him an increased slow on it, which I do appreciate. (By the way, I want to say for his w I'm not necessarily mad at but just confused by, like I'm mainly just saying \"the change on w just makes it so that now maxing w is sort of pointless\") Alright, looking now at his e, I got to say, this change probably made me the happiest. After seeing the nerfs on q and the confusing change on w I let out a sigh of relief/happiness at seeing the e change. The new slow is rather helpful, as now you can slow them with e so you can slow them with w, which is a nice new little combo. And the reduced cast time is nice, so that now the e is more likely to pull in someone on the edge of the range of it before they can walk, dash, etc. out of it. And lastly but not my least favorite change (q wins by a landslide on that one) is the ult change. I originally said here that it was a problem because you ran out of mana dunking in a teamfight before level 16, but apparently I was mistaken, as subsequent ults don't cost mana. Shoutout to Hyourinkaze for pointing that out.\n\nAlright, a long-af post like this needs a tl;dr.\n\ntl;dr Some of these Darius changes are nice, but some of them are bad or just make no sense.\n\nOh, one final thing: this is a Bronze 4 opinion. I'm not saying this thinking Riot is going to suddenly bow to my every whim and change him back. Chances are that these Darius changes are here to stay and I just wasted >25 min writing this. But I wanted to speak out what I think. If you agree, awesome. If you don't, then feel free to tell me why. Most likely there are perspectives or arguments I haven't thought of, so I'd be glad to hear them (as long as they aren't hate-filled or insulting).
