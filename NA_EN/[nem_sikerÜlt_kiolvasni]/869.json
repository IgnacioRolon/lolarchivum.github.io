They seem to have come out and absolutely destroyed teams whenever they've had adequate preparation (EL week 1, first match vs SK, last match vs H2K). Unfortunately I expect SK to roll over UOL, but who knows what will happen with that team. NA IMO will be a bit closer and harder to predict with Liquid finally looking like they know what they want to play, but I still expect C9 to take it 3-2. TIP vs TSM will be interesting seeing as TSM may not be ale to afford to leave Dyrus alone like they often do as Impact and Rush look to be the strongest part of TIP's lineup.","replies":[{"poster":"crocoroar","date":"2015-04-08T02:07:02.663+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah C9 will beat Curse 3-0 and TSM will beat LMQ 3-2 :P","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-08T13:46:42.239+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"You know until LMQ (lol TiP) Rush over Bjergerking with an aggressive and farm heavy XwX.

Snake has been mediocre in terms of playstyle. I firmly agree with OHminus about the Vici peaking. They have just recently started to look like they could contend for top 2 CN. \n\nMy beef with these rankings are  TSM's rank. Jeez please get off the IEM Koolaid. It is getting old to see people say \"well TSM won IEM, TSM is the best team in the world\". \n\nNext  Yoe Flash Wolves and Fnatic's rankings. Actually, everything from 12 down. All of those rankings are fubar and Riot should feel bad about them.  If you are going to have TSM/C9 up that high. H2K (best team EU?) up there as well. SK maybe, but their style is going to be completely outclassed come international play (its sad right EU Fanboys). And Fnatic, may not see much of international play if they don't take Semis seriously.\n\nOverall I agree with some of the rankings.
