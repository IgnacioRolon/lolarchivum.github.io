I'm of the opinion with some of these games modes \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" and while there were a few \"OP\" so to speak champs in URF, that was okay to me. All the champs were \"OP\" it was sort of the point of the mode and it was a blast. It would again feel watered down if it came back with tons of changes, some f the features removed, random stuff added to keep champs from being OP etc.","replies":[{"poster":"CG SereN","date":"2014-10-30T05:31:35.702+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can back the 6v6 thing. As someone who got to play it back when it was a glitch in the system, when it was announced officially, all I could think was 'Meh, guess i'll play a few games' and never got into it. URF I had fun every game I played, and am excited for it to come back. Dominion/Ascenion, I'd care less If I never see those again. So hearing that they will be changing URF makes me sad really, because I only got to play two games as Sona before she got banned haha (unless the change is to get rid of permabanned champs and incorporate draft-bans) -URF Sona 2015!\r\n\r\nPS- Its also disheartening to see that Dominion is still a permanent mode, but something that everyone thoroughly enjoyed is limited to a few appearances a year.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Quad","date":"2014-10-29T19:17:32.140+0000","up_votes":148,"down_votes":4,"body":"*Inset comment here about begging for URF back.\r\nGuys Riot said they are actually bringing it back but just patching it all up first!
