Let me understand this. You (Riot) are introducing 5 bans for everyone. But giving no ban strategy because it doesn't matter? \n\nThis defeats the whole purpose of drafting. Just let it be teambuilder ranked now. You say solo queue vs competitive has different needs but ban strategy is a very real thing for having insight into what the enemy team wants to ban. If we go through this then let us have mirror matchs.\n\n\nI feel like this is Riot wanting to push it because they said they would instead of pushing something that is balanced/strategic.\n\nSure at low ELO it doesn't matter, people will ban who they don't want to play against.\nOnce you start climbing strategy is obviously more important. Why would we agree to that? \n\nSay we go into a game:\n\n- Everyone decides we want to play a protect the Kog'maw comp\n- Team A (Protect) bans divers/assassin\n- Team B on the other hand someone just dislikes Kog'Maw\n- Team B bans whatever + Kog'maw\n- Team A is now at a disadvantage because the comp they wanted to play is now absolutely worthless and their bans don't matter anymore.\n\nThis is a huge step backwards for the game in terms of strategy.\n\nAlso would like to point out that the difference in competitive vs regular could be confusing/throw people off from wanting to get into League.\n\nExample:\nLeague of Legends is presented that this is the way it is played/drafted. \nHey cool I like the way they do it and play, maybe I will try it out.\nSign-up/Download League and the drafting is nothing like I saw.\n\nA) Stick it out and make do until I finally realize I don't like the way I was misinformed/lead to believe the game was.\nB) Immediately go back to what I was playing or find something else because it is not what I thought it would be.\n\nOf course you could always have the casters preface every pick/ban phase for new players:\n\"This is a different ban phase than what you will normally have because competitive gameplay has different needs than you scrubs.\" ","replies":[{"poster":"Towstie","date":"2017-05-19T19:18:51.889+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is hardly a \"tl;dr\", but thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mumuyyy","date":"2017-05-19T19:21:24.628+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":14,"body":"Your statement is probably valid for very-high elo, or ranked 5s.

Not being able to respond to the enemy drafting phase isn't good for the health of the game. Overall I just feel that it leads to \"dumbing\" the game down and like my last \"tldr\" pointed out that it will decrease the quality of players. \n\nYou hear people mention that the professional players now are vastly superior to the old for the most part because over-all there is more game knowledge. It's also a fact that it's because other people are better so they can improve even more. \n\nIf the quality of each phase is increased (IE pick/ban being important) then the over-all gameplay is improved and you get better players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Harvey Rabbit","date":"2017-05-20T05:01:43.887+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're implying that players in lower elo don't try to exercise any strategy in the alternating ban phase, that isn't true at all.

They aren't going to be confused by the fact that champion select is a little different, just the same way they aren't confused that not every game is a Bo3, that Ryze is the worst solo queue champion in the game, that there isn't any cheering crowds when they play, that they don't have to shake hands with their opponents when they finish the game. Those differences aren't going to make them quit League. You're delusional if you think that champ select is the thing that catches the interest of casual viewers.

So, even if 4 bans are duplicates, we're still at the same old 6 bans and everyone will be happy because they got to ban what they wanted. Either way, the same 6 champs would have been banned.\r\n\r\nI think that once you lock in a ban, it could show up for both teams, but this would just cause people to wait until the last second before banning in hopes that someone else on the other team would ban the champion they plan on banning.
