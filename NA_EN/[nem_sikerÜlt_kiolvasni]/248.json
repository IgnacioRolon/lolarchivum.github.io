We expect Quarters and Semis to sell out so if you’d like to attend, we recommend that you purchase when they go on sale on Friday. All Playoffs ticket sales are final and no refunds will be issued.","replies":[{"poster":"Chasmweaver","date":"2018-02-28T22:53:59.082+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why don't you guys ever come to Austin, Texas? We are an IT Hub, SXSW in March is a music and Multimedia event that is a perfect time to get hype for NALCS, Venues are man and cheap, plus unlike other major cities it is central so people can drive from all over the state easily. Consider it please.","replies":[{"poster":"merfdiezel","date":"2018-03-01T00:36:32.149+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Chasmweaver,\r\nI agree with your points regarding Austin's viability as an IT hub and cultural center (with an accessible central-Texas location, to boot). I've been there myself and can personally attest to the vibrancy of the local community. We also know that we have plenty of passionate fans down in Texas to whom we'd love to bring the NA LCS; however, many factors come into play when choosing a location for Finals, as detailed in RiotChopper's Quick Notes (https://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/quick-notes-where-na-lcs-finals-will-be), and though we haven't been able to bring NA LCS to Austin as of 2018, we have not ruled out Austin or Texas out as a possible future road show location. Thanks for your feedback, and for being a fan of the NA LCS!\r\n\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ItsFreakinHarry","date":"2018-03-02T03:16:44.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lets hope this isnt as terrible as the Finals sales went... best of luck to those trying to get a ticket","replies":[]}]}
