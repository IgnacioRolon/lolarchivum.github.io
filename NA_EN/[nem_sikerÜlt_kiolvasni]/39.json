You probably won't really understand needing someone to relate to in your games until you yourself fall into a social group that isn't represented.\nPlus, announcing he is gay is not defining him by his sexuality. He's defined by his fall from grace and ascent to becoming an Aspect.  Lucian is more defined by his straight sexuality with his vengeance for his wife than Taric would be if he was announced as gay.

Sure, he's got stereotypical aspects to him, but then, so does everyone else. Taric is a man who was a high ranking official in the army. He fell from his position because he valued life and beauty above warmongering.

His lore is about his actions as a defamed elite of the Demacian military who becomes a god, so of course his sexuality doesn't fit because it isn't relevant to his actions as a Demacian or an Aspect. His being gay is purely tertiary to who he is as a champion, just something to make him more human. I want him to be gay because of this, because it isn't linked to his actions or his feats. I want him to be gay because he is a hero, and if he's gay like I am, I can be proud of that, even if it does fall on some stereotypes (though, they don't detract from him or make him a laughingstock in the way that gay tropes are normally presented.)","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-04-07T21:58:01.816+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"from my pov most players just see him as a gay joke more than anything already","replies":[{"poster":"RetroNitro","date":"2016-04-07T22:44:08.251+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":31,"body":"From my point of view you are not well educated.
