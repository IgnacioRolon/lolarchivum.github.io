Making an essay like that takes a lot of time, energy and effort. I also learned a lot while watching the video, even though I have been playing since before Thresh was released. Hence the decision to share it! \r\n\r\nI know not everything will be everyone's cup of tea, but being constructive in your feedback is always better for an artist. It helps them grow, and learn to improve. \r\n\r\nThanks for watching this episode. :) ","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZombieXD50","date":"2017-06-24T07:32:50.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys it's me Jeremy ","replies":[{"poster":"Add Me After","date":"2017-06-24T13:38:19.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"*cringe*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lemon tiddies","date":"2017-06-24T13:19:15.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He just did a reboot of his content creation, I actually like his videos now because they aren't what they used to be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DiabloThreeLolol","date":"2017-06-23T22:46:15.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"P-please stop yelling at me.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot swimbananas","date":"2017-06-24T00:29:14.656+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not trying to...

I have really admired bard's horn design for a long time, but when I looked up cosplays to see what had been created none of them really hit the mark to me, I took advantage of 2 art classes to make this (u don't want to see the first one, its sooo bad.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teslyn","date":"2017-06-24T01:40:56.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not that.  i have seen this before when lolking did summoner showcase revival and Kat Andrusco began... she too was very forceful in the way she did the show.

Also, I mentioned it before but, they used that \"Gaming Curios\" guy in a good way, so they have lost all credibility, and I probably won't continue to watch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrHefe","date":"2017-06-26T21:13:00.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did she... just call us nerds......{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} {{item:3083}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"JacksonTheTerror","date":"2017-06-26T14:05:35.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still have some work to do on your showmanship but, if you do I think you have the potential to make a real skill out of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"confLUX OR AFK","date":"2017-06-26T00:08:05.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss Nikasaur, bring her back!","replies":[]},{"poster":"IonicWind","date":"2017-06-25T20:34:39.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feels old when you remember the 1st Summoner Showcase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DistressedLegend","date":"2017-06-25T20:25:48.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:42}} yt\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chuck the Elf","date":"2017-06-24T05:21:22.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like what you're doing here, but frankly I preferred All Chat.
