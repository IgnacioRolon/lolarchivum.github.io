Standard carry has 9 from runes, and since we mention Jinx, we'll use her base armor at max! That's 82.4, which is 91.4 in total. That's 39% ignored, which is 55.754, minus 20 is 35.754, divide it by 135.754 (Formula for Mr and Armor is Armor/MR divided by 100+Armor/MR respectively.). That's about 26.33% reduced damage. With a cleaver, you reduce the base by 30%, which is 63.98, then the 39%, which is ~39.03, minus 20, that's 19.03. Formula again gives us about 16% reduced damage. That means a Cleaver gives you 10% of your base damage more. You have to hit an enemy 6 fricken times to ONLY get a 10% damage boost against a squishy. Saying Jinx would be crying is silly since she'd be dead in 2 Q's regardless of a cleaver. \n\nCleaver would be fine against a tank, but on Varus when you have CDR boots and Ghostblade, you have 30% CDR and your Q is going to hit for chunks. You could easily get a BT for proper sustain and more damage without wasting 10% CDR and being incapable of stacking that passive properly. Varus without AS can't really stack a Cleaver well.

Cleaver would be good against the tanks, but as I showed the math up above, at max level, a squishy carry with 30% reduced armor with the 39% ignore and 20 ArP already only gives about 10% boosted damage.

These posts should recognize that solo queue (regardless of if you're bronze 5 or challenger) and ranked 5s in the LCS are completely different. Many LCS teams run champion picks and builds that are tailored around very specific team comps. In solo queue, people should really avoid playing varus mid every game if they want to have a consistently solid team comp as he is a rather gimmicky pick. If you want to main him, go ahead, but you'll never fit into as many teams as an annie mid main. \r\n\r\nThe reason he doesn't fit into comps all that well is because he's an AD mid and unlike the other AD mid laners that are viable, he doesn't have good split pushing. Xerath works very similar to him, except Xerath is AP so he fits better into most teams.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong though. If you have a sejuani jungle and a rumble top, Varus mid could work quite well. Just be careful with what comp you throw him into as a mid laner. \r\n\r\nAgain, feel free to main whatever you want, but just understand that there are many other champions with similar play styles that are simply more viable because they fit better into more team comps.
