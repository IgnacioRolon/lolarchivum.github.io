After which their usual trashiness returned promptly despite maintaining the entire roster and (I believe) staff that got them 2nd place finish at MSI* (footnote that MSI is a small sample size of teams so 2nd place finish isn't as impressive, especially when considering that CLG managed to avoid playing the 2 best teams at the tournament in quarters). Most people who watched NA summer and summer playoffs are in concordance that CLG was not in the top 3 of NA. Coming into the group they were not projected to make it out by most accounts, but upon seeing the implosion of G2 (who could've foreseen the vacationers sucking balls again) CLG's chances of making it out of groups actually became very real. They wasted almost no time punting said chance away. Being able to dick down ROX like they did week 1 meant they had the theoretical capability to make it out of groups. Unfortunately, they couldn't help but succumb to their true calling of being trash, and found themselves in the trash next yillian's old jersey. If I were a CLG fan, I would be pretty fed up with how ass they are. Legit straight booty cheeks. Also you say having a hard couple of years (plural) like this isnt only season 6.
