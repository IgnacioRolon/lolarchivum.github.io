I suggest using the legacy client to select your summoner name then head back:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope it helps but let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
