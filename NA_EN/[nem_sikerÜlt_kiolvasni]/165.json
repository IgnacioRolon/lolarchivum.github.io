I tried sending a \"lost password\" to my email and didn't get anything, so I tried \"forgot username\" too, which came up empty. The match history shows that my account has been used, by someone other than me.\r\n\r\nI sent in a support ticket already (filling out the question, attaching emails with riot point purchase and a previous support ticket showing my username, game name, and email) but the only way for me to look at it is to log into the account, which obviously is my issue to begin with so I can't add new info/see if it has been assigned to someone. The automated message said there is a high volume of tickets and may take a little longer.\r\n\r\nSo how long should I wait (I have heard it may take 1-7 days)?","replies":[{"poster":"3141592ab","date":"2016-09-15T23:24:52.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It took about 4 days for them to first get back to me then another few days to fully recover the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-15T15:50:30.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have any information to look up your ticket, but it may take a bit to receive a response depending on the size of the queue for the day.  If you filled out the recovery form, the ticket will be escalated to our account team who will be able to help you out.  If the form was not filled out then it may take a little more time to review everything.  Make sure not to keep replying to the ticket though, as it can bump you back to the bottom.
