With the only clear top picks being Elise and Gnar, those two can be traded in pick/ban and each team will still hold at least one target ban.

If anything that seems worse. At least when you trade super strong jungler for super strong jungler, it's an even trade for both teams. Trading super strong jungler for super strong top laner just warps the top lane matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2016-09-29T17:16:58.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's better because by trading Rek'Sai or Gragas bans the second squad no longer automatically received a power duo like Sivir/Karma. Now, when there is (theoretically) only one clear S-tier in a given lane, it means teams can opt to either leave it open to trade the S-tier pick or ban it out and force an even pick/counter-pick from the A-tier for that position. It isn't much of a difference, but it at least gives teams an extra tool to work with in pick/ban. \n\nAt the very least, having less than two power picks no longer locks you into a binary choice between one or the other. It allows for a lot more flexibility in terms of pocket picks and slot variety. It should also split the ban priority between the two positions so that teams can pick where to put their power. If we see Elise get traded for a Gnar pick/ ban in every game, so be it. At least we aren't 100% guaranteed to see the same matchup in every single game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Count Buffon","date":"2016-09-29T15:36:07.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was it really a goal to have no Gragas at all?
