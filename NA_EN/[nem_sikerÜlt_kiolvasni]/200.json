Split finals for each region, Worlds, MSI, and, to a lesser degree, Rift Rivals satisfy that itch thoroughly. What we need is more fun, silly things. Things for us to watch and laugh at, things to remind the pros that this is a game and it can be fun.\n\nI didn't even watch last All-Stars. I had had enough hyper-competitive League and simply was not interested. I've watched every all-stars where they had all the silly events. Because those are a fun change of pace.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RumbleStew","date":"2018-04-03T23:18:10.364+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you enjoyed the show.

It's how we had some interesting matters like Ibai vs Quickshot or even Rusty vs YamatoCannon; both all stars references but the point stands. I can imagine each year is a bit of a strain, especially with every region having their own thing to put on the table. But I do have to admit: ASE would be the place to produce the more heated showmatches whatever they may be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-04-07T03:22:59.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NA > EU","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penta Ace","date":"2018-04-04T16:10:20.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was very funny.
