Though I want Omega Squad everything. Omega Squad Teemo was one of the best skins Riot has come out with lately, and it actually made sense unlike some more recent skins (looking at you, Lunar Revel Cait and Morg).\r\n\r\nI feel like Royal Guard Jhin would be awesome too, a great counterpart to Fiora's. They're both rather artsy, though in completely different ways.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm just imagining Cosmic Jhin's ult turning the ground within the targeting reticle into a galaxy, and his trap doing the same. Ooh, and his skillshot being a shooting star.\r\n\r\nSo many bright ideas that could be made for Jhin, but I doubt any of them will be made because Riot will probably make another Cait/Lee/*insert the champs who already have a thousand skins that keep getting even more here* skin before Jhin ever gets a decent one after High Noon. And by decent, I mean not something that just looks like a recolor of his classic.\r\n\r\nThey need to stop playing favorites and work those creative minds on champions who haven't gotten skins in a long time. Warwick, for instance, would have been perfect for this Lunar Revel. And Casseopeia. Like, seriously Riot. Those two need good new skins, and they wasted the perfect opportunity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crysi102","date":"2016-01-28T00:52:16.249+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Arctic Ops Jhin instead of just Frozen Jhin?
