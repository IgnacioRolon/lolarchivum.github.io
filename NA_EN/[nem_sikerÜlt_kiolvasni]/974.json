From there, I used a triangle generator tool which randomly creates triangles in places where you click on the image. The more you click, the more triangles will spawn from that point. I focused larger triangles on the edges of the image and smaller triangles around the shapes of the figure. \r\n\r\nOnce it got close to what I wanted, I used Illustrator to crop off the weird triangular edges and to fine tune (manually changing shapes and colors).\r\n\r\nGood luck with your project!
