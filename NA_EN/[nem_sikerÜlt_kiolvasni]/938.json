It was so dead, and so few people were playing it, that they could actually queue up in the general population and get matches against each other reliably all the time. \r\n\r\nSo, honestly, the ranked ladder on TT wasn't worth anything because so few people were there that it was being taken over by cheaters.

As for the reason that treeline has such a small community Riot you only have yourself to blame on that. 3's has always been restricted to either normals or team ranked we donlt get any of the cool features like draft pick in normals or being able to go solo in ranked, and because of that there is no real draw of new players to the game mode it just exists.  I have even had people I know try out treeline for the first time after they hit 30 never played it before because there is literally no promotion of the mode and they couldn't believe that there was such an interesting and different way to play league.

Riot seems to play lip-service to this when many people are pretty bored with it. \r\n\r\nThis is where all of the calls for new game modes being made permanent came from (hello \"give us URF back!\" crowd) and constant frustration with the player-bleed due to no support for Dominion and Treeline. Hell I know a guy who quit when he found out Magma Chamber was officially scrapped. \r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that Riot/Ten-Cent's sustainability plans simply involve appealing to new players as they age-in to target age-bracket rather than trying to expand demographic appeal through new modes. Which makes a certain amount of sense given market-saturation in the field. \r\n\r\nWhy I don't understand is why, instead of doing belabored maintenance on supposedly dying game-modes they don't try to reinvigorate them through promotion? Why not have official tournaments or rewards for the mode? A lot of irregulars logged into Dominion queue when it was announced it was being shuttered simply to see if they could get that icon(despite it being fairly clear from the announcement that that wasn't an option)! Or maybe a segment on unofficial tourneys by professionals for Prime Time League? Or pro-play events being broadcast by the Esports team?\r\n\r\nI'm not saying any of this would necessarily work, and it's totally possible that a mode can die and people who haven't give up will be disappointed. It's just extremely frustrating to see a mode die to Riot seemingly not caring about the mode. \r\n\r\nSaying that a mode is shrinking and maybe should have been a rotating mode both ignores it's history(it was popular enough to warrant a map-rework at one point!) and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because who wants to put in the time to learn a mode that is apparently slated for the chopping block?\r\n\r\nIt's saying to the Treeline populace \"beatings will continue until morale improves\".
