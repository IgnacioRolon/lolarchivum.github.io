You don't know if someone is joking or not, as I've had more than my fair share of people that say this and mean it. \n\nI'm not saying you should just give up cause up some douche, but it gets old, and when no less than half the time, the person acting a fool in champ select is the one that acts the same in game, you just sigh and start expecting what is normal, and don't keep thinking \"maybe this time they won't act a fool.\" when that didn't work the last few hundred times.\n\nsure you might want to win, but when acting or saying something stupid puts your team mates off, they are less likely to gank for you, less likely to heal/shield you, less likely to respond or take your advice even when it turns out good, then you are more likely to lose. If you want to win, then perhaps even jokingly telling people you are going to feed isn't the best idea.

Honestly, the only thing the Tribunal needed was showing the statistics of the game, like the Advanced Match History that we can view at the end of every game now. If the Tribunal came back with showing the Advanced Match History of the game in question as its only addition, I guarantee that it will reduce the toxicity of this game.\r\n\r\nThink about it, with that addition, you could see someone's build order, where they died, how many times they died, and their chat log. Someone would literally have to be blind or not looking at the case at all to determine whether the person getting punished was trolling/intentionally feeding/being toxic or not.

Constantly yelling and cursing and saying some ridiculous stuff until I muted him.\n\nThe next two games I somehow got stuck with the same duo two games in a row. One jungled, the other played adc. They were making some way over the top racist jokes in champ select, telling people to F off cause they asked them to stop, then at the end of both games they would suddenly switch from trying to completely trolling and intentionally feeding.\n\nThe jungler would stand under the enemy team inhib turret and start spamming dance, then when we asked what he was doing he and his friend would start asking us what we were talking about in chat, trying to act like the three of us were making stuff up, since ya know...most punishment come from chat, and they weren't being as bad chat wise in the actual game, but were in game at least, very clearly intentionally feeding and trolling.\n\n\n\nI get people who go afk at 20 minutes because the team won't surrender, or someone who starts feeding because \"the game is already lost\" because someone might have died 4-5 times in 25 minutes, etc. I would say the percentage of games with excessive harassment is closer to 50% easily, especially when people start going on tilt. It is maybe 30% in winning games, but like 60% in losing games if not more.\n\n2% is a complete joke and an outright lie, unless Riot is actually only counting non-draft mode normals, aram, or bot games.

Is this for the tournament realm client globally? while sure racist, homophobic or sexist language is low because that requires knowledge of who you are playing with/against but there is way more then 2% excessive harassment. In over 10% of my Coop vs AI games there is \"excessive harassment\" I am lucky to get in a normal draft game where a player you can tell is rank/chat restricted because he will say one line every 5 minutes and it will be an insult about 30% of the time. Another 50% just have some guy on tilt getting pissed (at least I assume, I really hope he just isn't a troll) and the other 20% is actually nice... I would really like to see how you get the numbers considering you don't even look at reports considering you use an automated system now.\r\n\r\nIf you want people to be positive, not just neutral, make rewards for only the **positive** players, make use out of those stupid ribbons that you only see once every 50 games anyway people have over 500 \"teamwork\" and never been chat restricted. Make a \"reward\" for losing so the people who just lost a game doesn't feel like they wasted an hour of their lifes even if it is something small because guess what? 50 IP is useless when you unlocked everything and have over 50K IP. \r\n\r\nMe personally I say gj (good job) whenever my team makes a play and mb (my bad) when my team mistake that isn't my fault because I don't want to see them fight. But you know what, if they do we have a nice feature in the game called the *Mute* feature where you ether type \"mute *player name or ALL*\" or click on the microphone symbol when you press tab (by default) for the scoreboard. This would be the best way to combat negative language and allow you to focus on other stuff like what people complain about all the time. The trolls who intentionally feed or afks or someone picks AD Ziggs first time Ziggs in diamond 1 elo then goes 0-10-0. Like just create a video that randomly takes place (and forces you to watch) in the client after games (like say after every 5 or 10 games) to demonstrate how to use the mute button and block feature (the client version of the mute button). \r\n\r\nI hope my points are clear.

I was really excited when Team Builder was being talked about, and then super let down when they made you pick a champion and didn't implement anything for Draft or Ranked for just **picking roles.  **These are such easy basic things that if they happened, THEN I would be more inclined to believe that bs 2% number they are throwing out there, because I know most game negativity starts there.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, having a **Loss Forgiven Voting System **at the end of game when you play a game where someone on the other team Rage Quits or DC's would make a HUGE difference in players attitudes towards each other and actually give the community the ability to show **positive behavior towards each other **without having to do much or go out of their way.  Imagine playing a game where you get your win, and the other team doesn't have to be penalized because a **Loss Forgiven Vote** comes up because they have had a missing player for a third of the total game time?\r\n\r\nCan you imagine how great it would be if we had these tools and systems in place in the game to actually ENJOY ourselves rather than 'hope for the best' and maybe you won't get a troll on tilt being salty all game for your fifth game in a row?  Do you notice how those terms are so popular and thrown around rather than terms that describe positive people?\r\n\r\nI've played over 8 thousand games of League, yeah I live and love this game.  I own every skin you can and almost everything in game.  Hell, I wish I worked for Riot.  That would be epic.  I say all this just to legitimize that I can attest with all the rest here, the League Community is comparatively atrocious to most any other game community out there in how players talk and treat each other.  I know for a FACT most of my games have consistent negative behavior in them, and I personally strive to be as positive as possible under those circumstances.  I'd really like to see awesome ideas like this implemented in my League to hit the real 'root' of player behavior and circumvent the rampant bad behavior we all see and know really exists.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2015-03-25T06:27:55.956+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've played since quite some time before season 1 and I can honestly say the toxic levels in this game get worse every year. \n\nI applaud Riot for putting forth such extreme efforts to curb toxic behavior but whatever you're doing it's making it worse. Your punishments create multiple accounts, new players have to deal with them. Pre lvl 30 essentially IS a prisoners island, and guess what happens to the new players that have to go through that cesspool? They pick up off the worst of the worst in the community and are likely to come out toxic themselves. \n\nYou ban peoples accounts for verbal reasons and send them to smurfs. I've said this several times over the years, you're perpetuating the problem.\n\nI play WoT and account bans are super super rare which are for instances of cheating, botting etc. You know what happens to people that are verbally abusive? They get a temp chat ban (24 hrs) then 3 days, then 7, then a month, then 6 months, then permanent. You know what the result is? The toxic levels in that game is peanuts. The punishment system for verbal offenses is verbal punishments, and even then they're super lenient yet over the years it's fostered a long term improving environment.\n\nStop banning accounts for verbal reasons, ban people from chat for verbal reasons. Ping spam? Restrict people to being able to use all but the MIA ping, abuse that? Take it entirely. But STOP account banning over verbal reasons. You're only sending these players down to harass new players in a MUCH worse manner on accounts they don't care for. This community is 1000x more toxic than it used to be. Also 1-30 is 1000x worse since new players that are positive are usually run off the game if not hiding in bots. Oh and that makes the ones that DO want to PVP suffer that much worse of an environment as others literally hide in bot games from your prisoners island. So instead they often have to deal with bot accounts on their own teams when this happens!","replies":[{"poster":"linkblade91","date":"2015-03-25T17:43:27.164+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have to agree with this person.

Pro players like Dyrus have already complained that ping spams ruin the experience and are incredibly annoying due to their nature and how you cant squelch them. And since, if a person is using their INCREDIBLY limited to praise a player (to more quickly get their account back into a 'positive' standing through that), they use up their 'ammo' to communicate important things. Pinging things like Dragon/Baron/Other objectives with just a ny of the ping types don't actually or accurately portray what they player is trying to say. Specifically if a chat restricted player sees an enemy take dragon and they want to report to the team about the timer on drag (if vision isn't available, so the timer itself won't start ticking). Turns out, they won't be able to since, ya know, they're chat restricted.\r\n\r\nAnd since we're doing all this, horrendously repeated, talk of rewards, reforms, and punishment, none of it matter! Tribunal is still down and hasn't come back up. As someone who has willingly received one report and ONE warning about being negative, and being slammed with both ranked AND chat restriction, I know that its based upon the number of reports recived and, not at all, about the accuracy of the reports! It's just an automatic witchhunt of a system that is currently broken and won't get fixed with the tribunal no matter how many false reports and 'labels' you put down on players (aka, majority players are neutral, etc.). Its click-bait and filler of false information to just make one believe the game has gotten a lot better than previously. I'd rather see 'punishment' go out to people who are making bot accounts and adding everyone constantly instead of toxic people that I can just mute.\r\n\r\nBut I guess for now I'll continue to get into a game and under 10 minutes in am asked 'who I bought my account from' and 'to uninstall' because I'm having a bad game but have a great skin....yet I'm the one who gets reported and restricted while others go untouched.

For example, If you were playing basketball game and some dude says, pass me the ball everytime or i'm going to go score for them you would simple not play with them.\r\n\r\nIn league you don't have that option.. You are either stuck with that person for 20mins + of you have the option to dodge/afk but get punished for it and that is why people are toxic because they are helpless to do anything against people going out of their way to waste your time because they didn't get a position they wanted or just troll to troll.\r\n\r\nSimple Fix.  When you mute someone make it to were they can't see what you type so that way you can let off steam but they can't read it. Why they can still read what you say even though you mute them is beyond me but chat options is the way to combat toxicity since that is where it all goes down.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you can't change human nature as easily as you can add chat options.
