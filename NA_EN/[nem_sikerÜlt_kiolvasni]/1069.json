C9 would have been fare better off with a Jarven pick in game 1 vs TSM. And way better off with a lulu pick in game 2. I think the same thing about them at worlds last year.

As someone who did watch the games, and someone familiar with out rankings of this type works i am disappointed. At least half of the NA teams could beat Team Liquid under favorable conditions...and any of them can beat any other one under certain conditions. Your job when ranking isn't supposed to be \"oh well anyone can beat anyone..because 80% of the teams are 1-1.\" Your job when ranking is taking those performances and analyzing the strengths of every single player and every single team and how those players work together and compare them to each other.  \r\n\r\nThe any team can beat any team can apply to literally anything. Have we forgotten C9 and TSM in their games last year at worlds? They were certainly the worse team and could and WERE ranked lower than the Samsung teams...but they took a game. Just because some teams lost (c9) and some teams won (the rest of them) doesn't mean you couldn't actually make a list of the order of team strength. At the VERY LEAST you could of done the top 3 and then said \"the rest.\"\r\n\r\nAll that being said, i dont' think Team Liquid should be above Fanatic. While i'm part of that NA>EU bullshit, i do think that Fanatic beat better teams. \r\n\r\nWhile i think Elements (formerly Alliance) is going to be great, i don't think they are great right now. I was very unimpressed when watching their games...and again i'm surprised they are on your top 20 teams.  \r\n\r\nFinally...poor TA. 7-0 and still worse than most teams in the world. lol Dat weak region tho.

Keith filled in fine for Piglet (who returns Wk 2). Fenix on watch; had weak laning vs XWX, curious how he'll do against other lane-dominant mids (see Bjergsen)\n\n2) CLG - Aphromoo almost carried them back into the game vs TL. More or less rolled T8. No zionspartan makes a rather large difference in opposing teams' gameplans. Could swap with TSM, but CLG > T8 > TSM.\n\n3) TSM - Live and die by Bjergsen. This clearly showed in Week 1's games. Solo'd Hai in the c9 game and snowballed from there. Against T8, Santorin camped mid, but Slooshi8 fought through and crushed with Orianna.  Giving them benefit of the doubt. Need other players to step up. Will be in trouble if it's just the Bjergsen Show.\n\n4) TIP - Rush overextended in game against TL and had a few costly errors. He held back against Dignitas in a much cleaner game. Rhux/Apollo played well, team gets Impact back for Week 2. Rush, the primary shotcaller, is the big sleeper here. \n\n5) Gravity - Dismal against WFX due to a really fed Fizz + camp on Keane in mid lane. Solid backline dives against C9 and took advantage of C9's immobility. \n\n6) Cloud 9 - Solid leads in early game against both TSM/GV. Sneaky looks great, rest of roster appeared to have hit their ceilings. Going to err on side of caution and not underestimate them despite the 0-2. Could definitely drop next week pending performance. \n\n7) Coast - Big lead against Dig thrown away ultimately during a poor Baron call. Impaler looks good, Cris played well. Smart ganks against Flaresz during WFX games. Want to put them over C9, but loss against Dig is a blemish.\n\n8) Team 8 - Destroyed by Gnarvan wombo against CLG, stayed tough against TSM. Strength of schedule gives them the nod over WFX. If they can consistently repeat their Week 1 performance against TSM, will bump these guys up.\n\n9) WFX - Rolled over Gravity but somewhat slow to close-out the game. Dropped to CST in equally convincing fashion. Needs more polish, will eventually get Avalon/Helios/Imagine in starting roster. I expect these guys to climb.\n\n10) Dignitas - Barely scratched by CST, trampled by a very controlled TIP teamfight comp. Crumbzz needs to make a bigger impact next week to snowball his carries/solos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Golthurnahl","date":"2015-01-28T18:58:30.083+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team Liquid is theoretically undefeatable.\r\n\r\nIf you take the results of the first ten matches that have been played, and you assume that if team A beat team B and team B beat team C, then team A should be able to beat team C, TL should win against every other NA LCS team based on the matches so far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Golthurnahl","date":"2015-01-28T18:58:08.632+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Team Liquid is theoretically undefeatable.**\r\n\r\nIf you take the results of the first ten matches that have been played, and you assume that if team A beat team B and team B beat team C, then team A should be able to beat team C, **TL should win against every other NA LCS team** based on the matches so far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fsis1111","date":"2015-01-28T02:20:33.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"None of western team made to top 10..
