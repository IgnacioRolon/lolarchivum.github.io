It's a little lower than most other mages. However, she has decent safety, some cc, and is hella fun to play. I really like her and have lvl 5 mastery of her on multiple accounts. MAYBE she could use the damage back on her Matra E, maybe. Or maybe a bit more reliability when choosing to Mantra her W, like not make the root/snare instant, but maybe the damage could be upfronted(there is no damage boost on her Mantra W) instead of over time or something. But, overall she's in an acceptable place right now. I have a blast playing her and am quite satisfied if they don't even touch her. Probably better that way so they don't come back and nerf bat her for accidentally making her too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Triskael","date":"2015-09-29T22:16:52.027+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"When I play Karma support, with support masteries, I regularly out damage the ADC and I'm often the top damage on team, if not in game.

It USED to. Mantra W also does not get damage boosted that was also removed back in 5.10. It purely gains snare duration and the missing health heal, which is nice. \n\nLike I said, her damage is acceptable but most mages can put out more burst. Go compare abilities and you will find most mages have slightly higher damage on their main ability than Karma does on her base Q, usually through a slightly higher ratio and slightly higher base damage, and Karma's W isn't terribly reliable for damage output during large team fights that you were not already winning. Sure Karma's Mantra Q hits like a truck, but that is her ult and it consumes her Q usage as well so its not really as big as it looks when you remember you just used two abilities, and it requires people to actually stand in the pop. While most mages have combos that output a little more damage than Karma's will, Karma makes up for it in other ways. I love her, but damage is not really her strength. Her strength is her versatility.\n\nAnd yeah, you can out damage the ADC because you have roughly half the game where you are pushing AOE damage out and they *might* be getting an auto attack in here or there. A lot of poke/burst supports do the same thing. Total damage is a deceiving stat. It's a nice indicator of activity but it's more important that damage be applied at the right time to the right target.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-09-29T19:08:28.302+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **Resolved a cause of random disconnects in the client.
