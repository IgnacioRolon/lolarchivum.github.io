I thought Riot learned their lesson the few times they tried having Event Passes and instead just pissed everyone off cause it means you have to literally buy your way into the event. What's worse is that unless you buy the Event Pass, you practically can't get any of the good loot from the event considering you can only get 360 Worlds Token from the normal missions, which gets you a **single** border or Worlds Orb.

In addition, farming the tokens via ARAM isn't that bad because while the rewards are slightly lower, the games are done in about a third of the time.\r\n\r\nIt's not a rip-off, it just has an intended audience like most other things. I'm personally out of work for a few weeks with a broken foot, so for me I can get a large amount of value out of the pass since I have about 4-6 weeks to sit around doing a whole lot of nothing but ARAM farming or ranked grind.
