So thanks!\n\nHowever, while I agree with the psychology behind it (ie, random rewards are better at promoting the desired behavior or non-behavior), I would also propose that there are additional things that could be implemented that would allow players who are *exceptionally* positive to distinguish themselves, and yet still retain the element of an ongoing and/or random reward that is so important for sustained behavior change.\n\nFor example, perhaps players can have a limited amount of honor to distribute that should be given to only the most positive players in their games.  Of course there needs to be limits on this like only random players in queue, not pre-made, friends-list, etc.  As people accumulate more and more honor their chances of winning *something* gradually increase.  This means players can earn their reward sooner with exceptionally positive behavior, but maybe not earn more rewards than other people.  The random element here is time (ie, when you get something), but it could also still be the reward itself.  In this case you wouldn't know what you'll get, but you have better odds of getting it sooner if you are super positive and helpful to other players.  This example still contains the problem of ceasing the positive behavior after earning the reward, but there are workarounds like maybe an unknown but tiered reward system for accumulating honor, or being eligible for multiple rewards even after you earn one.\n\nAs another example maybe very positive players can earn chances to play a mini-game of some kind that has a small chance of rewarding the player with something neat.  Everyone can play the game, but exceptionally positive players can play *more*, or have better odds of winning when they play, or have larger prizes (e.g., longer ip boost, etc).  Here again, the reward has a random element because you might not win anything, and/or you have no control over what you might win.  However, the goal of being very positive and friendly to players is promoted through the *opportunity* to maybe win something, or to have more *frequent* opportunities to win.  In this example there is no incentive to stop being a positive community member after earning a reward (like there is in the \"10 games to be a positive player\" example above.\n\nJeez, the reward for being super positive could even be random a little popup message that occasionally congratulates you for being such a positive teammate or opponent.  \n\nTo promote ongoing sportsmanlike behavior, maybe the reward can be temporary access to a neat profile border or icon, and unless you sustain your behavior, you'll lose it next week/month/etc.  I've always thought the ribbon system we have now has so much unrealized potential.  Why can't you have multiple ribbons simultaneously?  Why can't you or others view ribbon(s) earned in your in-game profile?  Why don't ribbon(s) appear on the boards, or in chat?\n\nLong post, I know.  But there are some ideas for expanding this really cool program and potentially dramatically improving player interactions and behaviors.","replies":[{"poster":"Drogeist","date":"2015-01-31T10:48:02.448+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh I just thought of another neat \"ongoing positive behavior\" reinforcement idea.  \n\nThis one's specific to ranked games.  While I've seen some pretty bad stuff in normal games, some of the worst of the worst behaviors I've seen were during ranked games.  Once a toxic/try-hard/bad-day/whatever player decides the game is \"unwinnable\" or that they are personally doing so badly that their entire team must now suffer, that player has little or no incentive to keep them from trolling the rest of the game hard, essentially \"forcing\" their teammates to either surrender or prolong their exposure to this horrible behavior.  All they have to do is just be not terrible enough (frequency or severity) to get a ban.\n\nMaybe exceptionally positive behavior in ranked games (win or lose) could be rewarded with some kind of ranked-related bonus or earned grace period.  Continually earning honor/votes from randomly queued players could maybe earn you another opportunity to win during your next promotional, or maybe earn you a grace period to prevent dropping a tier if you lose too many games (but aren't a total @## while doing it).\n\nI could see this little reward operating in the back of someone's head the next time they are thinking of trolling a losing or difficult ranked game, or even preventing someone on the winning team from being a total @## about it.  Why lose those votes that could potentially help you climb (even slightly) faster if you care about ranked games?  While the other side is that by just being a cool/chill/nice guy or gal you can earn votes that can help you advance.\n\nThe inverse of having to earn honor/votes to receive the reward, would be the negative (yet far more satisfying) version whereby the default is that everyone receives the honor/vote from everyone else, unless you specifically choose to \"deny\" a person your honor/vote.  This isn't quite reporting someone for griefing or intentionally feeding, but could be used in addition or instead of reporting to slow or prevent the ability of negative players to earn the reward.  \n\nOf course a similar system to reporting should be implemented to reduce the potential for people to abuse the system by intentionally honoring negative behavior, or intentionally \"denying\" players who were actually positive.  In other words, the votes of trolls don't count or don't count as much, either way.\n\nJust another idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScarletFever105","date":"2015-02-11T16:41:41.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strongly agree with this type of approach.

I'm a player that's out to win (in ranked) normal's (i could careless about) but ranked i'm a player that is not afraid to hold people accountable for. which is something that has gotten me suspended for ( not because i'm a rage/ flamer) but people don't understand that ranked shouldn't be for dicking around or trolling. the incentive of a mystery skin isn't something that's going to make me in league terms a less of a \"toxic\" player because i feel like the people that troll ranked need to be removed from the game.... and the players in games that arnt pulling their weight should be told so.... i'm sorry those people cant handle the truth.  I feel like if i'm playing like garbage people should be able to say that to me and i wont cry about/ report them for being toxic if we can do it in a respectful way. the fact of the matter is the game is so broken right now in the sense of trolling in all levels of the ranked system that people like myself that are sick and tired of being jerked around by there match making system that we are being suspended for voicing our opinions / holding people accountable....for example suspended because i said fuck twice in a game because i said i was sick of being matched up with a troll after i was matched with 7 afk players in a row yes I dropped the f bomb twice in that game but i was accused of calling someone a F@ggot.... which after review chat logs was not the case and after i brought that to their attention the reasoning was because i said the F word to many times ( for those that don't believe me i will post my entire ticket if needed)...so at the end of the day a mystery skin will only be incentive if riot can figure out how to better hold players accountable for their garbage play and not ban people for saying the Fbomb twice","replies":[{"poster":"Thamos","date":"2015-02-01T20:44:54.411+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem here is that people have their own definitions of \"trolling\".\r\nI've been called a troll in ranked for picking heimerdinger, when I had the intention the entire game of trying my hardest to win. Also, there's a very thin line between respectful criticism and being a toxic douche. In a ranked game, where stress can be high, people are very often pushed over that edge. Giving criticism to random people you don't know and will likely never see again is generally not a good idea because it is likely to cause more harm than good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScarletFever105","date":"2015-02-11T16:50:33.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thameos this is the second one in this topic area that I have to agree totally with you on.\r\n\r\nHalf of the problem is that people like Trooerdeth here believe that there is only ONE WAY to play this game and it is THEIR WAY!

This will help fix the latter which is really nice since it is a topic of frustration among a lot of people...however, my issue is with the former...I noticed in a normal game I was playing that I was playing with a premade team of 4....I happened to mildly criticize the jungler for never leaving the jungle the entire game(no exaggeration, even when they were in our base and killing nexus turrets he was taking enemy red for some weird reason)...what happened was that the premade group turned on me and I just ignored knowing that it was a losing fight for me....however, after the end of game screen, I still got a chat restriction warning....so my question is...when are you guys gonna try to stop this kind of abuse of the system where pure amounts of reporting end up in negative consequences for someone.\r\n\r\nAnother game as Nasus, being a typical nasus, I tell my team that I will be split pushing unless its a big fight when I have tp up....they refuse to listen and end up reporting for not communicating and I get a warning...another example pure quantity of reports creating negative effects...pls do something about this...its not fun...and since rewards are being introduced I really don't want to miss out on then because of something stupid like this...i liked the last reward...:o","replies":[]},{"poster":"BettyWhiteLifts","date":"2015-02-01T12:21:33.574+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd just like to say that I received a reward for good behavior, but I haven't been good really.
