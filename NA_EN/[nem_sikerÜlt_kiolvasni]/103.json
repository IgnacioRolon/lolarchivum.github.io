I just moved to italy and wondering if EU WEST OR EU EAST is a better server to transfer over to. I'm near PISA if that makes a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T16:20:43.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I think that decision is best left up to you.  You can always create an account in each region to see which gives you the best connection, and take that route.  Good luck, and enjoy the sights of Italy!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-09-29T08:01:26.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, EUW all the way. The Euw servers are already kinda east of Italy, and they're more stable since they've made new ones. Also there's a bit less flaming and when people flame you in French it's going to be pretty easy to understand (once you learn Italian) compared to Greek or Polish.","replies":[]}]}
