I think this would fly really well as a sort of free-for-all king of the kill, where everyone tries to kill the Ascended and then try to keep Ascension as long as possible.\r\nThe problem with Ascension is that, as usual, certain champions are so strong (free heals? tough to chase? lots of burst? {{champion:76}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:41}} ) that the meta just revolves around them and the game mode gets boring.\r\nAnd then you've got this mode where being Ascended doesn't matter that much most of the time, unless you're someone like Akali or Nidalee, because everyone's just fighting over the relics. The relics basically become the game, and getting someone Ascended becomes a sort of nice extra sidequest you can do. It only helps you take relics, which are most of the points.\r\nMight as well name it Scavenger Hunt.","replies":[{"poster":"SPChocobo","date":"2014-09-17T18:42:26.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thought of a 6-10 person free-for-all with maybe a limited pool of champions sounds really cool.

I hope they keep it and add into the crystal scar stats. It would be nicer to have more shorter game modes (for those of us with limited time) or larger game modes with more people.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would like to see more icons associated with hard to do in-game objectives like a perfect game for Rift where you lose no towers, no dragon, no baron, and keep at least a 1:1 KDA ratio.  \r\n\r\nAs far as the lore, personally I like the new lore but I would still like to see some elements of the old lore (being an older player). I don't get why they can't tie it into the \"league\". Or it would be nice if they a can make a historical chronicle section for the old lore (just to go back and enjoy the old stories). On a positive note I am excited to see what they do and add more of a story/personality to the characters as well as see where they delve further into the world.
