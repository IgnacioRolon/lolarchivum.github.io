I do a lot with the client open, but not continuously active, when not playing.  I'd rather click on another app that's visible on the desktop or toolbars, than alt + tab in and out of fullscreen or use Win + D or alt + F4 lol.  Other people do care, though, so it should be a feature, I agree.  I would enjoy Windowed 1080p sometimes.  I like the fact that the actual game is full screen ;)  I would suggest that when using ctl + plus to enlarge the window, that it be centered automatically, if expanded to full desktop resolution, or expanded from the client window corner closest to the corresponding corner of the screen for smaller sizes.  As it stands now, you can't see the whole window when you enlarge it.  The window  position could be either remembered automatically, or at the click of a button in the client.\n\nTread carefully.  The Windows GUI subsystem is super fragile.  ROFL.  Thanks, Riot...can I call you \"Riot\" again?  The client definitely needed an overhaul.   I think we can safely put the speculation of another 5v5 PvP map on the back burner for another half decade or so....\nNow, if you can just whip those boys in the Chicago backbone exchange into providing reliably moderate (as opposed to moderately reliable) speeds and bandwidth WITHOUT the massive lag spikes and disconnects, this game might have some longer legs on it.  I suppose that's asking you to change American internet infrastructure and design and business ethics, so good luck on that one.   The whole system has degraded to generating money from American consumers by lowering the bar so far that we will beg and pay out the nose for crappy service.  That's also the result of existing monopolies, although there are supposed to be laws in place to prevent monopolies and the resulting increase in costs and drop in value and lack of choice for consumers.  Sure, you were sold on speed and latency wasn't mentioned so you end up with a screaming fast connection, that is when your packets aren't sitting in a congested  internet parking lot off the turnpike, waiting to be allowed back on, and zoom down the road again to the next parking lot.  With so many competing providers (owned by just a few parent companies) throwing their routers into the mix and battling for IT territory so they can charge each other tolls and control market position, latency has become as American as apple pie.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bubbabinsky","date":"2016-10-07T15:45:26.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the window resizing option.

(It causes the windows taskbar to show unless its completely taking all 1080p of my screen) Its getting kind of annoying at this point. \n\nAs for the PBE alpha rn, you guys added a new indicator on the tabs, for some reason even though the client saves the size now it still \"moves the client\" The new gold is doesn't show up until you click at it in login screen then it becomes \"full screen\" Its really hard to describe... Also is it possible for you guys to make it so that you HAVE to click the \"gold bar\" to move the client around. Its annoying to keep fitting the client in my screen when it gets moved by accident and the windows taskbar pops up and hides the client buttons (I end up opening Microsoft Edge instead of pressing \"find  match\".\n\nhttp://img10.deviantart.net/4f29/i/2016/281/b/d/2016_10_08__2__by_strikerprime27-dakd38n.png\n[](http://img10.deviantart.net/4f29/i/2016/281/b/d/2016_10_08__2__by_strikerprime27-dakd38n.png)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"hipopotosaur","date":"2016-10-14T01:36:52.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"does anyone else feel that the icons for almost everything are far to simplified and undefined?\nlike for the different essences in the loot menu and the different roles for draft","replies":[]},{"poster":"betsoni","date":"2016-10-09T01:22:01.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i really like new champ select ( it's very PRETTY {{item:3069}}  {{summoner:4}} {{item:3340}}  ) also the new things u can do in this client like changing in-game settings or better sound control that promised to come in polishing phase and the recent exciting news about replay, in upcoming patch but the rest of the client is really lackluster. i know u guys have said it many times it will become better in polishing phase and u will add some animations to solve this issue but i think some fundamental problems are here and now that u take the time to make UX better it would be much better if it also become prettier, don't u guys also think so?\n\nfor example the profile page where u go to see what is a player ranked is (their true achievement in this game), u just don't see the impact as u see a diamond player page in legacy UI and this UI is supposed to be an improvement in UX for players\n\nalso in end game screen please make DEFEAT ans VICTORY marks more prominent and meaningful bcs after game lobby is where people really brag  or talk about finished games and those tiny signs just DON'T make the point and can't brings the excitement to the chat room the way it truly deserve it\n\nit's just few images and marks but the overall result would be much better \n\nthx for the efforts that u guys put to make this game much more fun to play\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChickenPoop","date":"2016-10-06T10:06:57.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello,\n\nIs that patch live yet?\nI logged in and went to the play section but I couldn't find Ranked Queue?\nIs that something which will be released in the upcoming weeks or it should be up now?\n\nI'm from EUW and I'm talking about the LIVE LCU not the PBE one.\nThanks.\n\nRegards.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Grumbles","date":"2016-10-06T19:00:06.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 6.20 patch is live and the ranked queue will be getting turned on soon :)","replies":[{"poster":"Alchemist Prime","date":"2016-10-06T20:52:02.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like how soon tho.

I was wondering if that was just optimization or a bug. I dunno if it's an issue for anyone else, but \"disable animations\" doesn't seem to work? Or maybe it's just listed in a weird way. The animations for draft pick lag my client ridiculously. Heck, even the \"game found confirmation\" lags. (Too many afks from this issue smh). I don't even have a super low end PC (its not bad but not great.). Color me confused at this. I hope it's fixed soon.
