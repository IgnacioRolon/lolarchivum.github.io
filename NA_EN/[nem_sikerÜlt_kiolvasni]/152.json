I submitted a ticket, and have yet to get a response. I made this account because obviously I can't log into mine, I've tried the Forgot Username/Password, but I have not gotten any emails for League. So in conclusion I can only assume my account has been hacked and the email has changed but it seems that there's no activity on the account that I've seen yet at least in regards to matches. Please Riot, I am a paying customer and was looking forward to getting a Star Guardian skin because why not?\r\nI do not want to leave any info on this post but if an actual support can contact me I will communicate.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T16:27:00.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've submitted a ticket, rest easy knowing that the account team will help you out.
