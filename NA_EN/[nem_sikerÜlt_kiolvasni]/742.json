I don’t mind if you disagree or think I’m flat wrong.  All I ask is that you voice your thoughts respectfully.  There’s no need for insults, flaming, demeaning, ect.  I’m willing to admit when I’m wrong, and I’m always open to alternate opinions.\r\n\r\nAlso, I’d love feedback on the format.  Ways to make it cleaner, clearer, whatever-er.\r\n\r\nSo, without further ado, here is my take on patch 7.7\r\n\r\n**Amumu**\r\n\r\nNow coming to solo que near you…\r\n\r\nYou’ll see him in the jungle a lot, and possibly in other lanes too (paired with Ziggs bot maybe?).  I’m a little unclear if this is before mitigation, but regardless of wither it is or not, if he ganks mid for a high AP champs… uhm… I’m thinking crater (especially if it’s a late-game Viegar or Viktor, then it’s a mushroom cloud).\r\n\r\nNow there is some question how this balances out with the MR reduction being removed.  I would argue it’s worth it because not only is it additional, but it’s refreshed by his W, and applied by his Ult.  If he can stick to the enemy in team fights, your mage should do the rest.\r\n\r\nBy the way, don’t get confused by the damage of his W.  It’s a straight tiny buff.  It still does 10-30 damage per second, it just applies it every half second.  So what it will really do is 5-15 damage every half second.  Riot just likes per second numbers, and frankly, so do I.  Buff for any Liandry's builds as it will apply/refresh the burn more often.\r\n\r\n**Alistar**\r\n\r\nTime to add some beef.  (sorry, couldn’t resist)\r\n\r\nThough honestly, not a ton.  The buff to his passive heal is a much needed one to help him regain some support ability.  Still not as easy to use as a skill perhaps, but still nice to have.  Going to admit, I’ve never been able to tame him, so I’m not sure how big the buff to his E is, but more damage and less cooldown is always a good thing, even for a support, and may help him clear waves and provide pressure when used.  I’ll differ to those who CAN play him well for further insight.\r\n\r\n**Bard**\r\n\r\nWell, that’s a lot to read.  Full disclosure, I’m not going to go through and do all the math on this one.  You can call me lazy on this one.  You’d probably be right.  I will say he does gain power faster now, so definite buff.  I think the damage scales about the same, maybe just a touch less early (again, not doing math).  Not much changed besides more meeps.  So, faster growth on chime collection, and a larger meep magazine as you collect more chimes.  Not too bad I’d say.\r\n\r\n**Camille**\r\n\r\nAh, more nerfs.  W no longer heals on minions (ouch), and ult lasts less in early levels (ouch again).  They wanted to hit her sustain, and boy did they ever.  She’ll have to play much more carefully, and bullies can, well, bully her more because of the reduced sustain.  May relegate her to more situational or “ban this champ” picks, though not enough to ruin her.  I would even argue the nerf to her ult is a fair one.  4 seconds at level one was a little oppressive.  We’ll see if the sustain hit was too much the other way, though for the most part, I’d say probably not.  Just means she’s not this “ban her or lose” champ anymore.\r\n\r\n**Galio**\r\n\r\nOh look, Galio nerfs.  Who’s surprised?  Though after seing him in action, I’d say much needed ones.\r\n\r\nThough, is it a nerf?  His passive yes, but you’re trading 3% max HP damage for 15% AP ratio.  A nerf to non-ap builds, but perhaps a buff to those that are?  I’d say push or perhaps minor nerf only because of that reduction to the max HP damage.  Though if you’re going damage, you won’t miss it too much.  May not be enough to bring him back to Earth just yet, but it’s a start.\r\n\r\n**Graves**\r\n\r\nI’m going to call ouch on this one.  Ganking mid, or face-checking AP junglers, just got A LOT more dangerous.  Now it does mean he’s not as inherently tanky as before, so I guess mission accomplished.  Still, this one’s going to sting, and many a jungler is going to die getting used to the “oh, right, Elise can blow me up now.”\r\n\r\n**Jarvin IV**\r\n\r\nTank builds rejoice.  AD builds, not so much.  Though to be fair, once you hit 2.5k HP, you’re right back to the old number, and anything more adds that much more (I DID do the math on this one).  So even Black Cleaver and a Titanic Hydra may be enough to make up for the lost base shield.  Go big on HP, pair it with the Courage of the Colossus mastery, and when you start that fight, you’re going to have A TON of HP to get through before they get to your real HP.  Just make sure they don’t have a BotRK ADC too close, or you may see that HP evaporate.\r\n\r\n**Jynx**\r\n\r\nJust a CD reduction late for her Chompers.  Nice for getting access to that CC later, but overall, nothing major here.\r\n\r\n**Kassadin**\r\n\r\nNot a grand change really.  A bug fix, slight CD reduction on his E, and another 10% AP on his ult.  Ok, so that last one is going to help a fair bit.  I’m just not sure it’s anything Earth shattering (yet).\r\n\r\n**Katarina**\r\n\r\nFair enough nerf, minor as it is.  Reducing her access to her engage/escape early on will help others deal with her laning phase.  Letting her keep it late will reward those who get there.  All in all, I’d say this one is fair for all, even as Kat mains will hate it.\r\n\r\n**Lux**\r\n\r\n*face freezes in confusion for a month*\r\n\r\nUhm, Riot… I… uhm… what the $@#! are you thinking?!\r\n\r\nLate game Lux already has a super short cooldown on her ult.  Now you want to cut that in half with a kill?  Somebody call Starfleet.  We’re gonna need their shields when this one goes live.  Oh yeah, and you though you were gonna see more Amumu?  Lux is going to be EVERYWHERE with this one.\r\n\r\nI predict a “whoops, wrong idea” nerf in 7.8.  If not an out-right hotfix.\r\n\r\n**Nunu**\r\n\r\nOk, minor ouch on the HP nerfs.  Not the end of the world, but still noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe buffs however, oh boy.  At least… I think so…  Okay, I think I’m reading it wrong.  I think every time his passive comes up, you can upgrade an ability, and the listed upgrades in in addition to his base stats on those abilities.  Kind of like Viktor does.  I’m definitely going to take this to the practice tool and update this section after work tomorrow.  If that’s the case, hello mega buff!  Now if that’s how he get TO his listed stats, then I call nerf as he’ll have to get there before he can become a monster.  Again, testing required, and I will do it.  It’ll just be afternoon before I can (darn job).\r\n\r\n**Rengar**\r\n\r\nPoor kitty keeps getting his claws trimmed.  Going to hurt his burst and his clear by a fair amount.  Not sure it’ll change much clear after a finished jungle item, but before that, it certainly will.  Now it isn’t Earth-shattering like one might think, but it WILL be noticed.\r\n\r\n**Rumble**\r\n\r\nPretty minor nerf, but still noticeable for him.  He’ll have to manage his Harpoons a touch more carefully to avoid being without at the wrong time.  It’ll add up pretty quick, though I once again say it’s not the end of the world for him.\r\n\r\n**Shaco**\r\n\r\nHmmm, I think I need to differ to players who know him better on this one.  I don’t play him, so I don’t know how much this will change.  Seams like they just moved his AP damage to his passive, reduced the passive AD ratio, and removed the Q base damage while upping the cooldown early.  Okay, that’s a lot, but I don’t know him well enough to say how it will change him.  Sorry, but I don’t know everything (though I often pretend I do).\r\n\r\n**Syndra**\r\n\r\nJust bug fixes.  Moving on.\r\n\r\n**Talon**\r\n\r\nSome minor nerfs to help his early laning phase, or rather, that of his opponents.  Not sure it’ll do what they want, but it will help all the same.\r\n\r\n**Voliebear**\r\n\r\n“There's now a small delay between bounces.”  Define small.  .25 seconds?  1 full second?  These things matter.\r\n\r\nStill, the additional bounces will indeed feel nice, allowing you to spread that pain much better than before.  Definite buff, moderate for low damage builds, larger for ones with some actual stats.\r\n\r\n**Raptor Camp**\r\n\r\nThis will help all junglers.  Yes the HP is higher, but the overall damage is lower, which is the main problem.  Considering you generally take them on with some kind of AOE damage anyway, the change will be a net positive for everyone, which may not clear up the discrepancy they’re trying to fix.  Those that could before can do it better still.  Everyone one just gets to join the fun.\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes**\r\n\r\nYay for magic shield improvement.  Personally, I never had a problem with the old one, but the new one was bad, so I’m glad they’re trying to do better.  Let’s just hope they did it this time.\r\n\r\nWell that’s it.  Feel free to offer counter comments.  Just keep it respectful.  That’s all I ask.
