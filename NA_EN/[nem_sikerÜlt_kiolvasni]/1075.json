In Kayn's lore it says it works for an emperor which is Jarvan IV which means he's in the Odyssey Universe as well. But from Rhaast's own interactions with the other Dark Star skinned Champs like Thresh and that when he takes over Kayn's body he basically becomes Dark Star Rhaast. From I gather that also means the Dark Star skins are also a part of the Odyssey Universe or they are traveling to these alt universes(Which is fair but as far as I know from Thresh's interactions he's only traveled from galaxy to galaxy from ONE universe) So my questions is since Jarvan also has a Dark Star skin: Is Jarvan already a Dark Star follower and no one just knows of it?
