For Elise I wanted to do something else that played off the more beautiful and calm appearance of her human form as well as the lore of the \"Jorōgumo\".\n\n\nIf we were making strict kabuki skins, they'd all have to be male characters (all actors in kabuki theater are male, the females in the stories are played by men with heavy make-up on)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pioo","date":"2015-01-08T22:08:47.639+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"So...
