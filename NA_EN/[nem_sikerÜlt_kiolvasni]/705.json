The fact of it is that on the northeast side of the map, heading southwest, your forward vision is limited. You can move the screen all you want, but there will always be an inconvenient hole in your screen at the bottom left. This is a distinct disadvantage for ~~purple~~ red side bot lane while they are defending the first turret. The side that a team is selected for should not determine a disadvantage, and this would mitigate any disadvantage based on screen layout. This pertains to Riot's design value of Clarity \"Players should fight their opponents, not the game\".\r\n\"But that would change the meaning of top and bot\" \r\nPeople can figure out that those words relate to blue side and still go to the correct lane. Also, it would be an option you can toggle in your settings.\r\n\"I don't want my map flipped\"\r\nIt would be an option.\r\n\"Your bad! Learn to play the game!\" *Giant Squid of Anger* \r\nIt is not about skill. It is about neither side having a disadvantage based on screen layout.\r\nTL;DR We need a toggle-able option to flip the map layout for ~~purple~~ red side.","replies":[{"poster":"HailFire Dragon","date":"2014-06-09T19:58:44.630+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":9,"body":"they are adjusting the camera angles so everyone see the same vision.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlakeSlays","date":"2014-06-09T19:03:20.158+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":1,"body":"* I'm ready to hit up the new shop.

If so, will there be any scaling in ability frequency as the game goes on. The reason I ask is because as they stand now once you get into later game Baron and Dragon get shredded incredibly fast. Baron usually gets to use his knock only once, if that. It makes for a very unintimidating fight, especially when a lot of % max hp shred is involved. \r\n\r\nPossibly Baron having a set attack at specific points in his health or even an enraged mechanic under 25%?
