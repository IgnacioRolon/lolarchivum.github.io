I am beyond owning the capacity to design sentences any further in reference to the artistic relationship involved to help embrace the final presentations of the Champions you coordinate Teamwork and Time towards.\n\nThis is off your subject, and I will call myself out for this. I know of no other way to learn if I was wrong with my conscience or not for speaking the analysis of the actions I witnessed in reading a comment reply thread inside of another discussion with some other Riot people.\n\nSpecifically, because I know you allowed yourself to be known as a Human Being surviving from a line of classified mental illness, Truly the tears were there that day as I try to hold them back today while typing this to you. This discussion of thoughts is closer to me than you might first read. I continue to be hesitant to share what HiPAA Rights protect. Though in another board discussion I created I mentioned how I was a victim of therapy counseling. More of anything I could share was to live as close to my grandmother portrayed to me when growing up. She was not only a special education teacher, but helped to make sure North Shore Special Education District and North Shore Special Recreation Association were established and maintained from some of her efforts while she was alive for the portion of her life I was allowed to live in and near for that period of time.\n\nDue to the fact that I wanted to be more of a family mediator and an advocate for my peers {whether we will ever be friends or never be friends}; witnessing the social bullying some of them had to endure in school in the 70's, 80's, and 90's pained me too much far in the depths of my core lacking empathy to stand and fight on their team. So, after college and obtaining my Bachelor's of Science in Speech Communication with a Minor in Health Education I owned a fast stream of thoughts intrapersonally to the corner of my hometown childhood house location and will never forget the ancestors of elders in my life side-barring a counsel advisement where my instincts were told to not allow the people to label of judge me medically. Since I know of those military veterans {World War II = Blood/ and World War I = More than close family friend} the family conflict and being only homeless at the time was where the mental illness state facility coordinated in pruning new growths for new clients for their pools of nourishing more Rx clients into states of medically forced fed addictions. {Nope, refuse to believe any symptom is a life long infliction} )in most cases, and happy to be a part of the movement in Illinois where Illinois believes people are human beings and can recover from a mental illness}\n\nI am close to where you are there in the medical terms. As for the Artwork, far from you REALM of expertise. I spend some time with watercolors because I believe I can own the skill in almost making artwork look as the value appearance I search for. In one of my first pieces, the perception in my mind changed. Usually, I am in a two-dimensional perception glance with my mind and eyes teamwork. Then when taking the time to envision myself as a bird on the outside of my presence as a human being artist trying to paint a water color art piece, the perception allowed depth to exist inside of my sight. Nope! 20:20 vision. Thinking more with the head injury concussion before second grade would be why there is not only the learning disability I had to grow with in some subjects in school, but also with my artwork.\n\nAs for the victim of counseling and being homeless, well going of a 15 year as homeless, and owning more than a dozen mental illness medical hospital scars; no, the truth is obstructed from the medical staff of claimed experts which {if you can tell me when I am going to throw up or when my next headache is then maybe there could be a line of expertise, but until then medical doctors are only expert reguritators}; continues to undermine my validity in a court of law. I have been told my assessments are maybe borderline, and most of the initial history were conclusions of my presence of a human being then as a Victim of family violence. I could Best Book court book Oath connect a quote, but I do not want to get caught for Quote preaching. As for those social workers trying to claim they are ending homelessness, no, they are the expert enablers in making sure they have homeless people for their next season and ensuring they continue to own a job as a social worker helping the homeless. Since I boycott Lake County, I attend McHenry County PADS. No, across illinois PADS appears to fall in their mission statements when they state they are there to help end homelessness one: women, child, man and person at a time. But, when they make sure their homeless people are not without tents from one summer to the next, and then most definitely make sure the Church Staff volunteers have their support but more important to them is the homeless people they can continue to look down onto and also state in Church those more inferior to their level of existence, contradicts the clean communication process ethical Facility code of conduct hygiene I continue to battle on a daily basis. Try to look for an apartment, but the level of homelessness is already frowned upon and judged. So, build out from where society dictates to me in how I am suppose to function and live in their lives, No the Tenacious level of the Oak Tree and The Strength of the Rose Tree connected to my bloodline are those Experts Ancestors in my life, Both Jewish and Christian!\n\nThis first comment is more for the appreciation of the time you took to talk and chat with those people who decided to share. Please excuse my length in what I have shared. I know one is your while the other is not, but the partnership of the Champion Art helps me to self-counsel and cope. Have already stated to another Riot in an earlier comment reply of mine: I game at Networx Gaming in Crystal Lake Illinois/ McHenry County Illinois (more inside of the illinois homeless season of October 1st through to April 30th), and board at public libraries. Without Riot and the time I spend in their League of Legends online video game I am not too sure of how my self-designing levels of inspiration would be at a more lower quality of artwork exposure, as in the art time when spending time confined inside of an adult psychiatric unit. My artwork is far from the art I game with.\n\nThank you for your time! If you could help me to review my conscience, or help me to call myself out from a comment inside of another subject discussion, your help would be appreciated. Need not a lot, but maybe to be told I was wrong. However, with empathy and the 5 steps of empathy, there concludes to be Truth in All Perspectives!  \"I/Truth will be heard {{champion:131}}!\"  and \"The stars will heal me {{champion:16}} !\"\n\n\nThank You!\nFrom: FuryofThornsRedo\n{{item:3751}} {{item:3105}}  \"Follow No False LIGHT!\"","replies":[{"poster":"FuryofThornsRedo","date":"2015-07-21T19:56:16.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will answer my own post Riot as I already know When AND Where ANY thoughts I could Validate from my own analysis belong; Already learned that Riot League of Legends Might not Ever possibly be the EnvironMental Realm of infamous social media.\n\nJust because she is A social Media Specialist; Directly does not mean to dis-include any or all of the perimeter tasks of TEAMWORK in alignment with claiming to aspire to be the Best online video game, or one of.\n\nSo she is not technologically inclined, well thank you for stating the obviousness of her weakness there Sky Shadow. Some people might not have picked up on her capacity of abilities inside of her position of Social Media Specialist.\n\nSo, a Social Media Specialist. Wow! What would be those TRUTHFUL classifications in conjunction with your credentials Riot claims to empower you with the title position Social Media Specialist? Whoa! A Social Media Specialist, well the title sounds nice, but only as far as those around you assert for you where you chose not to clarify your involvement level of owning the accountability of TEAMWORK management to help get troubles concluded and fixed; though with other people sounding off for you, and clarifying your life for you without any responsible ownership of the title many of us might not have known until Sky Shadow needed to validate their existence as a support network friend to the admin Cobbel (NA) tried to comment to; as stated though with other people sounding off for you to defend the Social Media Specialist they state you are, the level of Social Media Specialist is all you could ever be as defined from Sky Shadow.\n\nWhere was the Defense? Why should I now be informed of the level of so called claimed expertise from some other person other than the person to actually own the position and title of Social Media Specialist? Why devalue the strength of the Riot League of Legends Team inside of this post?\n\nNo, no competition. Nope not even close to trying to sound what some claim as salty, while I assert my stance in life as at times maybe sounding thorny, far from that. Maybe professional level of claimed expertise clarified in the comment reply from Sky Shadow as obnoxiously annoyed. Considering the depth of intensity with determination to attend to the privilege of claiming to own a professional position with Riot as a Social Media Specialist in striving to service the customers community of online video gamer's Riot League of Legends caters to; yup!, those people working at Riot League of Legends are people owning a privilege to possess a title position contract of employment with Riot League of Legends so this push to ...\"Let's All Try To Be Professional (Grammar and Behaviors amongst ourselves); Please Riot League of Legends Please try to Never forget the Privilege in owning your title position of employment with Riot League of Legends. Also, please try to have your online friends try to not sound off for where you are the person asked of a concern. If you are not wanting to reply, then maybe say you own no stance inside of this comment rather than a full all out ignore to a post. Why?\n\nI would rather not have learned inside of the comment reply from Sky Shadow that the admin referenced in a comment is in a position to not address the concern one of your Priorities of the customer community of Riot League of Legends took the time to bring forth.\n\nConcluding almost too close to a sound for me, not classified as an opinion of mine, but based upon the TEAMWORK efforts of the admin addressed and their friend Sky Shadow; almost as if their TEAMWORK illustrations sound as a Tandem Tag-Team of Gods and Goddesses. Thus in full almost allowing the full encompassing experience of Comic Con(c) to exist \"In Real Life\" while at work as a full time character other than the factual actual person Riot League of Legends hired as the Social Media Specialist.\n\nQuite possibly maybe on the off-side out of computer realm range you might have asked her if mentioning her position was alright, or maybe not. Which ever the case, if she is hired to own the position as a Social Media Specialist then she should be more than well Equipped to empower herself and speak for herself while also managing her own efforts inside of the Subject Discussion Community containing the boards discussion threads of comments I am addressing the Speech Communication Process: Lines of Codes of Conduct, Codes of Ethics, Lines of Character Values, and Lines of Character Morals of Professional Behaviors, Mannerisms, and Etiquette!\n\nPlease acknowledge that the few words I took the time to CAPITALIZE are done so as to not interrupt the pixel strength of the sentence reading ability for any of the readers to this comment reply I have taken the time to create. Sure a **bold** mark could have been stipulated, though as I have mentioned the bold or even the _italicized_ readability features coordinated under my standards as the readability artwork features inside of this comment reply.\n\nReceiving Feedback of Receiving Zero Feedback is not the driving objective for this comment post! I have stated my analysis of the communication behaviors between: Cobbel (NA) {no wrong in bringing forth a concern} versus Sky Shadow communicating the lowered level of Riot League of Legends TEAMWORK Definitions illustrated and Marketed from the efforts of Sky Shadow to clarify Truthfully; Really How Far Riot League of Legends could Ever own ELITE TEAMWORK? From these efforts and their self-decided marketing decisions, not too far and lacking the endurance of owning any value to the customers.\n\nThe comment could have been stated nicer, or in another combination of words designed inside of the sentences used to reply to Cobbel. No, I am not throwing down. No I am not trying to sound more superior than those inside of this comment post reply and the threads of comment replies we share in illustrating the functioning business partnership between Riot League of Legends and Riot League of Legends Customers. I know where my strengths are. I might never obtain a Penta Kill; considering my arcade back story into my online video game skill level, but I know where my strengths are in defending much of the intensity of the Passions for those people living with more passion with owning more online video game skills than myself; so, if I am not working a Penta Kill due to those strengths needing more than a lifetime to boom-amp up to gain the Penta Kill, then I will most definitely will Sound Strong Stance my efforts in subject discussion boards community for those parties of interest and lines of thoughts inside of the Arenas of Thoughts I contemplate inside of daily with my degree in Speech Communications analyzing the Communication Process and sound my truths connected to my conscience!\n\nWhether I am heard inside of any climate, surrounding the space inside of any EnvironMental Realm, I at least know I Listened to my conscience and communicated the sound I needed to confront.
