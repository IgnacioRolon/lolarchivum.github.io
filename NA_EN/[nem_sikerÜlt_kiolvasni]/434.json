If you're interested, here's the marketing history lesson.\r\n\r\nEarly sales began a while back.  Originally, skins were often more than a complete price tier lower in cost for the first week after their release.  Later, Riot did what was clearly a social experiment to see if they could up the ante (and profit) on new skins: they released a wave of 1350 RP skins that were the full price for one week before going on that ordinary sale the NEXT week... but if you bought it in the first week (at full price), you got a fairly trivial loading screen border with no effect on your in-game experience or appearance.\r\n\r\nThey must have had impressive sales in the first week, because it was only something like a couple months later they announced that new skins would remain at full price - but that 4-6 months after release they would go on an \"early sale\" (since it normally takes 10-12 months for a full rotation of skins through the sale schedule).  This sale would drop the price by a single price tier.  The law of supply and demand now reigns supreme, with Riot delaying the \"release\" sale by those few months and giving a lower sale, since it was clear people would buy at full price just to have their skin ASAP after release (even if the wait would only be one extra week for maaajooor RP savings).\r\n\r\n**TLDR: **It's a watered down and extremely delayed version of the release-day sale that used to exist for every new skin.  Hence, it is still \"early\" compared to the normal sale progression, but delayed so much that everyone forgets when the skin comes out and it doesn't feel early at all, leading to considerable confusion I witness every couple months like clockwork.","replies":[{"poster":"Estilo","date":"2017-07-19T00:36:24.785+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should definitely copy paste this for the next time its asked","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wewdy","date":"2017-07-18T19:52:07.819+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for explaining that, I was fairly confused about it as well, but didnt want to ask what it was about","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spartan DMG 02","date":"2017-07-18T22:10:19.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So when will those skin be on sale?","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2017-07-19T06:09:02.865+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Early sales are during the last weekend of the month.","replies":[{"poster":"Karmeh","date":"2017-07-22T00:47:29.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are the Blood Moon sales going on sale at the last weekend of July or August?","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2017-07-22T05:10:58.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider the early sale for the Blood Moon says \"**August **sales schedule\"","replies":[{"poster":"Karmeh","date":"2017-07-22T16:53:55.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{champion:32}} Damn","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"andrea","date":"2017-07-18T22:17:34.247+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's no (public) set schedule for when skins go on normal sales.

Rather than making people wait for the regular sale, they added in an early sale with a smaller discount that generally happens ~6 months after the skin's release. People that pay full price usually get an icon and can run the skin from day 1 of its launch.\r\n\r\nLoad screen borders were introduced as a new concept when the PROJECT: Yasuo skin came out and doesn't actually have anything to do with early sales. They were, however, always a limited-time object meant to reward early adopters, so that may be the reason why there was some confusion about their involvement with early sales. These borders are still limited-time collectibles but are now only available through crafting/missions during in-game events.","replies":[{"poster":"Novanious","date":"2017-07-20T12:28:06.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Load screen borders were introduced as a new concept when the PROJECT: Yasuo skin came out \r\n\r\nNo. Loading screen borders as incentive to buy skins were introduced when the second wave of PROJECT skins came out, which is what the \"rant\" is talking about.
