When Worlds came to New York, I was especially excited. And even though I didn't get a chance to go (funds for a high schooler...ugh!!), I still appreciated all of the viewing parties and events she organized. Along with Microsoft starting their League of Legends weekly tournaments, it really gave me a chance to gain some exposure and improve significantly. I've always had a dream that I would be able to compete at the highest levels of play in this game and these people are working to make that a reality for me. Coming from a lowly Silver 2 player, this might not mean much but I hope that I can fulfill my dream one day. Thank you Narz, Microsoft and Riot Games. May we meet someday.","replies":[{"poster":"Narzz","date":"2018-10-08T16:58:03.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We will absolutely meet! I believe in you and your dreams. Keep fighting!
