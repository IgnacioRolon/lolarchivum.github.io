After failing to be able to log into my account, and trying to retrieve the password to my account, only to not have the password reset being sent to my email, I turned to RIOT to help me recover my account.  I have supplied all of the information that they have asked for, 100% correctly, however, the keep saying that the information is incorrect.  I have even sent screen shots of purchased through paypal of specific DATES when I purchased RP points from them, and nothing.  They refuse to tell me what is supposedly incorrect, and am still, weeks later, locked out of my account. If anyone can help me, let me know. I'm not even close to the first person this has happened to.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T17:40:11.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our account team will only return an account if they are absolutely sure it's being restored to the owner.
