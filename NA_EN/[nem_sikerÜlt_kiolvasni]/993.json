Now if they'd actually given her a real recall animation to match the rest of the championship skins, I'd be happy, as it stands all she does is raise her sword, while the rest of the championship skins get pedestals, altars, a goddamn throne.

PAX Sivir is getting a hugely better deal. The difference between the OG and Neo will be immediate, the colors are different, even the name is different.

The new effects are also on the 2016 one, making it so the new effects were essentially a VU for the skin. The \"different\" model is legit a crown placed on top of her head and it's very easy to miss. Again loading screen borders are easily missed by most players since most alt tab during the loading screen. I do have the original CS Riven, it's the only reason I'm complaining. Side by side, Original CS Riven and 2016 have very few differences. \n\nIf you're talking about new effects for the original, it really is only a VU that would've happened eventually, the way riot has been working.
