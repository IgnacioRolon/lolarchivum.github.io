Here's why!\r\n1. The ranked scoring system is garbage! No Matter how well I play. I always have 3-4 shitty kids with no clue how to play! You can't help these kids because no matter how nice you are about trying to help them, they automatically get pissed and tilt! What does Riot do about this. It shortens the time it takes to get to level 30 by half so now the game is FLOODED with even shittier kids!\r\n2. Every other game has an AFK, rager, INT feeder or some foreign kid that DC's every 5 seconds because he has a garbage computer.\r\n3. All of you scrubs that are going to type 'well your just bad, if you were good you would carry yourself out like I did\" Except be honest, you didn't carry shit but rather got carried out if at all!\r\n4.

That is, unless you are one yourself. Think of it this way; you have 4 teammates, and the enemy team has 5. That creates a larger chance for the ENEMY team to have \"shitty level 30s\" over your team, thanks to the extra open position.
