You can also hop on the Millenium Line at Coquitlam Central instead, but from experience, going the 160 is potentially faster, and all three buses are frequent. (Every 15 for the 701 and 160, and even more on the 95)\r\nFares are $2.75 CAD for the entire system (less if you're using a Compass card) on Saturday and Sunday, and includes unlimited transfers within 90 minutes.\r\nIf you're a visitor that's planning on getting around mainly by bus, you may also be interested in a [compass card.](http://www.compasscard.ca) At this point it would be safe to assume it's too late to order one to be sent out, though.\r\nAny further information can be found on the [local transit authority website.](http://www.translink.ca)\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that there is **no ridesharing** (Uber, Lyft, etc...) in Vancouver, so if you're looking at getting a ride from someone, it'll be by [taxi.](http://www.yellowcabonline.com/)\r\n\r\nAnd for those driving in, all parking around the Coliseum and the PNE is *pay parking.* Depending on local awareness, you may or may not have residents offering their own driveways for a price. (This used to be a big practice back when the Canucks played at the Coliseum. Dunno if it's even legal for them now.)\r\n\r\nFor those staying in downtown Vancouver overnight, keep in mind that the Vancouver Sun Run is happening in the morning and that detours and delays could happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pieman10001","date":"2017-04-13T04:58:07.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will I have any issues going through security with a turban?","replies":[{"poster":"Eroica","date":"2017-04-13T17:29:51.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, you'll be fine pieman!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"axetnollim","date":"2017-04-13T15:28:04.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When will tickets be on sale?","replies":[{"poster":"Eroica","date":"2017-04-13T17:29:11.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey axetnollim, \r\nTix have been on sale and you can find more info here: [http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/2017-na-lcs-spring-finals-tickets](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/2017-na-lcs-spring-finals-tickets)\r\nHope we'll see you there!","replies":[]}]}]}
