But I can see the potential problem with this.  Placing 5+ shrines under the bot lane turret would be enough to completely fill the adc's health even it is when very low.  Maybe there should only be a limit to the number of shrines within a certain range of each other.  Or a decrease in consecutive heals within a certain time (similar to summoner spell heal {{summoner:7}} ).","replies":[{"poster":"DabYeet LitFam","date":"2015-03-05T20:58:34.948+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that your idea of the decrease on consecutive heals is a nice idea.

However, Bard seems to have a real weakness with his ability to support a team. Is he supposed to be a cc/protection/disengage support that protects his carry? Janna, Nami, and Lulu easily beat him in that role. Is he supposed to be a fierce damage dealer, becoming a monster late in the game once he builds up his chime collection? Zyra and Morgana dominate him in that regard in both cc and burst damage. (And I'm saying this is true even after I've collected 100+ chimes with Bard and have fully maxed out his items). Is he supposed to be some kind of bruiser-like character who can both take a hit and dish out some damage? He doesn't have the natural tankiness to fulfill this role, and Blitzcrank and Thresh easily dominates him in this area.\r\n\r\nAre there any plans for reworking some of Bard's abilities in order to more clearly define his support role?  Right now, in an all-in situation or in a moment where an assassin jumps one's adc, Bard only has one and a half abilities.  Q, which might or might not stun, and W, which works at half strength if not given the time to charge up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blind Saitama","date":"2015-03-06T03:45:21.630+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So...
