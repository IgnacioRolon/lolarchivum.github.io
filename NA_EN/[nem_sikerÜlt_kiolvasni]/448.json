The more the merrier right?\n\nAnyway, this is only my take.  I don’t mind if you disagree or think I’m flat wrong.  All I ask is that you voice your thoughts respectfully.  There’s no need for insults, flaming, demeaning, ect.  I’m willing to admit when I’m wrong, and I actually like having conversations about different takes on the notes.\n\nSo, without further ado, here's my take.\n\n**Attrox:**\n\tAt first glance, I thought his Q had been nerfed to worthlessness, then I realized they doubled the AD ratio, and made it include ALL AD, not just bonus.  I’m sure the pure math is one way or the other, but overall, the damage change shouldn’t be that much.  I will say the health costs, or rather the removal of them, will make him safer to play.  30 HP every time rather than 5% will mean you can go slightly tanky without basically killing yourself every team fight.\n\n\tIf I’m reading it right, looks like the revive passive no longer scales, but it instead is only there when Blood Rush is active.  If I’m right, going in now has a higher skill curve as you’ll stay dead if you aren’t in Blood Rush.  In short, it’s all about playing around that power spike much like Vladimir’s Blood Rush or Caitlyn’s Headshot.  I’ll probably hit the practice tool to test this one out to be sure.\n\n\tThe W changes will help your sustain as the base healing is up, and it scales with missing health.  Pair that with Warlords (even after the change), and you could become quite hard to kill in a team fight.  That said, they did hurt the damage side of the W a bit in exchange for it filling his blood pool.\n\n\tHis E changes are pretty minimal.  About the only “nerf” is no more AP scaling, though the base and ratio damage are up slightly.  Yes the slow now scales with skill levels, but the duration is fixed, so I’m calling this one an adjustment.\n\n\tAll that said, after reading a post by Supe, I'm actually think it is quite the nerf.  (you can find his post here: [Link](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/8vdlnIqA-a-huge-nerf-to-aatrox))\n\n\tOne of the nice things about Attrox was the buffed attack speed as his blood well filled.  Well, if I’m reading the notes right, that has been removed.  If it has, yeah, that’s gonna hurt.  The sustain changes will help after a revive, but not being able to get more attack speed until the well is full, and then only for 4 seconds, that’s going to be a problem.\n\n\n**Fizz:**\n\tThe Q buff will help his assassination, but you’ll have to aim that ult more carefully now.  If it misses, it stays missed.  I understand the pop-up zone is still there, so it’s not a total waste, but the enemy can run/dash over it now to get away before it hits.  Overall, other than the Q, not much to see here (though that’s plenty to respect).\n\n**Kindred:**\n\tScuttle control just became more important early to see that she does (or doesn’t) get her stacks.  Nothing more done so far.  Don’t think it’s enough, but it’s a start.\n\n**LeBlanc:**\n\n\tOk, on behalf of all LeBlanc players, let me just say,\n\n\t**#?%*! OUCH!**\n\n\tI get that they want her to be a “deceiver” rather than an assassin, but my word.  Her primary damage just got sliced in half.  Having never been much good with her even before the rework, I may be over-reacting, but it seems to me they over did it with this one.  Possibly to the point of going from ban worthy to barely played.  I’ll differ to LeBlanc mains to say if I’m right, wrong, or somewhere in the middle.\n\n**Lucian:**\n\tMinimal update here, but don’t totally ignore it.  As we all know, fractions of a second matter, so the ones they gave Lucian may matter enough to help him out.\n\n**Miss Fortune:**\n\tHard to call this one.  Landing the right Q bounce will still hurt, but the nerf to the static bounce may well reduce her power enough to give enemies a better ability to lane against her.  Good/lucky players will still get that longer range poke without it being automatically oppressive.  We do have to ask, is there enough threat left without it?  I think so, be time will tell.\n\n**Rengar:**\n\tIn short, makes you think more about how you jungle, and when you gank.  Getting a reduced heal from camps may well get him in line with some of the others.  I’m mixed on the armor nerf as it does make him more squishy, and thus fightable, but does it make his clearing ability early too hard?  Such a small amount, I honestly doubt it, but it’s still going to be an adjustment to Rengar players.\n\n**Ryze:**\n\tMore minor changes.  Normal root duration will help enemies get away better, and the longer cooldown on his E early will also help the laning phase.  Overall, a fair tweak I think to give opponents something to play against.\n\n**Varus:**\n\tI think we knew this was coming, and here it is.  The Q nerfs.\n\n\tOverall though, the damage nerf actually isn’t as drastic as I expected, and I might even argue is fair.  When one Q can take an ACD to 40% or less, an adjustment is kind of needed.  The cooldown is the one that’s going to hurt.  Though again, perhaps it’s fair to make landing or missing those arrows more impactful.  And as a Varus player who makes an effort to stack those Blight stacks before firing, the ability to regain some cooldown by procing them is going to make it hurt less.\n\n**Items**\n\n**Blade of the Ruined King:**\n\tI’m going to say slight buff on this one.  Ok, the attack speed and active nerfs hurt, but the life steal, AD ratio, and ultra slight passive buffs make this a much more viable option for more champions.  It might even mean Bloodthirster is no longer the “gotta have it” life steal item.  You can trade the BT shield and higher life steal for the BotRK attack speed and active slow without it being such a drastic trade-off.  It also means getting a BotRK for anti-tank combat feels better for the same reasons.  Better life steal, and higher damage.  As I said, a net slight buff.\n\n**Edge of Night:**\n\tI’m actually very in favor of this.  The spell shield active is a wonderful addition, but 10 seconds?  Yeah, that was a bit much.  So reducing the duration to 5 seconds is a fair nerf to make it easier to player around.\n\n**Masteries**\n\n**Stoneborn Pact *Bond of Stone replacement***\n\tI give it two weeks tops before a hot-fix comes in.\n\n\tLet’s see.  5% extra HP.  You thought late game Maokai was hard to kill before?  Yikes.\n\n\tThen there’s this:\n\t“Your movement impairing effects mark enemy champions with an earthen rune that heals other allied champions who basic-attack them for 5 (+2.5% of your maximum health) over 2 seconds. The mark lasts 4 seconds.”\n\n\tThey wanted to buff it, boy did they ever.  Possibly too much.  This is almost worth taking for some supports who have slows in their kit (I’m looking at you, Zyra, Karma, Lulu types).  What a nice way to help your ADC heal in a trade.  And I don’t see a cooldown listed, so if you can proc it constantly, I return to yikes.\n\n**Deathfire Touch:**\n\tGonna hurt auto attackers and those with long-range skill shots (sorry Jhin).  It’s not the end of the world at least.  We’ll see how it goes, but it may push DFT users onto other masteries instead.  I think it will still be worth taking for those who want that extra damage on their skills/attacks.\n\n**Warlord’s Bloodlust:**\n\tTell me this is a typo.  50% life steal at level 18?  You let that Olaf get to late game, just FF.  You’ll never kill him.  I actually think it is a typo… maybe… probably… uhm… Riot, please tell me it’s a typo.\n\n\tOk, joking around aside, this one is gonna take some getting used to.  As I read it, the effect ONLY procs on energized attacks, which you gain by moving or attacking.  So I think every other auto-attack would trigger it (first shot energizes, second shot procs, rinse, repeat).  It also looks like the life steal early is a lot less, and then scales.  Ultimately, I think the change is minimal because now you gain some movement speed when this thing procs.  That’s worth more than people think for an ADC in a team fight.  The life steal element has been nerfed early, but it’s gained other uses that may even it out.\n\n**Other**\n\n**Exhaust:**\n\tWell that hurts.  Half the reason I take Exhaust mid at all is to defend against a Kha’Zix, Master Yi, ect gank.  The attack speed reduction is the whole reason to take it.  I think they trimmed a little too much fat on this one.  Removing the resistance reduction I’m okay with, but I’m not so sure they didn’t trim too much fat on this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Azules500","date":"2017-03-08T04:38:26.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The new Warlord's Bloodlust is going to charge at the same rate as Statikk Shiv/RFC.
