You need a chance for reform and not just permabans to do that.\r\n\r\nHow can you think they are saying it's \"okay\" and \"not addressing\" when they just ended his shot at going pro this spring. It is addressed right here in this announcement (basically a public shaming). This a pretty major thing to take away what these players strive for and I'm happy they did so. I would have also been okay with a perma ban here but I don't think that's the answer to every abusive player. This highlights their push for reform across the playerbase. This is the first time he's received anything more than a chat restriction, hopefully he becomes civil now. If not they will not be lenient next time or then I will agree with you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-01-19T13:48:16.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bear in mind that these types of suspensions are reviewed at the end of their term and if the person hasn't shown improvement, they'll be restricted again. The suspension is really just the 'minimum term' of the punishment, not the potential length of it.\r\n\r\nThey're just giving him a split to reform, if he doesn't, we'll hear that his suspension has been extended. If he does, we'll hear the opposite.\r\n\r\nBut being suspended from competitive play is a far harsher punishment than having his personal account closed... since the latter is 'just a video game account', while the former is potentially the death of a long time dream that he's been working towards. If ANYTHING is going to get him to reform, it'll be that... so it makes sense to give him that chance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KT FanLing","date":"2015-01-18T10:54:07.768+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":22,"body":"WE DONT NEED OCS.

The wildcard did what is hoped it will do, have one or two lucky wins that have massive impact on other things and create hype story lines. For that to work the wildcard needs to play hype/good teams, no one gives cares to watch two wildcard teams play one another you are fighting to be the best worst of the worst. Also no one is going to watch OCS and say shit that guy is a god, better bring him over. Why? Because they are the worst, so someone that is a god there will probably end up about average in higher levels of play. I am noting say that we just shouldn't stream these games, but we should not ignore a much stronger regions games because its \"fair\" or something.  I want to watch LPL to see how all these new koreans are effecting the league, to see how all these teams I have known for years are reacting to new changes in the game, and there is finally a quality english stream for it?
