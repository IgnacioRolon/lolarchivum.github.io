There are times on my end where I will have a perfect connection to the internet, yet the client will Lag so severely that it will become unresponsive (One time it flat out refused to let me play as it would lag out after pressing 'Accept Match' during Queue). There's also a bug at the Post-Game Screen that I have noticed where as soon as you join the post-game lobby, it will say that all players (including myself) have left the lobby. Other players have stated that the Friends list is also bugged as well.\n\nI'm not expecting the Client to be fixed overnight, but I don't think I've seen any official responses from anyone so far since all this trouble started.\nIf someone can atleast address it and let us know that you guys are looking into it, that'd be nice.\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/51/Everything_is_Okay_Emote.png/revision/latest?cb=20180322145328","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jabalor","date":"2019-12-18T19:13:29.401+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sooo is the framerate drops bug fixed or will it have to wait for next year?","replies":[{"poster":"Bad at games","date":"2019-12-18T20:24:11.108+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"If you're using blitz.gg, just uninstall that garbage, nearly doubled my framerate when I did lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HA I am Shaco HA","date":"2019-12-18T19:37:13.291+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":27,"body":"How detatched are you guys from the game that you think AD Shaco needs to be nerfed, by all means nerf AP Shaco!

Riots balance team......what in the entire world were you thinking  when making Aphelios? I shouldn’t be struggling as a JUNGLER to take an adc down at close corners when my bot and the enemy bot are on par with each other. I also should be expecting an adc WITH 5 GUNS TO be DECENTLY weaker than normal since he can use each weapon and ability to his advantage more than any normal champion. When slightly ahead in game he does about 1/3rd of my HEALTH in a single shot. I’m not sure if that’s an ability or basic attack but either way that’s just not balanced in my opinion. Don’t even get me started on how scared I am for Sett. At this point, top is a mess and broken champions need to be scaled down to normal champions. After the Morde rework incident i will forever be on edge with new champions no matter how “balanced” you claim them to be. My advice for you Riot? Make the game balanced so I don’t regret spending, and possibly don’t think about quitting the game.","replies":[{"poster":"mage192117","date":"2019-12-18T23:01:06.271+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"The argument that just because you’re a Jungler (a position with almost every role: tanks, bruisers, assassins, at least one support (Ivern), mages, and marksmen), you should automatically be able to 1v1 an adc already made me hesitant to read the rest of your comment.

As a melee champ with no gap closer (esp. after jg nerfs), about the only option we have anymore to even 1v1 is a serious outplay or bush cheese.  We are so reliant on our laners it's almost not even a fun role anymore (in fact, I would say that the only reason I still play jg is that it is the only place where I feel comfortable, because it's the only role where I have experience).  In s7, it was quite possible for me to carry games as Udyr jg - when I was just learning the champ.  I now have 2.5 million XP on him, and I can't remember the last time I \"carried\" a game.  I can go Cinderhulk straight into Frozen Heart + ninja tabi, have no damage in an effort to be tanky, yet get 100-0 in all of a second by a 2 kill Talon or Zed with one completed item and a second dirk, with zero outplay potential.  I feel the same about items like void staff.  You shouldn't be able to buy ONE item (a damage item no less) that SIGNIFICANTLY negates ALL the items I bought, that I sacrificed damage to get.  And you certainly shouldn't still be practically one-shotting me every time I get within sight of you, because my laner fed you two kills before I could finish my third camp + items and ranged champs are already all working to be not in my favor.  Every champ has CC, damage, goes into a wall, into the ground, into your body, gets a shield, and heals on like every damn ability.  Udyr gets a tiger dot.  He can run fast for a couple seconds, he can produce a small shield.  I'm not saying make Udyr stronger.  But maybe buff more items for melee champs, or nerf items when used against melee champs.  Something.","replies":[]}]}
