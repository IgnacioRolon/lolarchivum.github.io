And the similar ability isn't Veigar's ult, whereas it's ults that are directly near-same between Galio and Shen, with Shen having the clearly overall better version and better kit overall, making Galio simply redundant. Janna's WW has a chargeup and doesn't interact with her ult. Yasuo's requires hits on enemies instead and is used to set up his ult. Morgana's 3 year root is an abomination in and of itself so don't even get me started there. Zyra's is much slower and works very differently due to the usage with her plants. Plus most champions have at least 2 things that really set them apart from any other champion. Galio has nothing like that left except the taunt itself, and he used to have several more things which they outright replaced with copycat abilities.

To put it into scale. Lulu would be about 7-8 times the size, Lux 12-13, and Aatrox with one of the tallest if not the tallest in-game model stands at a staggering 16 times the size of the near by people. Even the minions are at least 3 times the size of the people. So to summarize they really are league of _LEGEND_. Because they are so insainly large existence battling it out for and against the rest of us tiny existences. And to make it even more over the top you have summoners who instructs these Legends. So I have to ask, what are we? We give orders/instructions to beings that are basically god like existences, so what is the most powerful existence in the game, the summoner. With varying strengths and skills we command an god like (Legendary) existence, so this raises a question.
