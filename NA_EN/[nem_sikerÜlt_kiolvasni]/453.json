Videogames are a unique medium in that they combine movie, written, and interactive elements together to deliver an entertainment experience as a unified package that is part gameplay, part art, part audio, and tells a story. If you forego chunks of these elements, you have a low quality or generally poorly delivered game. Gameplay is but one element of a videogame, but the written, audio, and visual elements outside of the gameplay also need to exist coherently to deliver the experience.
