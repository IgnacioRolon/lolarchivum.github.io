Anywhere from 11-15. Now, here's where it gets complicated. Luden's Echo costs 3100 gold, and gives 120 AP. 3100+120? 3220. Nothing important right, except that we forgot the 7% movement speed Luden's also gives. And whats 3220 divided by 7? 460. 4+6+0=10. 10, the same as 5+5. but turn the + into a . and you have patch 5.5. But now we have a leftover +. + can also be seen as a t. Put the t onto the end of Luden to get Ludent. Ludent is a flouride chew (rito is sponsored?) who needs flouride for his teeth? EKKO CAUSE HE GOT SMACKED IN THE GABBER. AND GUESS WHAT, EKKO HAD A LADY FRIEND. Luden, could that be her possible name? In that case it would be Luden's Ekko, and Ekko's Luden. BUT WAIT THERES MORE( HEY THERE BILLY MAYS) Lud was the founder of London, making London, (which sounds a lot like Luden,) Ludanian or Luden for short. IS RITO PLANNING TO OVERTHROW AMERICA IN THE SECOND REVOLUTIONARY WAR OF AMERICA. BUT GET TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE. In the Welsh versions of Geoffrey's Historia, Lud is called Lludd. in another welsh tale, Lludd has to fight through three great plagues. THREE PEOPLE, THREEEE. WHAT ELSE HAS THREE, WELL THE ILLUMINATI TRIANGLE DOES OF COURSE. SO WHAT DOES RITO PLAN TO DO WITH EKKO AND HIS LOVER LUDEN. UNLEASH A GREAT PLAGUE UPON THE WORLD, PEOPLE. THE FACTS ARE ALL HERE. OPEN YOUR EYES EVERYONE (*insert lee sin joke here) THIS SPELLS TROUBLE. AND NOT IN THE FIGURATIVE WAY EITHER. What does everyone want from rito? Loreeeeeee. and what do the writers say? \"But the loreeeeeee is too hard\" but and lore can be anagramed into trouble. AND THE REMAINING WORDS. THE, IS, TOO, HARD. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAN BE ARRRANGED INTO. OH DEATH RITO. *DEATH RITO* PEOPLE. IF THAT DOESNT OPEN YOUR MIND TO THE GENOCIDAL MACHINE THAT IS RITO, THEN I DONT KNOW WHAT WILL. WE ARE FACING A CORPORATE MACHINE OUT FOR BLOOD and our wallets (pls the sales rito it hurts, I sold both my children and my house).
