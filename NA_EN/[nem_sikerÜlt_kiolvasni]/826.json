Hope the scene want be as one-sided as the two last splits... With Dignitas picking up Zion and Shiphtur, Curse picking up Xpecial, TSM hopefully solving their leadership problems, LMQ joining the league, CLG getting a new top lamer from the best region in the world, and C9 changing nothing what so ever; it seems promising for most teams. Hopefully most teams will show up better now; and give C9 a run for their money. Can't wait till may 23. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saint Latona","date":"2014-05-16T23:49:42.305+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"The USA ain't known as the \"melting pot\" of cultures for nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"General Ginge","date":"2014-05-17T03:56:02.932+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"It used to be a melting pot.

The correct thing to do in my view at this point really would be to find solid replacements for at least Snoopeh and Pete, as I could see an argument at the least for keeping Krepo on. Truth be told though, EG's backbone in Season 3 was Froggen. Without him, they seem lost. They have never had the highest level of mechanical skill overall, and it now seems clear that their old grasp of strategy isn't serving them well. They need to find an entirely new identity in order to be successful, and after a year and a half of trying to find one on their own, it seems likely that they will need a significantly different core lineup in order to find one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CeeJem","date":"2014-05-19T09:17:13.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My prediction would be:\r\n1.

So yeah he was a sub, but being a sub to one of the best toplaners in the world isn't really bad. The only game he played was vs Samsung Ozone and kaned against Looper. He won his lane but his team lost the game. He was #17 in Korean Ladder (believe me that proves he is really really good). P.s. we have seen him playing and he is very good just overextends a bit which i dont believe he will do in LCS + Darius was heard in oddones stream saying Seraph is the only person that solokilled him a couple of times","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"aznman908","date":"2014-05-20T20:40:42.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Motecristo is conducted the korean hype train...

Before the spring split started, LMQ played 3 consecutive games against TSM in an unofficial series, which they eventually lost (the series can be found on Sullla's Youtube channel).
