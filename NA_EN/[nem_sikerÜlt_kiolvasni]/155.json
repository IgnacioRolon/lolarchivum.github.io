My problem is that when I want to go and change the password, it says that the password I type in is \"incorrect\". The thing I find weird is that in order to change your password you need to log in to the website itself (the account I'm typing with currently), and that password works.\r\n-I am 100% sure that the password I am typing in is correct. \r\nCan someone help me maybe reset my password, or do anything to fix the problem?\r\n\r\nAlso I cannot get my email verified and changed since every time I ask the system to send me a verification email, I am not getting one... This has been a problem the last 3 days.\r\n\r\nThank you for looking into the issue :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-26T18:05:19.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A password not working is usually ar esult of being logged into a different region on the patcher, so make sure you are on the correct one!
