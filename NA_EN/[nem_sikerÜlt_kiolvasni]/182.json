Don't worry, MF will still laugh while ulting :)\"\n\nI agree that Miss Fortune is in a fairly healthy state, but no matter what you guys try... Make It Rain will never be great or even subpar. The ability stuns her for like .25-.30 seconds, which is nasty. The ability itself is easy to step out of, because the radius isn't even significant especially considering its high mana cost. I saw you guys said the slow is getting increased at low ranks, but it only slows you for 0.25 seconds anyway so when someone easily steps out of it, especially with the vast amounts of mobility champions have access to... it doesn't matter.\n\nMy suggestion would be removing the mini-stun it applies to Miss Fortune, and removing the damage in favor of applying Impure Shots stacks ( as well as the damage of it, itself ). It'd make more sense in conjunction with her kit, as well as compliment her play style as an aoe-styled adc. It'd be like one of those expensive, delicious icings to the cake for her Q, her W and her R.\n\nAs it stands already, her kit already revolves around Impure Shot stacks but there's just not enough access to it other than auto attacking and ulting, which does a small amount of damage unless you can stack up Impure Shots on champions ( which it is rare to stack it up against MULTIPLE champions).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QuasiStickfigure","date":"2015-07-07T19:14:44.911+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":1,"body":"her laugh is more scary than Sion's ulti sound","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dragon Fang Shot","date":"2015-07-07T18:36:56.071+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"Really hoping that it's just a bug or unfinished.","replies":[{"poster":"Loli Shen","date":"2015-07-07T19:12:31.012+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"What if she's getting a new VO????","replies":[{"poster":"Kazzaam","date":"2015-07-07T19:28:07.972+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"I hope not, MF's VO is one of the bests and really suit the character.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LaowPing","date":"2015-07-07T19:15:00.661+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"I freaked out the moment I didn't hear it.

The unchanged E might preserve her theme, but it doesn't help her fragile gameplay which revolves around teammates dedicated to protecting her in fights.\r\n\r\nAs for the W... removing grievous wounds, really?\r\nThis is one of MF's early dueling caveats as a good MF can calculate how much a heal reduction will restore enemy champions mid-skirmish and come out on top!\r\n\r\nBut instead... you chose to go with W triggering her passive.\r\n\r\nSo let's talk use-cases here, the following is a list of things on live, right now that would nullify MF's passive and make her easier to delete.\r\n\r\nSingle Target DoT's:\r\n- Brand Blaze\r\n- Caitlyn Yordle Snap Trap\r\n- Cassiopeia Noxius Blast\r\n- Darius Hemmorage\r\n- Fizz Seastone Trident\r\n- Gangplank Grog Soasked Blade\r\n- Malzahar Malefic Visions\r\n- Mordekaiser Children of the Grave\r\n- Nautilus Titan's Wrath\r\n- Nidalee Bushwhack\r\n- Singed Poison Trail\r\n- Swain Torment\r\n- Talon Noxian Diplomacy\r\n- Teemo Toxic Shot & Noxious Trap\r\n- Tristana Explosive Shot\r\n- Trundles Subjugate\r\n- Twitch Deadly Venom\r\n- Udyr Tiger Stance\r\n- Urgot Noxian Corrosive Charge\r\n\r\n[This part is sketchy because the passive is defined as:  [New] Strut now has increased scaling based on level, and only falls off when Miss Fortune takes direct, non-periodic damage.\"\r\n\r\n...If those are single target, DIRECT DoT's... would they not remove her passive?\r\n\r\nPLEASE CLARIFY >.<\r\n\r\nDon't forget about these:\r\n- Red Buff\r\n- Gift of the Toadstool / Gromp\r\n- Liandry's on any champion with magic damage sources\r\n- Cinderhulk / Sunfire Cape\r\n\r\nAoE Dots:\r\n- Anivia Glacial Storm\r\n- Cassiopeia Miasma\r\n- Corki Valkyrie\r\n- Gangplank Cannon Barrage\r\n- Katarina Death Lotus\r\n- Malzahar Null Zone\r\n- Morgana Tormented Soil\r\n- Nasus Spirit Fire\r\n- Pantheon Heartseeker Strike\r\n- Rumble Equalizer\r\n- Shyvana Burnout via Dragons Descent\r\n- Viktor Chaos Storm\r\n- Wukong Cyclone\r\n- Rammus Tremors\r\n\r\nMF Passive is supposed to ignore the above-mentioned and retain a MS speed bonus?\r\nPlease clarify, because on one hand this sounds like it can be useful but its not an escape per se like Vayne, Lucian, Graves, Corki, Sivir, Kallista, Tristana, Draven, Caitlyn, Ezreal, Quinn, Teemo, and Twitch have.\r\n\r\nThe other ADC's not listed (Ashe, Varus, Jinx, Kog'Maw) have very strong CC capabilities, stun/root/slow's.

I have been playing miss fortune since the day I joined league, she was my first champ and main since I started. I gotta say that her passive really needed some tuning cause her gameplay centered too heavily on relying on team to protect her. For as squishy as she is too she had no escape, so if you get caught out you're pretty much screwed. While I am glad riot has finally decided to change up her passive I am also disappointed they removed grievous wounds from her Impure Shots as it was one of her strongest abilities. If you ask me what I would have done I would've rather they change her passive  to where her strut activates more quickly when she is hurt (say 3 seconds instead of 5) and where it doesn't proc off of minion damage. I like the idea that they have her passive activate immediately off of W as it will be a good gap closer but not at the cost of her grievous wounds.

The grievous wounds wasn't hidden.  It was part of the reason her enemies couldn't rely as effectively on lifesteal in a duel and why she was particularly useful against certain champions.  The only way in which grievous wounds was hidden was that almost nothing actually grants grievous wounds anymore, which makes it feel more like it's simply an ability Riot is trying to phase out of League for the sake of \"clarity.\"\n\nThe rest of her update matches this, not that I dislike the other changes.  But what's clear and consistent in current League: (and I hate that I'm saying this because I'm not someone who's complained about its creep) Mobility.  So how do you changer her, by maker her the...er...a mobile ADC, and that might be a problem because not only are so many other ADCs mobile, but the mobile ones are far more mobile than her even with this tweak.  This means her mobility will mostly give her an edge against non-mobile ADCs and ADCs not laning with healing or CC using supports or using significant lifesteal in helping her chase them down.  I honestly don't know how many match-ups that's representative of, but it seems like a small number.\n\nThis is because while it will help her keep up, I don't know that it'll be enough to help her get away when being pursued more than her current kit will against today's mobile champs and plain ol' CC, and it certainly won't help her win fights.  I honestly kind of feel like she could have gotten some tweaks to strut to help make her mobile just as a QoL against a more mobile champion set that's emerged.  This is especially true because the core identity you're enforcing of a lot of bullets just isn't powered to hit hard enough to do real damage in mid to late game, so now in exchange for her mobility, you're taken away that much more relevance to her presence in those phases.\n\nThat said, I really like the idea of the buffs she's gotten.
