The person who owns their contract can.  In other words, putting out feelers in an unofficial fashion is punishable.  What doublelift and zionspartan did would be fine in most industries, including sports.  The contracts LCS players are forced to sign to participate give quite a bit of power to both riot and the team owners at the expense of the players.  The part where a player who is unhappy with his team can't talk to anyone who might give him a way out until his contract is gone and his team can put pressure on him to commit is not healthy for the players.  It also means that when somebody is trying to explore options discreetly.... guess what... it's not discreet because the team owner gets to know and the player doesn't get to be involved.  And do you really believe that the team owner is going to represent the player fairly when there is conflict with the player?\r\nThe issue here isn't about how easy to follow the rule is.  It's about the way this rule bans normal actions for players and creates an unhealthy environment for players that desire to see what other employment options are available to them.\r\nI understand that Riot was trying to protect team owners, and that's commendable, but their methods created a bad situation for players.  Honestly, without being a clg fan, I can't help but think that the real villain in the latest set of rulings against them are rules Riot created.  Punishing people for trying to expand their horizons is not a commendable action.

In sports, teams do this by setting up trades or buying a player's contract from another organization. But this talk takes place between the two organizations involved. It's not until a player's contract is up and they become a free-agent that teams can approach them directly (or they can approach teams).\n\nAlso, your attempted analogy isn't remotely applicable here. Out in the work force, you're basically a free-agent. Even when employed by one company, you're welcome to move around as you please.

People are quick to judge Riot based on conjecture, but the fact is each of these individuals signed a contract that stated they will not discuss team contracts and transfers before a contract is over. This is to prevent teams from poaching. Now, I do not believe that Doublelift was attempting to poach in the long term, I highly doubt that he was attempting to convince ZionSpartan to up and leave in the middle of the season and ZionSpartan DID finish out his contract before approaching. Having said that, it would set a bad precedent to allow it to go unpunished (and let's face it, the punishment is mild compared to the six figure salary many of these individuals make), given that they directly violated the rules stated by Riot. They could have held a conversation about the future while leaving out a mention of moving to another team, specifically the team that Doublelift played for.
