Clearly they weren't considering size changes because Malphite and Cho are vastly larger than the whole rift itself.  According to the log in art Dark Star Thresh is too.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaiju Boy","date":"2016-10-16T23:53:27.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, you can see Malphite's literal size in his splash art and in the \"Art of League\" book. While Cho'Gath and Malphite are some of the larger champs lore-wise, it has never really been stated officially that Cho'Gath or Malphite are THAT big. The only champ that could possibly be as big as Summoner's Rift would be Aurelion Sol, length-wise at the least, if you take a comparison of him and the structure in his splash.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-10-17T00:05:55.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, and Malphite in the art is the size of a small mountain.  Cho is of a slightly smaller size but we know that he grows as he feasts, so he could very well get bigger than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaiju Boy","date":"2016-10-19T00:35:24.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose that is quite possible.

The Void isn't really a good group to do a story on and a bunch of champs like Malphite just don't have many connections or reasons to be in other champ's stories.\n\nHeck, from his lore for all we know Malphite has never left the rift in his whole time in runeterra.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SuperiorLeague","date":"2016-10-06T02:11:09.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better Duck : ^ ) Duck up yo'{{champion:22}} // {{champion:15}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heart of Hades","date":"2016-10-05T19:18:27.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's awesome to see Trin featured omg!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeHolyKnight","date":"2016-10-05T01:53:00.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main man Trinimmortal {{champion:157}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xe1l0s","date":"2016-10-04T23:32:00.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WOO TRINIMMORTAL finally getting the recognition he deserves!! {{champion:157}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hamßone","date":"2016-10-04T15:17:49.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did Jessica go?
