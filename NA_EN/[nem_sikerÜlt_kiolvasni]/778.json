You say 7 out of 10, but whether they were really trying to win or not those 7 will still report them.  \r\n\r\nPersonally i think there is no excuse for AFK unless you were lagged out and can prove it.\r\n  \r\n*  AFKing should be 24 hour ban from League.  \r\n\r\n*  You lose ALL your LP, if you had less then what you normally would have lost it drops you down a division.  \r\n\r\n*  If you AFK again within 7 days, 30 day ban from Ranked.

And people who play ranked, they aren't afk'ing because they want to ruin your life! They don't even know you!! Sometimes people just have to afk, it's an emergency. Sure, there are people who say, \"I'm done, this adc sucks\" and goes afk. But come on, your opponents have those people too! An equal amount. It just seems more on your team because you actually care when people afk on your team. And people being toxic? People have bad games. They can get irritated. It happens. People are different.

I just dont main champs that can literally carry a team by killing the other team faster then they can kill us. As a support i try to support by either peeling or CCing or just sustaining but my efforts are not always followed up on or taken advantage of. As a tank i try to peel or take CC or even open up/kill their carries but it doesnt mean my team will follow up or take advantage of it.  \r\n\r\nNot saying im super good because im not, its just i find myself in the position of having to carry my team alot or being the leader because they dont seem to know what to do.
