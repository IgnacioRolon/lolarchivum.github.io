Do you know just how many champs would be forgotten if they weren't changed? I mean as is champs like Amumu are quite honestly rarely played and are mainly played when people first join league or by people who \"main\" the champ, and the reason being that Amumu is clunky boring with nothing new in his kit or maybe his animations are just uninteresting but when riot takes a champ an reworks them that champ not only gets a upsurge of being played but they also are more likely to be played after the whole new vibe is off because they become a lot more interesting or the end up having great animations and a genuinely fun kit. It will also take much much more time to release a new champ than to improve upon a currently lacking one, not only that but new and innovative maps take time, a lot of resources and, a lot of effort to make. These new maps will also require a lot of game optimization to make it so they run smoothly. My point is get your head out of the nostalgia cloud that is in and find enjoyment in the new thing, because only then will you actually find enjoyment in the things that riot does and in the game as a whole.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Andensia","date":"2018-05-01T00:28:20.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get a irelia skin riven has to many{{summoner:31}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"adjoth","date":"2018-04-30T22:59:21.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two things I dislike about the new Irelia, first is her 'w'. Its too easy to play around and often lacks any decent damage reduction to be of much use. Even more so when compared to other like ability (Fiora's W) it just seems like a cheap imitation. The other is her ult, specifically her ability to disable autos. In a group setting it has more use but in a 1v1 it mostly worthless unless you have a clear advantage for one simple reason. The won't move into it for the disable to take affect. Even in a group setting the duration is short enough to work with, not to mention the requirement to hit something first makes not very versatile.","replies":[{"poster":"GuardianV25","date":"2018-05-02T00:57:06.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooo are you asking for a nerf?","replies":[{"poster":"adjoth","date":"2018-05-04T00:56:42.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, if anything she (Irelia) needs a buff in her current state, particularly for her laning phase. She's still one of the weakest top laners forcing her to either play passive or just wait for mistakes. She has outplay potential but as it stands you got to outclass your opponent to take a lead with her. Basically in a fair 1v1 she's out damaged 2:1 or 3:2 depending on the match up.","replies":[{"poster":"GuardianV25","date":"2018-05-06T04:11:17.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's not exactly an early game champion.
