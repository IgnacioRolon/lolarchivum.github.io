A strong portfolio, having documented related field work, things like that can make up for a lot.

Although the Thresh and Shyvana skins were consistantly re-released and weren't the same kind of legacy skin that Championship Riven is, the particles and design didn't change much for them, and they feel like genuinely great skins as a result. I get that you want to make sure that the original owners are rewarded for having played the game when the skin was originally released, but I think that a custom loading screen card as well as the extra ult particles and the added crown is enough.
