Please try again\".\r\nSo I click on \"Forgot your password?\", and the client says it sent 'how-to-recover-password' to my email, which was the one deleted.(and of course I checked the email account I request to be changed to)\r\n\r\nthe in game ID is KRRI.\r\nplease fix this stupid situation and stop asking me to rewrite this through support ticket again and again?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T19:19:39.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It won't be possible to recover an account without access to the registered email, and you'll want a specialist from support to help out.
