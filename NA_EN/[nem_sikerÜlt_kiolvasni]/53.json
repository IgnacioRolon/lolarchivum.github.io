Runes have always been important to winning lane, and to me, they've always felt like very meaningful choices. If you look at professional player builds, or champion main builds, you'll see that some people run very strange runes to fill in gaps that their champion has, such as an {{champion:103}} Ahri who might run 5 percent attack speed in the mid lane to make her last hitting more fluid and reliable. Some people want to play with their luck, opting for a .93 crit chance mark instead of an attack damage one. \r\n\r\n  I'm truly afraid that, by making this change, you wont be able to fill in gaps that some champions tend to have as champions are constantly being changed, altered, revamped, redone, etc. Runes allowed players to fill in small little nerfs like a decreased base attack speed for a champ by sacrificing other runes in its stead. \r\n\r\nHow does Riot plan to make this feel like its own unique system, separate from masteries, that still allow for an adequate amount of champion based customization(if they do)?\r\n\r\nTL;DR  HALP!!","replies":[{"poster":"ADCsBabysítter","date":"2017-06-28T23:04:02.123+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot please reply to this.

There have been changes and buffs to other offensive Keystones, but anyone hoping to get the best of Kah and be competitive with him will always pick Thunderlord's, and so far I don't really see how Runes reforged will be that big of a difference where this won't occur. Sure, one Kah may use Battle Trance instead of Double Edged Sword, but you **still** will take Thunderlord's regardless.\n\nWhy would Kog not want Berserk every game? He's at his best when blasting baddies with high ASPD in the late game, and any other option would just detract from his most powerful form. Playing Kog'Maw to not be this late game powerhouse just means playing Kog as a lesser version of himself, and I don't think anyone who wants to main Kog would want that.\n\nI just feel there's always going to be a Rune that will improve a champion's kit the best over any other option simply based on the kits themselves. Because in the end, current masteries/runes and then Runes Reforged are a pre-game setup that aims to optimize a champion's kit so he or she can do what they're designed to do the very best.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SHORKS","date":"2017-06-28T18:28:44.200+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I dont think thats totally true.
