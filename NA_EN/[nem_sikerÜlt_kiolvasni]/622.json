What if we still tag him as Legacy, but he never leaves the store? This way, most of the year when there are no other Legacy skins available, he'll be the only skin that shows up under the 'Limited Availability' tag in the store, prompting people to ask their friends why. This way more League players will hear about Joe.\r\nIs that stupid? Is it just confusing?

Riot, last I checked, is a company. They have the LCS and equipment to afford, lighting/electricity (with so many servers, work computers, etc; can you imagine their electric bill?), salaries for their employees, and other expenses that they have to pay. League is a /free game/ and so letting people spend money on microtransactions (What's keeping them in business) isn't unreasonable.\r\n\r\n2. SKINS ARE OPTIONAL!!! Nobody is forcing you to buy these skins. Riot isn't making league a pay-to-play game. Riot isn't making you, for example, have to buy any champions you're missing only with real life money. If they did, I guarantee Riot wouldn't have as big of a playerbase.\r\n\r\nThey're a company that needs to stay in business. I understand that all of these skins should make the people that already own them feel like they should get some sort of additional reward, but the fact you have a skin that now, nobody else can get for a really long time (I'm talkin' months, here.) should be a reward in and of itself.\r\n\r\nTl;Dr - Stop QQing. Riot's a business. Either buy the skins or don't. It isn't that hard not to complain about their business decisions.","replies":[{"poster":"CamelCrusher","date":"2015-08-21T05:46:13.705+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"\r\n*slow clap* Bravo bravo.... and just to add.. have nobody seen the server move project they're doing for NA? they are doing it so players have a more equal quality game play connection.... personally I'm quite impressed by the company and appreciative of a company whom thinks about their clients... currently I rock a 115 ish ping, and server move should cut that in half, so I say bravo to someone who can see more of then just themselves and the intellect to know to understand and voice their view.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Foreman Grills","date":"2015-08-20T21:43:11.626+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm okay with Riot taking out skins like Toxic Mundo which are really horrible by today's standards, but many people still like Jaximus, Queen Ashe, and Obsidian Malphite.
