I just created a new account to try him out and so on and so on and it seems he's all ready overpowered if played right as it is. (Builds full ap) I noticed that getting stacks was way to easy, going in and hitting the opponent twice without my toungue and then running away to make them chase just a tad bit to use my w to eat them and throw them into the or back at the minions or even my own teammate to finish the kill.\r\nMy point being, since i got a little to much into details, I wouldn't look at it as anything to fix but instead look at it as a skillshot which it is.

I said if the enemy is standing right on top of you, and your point and click ability works on either, it will often enough be a complete gamble on who it will land on because it casts on the target under the mouse pointer, except you and the enemy are practically on the same spot. \n\nMelee enemies as a general rule will attempt to stay on top of you some, like fizz, can run through you. So in what way can I use \"skill\" to make sure the ability goes off on him instead of me? There is a hotkey to force self cast for this reason, so you can make sure it goes off on you if you don't wan it to go off on him. I don't understand why there isn't one to force it on him. It's a basic mechanics issue. It doesn't affect most champs, but on those that it does, like lissandra who I play a lot, it's extremely aggravating.\n\nIn the case of Tahm, if an enemy with 3 stacks is standing right on top of an ally, how can you ensure your devour will go off on them and not the ally? You can't.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedoro","date":"2015-07-16T10:58:24.310+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look up the [~] key in your keybindinglist.
