It requires you to level up in order to get BE, and you miss out on 30 levels worth of BE if you are already level 30. Unless you are brand new to the game, this system does not work out in your favor well. It is substantially harder to do things like gain Mastery levels 6 and 7 for champions, and buy champions. What set LoL apart from other free games was that it wasn't a 'pay to win' game, skins are just extras. Now, LoL's currency system works just like any other mobile game. Level up, get rewards quickly at the start. Reach a certain point, leveling becomes slower and you gain less and less rewards over time. At that point you either grind, grind, grind for hours on end, stop playing the game because of its lack of consistent rewards, or buy what you need with real money. The even sadder thing is that it's a gamble every time you level up, you can either get champions you don't own, expensive champion shards, or cheap champion shards that won't give you much BE. I loved the feeling of wanting a new champion, then playing games and watching my IP grow more and more until I had enough for that champion. And it took a while too, but it was a worthwhile grind. Now you're just grinding for an unknown amount of BE. Was Riot's IP system really holding back on their profits? Is 1,628 million (and counting) dollars worth of transactions not good enough for them? Riot is constantly releasing new skins, and there will always be people there who want those skins. I have heard that many people might leave the game because of its 'pay to win' feel it has now. I am sick of playing game after game and looking at my BE just stay where it's at. If Riot made it so you would get an amount of blue essence after a game (maybe, half as much earnings you got from IP, or even a quarter), then people would know that they're earning something from every game they play, which is what keeps them playing. I kept playing because I wanted that new champion. Now you can't do anything but hope that you get good champion shards on your next level up (which is very time-consuming). Hopefully this will be fixed, maybe after the BE store shuts down, this change has made me pretty angry, along with many others.","replies":[{"poster":"dubz98","date":"2017-11-10T14:50:00.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":34,"body":"no you don't the mission at the beginning of the update gives you a lot of BE","replies":[{"poster":"imjchiang","date":"2017-11-12T05:32:52.101+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is just the mission in the beginning though. If there were missions like that once a week I wouldn't be complaining, but I personally leveled up to level 32 within the past 3 days and got only 500 blue essence worth of champs that I already own. Now just  to give you an idea of the time comparisons. I played 20 games averaging 30 minutes in the past three days. This resulted in approximately 500 BE. Now if you look at before the update, I could earn around 500 IP (or now BE) in two wins on separate days assuming the games last around 30 minutes. So do the initial mission benefits outweigh the grinding necessary to meet the conditions before the update? No, not at all.","replies":[{"poster":"rbaajla","date":"2017-11-19T21:19:13.642+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree with this.
