They are the finished product of when chaos meets order. At MSI, Koro1 was the superior top laner, Deft better than Bang, Meiko having the tournament of his life, and Clearlove significantly better than Bengi atm. They seemed to be able to keep SKT on their toes at all times. Of course when Faker came in, SKT felt secure than mid lane wouldn't lose lane against Pawn (which Easyhoon did twice), but SKT had a lackluster pick ban phase during that series.","replies":[{"poster":"Dodgyr","date":"2015-09-02T18:48:10.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easyhoon didn't lose to PawN, he even beat him in cs and score in the ori game, and cs in the cassi game.... watch the games before you talk about em.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Guanyuzhizi","date":"2015-06-16T19:38:25.332+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"lol..\r\n\r\npreaching the \"superior SKT-style\", and not mentioning EDG's execution of the chaotic style which defeated the former","replies":[{"poster":"GenderFluidDruid","date":"2015-06-17T07:56:21.229+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah it is a bit weird that they have FNATIC as the example of \"Chaos\" style when EDG is by far the best team playing this \"Style\" and even defeated SKT who the best at \"SKT\" style.\r\n\r\nKind of bizarre actually that they fail to mention EDG.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadowguynick","date":"2015-06-16T23:28:39.163+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because that's the only reason they lost right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"zStewie","date":"2015-06-17T19:29:26.642+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Their game 5 win was a result of them baiting faker and SKT into the LB pick.
