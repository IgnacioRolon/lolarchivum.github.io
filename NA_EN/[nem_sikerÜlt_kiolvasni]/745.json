Or they would make content that enhances game play in the form of stat boosting that costs actual money instead of IP.

I'm just not going to pretend they're doing it with other thoughts in mind.\n\nBy having it on the weekends, they get spikes. The majority excitement fades after a day or two. Having more opportunities to have that 1~3 days of excitement fuels people to want to buy X skin to use for Y gamemode. That's what excitement does, it makes people excited.\n\nBy having it on for the whole week it would garner less overall profit, because the excitement wouldn't be as high on the peek days, and would trail off more quickly. The enjoyment people get from the modes would be increased overall, yes. But the level of peek excitement just isn't the same.\n\nIt is a very smart marketing plan to limit the amount a thing is available, to the times it will make the most money through the excitement of the consumer.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dexwin09","date":"2016-04-09T01:10:18.410+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"and then riot asks themselves why players are quitting LoL.. we have the same game modes every time (Armam and Summoners Rift normal (who plays twisted treeline anymore?))\r\nthey should just rotate them for the whole year, at least just the weekends to dispose all the salt in our bodies and just relax in fun game modes..","replies":[{"poster":"HDK ShadowArcher","date":"2016-04-09T17:25:44.348+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play twisted treeline all the time, nobody wants to learn the strategy of it, it's sad really {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nerf This","date":"2016-04-08T21:03:14.745+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":4,"body":"All I saw was URF","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FaIIenShadow","date":"2016-04-08T20:30:54.024+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":2,"body":"URF The weekend before exams. {{item:3070}} \r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aubin100","date":"2016-04-08T19:48:28.740+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":89,"body":"Its like if rito wants me to hate them.\r\n\r\n1.
