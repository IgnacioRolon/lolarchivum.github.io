One is easy/simple spells to animate, another is an easy/simple model and the last is popularity. \r\n\r\nLux and Ezreal are two of the most popular champions and have very simple models making reskinning them fairly easy. Their spells also aren't crazy complicated either meaning you can redo them decently quick, it's part of why Ahri also has like a billion skins: she's popular and her spells aren't complicated to make variations of. \r\n\r\nIvern has a complicated model since he doesn't obey standard proportions for a human, well his spells aren't complicated his ultimate requires a second model to be made for each skin because of Daisy which adds more work, and his popularity isn't insane either, on Champion.gg he's sitting at 137/207 in terms of play rate with a play rate of 0.98%, as context Jungle Twitch has a 1.66% play rate.

It feels like we've gone back to to the prior Runes and Masteries system, but with less diverse paths in the opposite tree and the only benefit is ease of customization over actual customization. \n\nWhere Runes were extremely diverse and we could customize all the stats we wanted, and the Masteries were bland but marginally effective in their own way. Now it is Masteries that are diverse [the regular precision/sorcery paths and such] and very, almost excessively, effective; but the Runes (which is now the stat tree choice) are extremely limited and preloaded. \n\nIt has gone full circle, but limited freedom in exchange for a better UI, which could have easily been applied to either prior iteration. At this point, reverting Runes Reforged seems even more attractive, albeit not as feasible nor suggested. But going wholeheartedly with that older philosophy and redesigning it as such feels much more effective than forcing whatever design this had in mind which always falls short as well as causes so many balance issues, damage creep, and stunted variability in the game.
