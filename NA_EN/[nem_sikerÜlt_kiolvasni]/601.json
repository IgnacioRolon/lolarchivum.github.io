While I fell that Riot should keep their amazing ARAM game mode on the Freljord inspired map, they should also  make this new map the style of their old special event game mode (1v1/2v2) so you can classically duel your enemy in an old fashioned showdown or fight along side your partner in the fitting pirate paradise.

Please do give your though on this if you feel otherwise or see improvements/ just want to support the idea. Thanks and good luck on the rift!  P.S.
