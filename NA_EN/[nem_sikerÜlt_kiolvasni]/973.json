Riot needs to fix it so chat logs show all chat history in the logs however censored names similar to tribunal.\n\nWe need a way to appeal punishments that are false after being spam reported by toxic players themselves, unless of course the new system only punishes players as stated for this reason: ( homophobia, racism, sexism, death threats, and other forms of excessive abuse.) If this is the case I have nothing to worry about, but with the previous system I was always getting restrictions because players spam verbal abuse reports, after refusing communication, or harassing chat even with no text typed in some games at all you still get behavioral warnings at times of being spam reported. \n\nI am all for dealing with the extremely toxic players,  and those who just start arguments in games, and don't know when to accept (NO) for an answer, or those who spam others with threats of reporting one another for simply having bad games especially in those where players don't talk in champion select or understand what they are doing it happens a lot.\n\n**I also want to know when Riot is going to fix Champion Select Toxicity.** I have been getting a lot of toxicity in Solo Queue lately.\n\n. Non Communication,\n. Players who auto lock.\n. Players who say they are filling a role, change their mind without informing players.\n. Players who do not know what they are doing (Not really punish worthy but for me its a major problem)\n. Players who say hateful things when a person says they can't play (X) Role effectively.\n\n. Players who do bad after being forced into a role because of either unskilled players or just doing badly because they are new to something or don't actively fill a specific role a lot.\n\n**We need a solution** I know riot said they were going to add role finder to Ranked Solo Queue, and I believe this would solve alot of toxicity.\n\n. My personal match history would be a lot better\n. It would lower toxicity of (X) Role or feed\n. It would allow players to fill the roles they want to\n. In general I believe over-all toxicity would drop\n\nThere is just too much toxicity around champion select often because players argue over role, and some players just can't play specified roles effectively so players do bad then players get toxic in chat, adding a role selection would allow players who want to fill specified roles to be able to fill them.\n\n**The third issue but its not as big of a problem**\n\n.
