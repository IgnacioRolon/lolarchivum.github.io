And then when she finally gets back to the surface where she came from, her people treat her like a monster, like the monsters she's been running from and fighting all her life.\r\n\r\nAnd everyone has these chibi and bright and shiny anime representations of her as if she's some sort of happy-go-lucky magic girl or something. As if her life hasn't been hell or like she's not on the brink of going insane (which I dunno if she is or isn't, the stories don't say, but I can't imagine that kind of solitude in those conditions can be healthy).\r\n\r\nThe closest thing to what the mood might actually be is the Sinister Kai'Sa, but even that one is frustrating because according to the story, she's not evil, nor does she take pleasure in the hunt.\r\n\r\nI am the frustrated! {{sticker:sg-shisa}} ","replies":[{"poster":"LainSitting","date":"2018-03-08T03:01:47.444+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe share some blame with the designer who makes her look like a high-fashion super model.

I remember reading a bit that explained that the facial structure of every female league champ before Taliyah was basically the same. That frustrates me a lot.

She does have a cool look, but her look is more in line with, say, a bounty hunter who intentionally innovated the void to use it as a weapon against them or something.

She's portrayed as righteous in many ways, and far from vengeful or even spiteful towards the void. I feel like the story tellers could've given a little more anger in her character, more sorrow from her past(or current standings with civilization), or both, and given her A LOT more emotional/psychological depth. Rather than someone who essentially embraced the void and now is fighting it for the greater good.\r\n\r\n2:Communities often like to take characters out of their natural scene. If something appears bright and cheery, a community will make depictions of twisted horror and nightmares. If something looks terrifying or grotesque, people will make it happy and chibi. This can partly be explained by the simple want of having a character depicted in all scenarios, kinda like the emotion panels where it'll have a character when they're sad, happy, mad, etc. If a character is already happy and excited, they'll need to create an image where they are sad or angry, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's just my 2 cents on the topic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sol Sovereign","date":"2018-03-08T16:00:16.351+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"What are you even on about?

Maybe thou protest too much methinks?  What one person finds sexy, another might find meh.  Not to mention... LoL is all over the world.  Go look what some people in a very different culture find sexy/cute and you might be surprised.  Also, I would guess most of the champs are aged 15-35 so apart from a couple of exceptions (like Annie whose what, 10?) I'd expect the blossom of youthful female bodies to be present.  Also, typically, who wins the most fights to get in to the hardest competitions?  The fit iron abs chicks.  Look at the girls in UFC and such, they aren't fat or grotesque because they focus on their bodily health.  That pays dividends in the attractiveness department.  The only argument I see that you could really use about them being too sexy would be the age old 'super skimpy bra armor gives more protection' principle, assuming you're into huge amounts of cleavage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sol Sovereign","date":"2018-03-09T06:33:25.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just watching that video I had seen one \"dark\" image, 3 neutrals, and maybe 2 \"cutes\". Kai'sa hasn't been out long enough to even get enough artwork for complaints. DA only has around 140 images (many just being wallpapers of her splash) and pixiv only has 12. Conventionally attractive doesn't ≠ hollywood. From a lore standpoint she could look like anything so I'm not sure how Kai'sa being conventionally attractive breaks her lore. Going by her dialogue I'd say she's rather optimistic to say the least. I mean, one would have to be to not go insane by such circumstances.\r\n\r\nKayn and Varus are far more attractive then men in hollywood and I see no problems with that given that they hosts for super demons. In my estimation, Azir has the most heart-breaking lore and if he can be drawn and be presented with levity, then anyone in this game can. I brought up Vel'koz from before. Almost all of his are is silly and cute.
