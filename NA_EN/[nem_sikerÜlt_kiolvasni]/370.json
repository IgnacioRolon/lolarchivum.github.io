Their comments seem to be based in an expectation that the \"worse\" teams will always lose against the \"best\" teams. In reality, if you have a league where great talent is fielded by every organization, and stability has been granted through franchising, then we should *expect* teams like Golden Guardians or Optic to come out and have a chance to win on \"any given Sunday\" against teams like C9 or Echo Fox. Sure, you can reasonably predict the higher ranked team will win against the lower ranked team, but *especially* in best-of-1s, dropping one or two games per split to lower ranked teams is not necessarily  indicative of a team's downtrend into bad play. It may just mean this league has the chance to be really interesting every split. \r\n\r\nWe don't watch because we know what happens. We watch because of what *might* happen. That is the essence of sport, and even taking the time to figure out CLG's 3 playoff scenarios proves that deep down we want to see the impossible happen.\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Zim Zim","date":"2018-03-14T03:21:22.447+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree, it is just like the NHL, sometimes the top team loses to the bottom team. Does it mean the bottom is better? No. But goes to show anyone can have a good day/game and win, or the other way have a bad day/game and lose. Really the main difference comes down to consistency.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dilwoah","date":"2018-03-18T17:21:36.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually not good for the GAME at all.

C9, 100T, CG and GGS were the teams I was particularly keen on. C9 is pretty self-explanatory after their amazing first half. 100T as an organization seemed like it had more tools in their pocket, and with that roster, I felt like they had a lot more potential than their counterpart in Optic that joined the league. There was always the chance that they would flop, but with how they approached the game I had a feeling they couldn't be easily counted out.\r\n\r\nI honestly thought that CG had one of the best rosters, excluding the insane \"implosive\" roster that Echo Fox got, so I was still high on them, even after their awful losses. To me, they've already proven themselves to be a top tier team. The organization as a whole and the consistent play I've seen out of this roster has given me that faith they they will perform at the highest level they possibly can, even if they lose. GGS on the other hand, I thought would come into the split on a winning high and then fall off come the end of the split. However, I think it's better it turned out this way as it means that GGS actually are steadily improving to be quite a scary team and with Hai on the roster, I can always expect crazy plays. This team is one step away from being a Gigabyte Marines style of team and I like that a lot.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the league as a whole has been upgraded, seeing as I'm rooting for both bottom and top tier teams. On any given day, if the playoffs were a one off thing every week, I could see just about any team winning it all depending on how good their performance is on any given week. That makes this season all the more exciting and I can't wait to see where my favorite four teams will end up come the end of this season. It sure to be a good one with no teams with a terrible record going into the next split.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrollFan01","date":"2018-03-14T03:26:29.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I laughed so hard at option D","replies":[{"poster":"Pollo Fresco","date":"2018-03-14T16:22:02.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Option D is the most logical one :p","replies":[{"poster":"PwnLove","date":"2018-03-14T19:47:20.478+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pollo Fresco,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=XEPpRkuf,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-03-14T16:22:02.284+0000)\n>\n> Option D is the most logical one :p\n\nIt's the most faithful option :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PwnLove","date":"2018-03-14T19:46:43.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TrollFan01,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=XEPpRkuf,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-14T03:26:29.717+0000)\n>\n> I laughed so hard at option D\n\nGlad you liked it - Option D was my contribution, hehehe {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nate GG","date":"2018-03-14T23:10:37.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's is great for the scene that the 3 teams that were pegged to be the best by far prior to the season starting (TSM, TL and CLG) are the 3 teams fighting for the last playoff spot.

Right now NA has been described as quiet or even chaotic. We don’t know for sure who the top teams are. While bo1 fluctuates that and allows other teams opportunities to climb to the top, especially new orgs, I feel it doesn’t show as much in comparison to like LCK or LMS. While NA is behind the structure of esports relative to Korea, for a real chance at worlds, they need to have more rigorous structure than bo1’s. Look at both first and second place teams. They fell to bottom tier teams. They got complacent. This should not happen. Just my thoughts.

In the end NA will send their best team to MSI. I was opposed to Bo1 when it was first announced, but I have to admit it has been a lot better experience this split, as a viewer. I'm confident the 6 teams going to the playoffs will be better than the 4 staying home. Bo1 did it's job, now we'll see who can handle Bo5 in the play offs.","replies":[{"poster":"Dane Belthound","date":"2018-03-15T13:10:44.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have seen BO1s in NA LCS before. NA gets to any international event and they would collapse once they got to BO3 or 5 matches because they lacked the experience of having to adjust to a team throughout the course of several matches. When we went to BO3, it felt like they struggled in the BO1 round robin. I don't know what the answer is honestly. It seems no matter what, NA struggles in some aspect of the tournament.
