As he approached, the sun was near its zenith, and the light sparkled off of the snowy leaves.\r\n\"Your late.\"\r\n\"I apologize heartily, but your brethren Ursine were quite adamant about not wanting me within the borders of this forest.\"\r\n\"If they were truly adamant, they would not have let you pass.\"\r\n\"Whoever said anything about them letting me?\"\r\n\"IF YOU LAID A FINGER ON MY BRETHREN AND EXPECT ME TO NEGOTIATE I SWEAR...\"\r\n\"Calm down Volibear (440 RP), I am a defender, a guardian, not a \"warrior\" like those two bears that tried to kill me.\"\r\n\"Strength is the only true way to beat the oncoming blight, not defense and protection.\"\r\n\"What good is strength if you are not unified. Do you expect to just throw troops one by one at the powerful and deceitful ice witch and hope one of them kills her? Now, let us get back to the topic at hand.\"\r\n\"You are right, I apologize, we did not come here to debate philosophies, and I will deal with their impudence later. So, you came here to talk about a contingency plan.\"\r\n\"Yes, in the case where the Freljord is not unified when we strike, Ashe has proposed that we choose a temporary general.\"\r\n\"That would be a wise choice. Do you have anyone in mind?\"\r\n\"We were thinking...\" a rustle nearby \"Well, we've heard of a tactical genius known as Swain.\"\r\n\"WHAT!\"\r\nVolibear wasn't the only one with a shocked reaction, a sharp intake of breath from nearby told Braum all he needed to know. He quickly fired a blast of pure winter at his target, then raised his shield to protect himself and Volibear from the poison fangs that fired back. Now Voli realized why Braum had said Swain.\r\nThere was a spy.\r\nDriven by outrage, he summoned a lightning bolt and channeled it through his hand and fired it at the target. A quick zap later, and a snake fell out of the bush.\r\nJade Fang Cassiopeia (487 RP) attempted to get up but was stopped by Braum's sheild.\r\n\"Well, well, well, it is not honorable to spy, do you know that?\" asked Braum.\r\n\"You know what Sejuani does to spys?\" continued Volibear.\r\n\"You will not be doing anything anytime soon. I will be collecting a bounty on your head\" said Headhunter Master Yi (487 RP) as he dashed in, his Bird of Prey, also known as Anivia (260 RP) was close in toe. \r\nThinking fast Braum smashed the ground knocking up both the Headhunter and his Bird of Prey, but it wasn't enough. Anivia set up a wall while Yi meditated to get his focus back, then he rushed in with an alpha strike, hacking rapidly at Braum's shield while he defended.\r\nVoli rushed in and flipped Yi back, while Braum jumped in front of Voli just in time to defend as Anivia fired an onslaught of ice at both of them.\r\nThey all stopped and looked at each other. They had reached a standstill, and they were all waiting for someone to flinch.\r\nSuddenly, they heard a hiss and the sound of turrets firing. A big boom as an onslaught of rockets hit their targets was heard, followed by a flying Jade snake flying into the courtyard.\r\n“I hope I’m not too late,” said Heimerdinger (395 RP) as he walked into the clearing, “In exchange for a lesser sentence, one of the prisoners in Piltover told us that Noxus had sent a spy to eavesdrop on a meeting; and since I’ve always wanted to study the Freljord,  I decided I might try to come and help you.\r\n“Looks like a little someone tried to escape during the fight,” said Volibear, “I wonder what I will do to you know.”\r\nSuddenly, Braum had an idea: “Hey, if you guys want a bounty, why not just take this spy off our hands. I’m sure she’s hurt a lot of people.”\r\n“As wise as always Braum,” Anivia said, “I am glad you are here to defend the ice while I clear out other villains from the world.”\r\n“Then we have a deal,” said Yi, “Let’s go Anivia.”\r\nAs they walked away, Braum turned to Heimerdinger: “Thank you Heimer. Now Voli, about that treaty…”\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gubby Toad","date":"2014-11-03T15:51:08.202+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Braum or heimer?
