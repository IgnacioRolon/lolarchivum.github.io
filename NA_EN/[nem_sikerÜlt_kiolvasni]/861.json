Huni will beat Dyrus top no matter what champion he plays, and Febiven will be able to hold his own against Bjergson(Who is the best mid in the west). I think the bot lanes are equal, both have mediocre ADCs who are carried by their supports. The only way Fnatic loses is if Santorin is able to out pressure the lanes early, which is a real possibility. However, so much of the TSM strategy revolves around Bjergson doing well, and i dont see him beating Febiven in lane without considerable help from Santorin.
