I would have been interested in the OG vs KTR matches b/c how well OG did against FNC in the EU Finals but after losing their coach, I am not sure how, if at all, they were bothered. TSM ... have yet to fix whatever their problems are from communication, teamfighting, and generally not being on tilt the moment \"M\" and \"S\" are next to each other. If TSM Legends is anything to go by, their latest episode shows that TSM is far from challenging anyone in their group as they are right now. \r\n\r\nSo, to say that \"any of the four teams could make it out\" could not possibly be more misleading.

I don't agree with this at all. I understand the regional mismatch between EU and the Asian regions but AHQ above them? Fnatic's biggest strength is the coordination and cohesion between one another, their communication and shotcalling is among the best in the world and I feel this is where they will pull their biggest advantage; as team coordination is where the other teams in their group are weakest. That being said, I know IG has solid synergy, kakao works in that roster absolutely amazingly, however, FNC's bot-mid combo outclasses IG's in nearly every way, especially the bot lane. The international experience of yellow and rekkles will give them a big edge over the heavily mechanical but under experienced duo of Kid/Kitties. I believe FNC can easily get out of this group and I wouldn't be surprised to find them in the finals. rito nerf essay gg","replies":[{"poster":"Andersonthegreat","date":"2015-09-17T04:20:53.635+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"FNC lost badly to AHQ in the MSI.","replies":[{"poster":"Tobbydehuiself ","date":"2015-09-17T15:01:38.605+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"dude you forget that steelback was their adc then. with him their early game was a lot weaker because he was  (even in EU) losing lane.
