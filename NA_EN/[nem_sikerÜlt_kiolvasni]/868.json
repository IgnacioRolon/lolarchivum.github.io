Are you feeding faker trolls?  There are already enough people stuck in a time period two years past....Why provoke them?  Faker and SKT didn't even make it to worlds last year because better mid laners and better teams took them out.  Pawn > Faker I think should be pretty obvious and there are other mids better then faker now too.  He sits the bench on his own team with his...legendary champion pool because...What ? Easyhoon plays some champs better then him?   So hes not even the greatest player on his team for certain but hes still the best player in the world for some reason.  Get off it,  doesn't make sense.   If nothing else...realize pawn deserves some recognition for his accomplishments and listing Faker as the TOP mid is a insult to him.   \r\n\r\n     Anyone saying things like....\"CN better than KR? K.\"  Don't realize that the top Korean team right now...SKT, couldn't make top three kr last year,  before the best players left Korea for china.   Pawn being sick is the only reason faker might have a chance,  otherwise Pawn owns faker...Not only is he a better mid hes a better leader for his team.  \r\n\r\n    Anyways...Noobs I know faker has a cool name that all the kids like to say...faker faker faker.  In all reality faker is not the best anymore and hasn't been for a long time.   Riot trolls are feeding the noob trolls by saying over and over that Faker is THE GREATEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD.

If anything, Pawn solo killed faker a number of times last year, carried White to victory and carried EDG in many of their games this year too. His assassins such as kass and leblanc are just as good as faker's if not better. However, as it stands, Faker is still easily within top 5 if not top 3 in the mid laner ranking. The only people that I can think of that are arguably better than faker are maybe Pawn, Apdo, Godv (weiless) and Westdoor but at the same time other mid lane stars such as Rookie, Bjerg can easily show up and carry games with the support of their teammates. That said, rly excited to see Faker vs Pawn vs Westdoor vs Bjerg at MSI.

If we forget that Pawn usually lost vs Easyhoon, that he never was a top 2 korean midlaner eventhough SSW was arguebly the best/2nd best team there, that he have had a slump in China and that he picks off-meta assassins which is the main reason why he have performed better on them, since Faker haven't played an assassin in ages (expect Leblanc and you gotta be bold if you are stating that Pawn is better than Faker on Leblanc).\r\n\r\nI don't know. For me, it seems that people love to pick up on these Pawn's solokills but forget that Pawn was in a superior team in season 4 and that he never had the same Impact as Faker in the teams he played with. Sure Pawn is an amazing midlaner and can surely compete with Faker. but stating that he is better than Faker because he solokilled him or because he was in worlds and Faker wasn't isn't too good of an explanation, and would have arguebly been totally different if Faker was the one in Samsung White while Pawn was on SKT.\r\n\r\nAside from that, pros like Dandy and Mata in recent intervies still believe that Faker is the bset. I don't know even know how you can put Weiless and Westdoor ahead of Faker but Apdo has stated himself that he thinks Faker is better than him as a player.\r\n\r\nPS. I do believe that Faker is overrated however I also believe that he is still the best midlaner in the world and the weak arguement of ''he was good in s3, pawn solokilled him, faker isn't #1 anylonger'' just doesn't make sense if you look at the big picture and what Faker did for SKT in season 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-04T23:42:55.212+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"That post, is beautiful.\n\nhttps://31.media.tumblr.com/80ac19f16cc265a6795ea81ab694c6ec/tumblr_inline_mw6lagi7pQ1rv7u3r.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"its Erenee","date":"2015-05-08T05:56:17.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think at such professional levels, its pretty difficult to rate everyone because everyone has their weaknesses and strengths","replies":[]},{"poster":"Andadog","date":"2015-05-06T08:43:55.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"People can continue to argue about PawN and Faker  but lets not forget Toyz who also was considered the best mid laner of all time","replies":[]},{"poster":"SinatraZ","date":"2015-05-05T04:12:39.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Pawn is overrated.

Is it just me or does that not seem odd that they would focus on that.\n\nSecond, Easyhoon is brought into the lineup for strategic diversity. It has been brought up before that Faker optimizes aggressive play styles. Easyhoon has always been known for his defensive play styles, Xerath, Cassio, Azir (to some extent) are champions that he excels at and rightfully so is shown to be better than Faker at (his aggressiveness in the LCK Finals vs GET was stunning but not the norm for him). Both of them will be at MSI (as teams are required to bring only one sub) so SKT will be able to have the diversity of both.\n\nNow, onto the Faker v PawN. It is true that PawN has on multiple occasions killed Faker 1v1 (some of them should be mentioned are after multiple ganks and camping sessions which Faker lived through but that is besides the point). Back in Season 4 PawN's play style was a control mage/passive style. He played Orianna and Morg to much effect to counter Fakers all in play. Its a conflict of strategy.\n\nI do not agree that there is only a single \"best\" player in the world. There is too much variance in play styles, roles in the team and overall the game is not a single player game. It's a team game, but I will mention that Faker thorough out season 4 had one of the shittiest teams in KR. Bengi played like shit, Piglet was off. PooMandu was garbage. Impact was the only other force on the team and he wasn't a carry top.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowFiend812","date":"2015-05-04T17:33:46.805+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"How did this one come up before edg?","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-04T17:44:13.821+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"They already had it written because they already knew that SKT was going to win.\nIlluminati confirmed.\n\nTo be honest, its likely just a scheduled format.

Pawn however always managed to do well against faker, whether he solo killed him on talon or nidalee, but he has also lost to faker, horribly, faker on riven, zed, jayce and leblanc have all seen pawns demise. Faker was dominant in s3, and people overhype him ALL THE TIME because of that, even though he still has flawless professional records on the most champions of any player ever, but besides that, faker still loses, we all know that. Pawn I will say in my opinion is the better LANER, however faker brings his force to the larger team fights around early and consistent dragons or dives. No matter what angle you look at it from, both players are great. Faker may have a better record, but pawn has surely outclassed him in many regards. So for all the people saying pawn leblanc>faker leblanc, just look at the stats.... Really.... And for all the faker fanboys, look up faker vs pawn, the first thing you see is pawn solo killing him. Neither player is better, nor does that even matter... Whoever wins is what matters. Whether it comes to faker xerath vs idk pawn fizz. Pawn will probably get the 1v1 while faker e+w+q the baron for a steal. Both are great. So shut up and watch the MSI and spam reddit about who wins.
