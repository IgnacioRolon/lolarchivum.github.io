I'm very sorry that we missed your piece. I love the idea of showing two sides of Aurelion Sol, and really appreciate how crisp your line work is. \r\n\r\nIn no way do we want to discourage traditional artists (this is my preferred medium as well). Though because digital art is quite prevalent, it can sometimes be challenging to find a balance for the gallery. There's just so much amazing art out there! We try to include a mix of new creators and styles whenever possible, but I will endeavor to increase the frequency.\r\n\r\nAwesome! I'm a fan of BlondynkiTezGraja's work as well, and was happy to include her Jhin art and some other traditional pieces in the last community post.
