These concerts are a thing of wonder. I was hoping for Against the Current to perform the theme song at the Bird's Nest on the day of the Finals in the wake of Imagine Dragons in 2014, but even if they weren't going to do that and there was no live music that day, I'd say the quota was more than fulfilled by this amazing event the night before. I see a Warroirs image up there, but Imagine Dragons is in the middle of their US tour, so I'm not expecting them at the show.\n\nBut even then... live music is such a wondrous thing. People playing their instruments, together or as soloists, is some of the most amazing stuff to watch, specially if it's being recorded. Masters at their craft and an amazing display of skill, hard work and talent are just some of the few things that start describing real concerts, with real people playing real instruments.\n\n#KeepLiveMusicAlive\n\nIt's also always great to see Olympic venues being used for events like this, specially seeing the situations of Athens and Rio. It's so important that the infrastructure built for the games has a purpose and a use after the games are gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Eroica","date":"2017-10-19T05:37:03.421+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you a musician? \r\nIn the digital age we sometimes take for granted that what we hear in soundtracks in movies or video games is SO PERFECT.

I'm also an engineer you see, so I just found it more fun to take my time with something I may have recorded and fine tuning it than the frenzy that dealing with live sound can be. But I was introduced to music appreciation since very young by my dad. We'd attend orchestra concerts, and later in life I attended to a McCartney concert, my first rock show ever. From there I've experienced a lot of Live music in many forms, and as the years pass by, the more fascinated I get by it. I think I posted about it in an old 2015 complaint about Worlds Finals back then, but even two people: one with a piano and a singer, even if it weren't \"big\" names, would have been so much more powerful than the SFX video those finals had.\nThere's a beauty to live music that is bound to embellish any event it accompanies, and by itself is just a marvelous occasion. I was happy about last year's concert, and I'm very much pleased with this year's!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Eroica","date":"2017-10-19T20:29:05.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's so cool!

Hit me back here afterwards!","replies":[{"poster":"Yordle Xayah","date":"2017-11-04T04:26:05.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well then! Here's my full thoughts!\n\nFirst of all, the whole thing was an amazing display of talent, hard work and great planning. I can't even begin to imagine about how much work must have gone into the logistics for the whole thing. Makes me wonder if a single console was enough for all the artists, since I know usually a single artist can consume several channels fine tuned to their personal liking. There was Pentakill, there was several DJs, there was the Orchestra and just... wow!\n\nLogistics out of the way, I think my favorite moments were the opening **Worlds Theme**, The Crystal Method with the **DJ Sona Tribute** and the **Star Guardian Medley**. I didn't really have _\"Low Points\"_ but I'll talk about my only two nitpicks in a moment.\n\nIt's always an amazing thing when all those tracks I normally listen to at home are performed live. I liked the use of the traditional Chinese instruments, as they gave many of the pieces a very distinct palette of eastern sounds. I was truly also amazed at the many talents that were congregated for this one musical event. I've always thought League had a huge reach in different genres of music, so it was great to watch all these artists gathered to perform.\n\nAbout my nitpicks, I have two:\n\n**First**: With how amazing Nicki Taylor, TJ and Lunity were during **Burning Bright**, the **Pentakill** tracks, **Amumu** and the **Jinx**/**Vi** tracks, I was just so sad that their voices were almost completely muted by backing vocal tracks during the Alan Walker fragment. I could barely hear any of them. It was quite distracting and took away from their amazing performances :(\n\n**Second**: I'm a bit disappointed that some of the tracks that ended up in mixes. If **Amumu**'s track can be played fully, I keep wondering... why not give **Ignite**/**Warriors**/**Worlds Collide** the same treatment? Even the **Jinx**/**Vi** songs I felt I would have enjoyed more if they had their own numbers.\n\nIt actually makes me a bit worried about tonight's performance at the Bird's Nest, since it might as well be the only time that **Legends Never Die** is performed in its entirety. **Warriors** has never been performed as its own full track since Finals 2014, and I personally think playing those songs in their original form would be even greater than some of the champion mashes. We've listened to **Nami**/**Taliyah**/**Asol**/**Freljord** mixes repeated times, and I can't help but feel these take time off the program that could be used by some of the tracks that were mixed. The **DJ Sona Mix** I can understand, but when I saw that Nicki was gonna be at the show, I was super hyped to hear **Worlds Collide** in its full form, as it had only been played once during Summoner's Con 2015, and that wasn't professionally recorded and well. I can't lie: I was a bit disappointed by the tiny portion it had on the show, and add on top the issue I had with the backing vocals that I mentioned before, and that part of the show just was not what I expected.\n\nI wish big songs like **Warriors**, **Ignite**, **Worlds Collide** and now **Legends Never Die** had their own dedicated numbers in the future, instead of being part of a mix. **Ignite** is more of a techno track. **Worlds Collide** has more of an opera-rock/pop feel to it, and **Legends Never Die**/**Warriors** are the more rock-esque tracks of the bunch. Mixing em all together I feel takes away from their uniqueness and doesn't do justice to the original compositions. Even if Zedd/Imagine Dragons themselves weren't at the show, I know amazing versions of the tracks could have been made yesterday... Maybe next time :)\n\nEverything excluding those two aspects not only met my expectations, but highly exceeded them. The show was better than last year's (which was really good already) and I'm just so happy we've got the VOD to go back to. I often find myself listening to live versions of tracks instead whenever I'm working or whatever, and I know I'll be doing that with the show from last night.\n\nMassive cheers and respect to the tech team, the musicians and everyone who made last night's show possible!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nP.S. This would have been my Ideal Setlist:\n\n01.- Intro _\"Honor/Worlds Theme\"_ (Same as yesterday)\n02.- Curse of the Sad Mummy **Feat TJ Brown**\n03.- DJ Sona Mix/Arcade Mix **Feat The Crystal Method**\n04.- Tales From the Rift _(Serves as Intro for #5)_\n\n**_The Star Guardians Break Teeto's Curse_**\n05.- Endless Starlight _(Full Version)_ **Feat Live Singer (Anyone)**\n06.- Burning Bright _(Full Version)_ **Feat Lunity**\n\n07.- PG One _\"Penta Kill\"_ / Summoner's Call\n\n**_Pentakill Section_**\n09.- Tear of the Godess _(Full Version)_\n10.- Mortal Reminder _(Full Version)_\n11.- Deathfire Grasp _(Full Version)_\n\n_12.- Champions Mix (Camille/RakkanXayah/Galio/Kayn/Ornn/Eve)_\n**_Mix of only the latest champs we've never heard live and serves as bridge for final block_**\n\n13.- Here Comes Vi _(Full Version)_ **Feat Nicki Taylor**\n14.- Get Jinxed _(Full Version) **Feat Lunity**_\n15.- Warriors _(Full Version) **Feat Pentakill**_\n16.- Worlds Collide _(Full Version)_ **Feat Nicky Taylor**\n17.- Ignite _(Full Version)_ **Feat TJ Brown and Alan Walker**\n\n18.- Finale (Same as Yesterday, ends with **Silver Scrapes**)\n\nThat list is more wishful thinking than anything else. Once again, thx for the amazing show we had yesterday!\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sunodabeach","date":"2017-10-17T15:42:10.749+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Is it live music, or them just playing and MP3 and acting like they are djing?","replies":[{"poster":"Eroica","date":"2017-10-19T05:26:15.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will be live. deze notes are too fast to air guitar - you'll be able to tell ;) ","replies":[{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2017-10-19T21:24:47.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, after seeing and misreading your name (I read it as Riot Erotica) I know where my mind is today. time to get off the internet for a bit.
