He doesn't want to kill non-shadow ninjas. He has a temporary truce with Shen, Kennen, Akali, and the rest of the Kinkou. He simply wants others to follow in the path of the Shadow, or alternatively \"die in darkness\", He doesn't say \"Oh, you aren't shad0w man, u ded LUL\". He gives them the choice of learning the \"truth\" or dying in the darkness of ignorance. Zed's relationship with the Vastaya, on the other hand, is completely morally questionable. As according to Rakan, he \"messed with Xayah\", most likely trying to steal her magic following the events of the latest cinematic (the name of which I've completely forgotten because I'm a scrub). But in terms of his relationship with other Clans or ninjas, or Ionians in general, Zed only kills those who threaten his Order or his land (in this case, Jhin and Noxus), but to kill Jhin, he needs Shen's help and vice versa. His Order was also noted fighting in the Noxian-Ionian War, along side the Wuju Masters (pre-Singed), Yasuo's clan, and the Kinkou. Yes this post is biased. But that's beyond the point. Just because Zed is painted to be a bad-guy, doesn't mean he's a \"bad guy\". \"Ignorance is fatal\". Inb4 someone points out Master Kusho's death and the slaughter of the students, we don't really know what went down in the Temple to cause Zed to do that. Zed just wanted his box, but Kusho had to fuck things up somehow.

He is sitting on a 43% win rate, I feel like you guys just threw this rework at us and not really put much time into his kit. Riot I'm being serious, you guys took a step backwards, not a step forward. \r\n\r\nInstead of 'reworking' {{champion:107}} Why don't you just scrap his whole kit and make a whole completely new design? He's honestly so fun to play that it sucks just seeing the champion i've once loved is being gutted to shit. (Excuse me for language) But in all seriousness, this new Rengar is clunky, it feels like it was rushed. When the rework was announced I was so excited but as soon as I played him, I was so disappointed. The Q ability is really what gets me, it seems like Riot was going into a direction where he's a 'bruiser'. Well I know you guys were, I heard Ghostcrawler say it in a interview. I've honestly drawed away from League because the way this rework has put Rengars stats to shit. I got almost 1 mil mastery on him, ( http://championmasterylookup.derpthemeus.com/summoner/?summoner=MsKatlyn&region=NA)\r\n\r\nBut for now, I don't wanna play him anymore.
