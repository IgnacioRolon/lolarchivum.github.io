Yasuo opened his eyes and stood up. He heard the sound again, so he began running towards the source.\r\n\r\nAs he approached his destination, he saw three people sitting on the ground, having a picnic while watching TV.\r\n\r\n\"Hey Yasuo, wanna watch the world cup with us?\" asked Cassiopeia (440 RP), \"look, I'm even wearing green and yellow like the Brazilian flag!\"\r\n\r\n\"Huehuehue\" replied Numero Uno (395 RP).\r\n\r\n\"No, thanks,\" Yasuo politely declined, \"I'm on a mission.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know why I like football/soccer?\" replied [Count Vladimir (260 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzZV41P-bMA), \"because it sucks!\"\r\n\r\nYasuo ignored the joke, as Vladimir smiled proudly, he had to be positive that this pun was the funniest he'd said.\r\n\r\nYasuo kept running. The howling sound was closer and closer.\r\n\r\nEventually, he saw it. [Hyena Warwick (487 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkdnwUctUk4&feature=kp) stood there, facing a wounded [Dragonslayer Jarvan (375 RP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AywiSpaTa-I).\r\n\r\n\"Yasuo...\" whispered Jarvan when he saw the samurai running towards them, Yasuo was surrounded by flying metallic debris which had been cast by Mordekaiser just as he left their picnic area \"help... Me...\"\r\n\r\nWarwick sent out a roary laughter and began slashing at Jarvan. Yasuo was still a bit far away, Warwick had enough time to kill his prey and then run away.\r\n\r\nJarvan knew he had to do something or it would be too late by the time Yasuo arrived. He was almost out of mana, but maybe he could still cast a couple of spells?\r\n\r\nThere was no time to make the calculations, he had to trust his luck now.\r\n\r\nJarvan tossed his Demacian Standard, but he tossed it too far away, so it landed behind Warwick.\r\n\r\n\"You idiot!\" Laughed the hyena as he slashed Jarvan over and over again, \"you couldn't even hit me! HA!\"\r\n\r\nJarvan then raised his lance with both of his hands and extended it as much as he could.\r\n\r\nIt hit the flag.\r\n\r\nJarvan was immediately pulled towards it, sending his attacker flying up in the air.\r\n\r\nAnd then Yasuo struck.\r\n\r\nHe teleported at the airborne Warwick and began slashing him once, twice, thrice...\r\n\r\nThe hyena cried in pain as he felt each strike cutting through his fur, skin, muscle and eventually bones. He could also feel the shards from Mordehuehue's creeping death cutting into his already opened wounds.\r\n\r\nIt only lasted for a second or two, but Warwick felt it was an eternity.\r\n\r\nEventually, both landed on the ground. Yasuo on his feet, Warwick on his back.\r\n\r\nHis wounds began oozing blood, as he knew his time was up.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get you... You'll see... This isn't... Over... Yet\"\r\n\r\nYasuo struck one last time, as Warwick let out one last, gurgling breath.\r\n\r\nYasuo performed chiburi to remove the blood from his blade and, at the same time, cleanse his soul from the act he had just committed.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards performed noto, sheathing his blade back into its home.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks Yasuo,\" whispered Jarvan, as he stood up, \"I owe you one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just doing what's right...\" replied Yasuo, as he walked back to his cherry tree, Mordekaiser's shield fading away.","replies":[{"poster":"Wyntershine","date":"2014-06-12T16:26:49.212+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Mordehuehue\" \r\n\r\n^ this is the point where I cracked","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swoodington","date":"2014-06-12T15:23:01.892+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"This story gives me hope for a Dragonslayer Yasuo","replies":[{"poster":"I am a Witch","date":"2014-06-12T19:34:20.098+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hyena slayer Yasuo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrampStamps","date":"2014-06-12T17:49:34.640+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sad WW{{champion:19}}  died, everyone hates him.
