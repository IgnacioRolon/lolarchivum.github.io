They have never done anything this bad and I've been playing since early beta (user 2352).\n\nHere is how big of a money grab (and how needlessly complicated) this entire event is, especially compared to every single past event. It is just INSANE.\n\nTo actually get all exclusice content: 6 Golden Chromas (Caitlyn, Sona, Corki, Katarina, Garen, Riven), the 3 Borders (Lux, Nasus, Warwick), the exclusive event Ruby Chroma (Lux, Nasus, Warwick), the exclusive wards / icons it would cost you: more than 12935 RP (around 18185 RP due to lack of Silver Token availability). That's over $121 in RP at the most efficient RP cost level.\n\nBreakdown:\nFree = 1 Gold Chroma = 96 Reveal Tokens (missions)\n2845 RP = Lux Border Bundle\n2650 RP = Nasus Border Bundle\n2650 RP = Warwick Border Bundle\n1500 RP = Puppy Nasus Bundle (1 Gold + 12 Silver)\n1500 RP = Puppy Warwick Bundle (1 Gold + 12 Silver)\n540 RP = Puppy Nasus Icon (1 Gold)\n1250 RP = Puppy Warwick Icon (no tokens, but Gemstone)\n\nThat gives you 4 Golden Chromas and 24 Silver Tokens left over. Meaning you still need 168 Silver Tokens to get the remaining Golden Chromas. There's no easy way to get the remaining Silver Tokens as the other bundles include so much other stuff (as you can't just buy Silver Tokens by themselves). The most cost effective way to get the remaining Tokens is to buy the \"Hextech Chest + 4 Reveal Tokens\" (125 RP) for a total of 5250 RP.\n\nNote: This doesn't even account for the skins with the Golden Chromas (as they are extra), just the Chromas themselves.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} {{sticker:sg-shisa}} \n\nEDIT: I've been following Riot Games since their start. They were one of the first to do F2P in North America and they did it right. They have been successful over the years because they treat their players fairly and respectfully. They did what others didn't. This flies in the face of that and why it feels so bad. Riot has a very specific brand about being focused on the player experience, and this damages that brand.\n\nHere's a simple fix that is fair and a better player experience: Sell the stuff individually.\n\nInstead of bundling everything together, can we just buy what we want? Why can't I just buy the chromas for 290 RP (like every other chroma)? The icons for 250 RP (or even the border + icon for 425 RP, like they did before)? The wards for 640 RP (like every other ward)?

They've been free from doing missions before (borders specifically) and the first time borders were introduced they were given to you for no rp extra when you bought the skin.\n\nThen the star guardians happened and suddenly you had to pay 175rp for a border (not including the icon - icon price I understand). Something that was previously free and collectable became a price tag.\n\nEven though Championship Ashes Chroma you had to pay for it, it came with a mission pass which was cheaper and more affordable in a few week period (time for people to get enough from their paycheck) unlike this mess. For me, and for others - a person who liked to grab the free borders and collectibles (As with icons - they added history to my account and a longevity on League I'd like to show off) finding that now suddenly the trend of them costing more continues but now it's 121+ bucks for everything? I'd be upset too - imagine if they did this for every event, increasing the price with each one.\n\nYes, there's more to grab so its higher priced, yes there are people who think the same way as you do - that these are cosmetics, why ask for them to be able to be gained from spending time for free?

Same story with the Lux, Nasus, Warwick borders and Ruby chroma. They are bundled in such a way you can't buy them individually.
