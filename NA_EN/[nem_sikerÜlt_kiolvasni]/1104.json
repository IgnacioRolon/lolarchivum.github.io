She's just a face and her content is going to be generic crap... otherwise people will look at top ladder streamers because they bash their heads in to get there... some of them are good, but they mostly just spent more time. The rare few that are actually reallllllly good at your game rarely get lucky enough to get through before frustration makes them KNOW they shouldn't stick around. Remove the luck factor from your matchmaking and create differences between \"lucky\" players and good ones. Lucky ones wont be stick around higher elos than they deserve:\r\n\r\nSimple to fix this, really: create Actually tiers into divisions diamon 3 GOOD players (best stats/position) vs BAD players (baaaad stats). Per division (gold / diamond) the standards change... objective damage may matter more than deaths, but make an overall belief of what a good player looks like and give these players More LP and lose Less LP for bad players : Lose more and win less until they match the division's good players or just get back to their respective ranking.","replies":[{"poster":"Rabadong","date":"2018-12-28T20:53:36.432+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP loss/gain is based on your mmr and individual stats. I won't insult you if you think gaining lp for losing games is more comforting than winning a game because you got carried, but you will rank up faster due to higher lp gain if you actually play at a higher level like you suggest. This is the same system that gets applied to people who have such high mmr that they skip a rank after winning their series. The system will do its part to aid or hinder players who consistently play at a higher/lower skill level with respect to their current rank. What you are asking for is a system that rewards players that consistently lose more games than they win.
