I've gathered that there was a way to do this but is there still a way?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T15:42:39.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There currently isn't a method to transfer currency or content between accounts.  IP specifically are influence points that are built for that account, and highlights the progress and history played for that account.  It would almost be like taking away that account's hardwork which would be a bummer.  Just keep playing games on your intended account, and grab an IP Boost if you want.  Best of luck in getting the content you desire!","replies":[]}]}
