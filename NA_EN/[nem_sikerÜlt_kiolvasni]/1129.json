I woke up, had time to kill before work, and figured I'd play a few matches before I start the rest of my day. I've always been a casual player. Since the pre-season for season 2. And I love top lane. I love the champs that are meta for that lane, and it's what I enjoy playing. \r\n\r\nWhen team builder came out, I loved it! I didn't have to fight or argue with others over a popular lane. I'd just be patient and get it. Then I could play the champs i enjoy, in the lane I have fun in. As is the entire point of the game, to have fun. Then this new system comes out.\r\n\r\nI que up for a match, pick Top as primary, and Bot as Secondary. I got top! But then shortly after the ban phase, someone didn't lock in. So i go back to searching for group. Next match pops! But now I'm bot. I can play bot. I CAN play most lanes. But I don't really enjoy it. But what ever, I'll take one for the team. Then another person doesn't lock in. YES! Another shot at top. This repeated around 6 or 7 more times. No joke. People wouldn't lock in because they didn't like the team comp. And each of those 6-7 games, I was bot. A lane I don't enjoy. And each time I have the same \"support.\" A Miss Fortune. Match finally starts. We have a jungler playing WW warning us that he doesn't know jungle too well it's just the only other lane besides mid that he even kinda likes. We have a support MF who wont even talk, or ping, or stop stealing CS and the few kills I managed to almost get. A mid laner who warned us that they prefer top like me, because they like bruisers like me, but are instead forced into mid. They try to play the meta, but aren't used to the champ, or arn't used to being that squishy. Either way, they don't do well. And what makes thigns worse, is our top lane choose top as his Second pick and wanted jungle as his main! Our team got just rolled.\r\n\r\nHaha, I've had some bad defeats in my years of playing. And I've had some amazing wins too! But I've never been beaten this hard. And not just me, my entire team. Every lane was pushed to the inhibs by 14 min. \r\n\r\nEach of us were forced into lanes we didn't want. And into rolls we weren't comfortable on. And as a result. We suffered the worst defeat I have seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nBut the match is over. Thank the gods! Figure that what happend last match was just bad luck. So i que for another. This time I change my secondary to Mid. Hoping that another solo lane might at least be a little more like the lane I enjoy. But when the group starts picking champs, i'm mid, our marksman is a velkoz, and our support is a J4. So I say fuck that and leave. But when I try and re que, it wont let me start another match for 10 minutes because I left. \r\n\r\nSo now under this new team set up, I can't play the role/lane I have enjoyed playing for a long time now because I always get my secondary roll. In team builder I could just deny entry to troll picks like an MF support, or Vel Koz adc, but now i'm forced to play with them. And to play with team mates that get lanes/rolls they don't like either. And thats assuming the match even gets started, as I've yet to have a matchmaking that didn't take 4+ tries because people wont lock in.\r\n\r\nBottom line, This change is FANTASTIC.......FOR RANKED PLAY! But for the casual players who couldn't give a shit about ranked play, bring back team builder please. Or I'm just going to /ff at 20. And I doubt i'll be the only one.","replies":[{"poster":"Boodle Toodle","date":"2016-01-14T22:15:11.108+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":5,"body":"At the end of the day...you are playing this game to have fun because its a GAME.

It messes up my matches so much. I smite wolves, finish them, and escape the enemy jungle. Then the Sentinel starts pinging \"I'm coming\", then \"Help\", then \"watch out\" and repeats it. My allies think I'm the one pinging, since the pings are identical to the ones that players use. Suddenly, instead of an easy escape, my allies think I'm calling them to assist me in blowing up the Udyr, when in fact I'm running for my life. This feature does not promote clarity, it confuses players. I rarely bother to smite wolves anymore because of it. Few people are aware that the Sentinel even pings, because you're only aware of it if you jungle.

I'm not sure this is the perfect place to put this but I want to get my word out there. While I can understand why you would want to do this in order to push the new champ select, there are some great errors in this mentality. Disregarding the current problems with the new champ select, because they will be ironed out and made to be smooth, Team Builder was a great part of queuing up for League of Legends. It allowed a player to play the specific champion that they wanted, in the specific role that they wanted and allowed players to join a team comp they are comfortable with. Even though the wait times were longer than other queues, it was worth it to get the champ, role and team that you wanted. Additionally, the possibility of creating a multiple person party that once again gave everyone the role they wanted and the gaps were filled by other players. For example, one role that I always find to be sought after is Middle Lane. In Blind Pick, the \"dibs\" system makes the possibility of getting mid essentially a one in five chance. In the old Draft Pick, the ability to go middle lane is determined by the order of picks, not securing the role desired but rather giving a chance at it.\r\n\r\nNow, with the new champ select that is meant to make Team Builder obsolete, there are at least 3 glaring problems:\r\n1. The role that you want is not necessarily what you are going to get. I can see the reason behind this, seeing as if everyone were to get the role they wanted queue times would be longer, similar to Team Builder. The need for a fast queue system is understandable, but in my opinion not necessary\r\n2. The champion that you want to play can either be banned or picked before you There's not much to say in this part, other than what has already been said.\r\n3. PEOPLE DO NOT FOLLOW THE ROLES THEY'VE BEEN ASSIGNED This issue is by far the worst that I have seen. In many situations when someone queues up and does not get the role that the put as their primary role, they choose to disregard their assigned role and either take another role from someone else and/or threaten to troll/fed/afk etc. This is unfair to those who get the role that is disputed and unfair to those who have to put up with the fighting on their team.\r\n\r\nSo, Riot, I understand that you probably will not read this thread or if you do it will not affect your decision making much. However in an attempt to try to demonstrate that people want Team Builder back, I have added a pole. Please take all that I've said into consideration.\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[]},{"poster":"HoodedDemon","date":"2016-01-14T18:43:16.230+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anybody else not able to even have the option to use Chroma Skins in new champ select?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clockwork Knave","date":"2016-01-14T22:08:23.346+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the new queue is a great change for draft, but I don't think it should replace Team Builder.
