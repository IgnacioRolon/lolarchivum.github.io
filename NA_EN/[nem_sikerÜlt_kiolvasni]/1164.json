Fresh meat! That makes sense,\" said Janna (292 RP) waiting impatiently to hear the rest of the story\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, back to the story. We had been having a lot of lag that day, not sure why. But eventually, we all reconnected.\r\n\r\nThe giant Xerath had been taken by our team once, so at least we were a bit ahead. But it didn't mean anything. The enemy team could steal the Xerath at any moment and we'd lose our last chance to get the icon. After all, we were just minutes away from the end of the event.\r\n\r\nI reached the centre of the map.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry Fiora,\" I said, \"my connection had some hiccups.\"\r\n\r\nShe had ascended, she looked quite scary I must say. Surely would win... Right?\r\n\r\nWell, as I thought that, a pair of hands grabbed me and tossed me into a pool of venomous gas.\r\n\r\nMad Scientist Singed (375 RP) had connected. As Fiora went to help me, she was trapped into a rune prison.\r\n\r\n\"Not so fast,\" said Dark Crystal Ryze (487 RP), as she proceeded to burst Fiora down with his spells.\r\n\r\nThe screen showed a message in big, red letters: The ascended has fallen.\r\n\r\nI tried slithering away from my opponents, but Singed was much faster and caught up to me again, tossing me against Ryze.\r\n\r\nI was dead. I would respawn soon, sure, but so would the central Xerath.\r\n\r\nOur other teammate, Sewn Chaos Orianna (260 RP) was running around, trying to live. The enemies didn't seem to bother with her and preferred capturing shrines in the meantime.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Fiora and I respawned I yelled.\r\n\r\n\"I want that icon... I NEED that icon!!!\"\r\n\r\nFiora nodded and got surrounded by a golden light, as she teleported back into the battlefield.\r\n\r\nI followed her. Soon enough, Xerath respawned.\r\n\r\n\"Attack!\" I ordered, and my teammates did. Orianna tossed her ball, Fiora cast her ult, so did I, freezing the enemies into blocks of stone. Afterwards I put as many poison noxious blasts and miasmas as I possibly could.\r\n\r\nBut they survived. What surprised me was... They didn't attack us back.\r\n\r\nThey were focusing on Xerath. They didn't care about winning the game anymore, they just wanted us to lose our chance of getting the icon.\r\n\r\n\"NO!!!!\" I cried in anger as Xerath's health got lower and lower.\r\n\r\nAnd that's when Fiora and Cassiopeia did the unimaginable.\r\n\r\nThey both flashed in front of Xerath, blocking the incoming barrage of enemy attacks.\r\n\r\nI could see their faces, their armour, their flesh... All being ripped apart by the combination of magical and physical attacks they received.\r\n\r\nI fired a pair of twin fangs at Xerath, and it dealt just enough damage for him to die and for me to ascend.\r\n\r\nIt was too late for my teammates though. I saw them dying painfully just as Xerath's power began running through my veins.\r\n\r\nI ascended and killed the nearby enemies with ease. That earned us enough points to win the match.\r\n\r\nI had already won exactly 5 matches of this mode, I expected all of us to be teleported to the centre and do a victory dance in front of our defeated opponents.\r\n\r\nBut Orianna and Fiora weren't there. Their bodies were still on the floor, lifeless and sad.\r\n\r\nI was taken out of the arena. My defeated enemies respawned. Some congratulated me on my victory, some called me a noob and left.\r\n\r\nBut Orianna and Fiora still weren't there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's really strange,\" commented Janna, \"what happened to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I went to Karthus after the match and he supposes they are stuck between life and death, but that he can't really do much to help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"So... What will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only fair thing to do: I shall go to the lands of the death and bring them back... Or get stuck there for eternity trying\"","replies":[{"poster":"nonamewarrior","date":"2014-09-25T14:40:21.938+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2014-09-25T14:44:12.420+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'M A DRAGOON!!!\r\n\r\nNot a dragon.
