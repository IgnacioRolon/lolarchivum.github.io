After having played several games with new Aatrox, I'm sad to say you guys really missed the mark on this one. He's basically unusable at this point. His only real damage ability - his Q - is so slow to hit an enemy has only to walk away from it to escape and be back to base before you can do anything to stop them. His W, while interesting, doesn't do its job 60% of the time, as it doesn't slow enemies enough to get the pull off before they leave its AoE. His E's range is absolutely pitiful. His Ult is just awful. The movement and attack speed are negligible, and the blood well does absolutely nothing as people wait for your ult to end and then finish you off. This is all coming from someone who doesn't even main Aatrox. I played him for fun occasionally because he was interesting and UNIQUE. I mean no rudeness and understand a great deal of time was put into the rework, but it just isn't WORKING at all. Best Regards ","replies":[]}]}
