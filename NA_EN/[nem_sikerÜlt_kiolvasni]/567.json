The whole idea of being forced to play an entire team comp that was chosen by the enemy team, against another team comp chosen by you, is just really cool. Once, I got together with a group of friends in blind pick and played a full support team. It was just amazingly fun even though I was the worst conceivable Karma mid. Troll teams are just great, and a game mode dedicated to them... I can't wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Myrlian","date":"2016-08-10T00:44:33.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I *HAVE* played it: Unfortunately in my experience with the mode, roughly 3 or 4 out of 5 times you sit through queue, and most or all of draft before someone dodges. And while the games can potentially be interesting on the rare occasions when you actually make it all the way into one, you'll get an afk or 2 half the time. So, after sitting through that once or twice and taking 30+ minutes of going through one draft after another, you end up deciding it's just not worth it. Hopefully by the second or third rotation in RGM people who aren't willing to play an enemy chosen comp will stop trying to play nemesis draft, but I'm not gonna hold my breath.","replies":[{"poster":"Itsbeghdev","date":"2016-08-12T02:39:39.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know...

At least some people are grateful (i.e., yay nemesis draft!)\r\nand all the rest are asking for other game modes/criticizing the current selected game modes\r\n\r\n     Could everybody please just take a moment and reflect on what Riot has already given us? Now, I'm not saying Riot is our savior and perfectly fault-free (I watched the entire MonteCrist0 video on the Renegades investigation, looked through all the documents, and question Riot's decisions). HOWEVER, they have provided plenty for us. \r\nOn League, Client,etc\r\n-They've given us a free to play game, when they easily could've charged money.  This applies to people complaining about skins as well. The whole game's free, its YOUR choice to buy skins. So don't complain about what you call \"ridiculous prices\" and etc. \r\n-They constantly add in new skins for those who want new particles or such on their favorite champions. It takes time to develop the model and all new particle effects.\r\n-While a lot of people hate on it, Hextech crafting is FREE. It's not cost money, just some people waste money on it. EMBRACE IT, its a way for people who don't spend money on League to get skins for FREE. You get chests, keys for free. Thank Riot for adding it.\r\n-A question to those complaining about the project skins not coming out yet (I'm guessing you want to buy them): Which would you prefer, a spoiler telling you that they will be releasing some high quality skins in a couple weeks, so you can prepare for it, or would you rather them release the spoiler and then the skins 1 or 2 days later? I'm assuming quite a few players are still students, so I'm sure they would want to adjust their spending accordingly rather than being caught off guard and wishing they could get the skin but not having the budget to do so.\r\n\r\nOn Rotating Game Modes, Urf,etc\r\n-They even bothered implementing Rotating Game Modes. Simply updating old game modes requires a lot of effort on programming side to keep it updated, especially with things like Nemesis Draft which is coming up, as they need to adjust it to the new map,champ select,etc. \r\n-They gave us Urf. They promised 2 weeks, they gave it. Stop flaming them, they followed through. Accept it and be grateful for it. Please, just shut up. I'm sick of seeing everybody complain about no Urf. Yes, it's a very fun game mode. No, Riot didn't say they'd give 3 weeks. Do you think flaming Riot constantly will help? Would you give in to somebody's demands if they've been screaming about you and insulting you for months? I thought not.\r\n-I believe Riot has said that they are working on BMB and DoomBots, but it is difficult to, particularly regarding having to rewrite the Doom Bots programming. Give them time, they have said they are working on it. Patience is a virtue.\r\n-They've even developed new game modes for RGM, Nexus Siege as the example. They could just be lazy and cycle through already existing game modes, but Riot has gone beyond. They took the time to develop an entirely new game mode which is extremely unique, and requires quite a bit of programming to develop as well as playtesting on PBE to balance it.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: shut up and stop complaining.I'm not a Riot fanboy, but I do recognize that they have done plenty for us. Free game, free way to get skins,alerting us to upcoming things well in advance,developing more game modes, updating old ones. Riot promised 2 weeks urf, they followed through, so please shut up about more Urf.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading the post\r\n~Player who avoids ranked and plays for fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"StainlessTweedle","date":"2016-07-30T12:40:54.421+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually wouldn't mind if you switched the weeks of nemesis draft and ascension tbh :v","replies":[]},{"poster":"JakeFSF","date":"2016-07-30T07:29:44.391+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illuzion Vortex","date":"2016-07-29T20:29:12.974+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":8,"body":"Riot pls ffs dont you see that about 95% or more want URF thats all we want!
