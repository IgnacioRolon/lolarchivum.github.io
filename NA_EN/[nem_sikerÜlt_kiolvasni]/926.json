If Swain isn't planned to get a VU for a long time, say, until 2018, then he should be up for a skin, yes? But I also see some Rioters saying they'd rather wait until he's gotten a VU, because they say his rig is too old. Then which is it? Does this mean Swain's going to have to wait a long time for any kind of skin, even after we've waited four years since his last one? It seems like if a champion is in such a need of a VU that they can't get a new skin at all, that they'd be high on the list of champions soon to get a VU. Even Mordekaiser, a champion with one of the oldest models in the game, and who is apparently on the list of champs looking to get a VU, got a 750 RP skin last year that is honestly pretty cool. Couldn't Swain get something like that, one that wouldn't be too much of a hassle to change come his far-off VU, but would still come soon enough that Swain mains won't have to wait even more years for something?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-06-03T19:13:58.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, Brutusness, wish I could give you a better answer.
