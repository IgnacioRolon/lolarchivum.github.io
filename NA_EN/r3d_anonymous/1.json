My lasthitting is not that good, but okay.  \r\n\r\nThe problem arises around mid-game when I notice that the ADC starts coming mid and takes a lot of it.  \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not just that, but at my ELO, people LOVE to fight and skirmishes are happening all the time, which quite frankly isn&#039;t my style.  I like to play passive and just farm up and get a couple kills here and there, but I generally don&#039;t like blood baths.  The reason this affects me is I often feel obligated to take part in the skirmishes, because if I don&#039;t then I&#039;ll get flamed for &quot;noob mid didn&#039;t help&quot;, which is a plausible complaint.  \r\n\r\nTaking wraiths/wolves isn&#039;t reliable because someone else most of the time starts taking them.  I can&#039;t go bot because ADC still wants bot farm in addition to mid-lane farm and I can&#039;t go top because the top-laner is usually there.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, I can&#039;t help only ending up with like 150 CS at 30 minutes, with all the fighting and lack of available farm.  \r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do to better my CS with these conditions?","replies":[]}
