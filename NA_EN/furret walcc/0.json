Now that his E perma bounces he just lane bullies you into oblivion and never runs out of mana due to a 750 gold item (starting with {{item:1027}} ) Ryze is unfun to play against and needs to just be removed","replies":[{"poster":"The Seraph King","date":"2019-10-10T00:10:57.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that he needs to be removed. You just need to learn how to play around him. I do it quite easily by picking champions that greater cast range that can keep him at a distance. Anivia and Annie are both good at this (though I think Annie has a slightly smaller cast range than Ryze). If you can't play around his abilities and learn his weaknesses, then I recommend either banning him or start playing him yourself.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
