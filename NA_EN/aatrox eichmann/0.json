Persistent verbal abuse from one person to another individual should be zero-tolerance, not an off-handed \"kys\".\n\nForget for a moment that we're talking about League. An off-handed use of \"kill yourself\" is equivalent in severity of meaning as \"go F yourself\". It is obvious that the speaker does not intend to persuade the person to go masturbate, nor kill themselves. Instances where people are considered for manslaughter with \"kill yourself\" are in persistent, honest abuse with clear intent to persuade the person to actually kill themselves. It would be the same with \"F yourself\"- only if the person were actually being abusive in an attempt to have them masturbate.\n\nBack to League and Zero Tolerance.

How can you fake trying to make someone feel better, or more confident, or whatever? Fake negativity would have to exist too, and there's no way to fake negativity. If I \"fake negativity\" around you, I'm going to pass a negative vibe to you. That is what negativity is.\n\nThe rest of your post, I agree with it to a certain extent.\nWhat the OP said is just too much. \"KYS\" in itself won't offend everyone, but if even one person takes that \"advice\", we're talking some pretty heavy stuff. Telling anyone that, is just wrong, no matter how you look at it. That is not acceptable.\n\nI do agree that Riot doesn't humanize the players, though. You're giving opportunities to reform and stop breaking the rules, but people are emotional fleshbags. If I'm in a toxic mindset, you're going to have a hard time changing that. The only one that can change that mindset, is myself, and if I don't see what you see...I'll never change.\n\nRiot should totally do something more for those that do reform though, because once you get perma'd...the only reason to reform is whether or not you agree with Riot's judgement. If you do agree, you'd reform...if you don't, you won't. But if you do reform, you'll still never get your account back. Constantly re-grinding all of the things you lost, and reminding yourself of what you had.\n\nLife time penalties for small time crimes, do seem pretty harsh. I'd like it if they did like a season long ban or something. After a year if the player has a new account, they could assess their performance. It seems pretty bad to give someone life in jail, if their crime was stealing a loaf of bread.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jonesybones","date":"2019-11-10T03:46:39.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the game isn't about ''killing''. it has a lot more depth then just killing.

If a animal can understand this logic, a person who has a much higher learning capability can. It dosint matter if it was a year ago, he did it enough to know its bad, not only that but he as a human being should know it is never acceptable in society to ever say that to anyone. Btw there is no proof he has given that says he was banned last a year ago, you can only take his word.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Okraki","date":"2019-11-10T02:54:11.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you get \"permabanned\" \"In the face-to-face world\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Jonesybones","date":"2019-11-10T03:49:07.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"by going to prison.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-10T02:21:55.073+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you skipped chat restrictions and went to the punishment tier right before a permaban without having committed a gameplay offense (e.g. inting), that means you used zero-tolerance phrases (encouraging self-harm, racism, homophobia, etc.) and were given a severe punishment of a 14-day suspension which very clearly tells you that the next time you make trouble - even a minor offense - your account is gone. And then you encourage self-harm, which is even more than a minor offense. So now your account is permabanned.\n\nThe reason you are permabanned for this can be seen in your reaction to it. You insist that it's ridiculous, you threaten a lawsuit, and you think that _you_ are the victim when you encourage self-harm in violation of the rules just because other people break rules as well. Riot realized that you'd break the rules again if they gave you the chance, so they won't - thus, a permaban.\n\nThe only thing you'll accomplish by \"spreading this post\" is to make yourself look bad to more people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-11-10T02:21:30.465+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":">I would threaten legal action,\n\nGood luck, my friend.
