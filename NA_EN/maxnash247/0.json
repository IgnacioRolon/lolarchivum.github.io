Our activites director says everything looks able and she has high hopes for it becoming a club. One problem is that we still have yet to test games like LoL and Rocket League on the machines we are able to use. Our HS's IT guy and I have been emailing each other and he sent me the specs of some old retired desktop PCs and I dont know if they are able to run league, will they? here are the specs:\r\n\r\nDell Optilex 380 PCs\r\nCore2Duo 2.8 Ghz CPU\r\n4gb of ddr3 memory\r\n10600 memory","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2017-02-22T17:46:15.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, checking stuff online..\n\nThose https://www.cnet.com/products/dell-optiplex-380/specs/ should be your specs, and here https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements the minimum and recommended specs. \n\nIn terms of minimum required processor power and RAM you are into the recommended section ( you have a dual core 2.8 ghz and it is require dminimum 3.0 ), even thought you are borderline good with RAM.\n\nThe problem is into the graphic card, since your PCs have an integrated graphic card ( which is this http://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Graphics-Media-Accelerator-4500MHD-GMA-X4500MHD.9883.0.html ).\nThe minimum requirement states that you must be able to run shader version 2.0 and the spec states you can run up to 4.0, but it is still an integrated card which is far from the dedicated card that the recommened specs suggest.\n\nIn the same page as the graphic card there are some benchmarks, to give context, and the graphic card seems unable to run Starcraft 2 - Heart of the swarm with barely 30 fps at low settings. I expect LoL to be far less burdening than SC since i played LoL on a laptop that had problems to run SC on low, however.\n\nThe problem remains that, with some further updates, the game might not be able to run anymore. Riot stated they always try to not raise the recommended spec bar but once in a while it might happen.\n\nThen again, the best thing is to try it on. There might be cases that make it more or less viable. Aniway, if you manage to get 30 fps stable then you are good to go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T05:51:04.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on the Operating Systems and the video chipsets of these PCs, they *may* be able to run League.
