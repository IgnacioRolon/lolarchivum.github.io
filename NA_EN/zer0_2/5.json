(Jinx Skin Appreciation Post)","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm SO HAPPY about this new Jinx skin!! I got home from school and saw it and LITERALLY STARTED CRYING. THANK YOU SO MUCH! It looks SO amazing. I tried to create a custom Jinx skin that was also called \"Firecracker\" and had the same effects design so when this came out for real you can imagine how ECSTATIC I was!! (Still am!) \nNot to mention I literally have a fetish for fireworks, they're my favourite thing. I cry watching them because of how beautiful they are! xD and Jinx is my favourite champion ever, I bought the Vi vs. Jinx poster, her one skin when she was released, changed my summoner name for her when I saw her teaser, bought the figure on release day, framed it and the box, made a jinx calendar for 2015,  own a replica fishbones that I bring EVERYWHERE, bought all the prints at Anime North 2014 of her, cosplayed her at anime north, and I wear temporary Jinx tattoos daily, so I'm so happy about this!!\nTHANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! \nAlso, from a feedback perspective after playing her on the PBE, when I ult, use Fishbones, or the Flame Chompers I can't really hear the fireworks go off D= I was wondering if the sound on those three effects cause it would suck to not have them reach their fullest potential =) \n(Also her joke is currently bugged)\nTHANK YOU AGAIN YOU'RE AMAZING {{champion:222}} \nI included some pictures of my reaction XD and yeah, I did give myself I headache. Thank you Riot, really.\n@Riot KateyKhaos @Riot I love you.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-14T00:32:13.169+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So glad you like her! :3 \n\nSounds are still being worked on, and I'd be happy to relay that feedback!\n\nAlso, what's bugged in regards to her joke?","replies":[{"poster":"ZER0 2","date":"2015-01-14T00:36:53.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AH THANK YOU FOR REPLYING!!!\nWhen you use her joke, she does the animation, but the joke isn't played... like her voice doesn't play at all.

I understand the **reason(s)** behind this decision... but unrealistic dress physics is unrealistic, just sayin'.\n\nBut yeah, my favorite part about the skin is actually the particle effects.
