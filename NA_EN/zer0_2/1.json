Urgot's reveal was part of his login and it was dope when we got the full thing. WW's teaser played his blood scent theme near the end, which then showed up in his gameplay. \n\nEvelynn's expected theme was a beautiful piano piece at the end, which honestly set the mood for the character more then the actual gameplay part of the teaser (a romantic setting where a demon lies to allure), however that music note isn't present in any other form, hell it could've just been an intro theme playing when you play eve, kinda like jhin has his music at the start of a game. \n\nSince its not in the gameplay, it was safe to assume it was her login but... it isn't anything like it... its NOT BAD and I do like it, infact might be one of my favorites, but its fair enough that our expectations were let down for what they were. Can't complain myself because I'm happy with the substitute.","replies":[{"poster":"Nevrankroaton","date":"2017-10-02T19:56:31.248+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, it is not like I was \"smart\" for not believing it, it is more like I already saw people acting like the piano theme WOULD BE her theme that I immediately though \"With our luck, they are going to do something different and people will biatch\".\n\nMaybe also because the teaser music really felt like a music teaser and not like a standalone part of a song?
