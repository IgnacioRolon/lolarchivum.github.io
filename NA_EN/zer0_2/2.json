He really wanted to buy Star Guardian Jinx for me but didnt want to use the US currency option because he wanted just enough for the skin (1820 RP) and the US RP options either give too less or WAY too much (1380 or 2800).\r\nHe knew that the 9 Pound RP Prepaid Card here in the UK would give 1850 (EXACTLY what we need without spending more money than needed), so he went out and bought it for me as a surprise.\r\nHowever, because we have NA accounts, we can't credit the prepaid card onto our accounts because they're region locked (we weren't aware). So now we're stuck 9 pounds poorer (and not financially stable enough to just buy another one, this was a special once-in-a-while surprise) and we can't even get the RP onto our accounts. =(\r\nIf there's anyway we can fix this or do a trade or something it would be greatly appreciated.\r\nPlease help us out!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T20:31:13.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RP Cards are specific to their own region and can't be used on another.
