Read on for the details. A few years ago now, we started giving players 400 RP when they hit Level 3, as part of progression towards Level 30.","url":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZGErnvY4-hextech-crafting-new-player-chests-to-replace-400-rp","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My sister started playing league tonight, and I was helping her along and showed her how to get garen for free, and she's been really enjoying him, so I was excited for her to get level 3 because she could use the free rp to get a chroma of him in her favorite color. She hits level 3, no rp so I do some digging and find the link I have attached. Tl;Dr free rp is replaced with a beginner's box in crafting at level 3. Alright, cool. I tell her to check the crafting page and she says it is locked until level five. Odd, but okay. A couple more games later, she's five and it is unlocked, but when she goes in there is no beginner's box or anything, the crafting page is empty. Her Summoner Name is Inhale Aesthetic. As far as I know Beginner Rewards are still active am I wrong in thinking that or is this indeed a bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T21:24:02.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at her account and it looks like she was able to open those boxes successfully!\n\nSometimes there's a bit of a delay in those getting unlocked or added to the account after just hitting level 5. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
