I think the balance is fine for the most part and the community is no different than every community in the world, not just gaming ones.\n**\n\n\n\n\nI&#039;ve played since Season 2.\nBeen through all the changes.\n\nI think I am finally ready to accept that it isn&#039;t the same game I started playing 7 years ago.\nWith each change, the game becomes more focused on the champion you pick, rather than the items you build.\nEvery top laner builds the same items.\nEvery mage builds the same items.\nEvery marksman builds the same items.\n\nThere&#039;s no real choice making. \nThere&#039;s no proper hybrids anymore.\n\nThere used to be options like &quot;I really like XXX champion, and I can play them how I want.&quot;\n\nNow it&#039;s just &quot;pick the highest tier champs and build the same 6 items as everyone else&quot;.\nIt's all focused and balanced around the optimal build/style to be as competitive as you can.\n\nI&#039;m not saying there&#039;s no skill involved. It still comes down to how well you handle said champ, and how much you can outplay your opponent. I am just saying that it isn&#039;t as fun.\n\n\nOver one hundred champs and there are only a few unique ones.\n\nSure, the micro plays are different, but realistically most ADCs are all the same thing in a different skin. All mages do the same thing, with the same items... they just look different.\n\n\nI miss the days of AP Tristana mid, Blitz Jungle or Elise top. \nAP Caitlyn mid was never on the pro scene, so I can't understand why she lost her AP ratios. AD players wouldn't build AP so it's not like it's breaking her regular play, it was just there for fun.\n\nSadly the best role was buffed and focused on while off-builds were nerfed or reworked out.\n\nIt&#039;s just not as fun anymore.\n\n\nIn pursuit of competition all the fun has been stomped out.","replies":[{"poster":"Dataless","date":"2017-07-22T15:41:26.544+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":5,"body":"I understand the point that the OP is trying to make, but I also recognize that they are making some pretty gross over-generalizations, I will go into them below.\n\n> Every top laner builds the same items.\n> Every mage builds the same items.\n> Every marksman builds the same items\n\nThis is simply untrue. Most champions within the same CLASS will build similar items, yes, but to simply say \"all of x lane builds the same items\" is not. \n\nLet's have an example.\n\nA top lane fighter/diver such as {{champion:58}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:240}}  will build {{item:3748}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3193}}. These items offer a growing bruiser what they need to succeed. HP, some AD, and the ability to enter teamfights and not die instantly. \n\nA split push champion such as {{champion:83}} {{champion:164}} {{champion:48}} might substitute a {{item:3071}} for a {{item:3078}}, as it enhances the auto attack reset element of their kit. {{champion:48}} might also go {{item:3074}} rather than {{item:3748}} since that compliments his innate sustain. {{champion:83}} REALLY loves {{item:3512}}, as it empowers his already very potent tower-taking power. \n\n{{champion:150}} wants a {{item:3022}}, somewhat unique among most other top lane fightey types. \n\nAnd then there is {{champion:23}}, who loves his {{item:3153}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3087}} etc\n\nTop lane tanks have their own set of items they like. Stuff like {{item:3068}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3800}} etc. Tanks will vary their build from game to game depending on the lane match and the damage type they need to mitigate. Their is also some variance based on playstyle, if you want to play a very supportive top lane tank and key into protecting your carries {{item:3193}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3109}} are there for you, and while those items are powerful (and very meta) you don't HAVE to build them, and selfish power tanks items can be a perfectly acceptable choice as well. \n\nI could keep going, I can talk about mid lane mages. {{champion:69}}{{champion:13}} have a different build than {{champion:103}} or {{champion:7}}, then there are the mid lane AD champions {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}}.\n\nThe same goes for marksmen, {{champion:429}} does not build the same as {{champion:51}} who build differently than {{champion:202}} who build differently than {{champion:96}}.\n\nSupports actually get to have f-cking items now, not just boots and wards from back when I started playing. \n\nThe point I am making is that this game does still have variance WHERE IT IS NEEDED. The trick of the item system is recognizing what your champions strengths are within their respective class, and building the items that highlight that. The item system in league is subtle and succinct, and typically whenever a particular item finds widespread success outside of it's intended user (league of black cleavers, lethality from the start of this season, etc) those edge-cases are typically brought back in line in short order. That being said, Riot still has a very long way to go in order to bring the game into balance, there are forgotten champions like {{champion:268}} and pre-rework {{champion:3}} {{champion:6}} , there are binary and frustrating champions {{champion:80}}, and then there is {{champion:157}} >.>\n\n\nNow, none of this means anything since the OP has \"lost the fun\" in League, and that is not something I disrespect or disdain in any way. It's your life, your choice, if the game isn't fun don't play. The point I AM making is that \"X lane all builds the same items\" simply isn't true. At all.","replies":[{"poster":"zero356","date":"2017-07-22T17:00:24.466+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":1,"body":"Name does NOT check out","replies":[{"poster":"Dataless","date":"2017-07-22T18:32:54.931+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ha!

I especially felt this with the class reworks which were focused around \"making a kit less toxic (?)\" but one key thing they never considered when designing for these reworks was \"how much _fun_ is the new kit?\" I feel like if Riot asked themselves that question more often, they would have an easier time balancing the game.

Am fairly hyped about rune changes. BUT, and this BUT is the size of Kimmy k's.  I feel like riot is setting itself up for failure. I remember the balance overhauls that happened with mastery changes, and do not look forward to this upset to one of the games core unchanging staples (till now). \n\nRunes have been almost exactly the same for years. You have the ones that are considered \"useless\" (time dead, spell vamp etc) but are bought and built by people who try to experiment and tweak their champs. Adding to game value. For example. I at one point had 6 rune pages, 4 of which were set up for different malzahar playstyles;\n\nSpellvamp/mana regen/mixed pen/cdr (the Im'mortal page-  my most used page),\n\n standard ap runes (cause sometimes being special is bad).\n\nAD,CDR,ARMR (\"When Voidlings Attack\" Ad malz page).\n\nAnd last but not least, Full Magic pen (Feminist- literally nothing but Anti-Mr ....cause f*&^ galio...)\n\nAnyone willing to try and gain an edge in game could look into those builds and try to craft up something that would be unexpected and powerful. But not broken enough to cause a major balance issue. Rolling spellvamp Quints and malz royally screwed his early game damage back in the day, in exchange for a little unexpected survivability. Thus, they were balanced. \n\nFor casual players, I'd say the coming changes will be an improvement. They spend less time trying to test and flex things then people who actually like to crush hours on one champ. Trying to figure out how much of a difference one or 2 different runes will change make in practice, not just on paper. I would not consider a rune or mastery change tested will I got 30 games on it. Assuming that each rift game lasts an average 29 minutes, That means I put roughly 870 minutes into testing a page change. (~14.5 hours of gameplay). And this is just for my staple pages, not testing to stuff I deemed crappy, like gold over time in mid lane. No casual will do that. \n\nFor Hardcore players, well, 5 keystones, across 3? trees? doesn't add the same amount variability as the runes we have right now. And even then, I'm not factoring in how a most likely higher percentage of keystones will be unusable for a champ. \n\nAs for balance, like earlier, runes may have added variability, but they did not have such a massive amount of power that they would threaten to make or break a champ. Like masteries did. (remember release DFT? Warlords? The meta itself warped for those damn keystones). With this change they are going to do the same thing cause riot never gets balance right at the start, unexpected interactions, and front loaded keystones will abound, tossing the game into a pit of chaos. This period is sure to get on my nerves. \n\nThat being said, I want to see what new things my champs will be able to do. Though it will cost stability, and most likely break yasuo, vayne, ekko and kalista. As such, I feel like I'm going to be disappointed in the grand scheme of things.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2017-07-23T01:57:15.216+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe that's one reason I enjoy Teemo a lot. No matter what he doesn't give a shit about the meta. I'm pretty effective with Tryndamere jungle too and have a blast eventually 3 shoting peeps with unkite-able ghost + spins. Both are champions people commonly request changes too either because they hate playing against them or feel they have lost their place in the game. I selfishly don't fully agree and am weary what could happen to them in the future.\n\nI tend to innovate and come up with something nice like ultra roam heavy Morgana mid. I actually picked boots of mobility first and from there theorycrafted who has the most \"unstoppable\" waveclear and punishing ganks. Morgana is ultimately the best answer however a few other work closely such as Zillean and Varus maybe before some of his changes. As dumb and simple as the playstyle is I love it because it's effective and it's mostly unique to me. There's something funny about a huge 3 second snare doing massive damage.\n\nWith recent mass class changes to champions and items these recent years the champion meta soil has been tiled a lot. Professionals looking for the next thing and casuals alike give these reworked champions another look. Champions I used to look at before their changes. Don't get me wrong I feel like a lot of changes have good intentions and usually go in an interesting direction. Overall though, either from conforming design choices or exposure + further conforming changes things tend to be homogenized to push the _ideal meta role_ for each character.\n\nI understand that the game today has a very defined meta but in order to make characters fit it feels like overtime it started to make characters all operate in a more similar way. Old old champions like Teemo or Tryndamere or Kayle or TF or Morgana or Veigar even Anivia. There's something very different about them. Compared to newer champions who are designed to MUST have potent waveclear or w/e in their role. And it's not like... new champions AREN'T unique. Plenty are. But idk.\n\nI also feel a large problem comes from itemization. I feel like itemization going forward is gonna need some serious work to keep from stagnating. AP champions in particular had a poor round of itemization changes with the mage rework in my opinion. In fact we already had to stomp out Rylias and Gunblade a bit. It feels \"dumb\" to me how generically Morellos provides nearly every mage with a perfect dose of stats and it's only offset by temporarily passing on powerful defensive stat options. And there's no significant risky \"glass\" build anymore and building that way is rarely rewarded fairly. Also tank item balance [and % pen] has been a significant issue too. With tanks dominating the competitive meta game constantly even against the will of certain professional top laners [unless something else is _massively_ broken GP/Jayce/Kennen/Fiora], and the same gank heavy assassin like junglers building into bruiser/tank constantly. Ranged mids roleplaying ap bruisers in certain metas. Defensive powers generally underrated/nerfed later. Offensive powers immediately nerfed and restrained. That whole pattern has been so long it itself is becoming the expected experience. We have lethality again now but I'm curious how long it'll last and if it can even compete against the standard mage and tank and ranged carry gameplay that's so cookie cutter in high level play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PimpStickNasus","date":"2017-07-22T17:05:45.034+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Step one: Get top\nStep two: Lock in Kled\nStep three: Choose one; ADC Kled, Lethality Kled, Tank Kled, Multiple juggernaut Kled builds, Bruiser Kled.\nStep four: Jhin\nStep five: Moral victory and prolly a win too\n\nMy point is you can build Kled as you wish","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-07-23T01:27:57.171+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss my random mix of AP and AD scalings.

I don't really agree with you on this one.\n\n\nFighters can choose between diving into the enemy team for kills, or peeling a little while dealing out a little damage. They cab sometimes also choose to split and look for TP ganks so they can make cross map plays.\n\nTanks are there to soak up damage and peel, the idea that a tank just stands there is misguided. There tanks need to not only soak up damage, but they also need to build for the games situation (Which can be hard at times), and peel for the entire team. Some tanks are like Gragas where they can make plays to initiate, others are like Naut (top) and can be used to just peel.\n\nAssassins can do many things, some like {{champion:245}} are mostly used for splitting, while others like {{champion:55}} can be used to teamfight, but honestly they both could choose to do either. Some like {{champion:91}} or{{champion:238}} look to try and catch someone out before a fight, kill thme, and start a 4v5. Also most assassins need to outplay the enemy team to do their job and assassinate someone, because of Exhaust, the supports, and the tanks trying to peel them off. \n\nSupports are by no means the most diverse role, midlaners are by far the most diverse, because every midlaner has a job to do in a fight, and all of them are different in some aspects.","replies":[{"poster":"CytheGuy","date":"2017-07-22T19:48:31.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"However, if you've been playing this game as long as us, then you get used to everything.
