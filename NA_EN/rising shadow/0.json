What I don&#039;t get is why we have to suffer the points lost because 1 or more of my teammates left the game after the 3 min mark and caused us to lose. Why do we lose points? Could there be a no points loss scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-15T00:24:50.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"time to duo/flex using my smurf... ah damn.. we are losing.... ima just afk so no one has to lose points... just my smurf anyways.","replies":[]}]}
