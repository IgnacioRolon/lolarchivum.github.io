They can ban lets say kassadin, and yet i have the option to select him, when i do select him, it selects another champion entirely. As if the icons are not right. It happens probably every 1 out of 5 games. Im not sure if I should repair my client or what but it can been happening since the last patch (3.1.2) i believe","replies":[]},{"poster":"FromTXwithLove","date":"2013-10-02T19:58:30.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that mean you could ban Kass for the other team AND THEN PICK KASSADIN??","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-10-02T19:08:14.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey IMythikos,\n\nNot going to lie, I had to stare at your screenshot for about 5 minutes before I finally found the issue you were referencing.  I have to say that I've never seen this issue before.  Does this consistently happen?  Or was this only a one-time occurrence?  \n\nI look forward to your response!","replies":[]}]}
