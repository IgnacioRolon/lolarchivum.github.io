I'd advise you to seek out self-muting programs that replace your enter key or to learn to just not say anything, or at least tone it down. Getting mad is totally acceptable if you don't go overboard. For instance, \"I'm going to beat you up\" and \"I'm going to shoot up my school\" in real life are handled way differently, regardless of actual threat. Saying \"wow, you're bad\" now and again won't trigger a punishment. Saying \"kys\" or anything like that will.

Which brings us to right now, where in this last season rito has implemented a policy of autoban bots. They don't care about context, there is no person reviewing your bans, they have a directive where by if there are any words or phrases that are in their toxic log you will automatically get banhammered. So for example lets say you said \"this poro needs to gtfo of my way\" right? Nothing particularly toxic about that, you aren't aiming it at a person, just a npc right? But if you were reported by someone in that game the autoban bot would pick up the phrase \"gtfo\" and you would automatically get a banstrike against you.
