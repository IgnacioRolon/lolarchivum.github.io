RIght now Udyr has never (seriously, anyways) been picked in a professional scenario, nor is he prized for his ability to be a strong jungler, at all. \n\nSo I decided to post an idea that may make him viable.\n\nUdyr has always been known for that \"all melee\" with no gap-closers. However, this could keep him all melee, and provide a gap closer.\n\n\nIdea:\n\n**PASSIVE:**\nWhen Udyr is in combat, he gains insight on his enemies, and he reduces enemy champions armor by 3/5/7 every 2 seconds (within 350 range). This effect can stack up to 2 times.\n\n**Q: Tiger Stance **\n*6/5.75/5.50/5.25/5 seconds*\n**Activation:** Gains 35/50/75/90/105% attack speed for 4 seconds. \n**Persistent: **Udyr's basic attacks rip away at the target's flesh causing them to bleed for 0.8/0.85/0.9/0.95/1% (+0.05 attack damage) of their missing health over 3 seconds. The damaging effect can stack up to 3 times. \n\n**W: Turtle Stance**\n*6/6/6/6/6 seconds*\n**Activation: **Gains a 60/80/100/120/140 (+5% max health) shield for 5 seconds.\n**Persistent: **Udyr takes 6/6.5/7/7.5/8% less damage (does not apply to true damage), and gains 6/8/10/12/14 health regeneration per 5 seconds.\n\n**E: Bear Stance**\n*12/11/10/9/8 seconds*\n**Activation: **Udyr gains a 3 second buff that will cause him to gain 15% movement speed, ignore unit collision, and his basic attacks will stun a target, and 1 target directly behind it within 300 range for 1.5 seconds. [The effect behind the initial target would have a deadly stun effect that travels at about the width of Zed's Q]\n**Persistent:** Udyr gains 5% movement speed, and basic attacks will stun the target for 0.75 seconds, there is an internal cooldown per target of 8 seconds.\n\n**R: Phoenix Stance**\n*22/21/20/19/18*\n**Activation:** Udyr's next basic attack will swoop Udyr into the air to land on his target. He lands in a burst of flame dealing 100/145/190/235/280 magic damage + 6/6.5/7/7.5/8% current health. 475 range.  (Usable on allies - does no damage but 350 range) [The flame effect here is similar to LeBlanc's Distortion AoE] [The way it will fly in is like Corki's w, except it is not a skill shot. You choose a target, and Udyr is coming for you!]\nNo persistent effect.\n\n- No change to how his abilities can be leveled\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"F0ND","date":"2015-03-15T07:43:07.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be utterly broken.","replies":[]}]}
