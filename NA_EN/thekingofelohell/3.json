Beware.\r\n\r\nThis is the death of a 1 trick. I have mained Mordekaiser for 6 and a half years since his release Feb 24, 2010. 10,000+ games and over 2,140,000 Mastery...\r\n\r\nI have also demoted from Diamond on not only my smurf, Lord Morde; but also my main, TheKingofEloHell. I was absolutely static when [I first hit Diamond 7 months ago I thought I was going to climb so high] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rvLb26CfCQ) and FINALLY prove myself to the League community as the 1 trick that *could* indeed take a well disliked champion and change the meta with him.\r\n\r\nI worked my ass off for this champion guys. Like I really really tried. I innovated in ways you guys can hardly fathom. I coined the [Holy Diver gank bot] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrrF4Luf6Q8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m43s) and even the [Mordekaiser Master of Medicine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybtlJbb3VU) strat from one of my first front pagers on [Mordekaiser Jungle] (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3yjc7n/morde_jungle_gave_me_300_lp_in_48_hours_and_i/)\r\n\r\nI even got my **stupid butt permanently banned** in the LeagueofLegends subreddit because I continued spamming my Morde content, not only to promote myself, but most importantly to inform people about Morde.\r\n\r\n* Given that the current Meta encourages counters to Morde top, (Jayce and Kennen and Gnar and Fiora) --\r\n\r\n* that the meta expects useless DMG supports (Sona, Zyra) or Utility back liners (Nami, Soraka, Janna) (Nevermind that Mordekaiser&#039;s ally heals make theirs look silly)\r\n\r\n* and CC&#039;less Junglers, (I have come to loath both Nunu and Graves JG)\r\n\r\n Mordekaiser is left without frontline to achieve his perfect team fight. His goal to enslave the enemy ADC is lost as the main objective in every single game. Expecting teammates to pick around me is impossible because unlike Yasuo comps- No one has any idea what the fuck Mordekaiser does. It is with great sadness that I officially retire as the Morde 1 trick......and branch off into a new chapter of League. Which after the moving eulogy above, is the real goal of this post.\r\n\r\nI was inspired watching the finale between SSG and SKT. Seeing so many awesome plays from CuVee (especially that poppy teleport to Elder Dragon pit for the 3 man ult) made me for the first time playing League, want to learn OTHER champs. So I am asking YOU guys; what champs, *no matter the role*, would you most recommend me learning? I intend to learn them all, but knowing where to start both mechanically and intellectually is daunting given the size of this game now. It&#039;s so much bigger than it was 6 and a half years ago..\r\n\r\nPlease assist me in becoming a better player.\r\n\r\n-Signed a player who just wanted to put the **Meta** in Master of **Metal**.","replies":[]}
