Morde relies on teammates to CC the carries so he can kill. If Leona had not died for the first ghost, none of that would have happened. Morde has no cc or escapes.

Ofcourse he would go for the leona while he still had ult. I just planned for that and used her death to heal myself so I could kill him. What could thresh have done better? I mean he landed all his hooks right? What about the vayne? What's wrong with an adc shoving in the lane while he jungler and support fail to 2v2? Then we she DOES come in she ults and tumbles and then cond- oh wait, she's oom. Sad this is true, but a common mistake. I get 2 kills and thresh escapes. He goes back to base. Both adc and Jungler are now spawning. Oh darn we got dragon. Well at least we're returning back to la- OH FK DRAGON IS DIVING US FROM BEHIND OUR TOWER!?!?!? CRAP we dont have any sums left cuz of the previous deaths. Rammus tanks tower and kills himself to vayne. Mid decides to come help his team. Get exhausted by leona. His ult is wiffed. Thresh dies under tower after landing both hook and ult, but hey- I'm just too strong with Drag ghost. Vayne tries to finish me off where viktor failed. I'm lower hp than she is and my leona is oom- oh wait, leona jsut got enough mana after viktor death to E again. Oh nuts, morde's ult is up again, let's proc leona's passive and we E and R for the kill and THIRD ghost in less than 4 minutes. That's a LOT of pressure.
