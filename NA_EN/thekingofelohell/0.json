But the entire point of the poll is to get the community counting the days until Tyler1 has been banned for exactly 1 year. (April 30th, 2017)\n\nI want to see if the community believes he shows signs of reform, if he can instead become a symbol of redemption, rather than toxicity.\n\nPolls make this a far more interactive thread. I need Polls :( and I can't post it anywhere except Player Behavior and GD.
