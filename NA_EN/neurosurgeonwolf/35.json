I never have had weed in my life, not even once. I never have drank alcohol either.\n\nYet as someone who actually was in medicine for a brief time and designed and conducted numerous pharmacy research experiments I am outright livid whenever I hear some \"enlightened\" individual \"bestow their knowledge\" upon others.\n\nThis is a hilariously messed up notion. Research actually indicates many many many maaany positive effects from cannabis ranging from improved mood at the low end all the way to pote Tilly offsetting the neural damage of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nPretty much the entire negatives that have been solidly proven are the fact that the lung alveoli do NOT like particulate matter in them. But that doesn't matter if its cigarette smoke or dust clouds or asbestos. The lungs hate particles.\n\nBut all of the idiots saying weed makes you become Satan are wrong. I've seen studied try and overdose mice and even some controversial studies of them trying to OD people. The most I have seen in humans is increase in food intake and sleepiness.\n\nI do not see people getting increased amounts of cancer or renal failure or liver failure because apparently weed in the bloodstream damages hepatocytes and I do not see increased plaque in arteries (leading to strokes heart issues congestive issues etc) or neuropathy. All of that is buzz words portrayed by the uneducated media that the equally uneducated population picks up and holds as gospel.\n\nSo many fucking sheep IRL and in game. I want to get a crate full of Baby Jesus and hand them out saying y'all motha effers need Jesus.","replies":[]}
