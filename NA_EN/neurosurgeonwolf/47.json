They're basically the equivalent to a sack of meat but irritating.\n\n-dont lift. And I am sorry but I honestly refuse to be with a guy who doesn't lift\n\n-have no goddamn brains whatsoever. I don't give a shit if you don't have a degree or a PhD. But I expect some mental fortitude. Like bitxh if your ass cannot grasp simple shit then just walk right out that door. Fucking peasants.\n\n-dont care and are so apathetic to anything other than sex that it is just so fucking dull. Like if you do something then be excited and tell me and be excited about my stuff. I work that positive energy bounces back and forth between me and others. If you can't get excited then like gtfo. No downers please.\n\n-too skinny. Holy ducking ducks I am so ducking tired of all these skinny ass guys tall or small who are just skinny little toys. Like honestly no honey. I like bears and I like powerlifters and I do not want to be dating someone who is so slender I fear I could break them by hugging them.\n\n-too socially awkward. Like I get shyness is typically what is meant but I also mean the ones who are DUCKING LOUD, ANNOYING, OBNOXIOUS LITTLE SHITS WHO DO NOT KNOW WHEN OR WHERE TO SHUT UP. LIKE GOD DAMN HOLD YOUR TONGUE.\n\n-The ones where they boil their main identity to their sexuality. Bitch there ain't nothing that pisses me off more than the thought of me being boiled down to the fact I like hotdogs more than bacon strips. Like seriously put a goddamn cork into it and be a diverse multifaceted person. \n\n-The overabundance of sexual talk. Like sure a sexual joke here and there is cute. Butwith a lot of gay guys its EVERYWHERE. Like sexual remark eeverywhere. It isn't even a goddamn remark at that poi t or witty. Its just fucking crude and obnoxious when for the 1000th time that day you make a phallic reference. Just get a grip- not even jocks in Jr high talked about sex that much. Holy god I HATE this.\n\n\n-FLAKEY AS HELL. And playing hard to get. Girl if you can't fucking man up and tell me how you feel then goodbye. Communication is something our specifies depended on to survive. \n\n-oh and \"shade\". No you don't come across as witty or funny you come across as a fucking asshole. Throwing insults and ripping others down is wearing to listen to even if I am not the target. Like get a goddamn moral compass and act like a man not a bitch. Kindness is a goddamn virtue.\n\n...\n\nWHERE THE FUCK IS A NORMAL GAY GUY?\nI am seriously not even upset about not having a bf because the shithole area I live in doesn't haveany good gay men.","replies":[]}
