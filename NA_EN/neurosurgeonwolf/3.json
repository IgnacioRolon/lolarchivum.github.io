(As in, not a prewritten preordained policy).\n\nhttp://brettrutecky.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/129.jpg\n\nWhy or why not?\n\nAnd then on the flip side, do you think people truly have freedom of thought, or that we outselves are biological machines made of trillions of electrochemical signals? If we are able to be creative with our neuronal signals why can't machines, or can they? \n\nMaybe it's just a matter of clumping the right signals together in the right way with the proper faculties to interact with the world and reason with it to come up with \"creativity\". Perhaps a better way of putting it is maybe we can have AI one day, instead of fitting blocks into the children's toy to solve it, to knock off the entire toy and solve the task ina  way we never ever would have expected.\n\nhttp://teachingmama.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Tower-1024x512.jpg\n\n\n I have my own thoughts on all of these subjects but I am curious about GD's thoughts.","replies":[]}
