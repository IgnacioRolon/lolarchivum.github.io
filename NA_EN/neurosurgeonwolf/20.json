Like I am sure that the game's entire team is frothing from the mouth with sheer ecstacy that this information was \"revealed\". Like they must be just utterly electrically estatic and beside themselves. \n\nWhy? Because this officially killed this game for many players. And we're talking big names, like actual big names. \n\nI am wondering, how much did blizzard pay Riot for Riot to intentionally kick it's playerbase over to overwatch?\n\nThere is some CONSISTENT MAJOR BAD decisions going on. This is like, astounding that the patches can get successively worse and then this tidbit is dropped... Coincidence?!?!?!? REALLY?!?!? Hard to believe.\nhttps://secure.static.tumblr.com/380d3b55bf62f0cbe2ffda2dd028c6d3/ejocu9w/GAenxxwru/tumblr_static_tumblr_static_2h8r81615tmow0g84ks40o8oc_640.png\n\n\n\nOh and let's not forget.\n\n#MAGE OPPRESSION.\n\nYeah, that is still a thing. GG on the second mage gutting.\n\nAs an actual mage main I find it more and more difficult to log on even when my RL friends play. And overwatch isn't even out. The game just isn't fun anymore now after my fave champs were annihilated, again, and again. Oh and again. Ohhhh and let's not forget my main years ago being turned into shit with a useless peashooter {{champion:101}}  Yeah, still not over that one.\n\n\n\nhttp://38.media.tumblr.com/74b1fdcba02bd5f03ff1533f1200144a/tumblr_nes5iauIde1tndn6wo1_r2_400.gif","replies":[]}
