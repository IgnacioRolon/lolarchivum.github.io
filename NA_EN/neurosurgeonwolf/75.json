Like I have chosen to keep fighting and not give up, I decided that 100%. \n\nYet... when will it be my turn to be happy? (\"Blah blah blah you're lying/trolling blah\". My persona I put on here is crafted and fake, I'm being serious here for once. Probably because I am exhausted, feeling a bit lonely and whatever else. Let's face it, GD is my #1 social outlet at present.)\n\n\nThing about me is I help people nonstop, I've tutored over 30 different CS students this semester alone already for example. (Like I can literally list probably 9 other things I do to help people).\n\n I support friends who are going through rough times and do everything I can but in the end they don't even return the favor. Like one girl seriously seems to have a rough go every week and I sit there thinking to myself \"At least you have someone that loves you.\" Like I authentically support her but at the same time I can't help but feel jealous, she may be unhappy but she isn't lonely like I actually am. And whenever I feel down she isn't there at all for me, not even once. \n\nThere are, unfortunately, over 10 cases just like that one I picked above ^^\n\nSo... I sit here wondering after Brandon died what the fuck happened to me, why did things change so much? I actually was supposed to go into medicine and I moved down to TX with him to do it, he ended up being hit by a truck(with me) and died. I ran back home and honestly ... I'm still not over it. This was 2.5  years ago and I'm still upset.\n\nI honestly do try to make an effort to find dates, I've got a POF account and an OKcupid account and even a few others. None of them have been fruitful, not even one. Years later of trying and I'm still left to just be that guy who \"left med\" or \"who couldn't handle death\", the names go on and on. I have actually prettymuch heard it all. \n\nHell, even recently I outright changed paths to go into CS and honestly it was the single best decision of my life. But even that's come with struggles with identity because I don't fit in- I know too much at a high level and too many applications of knowledge and it pisses off people. I'm actually not even sure if I will be formally accepted into compsci this year, I took over 10 CS courses in this degree. To put it lightly I am... stressed. I feel taxed to the limit and anxious. \n\nCompsci is like my salvation, idk how to describe it otherwise. I love it, I love everything about it (other than assembly) like crafting my own programs and watching what I write come to life... it is amazing. And yet there is the looming impending threat that I won't get in and \"haha bitch it's over, DREAMS OVER WELCOME BACK TO REALITY.\" Like, God damn it I am terrified of that to the point of tears. I am doing everything I can do get in, working so hard I get 2-5 hours sleep most nights the past 3 weeks.\n\nSo combine stupid Teddy Ghrams that are cute as fuck reminding me of my fiance, me remembering Brandon and my current shitty life situation... When will it be my turn to be loved again?\n\nLike when will it be my turn to be happy? When will someone actually love me for who I am? I've tried and I am NOT giving up but I just sit here wondering when I will finally be given the chance to move on and be happy again.\n\n\nAnd for the record I am not \"depressed\" or anything, not even close, but I am actually wondering about this... like seriously cause my life is difficult as fuck- when will I find love again or feel \"the spark\" or whatever other crap? Like I am not going to give up or quit but at the same point I need something or someone to fight for, right now I feel like I am in an apathetic limbo.","replies":[]}
