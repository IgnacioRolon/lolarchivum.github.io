Sona, Zyra, etc are useless trash now. And disgust me.\n\nAlso the item, since it is so risk heavy, has no gold generation worth talking about unless your enemy team comp lets you poke them asunder. I can't even get away with that on my plat normals on this account, how the fuck do you expect that to be viable higher?\n\nEnemy team picks blitz, you picked something actually viable in ADC dominance meta like lulu and get grabbed and 100-0'd","replies":[]}
