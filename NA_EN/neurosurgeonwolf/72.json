I&#039;m old I guess.\n\n_What does that mean though?_ I bought a hell of a lot of runes, pages upon pages of runes.\n\n*But I also used them.* And I don&#039;t feel guilty about it either. I invested into those runes and through time some of them became garbage and some of them became god tier (hi armor penetration). \n\n#But at the end of the day I got my money/times worth out of them. I played with some of my runes for literally years.\nIt outlasted multiple gaming laptops I bought. *shrug*\n\n\n#2: Stop kidding yourselves. Even if you weren&#039;t given IP you&#039;d still play the game. Sure you&#039;d complain but at the end of the day you&#039;ll till be buying skins and playing.\n\n*boom* \n\n[The fact they give any compensation is actually pretty good P.R.. They could be like blizzard and make some &quot;dumpster mode&quot; (aka wild mode in hearthstone) and throw them all into there with 0 compensation whatsoever.]\n\n#3: The removal of runes actually opens up opportunities to flesh out the game in other areas.\n\n_Why aren&#039;t more people excited about this? Major changes to the game spices up the meta, makes it more unique and gives something with a bit more punch to it!_\n\nI&#039;m excited at least at the prospects~","replies":[]}
