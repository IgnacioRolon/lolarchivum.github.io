I think anyone with a brain can see the flaws in this.)\n\n#2: &ldquo;Blaming the majority of normal men for rape&hellip;is wrong,&rdquo; Mr. Elliott, a 53-year-old Toronto man, wrote back in September of 2012. &ldquo;Rapists are not normal men; they&rsquo;re crazy. Why not blame the mentally ill?&rdquo;\n\n &ldquo;Are you kidding me?&rdquo;, pounded her fist and then announced, &ldquo;I know lots of normal men who have raped; I have been raped by normal men.&rdquo;\n\n\n(Because apparently all men are rapists and it&#039;s normal for a man to be a rapist. I am male and I am sitting here like:\nhttp://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lilr75Kh9g1qdlkgg.gif\n)\n\n\n#3: More feminist entitlement, also this should be illegal as it&#039;s a threat to his safety and wellbeing ontop of other obvious things.\n\n&ldquo;So I found the Twitter account of that fuck ....&rdquo; she tweeted. &ldquo;Should I sic the Internet on him?&rdquo;\n\n#4: Because this isn&#039;t outright fucking psychotic.\n(1) &ldquo;I put it to you that you wanted to ruin Bendilin Spurr&rsquo;s life?&rdquo; he asked.\n &ldquo;I was simply making people aware,&rdquo; Ms. Guthrie replied, but she acknowledged if others took action that ruined his life, &ldquo;I would not feel sorry about that.&rdquo;\nhttp://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqannkpmzx1qdlkgg.gif\n\n(2) \"She&rsquo;s also genuinely alarming, because she believes, as she testified Friday, in Internet vigilante justice &mdash; &ldquo;extra-judicial action,&rdquo; as she called it once &mdash; even if it might put the target&rsquo;s physical safety at risk.\"\n\n\n(YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. EVEN IF IT MIGHT PUT THE TARGET'S PHYSICAL SAFTEY AT RISK. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT!\n\nHOLY SHIT.\nhttps://quizzicalllama.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/tumblr_lyq4zxojhv1qbtmut.gif\n\n)\n\n\n#5: Maybe HE should be taking HER to court to put HER into jail\n\n&lsquo;So you&rsquo;re in favour of putting Hunter Moore in possible physical danger, yes or no?&rsquo;\n\n&lsquo;In this specific situation&hellip;in light of the actions he took and in light the law&rsquo;s inability, yes &hellip; depending on the case, yes&rsquo;\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SbDowkKFrRw/U9RszMvtFUI/AAAAAAAAGQs/64hDt9UhH10/s1600/tumblr_md8o5y1YXd1qe8i9yo6_250.gif\n\n\n#6: Oh did I forget to mention they also conspired ahead of time with many people to do this? Whoops, let me not forget that CRUCIAL HORRIFYING FACT.\n\n\"According to the letter, parts of which the judge read aloud in open court, the person claimed to be a former acquaintance of the three complainants and alleges they **“conspired, in my presence, to fabricate a criminal harassment complaint”** against Mr. Elliott.\n\nThe person also alleged the conspiracy extends “to the ministry of the attorney-general,” information relayed in the summer of 2012 by two of the complainants’ friends.\"\n\n\n#7: Let's not forget these women, grown adult women, DOXXED someone.\n\n\"When she appeared on the witness stand in the Elliott case, his lawyer questioned Guthrie about her behaviour during the video game incident. The man who created the video game had his personal details ‘doxxed’ (published online). \"\n\n\nLet me explain what a dox is:\nDoxing (from dox, abbreviation of documents),[1] or doxxing,[2][3] is the Internet-based practice of researching and broadcasting personally identifiable information about an individual.[3][4][5][6] The methods employed to acquire this information include searching publicly available databases and social media websites (like Facebook), hacking, and social engineering. It is closely related to cyber-vigilantism and hacktivism.\n\n-Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing\n\nHackers and amateur detectives alike can harvest the information from the internet about individuals. A basic Web search can yield results. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Linkedin offer a wealth of private information, because many users have high levels of self-disclosure (i.e. sharing their photos, place of employment, phone number, email address), but low levels of security. It is also possible to extrapolate a person's name and home address from a cell-phone number, through such services as reverse phone lookup.[11]\n\nOnce an individual has been exposed through doxxing, they may be targeted for harassment through methods such as harassment in person, fake signups for mail and pizza deliveries, or through swatting (dispatching armed police to their house through spoofed tips). Doxxing is therefore a standard tactic of online harassment campaigns such as the Gamergate movement and vaccine conspiracy theorists.[12][13][14][15]\n\n\n(... And I need not explain why THAT is NOTTTTTTTTT trivial.)\n\n\n\n#8: Oh and fascinatingly enough here is one of the two women (they are old enough, 29, to realize that this is stupid) saying that CYBERBULLYING SHOULDN&#039;T BE CRIMINALIZED.\n\nThey are saying, cyberbullying should NOT be a criminal offense. \n\nWell gee after reading / viewing all this I fucking wonder why they&#039;d say that. \"Because oh my god it&#039;s like our favorite way of inflicting grief upon others because our lives are so fucking boring lel\"\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWwJ8TVZl-Y&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nAll I can say is, these girls need Jesus.\n\n(But really they need some serious help. Like serious serious help. This isn't right or okay or fine. This is flagrantly psychotic as in the DSM (diagnostic statistical manual of mental health psychotic).)\n\nThey are dangerous, wildly dangerous, and a toxic venom to society that have shown their claws and severely injured a fellow human being. **They are not feminists, they are dangerous psychopaths using feminism as a guise to plot planned strategic attacks upon the well being of other human beings.\n**\nThey are dangerous, have shown that they are dangerous, and should be dealt with as the criminals that they are. \n\n\n\nSource 1: http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-the-twitter-trial-of-gregory-elliott-is-becoming-much-like-twitter-itself-shrill-and-uber-sensitive\n\nSource 2: http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-twitter-harassment-trial-halted-by-surprise-letter-alleging-fraudulent-conspiracy-against-accused\n\nSource 3: http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-complainant-willing-to-be-self-appointed-sheriff-of-wild-west-twitterverse\n\nSource 4: http://www.genuinewitty.com/2014/06/11/feminist-slacktivists-shut-down-free-speech-in-toronto-feat-stephanie-guthrie-artscape/","replies":[]}
