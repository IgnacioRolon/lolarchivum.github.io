But it will leave a huge scar","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has been destroying their own champions and player bases for years. \n\nDeception: magma chamber, replay, solo queue, and many many more.\n\nDestruction: mages in their most recent rework, xerath years ago, urgot, and so so so so so many more. \n\nAnd people are getting sick of the same old same old.  That&#039;s why HOTS is a relative failure. Why play hots when league does MOBA better? Hots wasnt even fun to play for me. It was doomed to fail.\n\nWhy? Because it was the same thing lol did. It was a cheap knockoff.\n\n\n\nNow let&#039;s get to the point. Overwatch is a game that is completely different to mobas. Very different. It looks and feels and plays way different. The characters are exciting and active. The playstyle is fast paced and tactical attached he same time.  The games are fast paced and crazy and explosive.\n\nGraphics are also very good. When compared to league though they are a couple billion light-years ahead. \n\nI think what people forget is people WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. something good novel. Something good they haven't played a thousand ++++ times the past few years. \n\nOverwatch delivers that. With pretty cinematicsure and lore.\n\nOh wait. Remember when league destroyed lore?\n\nBOOM ANOTHER PART OF THE PLAYER BASE THEY ALIENATED. The rpers and the lore lovers. See? The reasons stack up. It isn't just one single reason.\n\nSo will league die? No.\n\nWill I log on and play when my friends do still after overwatch is released? Yes.\n\nDo I think queue times will increase? Fewer players? Fewer dedicated players? Yes yes and yes.\n\nIt will not kill the game. But it will deliver a solid slap in the face to riot. Who have been all but flipping off the player bases every patch.","replies":[]}
