This is an introductory one where we cover relational algebra, ER diagrams and other cute stuff.\n\nSo I just had an assignment where I had the 10 most bizzare whacked out queries I had to write.\n\n4 of the 10 took me over 70 lines for a query. Yes. Really. No I couldn&#039;t have made it smaller.\n\nWorst part that IS bothering me is this, the fact that we covered the easy stuff in lecture. We didn&#039;t cover ANY of the advanced topics we had to implement.\n\nLike isn&#039;t the point of being lectured by an industry leader to KNOW HOW TO BEST TACKLE HARD PROBLEMS? No really I was knee deep into oracle documentation and stack overflow and oracle foruns. And even then BARELY could do it.\n\nWhat the fuck am I paying for. I AM frustrated.\n\nAlso don't damn well tell me self teaching myself multi layered nested queries with multiple segregated groupings and aggregated functions in each was covered. No it wasn't.","replies":[]}
