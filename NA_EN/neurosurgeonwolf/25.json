Yes I am serious. Here is proof.]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah7LYxysuJ8\n\n#This issue (especially with the new youtube changes to monetization) should concern ANY AND ALL GAMERS. This is not something to be ignored or shrugged off lightly. \n\n_It is very likely that the outcome of this will impact the entire future of gaming (streaming, youtube clips, etc. NO MEDIUM IS SAFE. No! Not even twitch!)_\n\nDMCA claim is a controversial thing because it implies that the person basically has taken content and has placed it for others to view/profit/whatever from. But youtubers like pewdiepie (1) cut content and shape it to a video [and editing, music, yadda yadda] (2) give massive commentary (3) are mostly selling their personality.\n\nEssentially creating it into completely new content. It can be considered educational even (eg: learning to play League of Legends from a pro player), or perhaps a parody.\n\nThat&#039;s why for instance tyler1 is more popular than John Doe for LoL streaming. Because he has a personality that shines through. Same baseline game, but it&#039;s the personality and the editing that \n\nEven more interesting is it is a symbiotic relationship between developers and streamers. If there was no streamers for LoL, do you think it would have gotten as big as it is now? (Answer: Doubtable.). Pewdiepie for instance is the absolute god send of game developers. If you get your game on pewdiepie's channel!?!? \n\n*Boom* Massive paycheque coming up. \n\nWhy? Because it is literally massive large scale advertisements _that the viewers actually give a damn about instead of muting out or tabbing away and ignoring_. There is literally no better form of advertisement for ANY video game.\n\nYou have a captive audience (pewdiepie's fanbase) literally staring at your game that they:\n\n-Likely never heard of.\n\n-Likely never would have otherwise heard of.\n\n-Are seeing the game in action (showing off what it can do)\n\n-Are provoked into purchasing the game (because their hero/idol pewdiepie played it)\n\n\n------------\n\n\nThis Sean person is actually just (purely) virtue signalling in his disgusting tirade. He says that he is all for streamers and gamers and yet throws a fit because pewdiepie makes more money than him (yeah really).\n\n_Bitter. [Hindquarters]. Queen._\n\nhttps://twitter.com/vanaman/status/906984060215427072\n\n\n#Oh and the funniest part? He isn&#039;t even donating the literally hundreds of thousands of dollars he likely made from pewdiepie&#039;s free advertisements for his company.\n\n_When virtue signalling, it&#039;s kind of obvious you&#039;re a fake sack of horse stool when you are like &quot;but oh no? DONATE the money &quot;I earned&quot; from this!? HEAVENS NO!&quot;_\n\n(We all know how rabid and intense pewdiepie fans can be when buying his games. This guy likely made WAY OVER $100,000 alone from pewdiepie&#039;s videos.)\n\nSo where is this &quot;injustly obtained funding&quot; going?\n\n-Not to Irma\n\n-Not to Texas\n\n-Not to any of the big charities\n\n-Not to anyone, anywhere.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/vanaman/status/906985405093838848\n\n\nNah, instead into this greedy virtue-signally spineless jellyfish&#039;s lousy gut. Disgusting.\n\n_\"Something to think about\", huh?_\n\n\n---------\n\n#But that&#039;s not what we should focus on (the people involved in this). The DMCA is the issue.\n\nYoutube removed the content that was\n\n-Edited\n\n-Had custom music\n\n-Had the #1 youtube personality on the planet (pewdiepie) providing commentary and jokes\n\n-Was mostly being sold by pewdiepie&#039;s personality\n\n#And in spite of all of this it was taken down by the DMCA.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nAny content with a video game. No matter who you are, no matter what editing you did, no matter what music you did, no matter ANYTHING... can be DMCA&#039;d down by a game developer at any point in time.\n\n#tl;dr: No content is safe on any medium.\n\nAnd why do I say any medium? Because people can be DMCA strike&#039;d on their streams under the exact same frame of logic. You&#039;re playing a video game which is owned by someone else. You&#039;re expressing their content and making views/whatever else off of it.\n\n#Look at nintendo for a prime example of this.\n\nMeaning that if this mentality prevails and pewdiepie is taken down (which the video WAS removed (which is a BAD signal for all of us gamers!!!!!)) that there will be a new precedent in the video game industry.\n\nAll set because of this sad little indie developer.","replies":[]}
