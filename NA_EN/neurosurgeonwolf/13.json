I just lost horrifically because the text absolutely marred my entire screen, I couldn&#039;t see anything at all and it was overwhelming having my huge screen FILLED to the brim with this text. I can&#039;t see cooldowns properly, I can&#039;t see baron/blue/redbuff properly as it is all mashed potatoes of text and it&#039;s overall horrific.\n\nThis isn&#039;t okay. And I have yet to find a solution for it. There isn&#039;t one? \n\n-Changing UI size does NOT help the text. In fact it doesn't change the text size (???????????????)\n-Have I gone into 4k native resolution? YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. That doesn&#039;t change it though. But It instead brings other issues like the HP bars being crazy small, I will post screenshots of it with it. I naturally play at lower resolutions in fact. I typically like 2k/1k option. This issue persists throughout various screen resolutions.\n-As a PLAYER I have no other options. And I am NOT willing to go to 3rd party mods for this. \n\nI should add a screenshot of the cooldowns of ultimates, it literally makes the hotbar skills unreadable if you have all 4 abilities on cooldown. I kid you not.\n\nEven having a levelup message... look in my screenshot. That's HUGE and clipped off?! I can only read it cause I've seen the message and know what it will say. This is the same for \"skill not learned yet\" warning and all others.\n\nThings to notice that I was OKAY with before.\n-*The level in the level box has huge text right? It's always been like that. I'm OK with THAT ALONE.\n-*The UI bars in 4k native were always ALWAYS tiny. I always went to smaller resolutions explicitly to avoid that.\n\n\nI'll add I am not the only one that has faced this issue.\n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bugs/gRyNb78G-hud-scaling-issue-4k?comment=0000 ","replies":[]}
