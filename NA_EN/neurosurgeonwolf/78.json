Weakness is poke champs that he can't jump jump on.\n\n3: I think leveling Q is useful for waveclear actually. Level E immediately after.\n\n4: Ekko seems MUCH more teamfight oriented. And his teamfight style is based upon the enemy team being focused / tunnel visioned.\n\nIf you land that stun it is ridiculous. It is much more utility than Orianna's by FAR. ALSO if you land his ult you DECIMATE a teamfight.\n\n\nTHINK OF IT LIKE DOTA'S FACELESS VOID THAT DOESN'T STUN YOUR OWN TEAM. IT IS GODLIKE IF IT LANDS. IT IS SO SEVERELY PUNISHING IT IS INSANE.\n\n\n5: He is a lategame carry, his earlygame is EXCEEDINGLY hard to farm with. Very very difficult. But lategame even if he only has 400 AP he can chunk squishies.\n\n6: I strongly suggest a morellonomicon or chalice. Strongly. The CDR is essential for him, without CDR his kit feels a lot more clunky.\n\n7: But when all his skills are ready his kit flows AMAZINGLY and he just can all-in like nobody's business. Trivially simple to proc passive and land Q and E and rack up damage.\n\n8: He turret dives hilariously well. It is just stupid.\n\n9: He dives well, period.\n\n#10: As in lategame if you're Ashe and the carry of the team/only fed member you better surrender. Ekko will 100-0 her even if he only has 400 AP lategame.","replies":[]}
