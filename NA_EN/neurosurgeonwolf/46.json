It really does bug me so much being single and it is a horrifically awful feeling. This is ideally the LAST thread I'll make on the topic, but I am looking for some serious advice on the subject.\r\n\r\nI was to be married 2.5 years ago, yes really, he died when I was going to medicine. Since then I haven't had anyone else in my life, no snuggly cuddle time or kissy love things or (especially) coitus. Yes, that's a long damn time to go without coitus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoo... during this time I've tried to get a man, and honestly nothing has worked. What can I get? I can get a bunch of guys who will hug me, hell I can even convince them to sit on the ground in a room on campus and snuggle me (on the cold hard ground where I just use them as a comfy thing which no doubt sucks for him lol)- I mean that's surely a compliment! I can get some to even wank to take me home. I have yet to find one that doesn't want to hug or kiss me. \r\n\r\nLike if I am meeting with a guy for the first time he already wants to snuggle me, and YES I have standards- we're talking about 22-26 year old guys who have careers and their life in place yadda yadda... and yet they upon meeting me totally want to kiss. Like I remember one guy who was a huge distract manager I sat in his truck and he seriously wanted me to kiss him- I actually didn't because I don't kiss first thing (It's an emotional thing for me). For some guys I can meet up and have a like month long thing with them where we meet nonstop and text a lot and cutesey stuff. \r\n\r\nBut it all ends the same, they don't stay. Either they become insecure saying I am intimidating (because I DO workout, I am getting the education I say I am, I am as ambitious as I say I am), or because they say they are too young to \"settle down\" (the gay community has this trend in it where they like to whore it up because they didn't in Highschool/Jr. High, and a bunch of other things.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo like... what the fuck do I do or what should I do?\r\n\r\nI am legit 23 years old and I feel old as fuck, I feel like I am going to die alone and no one wants me and it makes me miserable. All my friends (straight, I legit have NO GAY FRIENDS- or well I have very few) are getting into relationships and posting cute pictures of themselves getting their first house or popping out babies and I am just sitting here like... My fiancé was killed and fuck my life sucks. Like I miss Brandon so fucking much it kills me inside still, haven't had a person to MOVE ON with. \r\n\r\nLike legitimately speaking I am still in school, doing compsci after swapping out from medicine and I am focusing on that. I do workout 6x a week (yes really. YES REALLY) and have done that since my fiancé's death- am I saying I am Rich Piana? Fuck no, but it is obvious I workout after this long at it. \r\n\r\nBut still I don't get why I can't get a man for myself, I am kind and giving and thoughtful and ambitious and intelligent and authentically care about people- perhaps too much so and thus me leaving medicine for good. It deeply disturbs me... like I see all my friends and then there is me who I KNOW I am called \"dead fiancé guy\"... and it's like... I don't want to be dead fiancé guy. I want to be a LOVED guy. \r\n\r\nAm I a 10/10 in looks? Nope, but I am certainly an 8/10 and actually cute.  But still, many guys just seem to want even more and it's like... I don't even know...\r\n\r\n\r\nSo like seriously, I don't know what the fuck to do or how to feel. I want to be loved, I want to be cuddled and held and told I am loved and that I matter. I just... don't know anymore how to think or feel on it.","replies":[]}
