I&#039;ve known him for years, even back when I was doing medicine- at which time I didn&#039;t consider him anything worth caring about. But over time I have developed a lot of care about him as a person. (I mean yes: Great body, we work out at the same time on weekends, great beard... BUT I CARE ABOUT HIM AS A PERSON!)\n\n&quot;Really MLB? Again? This thread?&quot; No, this one is different. \n\nHe&#039;s been doing his PhD in AI for years, many years, and is about to present it and close it this January. Yeah, really close in time. Issue is he has gotten closer to me inadvertently over the years because of a mutual friend. He&#039;s seen me in some of my worst mood swings and emotional tizzies (this spring was one of the best examples, when I didn&#039;t know if I&#039;d be accpeted in Compsci.). \n\nThe past few months have been hard on me, really hard. I won&#039;t get into it here because I mean I am surviving and fighting on. But fuck has this been hard. Really REALLY fucking hard. 5 compsci courses at once, dealing with the fact I was R&#039;d last year (I can&#039;t use the word on these boards), etc. But fact is I am alive and kicking, screaming and clawing for a future with everything I&#039;ve got. \n\nHe&#039;s been trying to get me to be with him and open up to him, even despite how busy he is (insanely busy) he has offered MANY times to hang out with me and he hopes he can spark that drive/excitement back into me. At one point many weeks ago (months?) I broke and spilled my guts to him on how I felt about leaving medicine, feeling like I don't belong, worried about never getting a relationship, worried about working some meanginless job as an engineer, etc. He was worried and started insisting we hang out. \n\nWhat did I do? I analyzed the situation, as I always do.\n\nNow what am I to do? Hang out with my muscle clad, beautifully bearded and insanely attractive (despite being shorter than me... uh...) friend? Who btw does not clog toilets- sadly going to the gym at the same time for so long... I&#039;d know. \nOR REALIZE I AM THE MOST ABHORRENT EMOTIONAL VAMPIRE ON THE PLANET AND WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING DISTRACTING HIM?! WHAT THE FUCK!?\n\nResult? \nI began avoiding him outright, if I saw him it&#039;d be like I walked into an invisible wall. I would gasp and scurry off. If I noticed him anywhere I would run away and turn tail. I have ran into elevators and everything to stay away. \n\nLast weekend, exactly 7 days ago from now (minus about an hour or so) he confronted me outside the gym when he was going to his car. And I spilled my guts to him a bit: I told him I wanted him as an ally and a friend, that he knows things that I want to misapporpriate from his brain (steal from his brain) and that he is a really awesome person. BUT that I would NEVER EVER EVER be able to forgive myself if I fucked him over or distracted him or had him worry about me. \n\nHis response? He told me he is robust. Literally used THAT word last weekend. I was like... I said nothing and must have looked at him funny and then he said it was a fair concern. He told me he was going to personally invite me to his PhD presentation thingy (what word? I forget?) in January and he said to me that he&#039;d have A LOT more free time after that and put like emphasis on it. So I mean even just that there indicates he wants to me around me a lot and I just... ugh.\n\nLike the convo I can&#039;t remember the rest of but those were the main points. But he knew why I was avoiding him, etc... and that I still wanted to be freinds with him and all that other stuff.\n\nToday I noticed him try and approach me and I walked away without even acknowledging his existence. Even though I did, and his dark beard and dark brown hair were just amazing.\n\nSo I am sitting at home now with my software engineering notes open crying my guts out. \nAm I even doing the right thing? I feel miserable about it.","replies":[]}
