Part ONE","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":28,"down_votes":12,"body":"Norscout and BFNA&rsquo;s big night out.\n\nStaring awkwardly at the ground, BFNA shuffled his feet a little- hands vibrating ever so slightly. His nerves were getting to him. &ldquo;I really hope tonight goes well,&rdquo; he muttered under his breath. The air was a little more chilled than usual tonight, his breath forming little puffs of white clouds in his wake.\n\nSuddenly, a few footsteps were heard&mdash;his head and eyes darting to the left where he heard the footsteps come from BFNA looked half in fear and half in giddy excitement. Unfortunately it was only an old granny who was shuffling by, carrying with her a woven basket with a hideous pink ribbon on it. \n\n&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; BFNA spoke aloud, as his eyes returned to the pavement yet again. The granny eyeballed him after his outcry for love as if BFNA was an abomination. Continuing her shuffle, the granny turned the corner. \n\n&ldquo;Eyyy! BFNA!!!!!!!!!&rdquo; came a loud male voice, and then a shadow swooped over BFNA and knocked him to a wall eagerly. The sound of falling groceries could be heard from afar. &ldquo;Mon dieu,&rdquo; muttered the granny as she dropped her basket on the ground in shock, &ldquo;these abominations!&rdquo; BFNA stood there in the wall paralyzed in fear, as he heard the granny and looked in her direction in fear. It was Norscout, eyeing him down like BFNA was a tasty gazelle on the field, and him the ferocious lion. \n\n&ldquo;N-N- Norscout&hellip;!&rdquo; BFNA exclaimed. &ldquo;How are you doing!?&rdquo; Norscout asked. &ldquo;I- I am fine&hellip;!&rdquo; BFNA replied, a ring of fear in his voice. Norscout continued to eye down his prey longingly. \n\n&ldquo;S-so are we going to see the m-movie?&rdquo; BFNA inquired. \n\n&ldquo;Yes! Starwars! Aren&rsquo;t you excited?&rdquo; Norscout then turned around and walked a few steps and then turned his head back to eye BFNA still splat against the wall in terror, &ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Y-yes!&rdquo; BFNA clamored to get himself together, checking that he still had his cellphone in his pocket, &ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; Walking awkwardly with a slightly misplaced skip in his step, BFNA now was walking side by side the dashing Nordic beast. \n\n&ldquo;So those support mains, huh?&rdquo; Norscout rhetorically asked, &ldquo;Always getting carried!&rdquo; BFNA blushed a little, &ldquo;I- I suppose..!&rdquo; Norscout then leaned a bit on BFNA&rsquo;s shoulder as they walked and looked at BFNA a bit, waiting for a response. BFNA&rsquo;s cheeks donned a hue even more fitting for the color of passion, unsure how to respond. \n\nBFNA looked Norscout in the eyes and he knew what to say, &ldquo;I-&hellip;.&rdquo; But alas the words wouldn&rsquo;t come out of his mouth, &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Norscout prompted him, &ldquo;Yeah, BFNA?&rdquo; BFNA looked him straight in the eyes and said with confidence, &ldquo;I could carry you.&rdquo; Norscout smiled, his white teeth showing off his large canines&mdash;he looked as happy as if he could just sink his teeth into BFNA after hearing that.\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear,&rdquo; Norscout said, wrapping his left arm around BFNA as they walked&mdash;half shocking BFNA to death, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Your arm&hellip;.!&rdquo; BFNA cried out. Norscout took his eyes off BFNA to look at the set of lights ahead and then specified, &ldquo;The theatre is just past these lights.&rdquo; BFNA looked onwards recognizing that it was true, as well as that Norscout&rsquo;s Viking hold over him was getting tighter. As the lights were about to change, Norscout blew some of his breath into the air- a giant poof of breath. BFNA cringed a bit and then smirked.\nCrossing the street they finally arrived at the theatre.   \n\nWalking into the theatre BFNA felt his heart skip a beat, wondering to himself if he was truly doing this. There were a bunch of cute couples standing around, eagerly talking about lightsabers, deathstars, darth vader and other starwars related things. BFNA and Norscout walked up to the register together.\n\nThere was a very heavy woman there, with hideous hair who smelt like she bathed in popcorn. &ldquo;Let me guess, couples package?&rdquo; the heavy woman sighed, as she raised her eyebrows.\n\n&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Norscout eagerly said. BFNA&rsquo;s eyes shot wide open, and he felt slightly faint. &ldquo;Norsco..!&rdquo; BFNA started and then stopped himself, completely overtaken by shock&mdash;realizing that Norscout hadn&rsquo;t released his arm grip still, it just felt so natural. \n\nThe popcorn smelling woman snorted and asked them for money, Norscout finally had to let go of BFNA to get his wallet. BFNA inched away slowly from Norscout, nerves overtaking him. &ldquo;Now have a merry Christmas&rdquo; the heavy lady sarcastically said before she shouted, &ldquo;NEXT!&rdquo;.\n\nNorscout looked at BFNA and waddled ever so slightly closer and closer, BFNA countered this advance though by moving away slightly more and more until they reached the popcorn and drinks section.\n\n&ldquo;I really should be paying for myself you know&hellip;&rdquo; BFNA suggested. &ldquo;Naw! I&rsquo;m out here treating you to a movie, &ldquo;Norscout smiled as his eyes flashed with joy, &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be the same if I didn&rsquo;t pay&rdquo;. BFNA staggered, his cheeks returning to a scarlet red color, &ldquo;Norscout&hellip;&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like two large popcorns and a few chocolate bars and two extra large drinks, because we&rsquo;re thirsty,&rdquo; Norscout commanded. A very busty demoness popped out from behind the corner, her anatomy showing off. Norscout didn&rsquo;t budge an inch, but BFNA stared in curiosity of this spectacle that stood before him. \n\nThe demoness then asked, &ldquo;What sort of drink were you looking for to quench&hellip; your&hellip; thirst?&rdquo; Norscout shrugged, &ldquo;Pepsi I guess?&rdquo; Norscout and the demoness then looked to BFNA, who&rsquo;s hand started shaking in fear. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say, what if he chose the wrong drink? What if Norscout was a really really big pepsi fan, and if he ordered Coke Norscout would hate him?! What if he said the wrong thing and embarrassed himself in front of the demoness.\n\n&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; BFNA exclaimed with conviction.\n\n&ldquo;Water?&rdquo; Norscout now raised an eyebrow and smirked, &ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re funny.&rdquo; Norscout then turned to the pop demoness and said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have the same as me.&rdquo; The demoness rolled her eyes, &ldquo;And what about the chocolates?&rdquo; \n\nNorscout looked to BFNA, and the demoness just blankly stared at Norscout with her eyes at half mast- realizing this would be yet another punny parody. BFNA was in perma-blush mode, he now had no cue to go off of to know what sort of chocolates to get as Norscout didn&rsquo;t reveal his preferences (ooh) earlier. What if Norscout was a Hershey&rsquo;s fan?! What if Norscout only liked white chocolate and hated darker chocolate?! There were too many possibilities, BFNA&rsquo;s mind was racing. What to do!? What do to?!!?! BFNA then burst aloud &ldquo;Kisses please!&rdquo;\n\nNorscout flinched and staggered a little, his eyes wide after hearing BFNA&rsquo;s request. The theatre demoness sighed, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have Hershey&rsquo;s kisses. Would you instead like&mdash;&ldquo;  Norscout interrupted, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d just like anything,&rdquo; a sinister smile crossing Norscout&rsquo;s face. \n\nThe demoness raised her eyebrows and then reached in for the most expensive chocolate bars they had, &ldquo;Upsale time,&rdquo; the demoness muttered as she threw 5 chocolate bars onto the shelf. Norscout took out his wallet again, BFNA then grabbed Norscout&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Let me pay for these!&rdquo; BFNA insisted. Norscout looked startled, yet again, and then agreed. BFNA then took out his wallet and paid for the chocolate. \n\n&ldquo;Thanks for your purchase,&rdquo; the chocolate demoness sneered. \n\nNorscout and BFNA then waddled to the theatre area.\n\n&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; came a nerdy male voice, &ldquo;you forgot your glasses!&rdquo; Completely forgetting that it was an IMAX theatre Norscout threw his hands into the air, &ldquo;Duh, I completely forgot.&rdquo; Norscout then grabbed two pairs of 3d glasses from the nerdy theatre guy. BFNA kept walking though, slowly, he wanted to keep some distance between him and the Nordic beast for now.\n\nWalking into the theatre, BFNA quickly rushed to one of the seats in the middle-ish section of the row, he thought he&rsquo;d be safe from any mischevious actions there. Norscout sighed with disappointment, &ldquo;The middle, really?&rdquo; BFNA then had a slightly weak smile, &ldquo;Yeah! I can see the screen better from here.&rdquo; Norscout shrugged as he squished the seat down with his mighty derriere, &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s true&rdquo;. \n\nPlacing the treats and drinks down, Norscout then fidgeted for a bit looking around his pockets. BFNA asked, &ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; Norscout busily replied, &ldquo;Sec.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; Norscout exclaimed, pulling out one of the pairs of glasses. BFNA pre-emptively said, &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; as he held out his hand expecting Norscout to drop them in his hand. Norscout let out a little laugh and then pulled the glasses away.\n\n&ldquo;We need to get these off you first,&rdquo; Norscout gleefully said as he had a childish smirk across his face. BFNA sat there paralyzed, &ldquo;M-my glasses&hellip;?&rdquo; Norscout then leaned in close to BFNA, BFNA could feel his breath at this close of a proximity. &ldquo;N-N-Norscout&hellip;!&rdquo; BFNA&rsquo;s heart beat fast in his chest, he felt his palms sweating. Norscout then placed one hand on each side of the glasses frames and then gently took them off BFNA&rsquo;s face, BFNA&rsquo;s eyes locked right onto Norscout. A dangerous concoction of fear, envy and tingling excitement in BFNA&rsquo;s chest. Norscout then plopped the glasses onto BFNA&rsquo;s face with slight aggression, catching his ear a bit.\n\n&ldquo;There we go!&rdquo; Norscout said as he turned to look in his pocket for his pair of 3d glasses. BFNA glared for a second, it slightly hurt, but then BFNA looked at his glasses the Norscout ever so gently placed onto the chocolate bar on the ground and felt really warm inside. \n\n&ldquo;Can you do that to me?&rdquo; BFNA overheard one girl speaking to her boyfriend behind them, &ldquo;that was like the cutest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen!&rdquo; The boyfriend then said, &ldquo;What?! No, put them on yourself!&rdquo; The girlfriend sighed, and BFNA sighed as well. \n\n&ldquo;The movie is about to start, you excited!?&rdquo; Norscout questioned BFNA. BFNA looked anxious, &ldquo;I- I guess so?&rdquo; &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Norscout said like an excited kid as he grabbed a fist full of popcorn and shoved it into his mouth. \n\n&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Norscout said, &ldquo;I have the perfect idea!&rdquo; Terror stricken, BFNA wondered, &ldquo;W-What?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a selfie for GD!&rdquo; Norscout said half-yelling. BFNA now blushed with embarrassment, &ldquo;Do you have to be so loud?!&rdquo; \n\nNorscout then whipped out his phone and then held BFNA close, &ldquo;Smile!&rdquo; BFNA tried to smile but he was paralyzed by fear. &ldquo;N-n&hellip; Norscout please&hellip;&rdquo; he feebly implored. \n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FyVGFe6W.jpg&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\n\n&quot;OH MY GOSH THAT IS SO CUTE&quot; squealed the girl behind them, &quot;Josh! We need to do that! Take out your phone!&quot;\n\nSomething was off to BFNA though, something was quite off but he couldn&rsquo;t quite put his finger on it. It then struck him like a bolt of thunder, he felt Norscout&rsquo;s warm thigh against his as they sat together in the theatre! BFNA quickly withdrew his leg, a small droplet of sweat dripping from the side of his forehead, his neck felt tight. Biting his lip and looking down BFNA was then jolted awake by the sounds of the actual movie he cared about beginning to play, but he knew that only one thing was on his mind right now.\n\n&lt;Starwars Spoilers / Must avoid / Pls no bannerino&gt;\n\nSometime later in the movie during a scene&hellip;.\nBFNA let out a cry of fear! Norscout looked to him and threw out his hand to hold BFNA&rsquo;sas if it were an instinctual reflex. BFNA was traumatized, one of his fave characters just got &lt;spoilers&gt; and it was just terrifying. As a tear ran down BFNA&rsquo;s face Norscout clenched BFNA&rsquo;s hand even tighter. Realizing what was going on, BFNA tore his hand away from Norscout and muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay&hellip;&rdquo; Norscout looked at him with concern but BFNA insisted, &ldquo;R-really&hellip; I am okay&rdquo;. BFNA blushed, unsure how exactly he should respond in this situation.\n\n&lt;Starwars Spoilers / Must avoid / Pls no bannerino&gt;\n\nThe movie ended, BFNA was plastered across his seat as if he was just destroyed by that ending- it was too much for his heart to handle. The climax and then the tremendous drop paled only to the undoubtable affections shown to him that he was denying. Norscout on the other hand was on the edge of his seat, popcorn strewn everywhere like the rubble left from a bronze5 team going against Faker. \n\n&ldquo;That was awesome!&rdquo; Norscout exclaimed excitedly, leaning over to look at the emotionally wounded BFNA, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s watch it again!&rdquo; BFNA struggled to move his eyes and look at Norscout, &ldquo;T-That ending thou&hellip;&rdquo;  &ldquo;It was AWESOME!&rdquo;\n\nSlowly inching his way up to his feet, some candy bar wrapper fell off of BFNA&rsquo;s lap and onto the ground, &ldquo;May I go home now?&rdquo; BFNA sighed. Norscout looked at him with eager eyes, &ldquo;No! We need to go out for some food, I&rsquo;m hungry!&rdquo; \n\nBlushing yet again, BFNA looked at Norscout in slight confusion&hellip; he wanted to go out for dinner with him too?! &ldquo;I-I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; BFNA started. Norscout then grabbed BFNA&rsquo;s glasses off of his face and put them in his pocket, putting BFNA&rsquo;s glasses back onto his face. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get going!&rdquo; Norscout said as he marched ahead. BFNA held his right forearm with his left hand for but a moment before following, what was this feeling he was feeling right now?\n\n&ldquo;Oh my like God they are like the cutest couple ever,&rdquo; the girlfriend sitting with her boyfriend in the back burst out squeezing. The boyfriend sighed, &ldquo;Really Rachel, really?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh my god YAAAAAS!&rdquo;\n\n&lt;Outside the theatre/ At the pizza place&gt;\n\nNorscout was beaming as they entered the pizza place, BFNA slugging on behind. &ldquo;Damn, it looks like there is a lineup,&rdquo; Norscout observed, &ldquo;I have an idea&hellip;. Let&rsquo;s take a selfie!&rdquo; BFNA groaned, &ldquo;You know I am not photogenic though right? I haven&rsquo;t seen a good picture of myse-&ldquo; Norscout ignored his complains and drew BFNA close to his torso as his phone was in his left hand and his right hand on BFNA&rsquo;s lower back. \n\nBFNA shifted awkwardly and glared at the camera as the picture was taken. \n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2F87d2o8T.jpg&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\n\nNorscout looked at the picture briefly, &ldquo;No! Come on BFNA, you&rsquo;ve got to actually smile!&rdquo; Looking deeply into BFNA&rsquo;s eyes, he asked, &ldquo;Smile for me, would you?&rdquo;  BFNA shivered a bit out of nervousness and nodded, he was going to try and pull off a heartwarming smile for him. \n\nNorscout got close to BFNA but only this time his hand went a little lower than last time&hellip; BFNA noticed and got nervous, but he didn&rsquo;t necessarily feel wrong about it! Norscout&rsquo;s hand placement was just right- comfortable even to him. Letting out as much of a smile as he could muster, BFNA held his position. A few seconds went by, Norscout let out a little laugh. &ldquo;Are you going to take the picture yet? BFNA questioned, slightly concerned. &ldquo;I already took it, I just wanted to see how long you&rsquo;d hold that pose,&rdquo; Norscout replied.\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FKVq3S3T.jpg&amp;key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&amp;width=425\n\nBFNA withdrew from Norscout&rsquo;s grasp, slightly annoyed, &ldquo;I think we can get a table already&rdquo;. Nodding, the duo hed off to get a table. \n\nBefore them stood a teenaged girl with atrocious pink hair, &ldquo;Oh em like gee!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed, &ldquo;So like would you like, um, a like couples package?!&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; BFNA said by reflex. Norscout looked at him with saddened eyes, his smile was lessened he seemed a little let down. &ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; Norscout said, &ldquo;just a table for two.&rdquo; BFNA immediately realized this mistake, he realized he just made a big mistake, &ldquo;N-Norsc&hellip;.&rdquo; He stopped himself before he could say the words.\n\nNorscout walked to the booth seat against a window with BFNA, looking out onto the dreary dark street lit up by only a few lights here and there. Picking up the menu, BFNA perused through it to see what he&rsquo;d order. Should he order a salad and be boring? Should he order the Hawaiian pizza? Vegetarian (eugh)? But Norscout just sat there, menu in front of himself looking outside the window. \n\nA waitress came by, &ldquo;Have you decided what you&rsquo;d like to order?&rdquo;. BFNA then said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a small vegetarian pizza&rdquo;. Norscout said quite plainly, &ldquo;A stuffed crust extra large meat lovers pizza&rdquo;. BFNA&rsquo;s mouth dropped open, it was the polar opposite of what he ordered! The waitress smiled and she put her hand on Norscout&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;Big eater, huh?!&rdquo;\n\nNorscout smirked, &ldquo;Yeah I am,&rdquo; Norscout then spread his legs out and lay back, &ldquo;Happens when you&rsquo;re a big guy like me&rdquo;. The waitress then giggled\n\nScowling, BFNA felt something deep inside of himself&mdash;jealousy! This waitress touching Norscout made him feel absolutely green with envy. Bursting out, BFNA announced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to change my order to an extra large Hawian with extra meat!&rdquo; Norscout then looked at him, shocked, BFNA could eat that much?! \n\nThe waitress took her hand off Norscout&rsquo;s shoulder and confirmed, &ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll have those pizzas up and ready for you both soon.&rdquo; She then left to the back of the resturaunt. \n\nNorscout eyed BFNA, &ldquo;You never told me you could eat that much?&rdquo; Playing up a shtick, BFNA shrugged and said, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m a big guy too.&rdquo; Norscout laughed a little, &ldquo;Yeah you are.&rdquo; BFNA then explored a little, &ldquo;So what about that movie was it that made you so excited about it?&rdquo; \n\n&lt;SPOILERS/ Time duration&gt;\n\nNorscout nodded as he grabbed another slice of BFNA&rsquo;s pizza, &ldquo;I agree I didn&rsquo;t want to see &lt;Spoilers&gt; either&rdquo;. Before Norscout was a polished remnants of his extra large pizza, as he now took to attacking BFNA&rsquo;s vulnerable pizza. \n\nShrugging slightly, BFNA then expanded, &ldquo;I thought that the one scene where &lt;spoilers&gt; died&hellip; my fave character&hellip; I wanted to say thank you for&hellip;&rdquo; Norscout looked up, BFNA stopped talking, a smile then inched across Norscout&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no problem- I wanted to do that.&rdquo; Like the Titanic hitting an iceberg, BFNA&rsquo;s heart stopped and was sinking, he WANTED to!? \n\n&ldquo;I- I&hellip; I&hellip;&rdquo; BFNA trailed off for a few moments.\n\nLeaning forward, closing the gap between himself and BFNA, Norscout had an idea in mind now. &ldquo;What do you say we order a dessert and we head to my place?&rdquo; Norscout suggested, smirking. BFNA&rsquo;s entire face turned red, the Norse beast was asking HIM out to&hellip; his place?! &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; BFNA immediately cried aloud. Norscout then leaned back and let out a sigh of frustration. Taking note, BFNA quickly stepped on his own insecurities, &ldquo;I mean I want to go I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; Norscout groaned, &ldquo;You come over with me to my place and we enjoy some terrible tasting dessert while watching horrible Christmas TV shows.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Terrible Christmas shows&hellip;?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Netflix and dessert,&rdquo; Norscout said, half bursting into laughter.\n\nBFNA let out a slight smile and a little giggle, &ldquo;and dessert?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;My own design,&rdquo; Norscout said proudly.\n\nBFNA then stood up, securing his anxiously shaking hand against his leg, &ldquo;Fine. I will go over!&rdquo; Norscout burst to his feet and laughed, &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s do it! My place is pretty close to here!&rdquo; Staggering a little, BFNA was slightly in disbelief, was this really happening? He looked into Norscout&rsquo;s big shimmering eyes and he realized that he felt safe. Norscout was like Braum, a big protective guy who would keep him safe. \n\nWhile walking out, after paying the bill, BFNA had been trailing directly behind Norscout. Once they stepped outside of the pizza place BFNA rushed forward closer to Norscout and then outstretched his hand to grab Norscout&rsquo;s. Norscout grabbed his hand back and smiled without saying a word. \n\n&lt;WHAT IS TO COME IN PART 2 AND ONWARDS:\nBFNA and Norscout cuddles. &gt;\n\n\nFAN ART :DDDDDD\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Besteau,realm=NA,application-id=mNBeEEkI,discussion-id=PpqTedEW,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2015-12-22T21:42:42.902+0000)\n>\n> Anon Delivers.\n> \n> http://i.imgur.com/vOp89aO.png\n\n","replies":[]}
