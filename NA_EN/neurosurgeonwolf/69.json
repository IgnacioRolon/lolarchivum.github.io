Karthus does the aoe damage without needing to play some mindless pinball game. Also karthus does more damage outright because he can spam Q skittles mindlessly as well.\n\nAurelion sols stars only hit for 70+30% ap damage. If you manage to hit them. Good luck with that. Whereas Kart us is a nonstop bombardment of damage that isn't even 1/10th as hard to land.\n\n\nOh also Karthus field keeps going long after he is dead too.\n\nRemind me for what reason we care about this champion? The fact he can fly over terrain? Big whoop. Useless in a team fight and Karthus just presses R to roam.","replies":[]}
