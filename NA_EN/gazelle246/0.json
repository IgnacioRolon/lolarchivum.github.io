The following games represent only a tiny fraction of all of my games and these are therefore considered my most ever 'toxic' games.\n\nI understand that some of what I said without &#039;context&#039; may be considered toxic by the majority of players, but when your team is feeding/flaming you when you are the only one playing well or just damn right being toxic to yourself, I do not understand why I have been chat restricted for what was said below? Especially game 2, in which I was playing bad myself - what did I even say that led to a chat restriction...?\n\nSee below the following dialogue in which led to my chat restriction;\n\nFor game 1 I was playing Jungle, and Games 2 and 3 I was playing support. Also please note some of what I said was clearly sarcastic. Ty.\n\nPlease give me advice on how to prevent myself from getting chat restricted in the future, perhaps just not even responding to blatant trolls and feeders may be the best solution?\n\nGame 1\nGazelle246: cant solo\nGazelle246: ididnt thin khe would dive you\nGazelle246: no\nGazelle246: i didnt thin he would dive you\nGazelle246: likke i said\nGazelle246: ...\nGazelle246: stfu\nGazelle246: %%%%\nGazelle246: thx ahri\nGazelle246: &lt;3\nGazelle246: i dont help toxic individuals\nGazelle246: you dont help\nGazelle246: me\nGazelle246: i dont help you\nGazelle246: no\nGazelle246: cant kill you if they not there\nGazelle246: waste of time\nGazelle246: farming jungle\nGazelle246: while ipush mid\nGazelle246: wp\nGazelle246: i go farm\nGazelle246: gl\nGazelle246: ah ok\nGazelle246: i farm more\nGazelle246: yeah coz u suck\nGazelle246: ur mum is bad at escaping\nGazelle246: stfu ;2p\nGazelle246: l2p\nGazelle246: if you were that good\nGazelle246: how are u gold\nGazelle246: clearly ua re not very good\nGazelle246: so\nGazelle246: stfu\nGazelle246: i only take advice from diamond +\nGazelle246: not from noobs\nGazelle246: good job team\nGazelle246: very good\nGazelle246: 4/9/0 ahri\nGazelle246: giving advice\nGazelle246: report jgl no ganks\nGame 2\nGazelle246: hey c:\nGazelle246: ^_^\nGazelle246: gl hf :)\nGazelle246: sorry i idnt mean to take it\nGazelle246: sorry i was typing...\nGazelle246: aorry\nGazelle246: sorry\nGazelle246: guys\nGazelle246: im sorry\nGazelle246: i play bad this game\nGazelle246: please\nGazelle246: dont flam me\nGazelle246: im sorry\nGazelle246: :(\nGazelle246: you want me to go afk?\nGazelle246: ok\nGazelle246: ok\nGazelle246: ok\nGazelle246: ok\nGazelle246: :/\nGazelle246: sorry\nGazelle246: can you stop flaming me?\nGazelle246: its really making me play so bad\nGazelle246: your flame is making me play so bad\nGazelle246: so please\nGazelle246: stop\nGazelle246: gg\nGazelle246: nice\nGazelle246: :)\nGazelle246: my fault we lost\nGazelle246: report me for making myt team lose :)(\nGazelle246: gg\nGame 3\nGazelle246: ok??\nGazelle246: no blue for mid?\nGazelle246: lmao toxic\nGazelle246: you bonobos\nGazelle246: ez\nGazelle246: so close to gettting hooked :D\nGazelle246: lol??? i need my wins somehow\nGazelle246: okey\nGazelle246: mastery lvl 5 boys\nGazelle246: u block me :D\nGazelle246: yh i cudnt move\nGazelle246: lmao\nGazelle246: ;/\nGazelle246: needed a few secs\nGazelle246: 0 cs im bad :(\nGazelle246: :/\nGazelle246: what is this feeding\nGazelle246: 2.7\nGazelle246: 1,5\nGazelle246: yes\nGazelle246: nunu i dont think u shud b playing anymore lets just leave it at that\nGazelle246: i feel bad for the other people who get mm with you\nGazelle246: same for tahm kench\nGazelle246: rude\nGazelle246: tahm is worse than you tbh\nGazelle246: no\nGazelle246: im good every game\nGazelle246: just got noob team\nGazelle246: yeah noob team\nGazelle246: yup\nGazelle246: i honor u lucian\nGazelle246: only good player","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2018-05-05T19:27:02.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't have anything positive to say, then don't say anything. \n\nSaying things like \"how are you gold\"  \"clearly you are not very good\" and threatening to afk are toxic and don't help you or your team out and are reportable.\n\nYou clearly don't have a winning attitude here and are spending more time typing than worrying about the game and it seems like you are doing some griefing too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-05T19:44:02.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You spent all game flaming and arguing, seems like a pretty legit CR.\n\nIn case you are unaware, intentionally flaming people to make them play badly is not tolerated.
