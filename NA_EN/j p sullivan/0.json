I won my first game, and qualified for my promos. I was given the free win since I've already been at this promo. I lost my next game, and then won my final one. I noticed in my final one that I gained LP, and that I am on 99... What happened to my promo?","replies":[{"poster":"J P Sullivan","date":"2016-09-14T20:57:36.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remembered, my game crashed during a draft...

Crashes in champ select are often caused by an unstable connection to the matchmaking servers, so this is likely a result of network settings that cause problems with League.
