I'm using a brand-new Alienware Intel (R) Core (TM) i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20 GHz, 8 GB Ram (64 bit). When I start the game, I hear weird sound shattering, game doesn't lag or anything it runs smoothly, but when there's a reason for the FPS to drop down (Like opening shop, fighting minions, fighting champions) the game entirely freezes with nothing to do other than force shut down. I've read many threads related to my problem but nothing matched mine. However, I've tried running other high-quality games, even higher qualities than league of legends and much bigger games, they all worked perfectly fine without having a single problem, not even a lag issue, is this normal ?\r\n\r\nThings I've tried:\r\n\r\nUninstalling all the updates \r\nResetting my whole laptop\r\nUninstalled the game and downloaded it again for like 3 times","replies":[{"poster":"General Asthar","date":"2016-08-18T07:49:46.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the exact same problem and I'm also curious as to how this can be fixed.
