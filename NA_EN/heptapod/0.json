She has much, MUCH less. The pink wards were never really a problem to people who knew to play her because nobody who knew her would heavily rely on the invisibility to survive in the first place. The shimmer effect makes her now MORE vulnerable if anything, because back then people would have to spend 75G (which is big early on) and an inventory slot (which is big later on) to counter her shroud. Now all they need is a AoE ability which is free and usually readily available.  The fixed shroud prevents her from doing camp hopping, and the new dash is not long enough to cross 90% of the walls in the game so it doesn't compensate. Her sustain passive is less reliable and the sustain she gets from gunblade is been cut by 80% with the nerfs to her ult. The cooldown on her ults makes it harder for her to use it to retreat and reposition. Lastly, the new passive works on 8-4 seconds windows which forces her to use her shroud to wait for her cooldowns (which were also increased) meaning that she has to waste her escape tool to fight. And also 40% of her energy bar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2016-11-11T02:41:44.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kyuubii,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oYoKrR47,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-11T02:31:33.412+0000)\n>\n> Yeah she has slightly less burst but more survivability.

I'm glad it takes more skill to play Akali and it definetly feels like there's counter play now. Kind of annoying playing against someone who can do 1.2k damage in 2 seconds at lvl 10 :/","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-11T07:24:39.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It already took skill to play her, which is why she was consistently below average on winrate.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
