Because I'm used to it and I've always been good playing like that. However, now for some reason there's been this constant unusual lag that goes to like 370~400 for some reason. So my friends helped me out and found out that now my isp is bouncing to Japan first then goes to the Official NA server which is why I'm lagging. Is there anyway to fix this in any sort of ways?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-26T23:04:19.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whelp that ISP route is definitely not optimal that's for sure. {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} \n\nIf you already ran a trace route using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) or similar program to see where your ISP is sending your connection, then go ahead and send that to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
