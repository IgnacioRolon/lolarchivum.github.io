They are overall more interesting, with more defined gameplay fantaisies, and what they seem to have lost in AP ratios, they were made up for in other places.\nMalzahar's AP ratios for exemple were lowered across the board, because Voidlings reliably deal metric tons of damage now.\nBrand's AP ratios were reduced because his passive has been made that much stronger.\nZyra's Q  and plant damage AP ratio has been nerfed because you're now pretty much guaranteed to have much more plants fighting by your side ( although I feel like giving back some plant power could still be a good thing ).\nAnnie's Summon Tibbers damage went down because Tibbers himself is now 500% more deadly.\n\nWhat makes me kinda salty about the MYMU though is that there's nothing really interesting about the new AP itemisation.\n\nMarksmen were both given tools to patch up their weaknesses and to exacerbate their strengths.\nThey've got to have different iterations of basically the same item with different passives to enhance different playstyles ( Hurricane / Phantom Dancer / Shiv / Firecannon anyone ? ) when mages are left with itemization that yes, exacerbates their strengths, but also exacerbates their weakness rather than blurring it.\nMage buildpath is going to be made more stale than ever. Every single mana-hungry mage is going to absolutely NEED tear. Morellomonicon is now the only decent AP+Cdr Item and is now gonna be core on every single mage but a few outliers ( and really, I think 6.9 was THE BEST opportunity we had to introduce \"different types of Morellomonicon\" for when grevious wounds isn't needed like what they did in Black Market Brawlers. I seriously think that having the option to chosse between a Morello with Pox Arcana's active for mana regen / Netherstride's passive for kiting / Grevious Wounds to counter sustain would be a fantastic idea ).\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the Hextech items because, the \"hextech 900\" thing is only gonna be used as a deathfire grasp wannabe for increased burst because the slow is so bad, and protobelt isn't gonna be that useful for most \"true mages\" yet risks being hella obnoxious on Leblanc, Ekko, Ahri and the likes, who'll be able to abuse both the reposition tool and the rather good damage on the active while being able to do with a lower AP item.\nMind you, If there's one thing we Mage Mains never asked for was mobility. Part of the mage fantasy is being a slow moving glass cannon, bringing fear to whoever enters our zone of influence.\n\nWe wanted seekers to be as effective against AD midlaners than hexdrinker is against AP, but I guess that'll never be the case.\n\nWe wanted to be able to build armor + AP without resorting to the obligatory Zonhyas whose active isn't always useful ( adcs don't care 'bout your Zonhya, really, they'll have an aa ready for you after your stasis anyway ), and now that the AP has been lowered on the item and the active CD increased, that holds even more true.\n\nSome of us wanted to have option for health sustain so we do not have to back late game and leave our team vulnerable when adcs can just clear a jungle camp and be full and tanks can just wait for a minut or two for health regen to bring them back to full, but I guess now we're gonna have to back for both health and mana.\n\nWe wanted diversity and cool impactful passives, yet we only got stale damage actives and a way to get a hundred mana back in exchange for our live.\n\nLike really ? I've come to accept that Riot wants mana regen gutted, but really, at least they could make it more fun while it lasts !\n\nAs of now, if we want to have it all, we can just go and play Mr Unfun Graves and have more waveclear, more burst, more dps, more mobility, more sustain, be tankier and possibly infinite mana while still having some kind of utility ( freakin smoke ).

If they buy protobelt, they will lack the burst to kill you. They probably won't be able to match your waveclear. On a multiple dash champ like Ahri, there's 0 point to it 1v1.

What's worse they can't get TP or Ghost because they'd lose lane. A semi defensive item like Protobelt could be just the thing they need.

That's the reason why a lot of mage mains feel cheated. Why would anybody chose something when they could have that same something with some other things on top of it ? Yes it'll take 4.5-5k gold for the ADC to reach that 30% cdr, but in order to achieve that same 30% Cdr, so do I, and I'll have so sacrifice Mpen to get that Cdr from lucidities while Adcs get it from items that they were gonna build anyway.\nAnd moreover, please, do not factor in cdr from runes, because I'd very much like to have 10% more cdr on Morello so I can use Mana regen per level or Magic resist glyphs. if I need to make choices in my rune page , why whouldn't them ? \n\nTL;DR : Having the Adcs chose between a more caster or auto attack heavy build was IMO a good thing. Having acces to both without meaningful sacrifice is hella dumb.\n\n> What's one more dash gonna do? \n\n150 (+0.35 AP) to 300 (+0.7 AP ) bonus damage to their spell rotation. Damage that they can afford to use because they can then reposition to safety. One more dash in their heavy-mobility kit, especially such a short one, may not seem like that much, but the problem is that they have the option to utilize both the dash and damage, while most \"true\" mages are gonna be stuck with a dash that won't help them that much.

Maw and Steraks at least allows you to fight back. Plus there's so much of Zonhya's value that's dumped into the active it's infuriating. I want a good item that's not so sent back by it's own active, that's all there is to it.\n\n> Which is arbitrary because all spells are either passives, skill shots or targeted.\n\nMe finding something stale is always gonna be a matter of opinion, but your not gonna argue that some pure damage skillshot lacks in flavor compared to things like \"you do more damage the more health the ennemy has above you\" or \"your next auto has bonus range\" or \"you reduce the damage the last target you hit deals to you by 10%\" or \"A third of the damage you take is delayed over 3 seconds\"\n\n\n> I mean 2-3 OP picks ruining everyone's day.\n\nIsn't it already the case among Ad's ?\n\n>If that's the case, why do pros run scaling HP runes? If that's the case, why was a Yi with Devourer, Rageblade and one HP item called \"tank Yi\"? I'd appreciate it if you didn't just stand there when an AD champ AAs you,\n\nScaling hp runes are better than flat HP by level 6, which is most likely to be the moment an assassin or mage has the power to burst you down. It's about early game, not late. And \"Tank Yi\" is overbearing because he often builds Devourer+Rageblade + all tank/juggernaut items as opposed to only one. And even when he only has one tank item, more often than not it's DMP, which is 500 health + 50 armor, not just 300 health\n\n> If you didn't need more, then you never got Distortion boots either...\n\nDistortion boots is more about using what we've already got more often rather than having something to double on it. I mean, with distortion you get to flash more often. With protobelt you get to flash + protobelt one after the other. Not the same thing.\n\n> Who but Ryze buys tear roa on a regular basis? If you're mana hungry enough to buy Athene's, then Tear is now your new friend (so what?).\n\nAnivia does, Cassiopeia does, Swain does, some Orianna do, some Syndra aswell. Although not common, it remains as a viable option. Post 6.9, tear is at risk of becoming the only single possible path.\n\n> I also think you're sorely underestimating just what mages are capable of. \n\nI do not, and that's one of the first thing I stated. Their kits are interesting, and for most of them even really strong. But I really feel like the mage itemization is bad to a point where you need them to have borderline toxic kits to succeed. And it makes it so they feel grossly overpowered until  hexdrinkers / Mercurials / Steraks / health sustain items are built everywhere, at which point they feel kinda worthless unless having shitloads of utility.\n\n> Just like you don't choose between Morello's and Athene's, you pick whichever is currently better.\n\nI do choose, depending on how spammy do I feel like I'm gonna play ; do I value poke over burst ; do I feel like I need grevious wounds or the tiny bit of added Mr ? Just like Cait will ask herself if she wants the hurricane steady AoE damage ,Shiv's burst or RFC's added poke potential.\n\n> And partly because, well, what else could they have offered you?\n\n100 AP + 20 CDR + mana items that are not Morello ( though I don't want the 20% cdr from them to stack ). \nBetter laning phase options against Ad's\nA late game option for decent health sustain\nNo RoA gutting *sadface*\n\nI basically want black market brawlers without the brawlers.\n\n\nPS : I know I get kinda salty at times, but I very much enjoy this discussion.

If anything I am undervaluing the damage on mages. Here is the thing about why damage on mages is so significant.\n\nSince the damage from AP mages comes almost entirely off of spells, it makes the damage far less consistent than AD. This means that each spell is far more important when it comes to DPS. So if you miss a spell, your DPS can suffer by an extraordinary amount. Why do you think you can get much higher levels of AP than AD?\n\nTo say that their damage is only half their strength at best is pure ignorance and only something I would expect a complete novice to say. Not every mage has large levels of utility and to think they do shows complete inexperience.\n\nFiddle can fear 1 person and the silence multiple people IF the crow bounces properly. However that in no way disables a team for a short period of time. Fiddle's ult on the other hand forces the enemy team to deal with the threat or run away. The damage on his ult alone is far more impactful than his fear or silence in a teamfight.\n\nMages can't burst down bruisers or tanks... Were you not playing when Maw and Ster passives stacked? I didn't realize that ALL MAGES could keep people from moving for significant periods of time. Also very few mages have reliable forms of CC, a good number of that CC you are talking about is skill shot reliant.\n\nSOME mages kill carries, some mages control an area, some mages act as initiators, others push, and a few act in a more supportive role. To say that mages only kill carries shows a complete lack of understanding of the complexity of this game. Also, with RoA and Zhonyas receiving MASSIVE nerfs, they have even LESS options against assassins in lane.\n\nYou need to actually play with the items and take more time to analyze the changes before you make such naïve claims.","replies":[{"poster":"WacingTheFind","date":"2016-05-02T19:40:56.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=M0b1us,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pAWdZ6YE,comment-id=001600010000,timestamp=2016-05-02T19:02:19.170+0000)\n>\n> Why do you think you can get much higher levels of AP than AD?\n> \n> \n\n{{champion:202}}  wants to have a word with you about that one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MissMikasa","date":"2016-05-02T16:57:00.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=M0b1us,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pAWdZ6YE,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2016-05-02T16:44:10.388+0000)\n>\n> \n> My advice, start getting good with an AD mid.

The new Hextech items are even somewhat viable for many AD champions to use, especially Protobelt. What AD items were made semi-viable for mages to use? Case in point.\n\nThe majority of mages/AP champions only inflict damage via spells. Sounds reasonable, until you realize **every** AD champion inflicts damage via right-clicking **and** spells, and many AD champions have powerful spells often on par with mages. \n\nWhat purpose do mages have, again? \n\nOh, right, gotta mix up those damage types... \n\n{{champion:96}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:110}} \n\nNever mind.\n\nHere's another point: how is it fair that mages are restricted with cooldowns and mana especially in the early game, while AD champions have no restrictions whatsoever?\nMages **must** purchase items to bypass their glaring weaknesses before actually strengthening themselves and becoming effective, while AD champions are able to begin amplifying their strengths from the start due to lacking real weaknesses to cover. Even if you were to argue they did have any real weakness at all, they have a plethora of items to remedy it, including multiple means of sustain.\n\nYes, that lovely sustain that keeps AD champions on the field longer. Right-click or use spells, Riot has you covered.\n\nWhat about mages? Nope, spell vamp is \"unhealthy\" for the game.\n\n{{item:3812}} {{item:3146}} \n\nVery unhealthy for the game...\n\nNo seriously, what the heck is with this? Why do AD champions still get spell vamp while AP champions don't? Why is it acceptable and \"healthy\" for them to have it? Not only that, but the sustain applies to their spells as well as basic attacks. At least for AP champions, the sustain from {{item:3152}}  only applied to spells.\n\n{massive facepalm}\n\nWell anyway, all that matters anymore to Riot is the precious LCS. To make the LCS fun to watch, they value showcasing the consistent action AD champions bring with their combination of spells and right-clicking much more than the cooldown-based gameplay of mages. That's the simple, sad truth. \nThe only AP champions who are allowed to be picked in the LCS without being beaten by the nerf bat after are the hyper-mobile assassins, {{champion:103}}  for the sex appeal to draw in the hormonal boys, {{champion:1}}  because fire effects and giant teddy bear to wow the audience, and {{champion:61}} for some reason.\nWait... Orianna's passive... {gasp} should've realized her right-click power would continue receiving Riot's respect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-05-02T13:57:13.378+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah the items look awful and the mage reworks are gonna have to be Hella busted to be relevant.
