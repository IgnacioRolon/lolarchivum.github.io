Her tone of voice is always slightly giddy and she never sounds too serious.\n\nElementalist Lux is a great skin, don't get me wrong. Riot did an absolutely superb job working on it and it's definitely the best skin to come out yet. However, nothing about the skin screams \"Lux\" to me. She looks like a different character entirely, especially her face in the character icons which when compared with her original splash look like someone else entirely. It's actually somewhat difficult to identify her as Lux at first glance. I know ultimate skins are supposed to be a total overhaul of the character, but you can look at all the other ultimate skins and immediately tell what character they're for; the same can't necessarily be said about Lux. The only obvious clue that it's supposed to be Lux is the staff, an item that several other characters also have and isn't necessarily unique to Lux.\n\nMy biggest problem though is that her voice lines just don't really sound like Lux to me. She went from being upbeat, positive and carefree to being some edgy punmaster who's always biting at the bit to crack her next joke. Even though it's the same voice actor, that spirit from the original just isn't there.\n\nBasically, I think Elementalist Lux is a fantastic skin; just not a good LUX skin. I know most people probably disagree with me, but I'm still probably going to end up swapping between this and my other Lux skins I already have, because her original persona is a big part of what draws me to her as a character, and it's something that's sadly missing from her new skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-11T20:16:45.320+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"The goal here wasn't to give her base Lux's persona - with an ultimate skin, we're looking to change the alternate fantasy more so than we already do on all of our other skins; it's meant to be an experience. To your point of looking different, that's intended, she's meant to be older in this skin than she normally would be. Her goals aren't the same as base Lux.

He meant to say transform animation would look cooler on Xerath because his model has more effects and textures than Lux's. Elementalist Lux is by far the best ultimate skin ever for now, no doubt. But as Stars Shaper said, I think transformations would look cooler if It was Xerath.\n\nEven though I think transformations would look better on Xerath, I don't think this skin theme fits to Xerath very well, since his the most generic skill, Q, has no travel time, which makes it pretty unlikely to use elements like Earth and Water. Even without it, skin themes like Dark Star and Cosmic Reaver are cooler and easier to make.\n\n_Daily Reminding_\n\nI'm always open to a 1820 RP Cosmic Reaver Xerath skin. <3\n\nPlus 1350 RP Dark Star Xerath pls thx.\n\nWhite/Cosmic Blue and Dark Purple, colors that you guys never used for Xerath!\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-11-16T17:58:11.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well my was an extreme semplification and it wasn't ment to underhestimate the work behind the skin, I find her extremely fascinating.

You guys were a BIT lazy when you came up with stuff like Dark coming from opposing forces (technically darkness is the absence of light, but wouldn't Lux having two opposing forces just cancel her out back into Light form?) and Mystic not even being a proper \"element\" by any definition. \n\n>with some processing on some of the forms, custom VO interactions, new animations, \n\nBut the thing is, compare how different Elementalist Lux is against Spirit Guard Udyr or DJ Sona. Udyr's ultimate is a borderline visual rework, and Sona's completely changes her feel and her behavior. Elementalist Lux looks more like a lot of 1350 skins put onto the same character with a vocal rework slapped onto them.\n\n>new particles, \n\nWeren't some people pointing out that some particles are identical?\n\n>new SFX\n\nArcade Ahri has entirely new SFX and that's a 1350 skin. That's not THAT big a deal.\n\n>but she has entirely new VO for each form... custom item shop VO...\n\nThose are just vocals. And honestly I was a bit underwhelmed with what you ended up going for with what you had the potential to do, it's just the now-standard \"champ buys any item\" lines (not even specific ones! I'd have loved to see stuff like Fire/Magma Lux getting excited at buying an offensive item item and Water/Nature Lux wanting more utility items), \"champ kills enemy champ\" lines, \"champ kills class of champ\" lines, \"champ trashes tower\" lines, \"champ drops a ward\" lines, where's some of the potential neat stuff like Lux's nature forms going into the jungle, fire/magma Lux applying a burn effect to enemies, water or ice Lux entering the river, any Lux managing to snipe an objective or champion, or just champion-specific taunts? It's not helped by the fact that a lot of Lux's lines are incredibly cringy puns. \n\nVocals and sounds don't make a good skin, it's the things you do with them that does. Udyr was unique for his time in that his vocals reacted to clearing camps and built on each other depending on his form. DJ Sona doesn't even HAVE proper vocals but she changes the bgm for the match. Elementalist Lux's vocals are, honestly, a bit underwhelming and bring nothing new or exciting to the table. They're just advancements of things we already have.\n\nAnd Mystic Lux is almost literally just Lulu in Lux's body. That was especially disappointing for me.\n\nI haven't mentioned Pulsefire Ezreal at all because that's basically a Legendary Skin these days and nobody's denying it XD","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2016-11-14T22:24:32.963+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shes the one with the ability to copy any type of magic just by seeing it so it kinda makes sense shes can do this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"takeZOOOOOO","date":"2016-11-16T17:30:55.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">can veer away from the champion's base lore\n\nIoania yasuo skin with crest thingy on his back like Irelia and karma then? :O","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-11-09T20:50:01.475+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well there's an old lore tidbit that Lux's upbeat and positive attitude is actually a mask to hide a crushingly empty shell of a person who has lost almost every chance to be someone other than the first daughter of the Crownguards. \n\nSo I actually think it makes sense for her persona to switch so much with each element because of the influence the elements have over her own lack of identity.

I didn't think of that. I thought of her as ULTIMATE LUX but now reading this it is beyond that.
