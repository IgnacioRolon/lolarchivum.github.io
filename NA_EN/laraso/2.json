She's fun and simple and if I don't feel like stressing a ton I can rely on her to roll early game and do some rather nice mixed damage.\n\nIf you're looking for things to hand her in the short run before you finish whatever you're doing with her, you could hand her Q some bonus damage on a chance to crit - it's already kind of like a bonus shot, but past laning phase you're usually not going to find a good time to capitalize on the bonus damage from killing a unit, so I've found it feeling a little bit underwhelming once you've run out of minions to bounce it out of.  This would make it more noticeable later in the game.\n\nOther than that, her Make It Rain is pretty reliable as a zone-controller and a catching device, her R is good for wave clearing for tower protection and for applying some nice BC stacks, and the strut reactivation on her W has made splitpushing feel better since even if you've taken some stray damage, you can back off and speed yourself back up rather than feeling vulnerable.

Mostly, she probably needs her ult to be a lot cooler, or just a few more high moments/optimizations generally.\n\nThe largest issue with Miss Fortune right now is that it takes far too long for her damage to ramp up. Her W increases the magic damage it deals every hit, up to somewhere like 8 times at level 16. THEN her ult does extra damage per wave, per stack. Is it cool? Sure it is, will she ever get to use it's maximum potential? most likely not. \n\nMost marksmen have their powered loaded up front, or in one single strike. Jinx gets a damage bonus immediately when she switches to rockets. Lucian gets a bolt of light that does quite a bit. A good comparison of power to Miss Fortune is likely Varus. His W does X magic damge on hit. It scales with AP (for some dumb reason), can detonate for percent max health magic damage  (which is strictly a worse off Vayne W, which is always active, and does true damage instead) . Miss Fortune is squishy, for her to get off 8 auto attacks in a fight is very hard, and only then does her damage start to become good. \n\nYou have her ult do physical damage, that scales with AP, her W does magic damage, that scales with AD.
