I completely understand you disliking his dashing mechanic, however, you're exaggerating quite a bit when you imply that it's impossible to lane against a fed Yasuo. If by \"fed\" you mean that he has a completed item over you such as a statikk shiv over a needlessly large rod, then it's a bit more understandable as statikk shiv is a huge power spike for Yasuo, but even then, it's not as bad as you claim.","replies":[{"poster":"Laraso","date":"2015-08-24T16:46:27.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, I understand completely that Dyrus didn't take any damage.
