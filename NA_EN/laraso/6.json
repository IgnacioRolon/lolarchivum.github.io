He can clear waves extremely fast with his E + Q for no cost (resourceless), but can freeze just as easily. He can get to almost any location in the lane nearly instantly because of his dash that has basically no cooldown, if you&#039;re not under your tower or in the side bush then regardless of where you are you&#039;re basically in melee range as far as Yasuo is concerned. He automatically wins short trades with his passive shield + windwall, and wins long trades with his short cooldowns and sustained damage. It&#039;s extremely hard to poke him since he&#039;s zooming around left and right constantly, and even if you do manage to hit him his passive shield will negate all the damage, and it recharges very quickly. Once he gets his ult you can&#039;t be aggressive in lane, you have to sit like a little bitch under your tower because if you get anywhere near your minions then he&#039;s just going to dash up into your face, ult you, and then crit you a few hundred thousand times. His abilities have extremely short cooldowns, so he can spam all of his abilities as much as he wants and you can&#039;t exploit that because he&#039;s resourceless and his abilities are always up.\r\n\r\nThe part that bothers me most is that for the overwhelming majority of matchups, if you ever kill Yasuo in lane, it&#039;s because he fucked up, not because you outplayed him.","replies":[{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2015-11-22T05:46:35.883+0000","up_votes":82,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:90}} \n(definition of fuck you yasuo)","replies":[{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-11-22T05:56:03.060+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've heard of that, but may I ask how that is the case?

I could see hitting him with Q would suck, but I would just rush QSS, invalidating his ult\n\nOk, let me explain.\nThere area few reasons why malz is considered a hard-counter.\nOne is because yasuo is always risking getting aids from malz's E because he is melee. And because a W just randomly spreaded out will ruin his shield. And to top it all, windwall is nothing to malz.But nothing is more harsh than the reality of the problem of buying QSS.Yasuo is a hypercarry which relies on nothing more than raw cash. If he doesnt build items he is non-existant.He needs his shiv powerspike as soon as possible or he is potentially weaker than any midlaner in mid-game.\nSo...well you are risking a few things here if youre going to rush qss on yasuo against malz.\n\n1. QSS doesnt negate his ult \"completely\". Even if you press it, a 1.2 ap ratio nuke that deals more than a annie ult is being channeled on your head. You will die. Horribly\n\n2. Your powerspike is so delayed. You just \"prevented\" malz from surpressing you. He deals more damage than you now. You are now a \"hyper carry\" without attack-stats, you are now at last desperate to build a shiv. You might not even have damn boots.\nAre you now even worth ulting in teamfights from malz's view?\n\n3. Ok, what if malz had the brain to communicate with his jungler and just cced you twice anyways.\n\nSo...logically. You're forced to buy shiv no matter what. And pray for the best and of course in reality you will be ulted down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solaxo","date":"2015-11-22T15:18:55.790+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LadyRenly,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gyivbFdP,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-11-22T05:56:03.060+0000)\n>\n> I've heard of that, but may I ask how that is the case?

I am a main Vlad and I've never lost lane directly to Yasuo. His Q is point-click and can completely bypass Yasuo's windwall (but the healing particle will be blocked, though). You can pool the tornado. You can easily break Yasuo's shield, and since Vlad doesn't have any skillshots - all his abilities are targeted or AoE - he doesn't have any problems in harassing Yasuo, despite his passive shield. Also, Vlad is manaless, just like Yasuo, he doesn't have to care about suddenly being OOM.\n\nI suggest starting with Cloth + 4 pots, and then, rushing a Hextech Revolver. Once you have it, you will outsustain Yasuo. Oh, and Yasuo can opt to rush a Hexdrinker early. This allow him to not die to Vlad, but then, he will have his powerspike delayed, and he can't kill Vlad either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-11-22T08:43:39.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Good Yasuo's can easily deal with Malzahar, it is true that he can never all in you at full hp when your spells are up but he can constantly harrass you and allin you easily before level 6 the moment you use your E on a minion.\n\nI have about 100 ranked games with Malzahar in Season 5, so I have played this matchup quite often and know what I am talking about, it is not nearly as favorable for Malzahar as people are making it out to be, once Yasuo buys QSS he beats Malzahar.","replies":[{"poster":"Craft Zeppelin","date":"2015-11-22T09:33:54.333+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Buff Jax please,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gyivbFdP,comment-id=00020002,timestamp=2015-11-22T08:43:39.679+0000)\n>\n> Good Yasuo's can easily deal with Malzahar, it is true that he can never all in you at full hp when your spells are up but he can constantly harrass you and allin you easily before level 6 the moment you use your E on a minion.\n> \n> I have about 100 ranked games with Malzahar in Season 5, so I have played this matchup quite often and know what I am talking about, it is not nearly as favorable for Malzahar as people are making it out to be, once Yasuo buys QSS he beats Malzahar.\n\nWell i know what are you talking about, and you're in a higher rank than me so we might be in a different environment.\nBut since I'm a 300 match malz player I might have some experience advantage.

This is the 2nd issue and much harder to address.\n\n5) I think the best solution, although site is 3 changes that doesn't make yasuo feel any less fun to play (which is important to me) but makes him much more manageable \n\n-a change to his passive, he should get 100% crit after 3 big items, not 2.\n\n-a change to his Q make the duration for his knockup charge 5 seconds (down from 10) they did a similar change to twisted fates gold card awhile back to tone down his lane pressure, and considering yasuos Q is on a 4ish second cooldown, it gives yasuo a 1 second window to trade with his knockup  (where his opponent will trade poorly)\n\n-a change to windwall, this is honestly I think the biggest nerf here but one I feel is necessary for yasuo to not feel so bs, make windwall start outside of yasuo and not inside of him, windwall starts inside yasuo and doesn't actually appear until it's a few units past him, this is how yasuos block spells last second, sometimes without even casting it in the right direction \n\nThese will tone down his early game power significantly without feeling as awful as say a 5 second cooldown on E, yasuo is a fun champ and I do believe he should be strong late game But he's currently pretty overbearing in lane right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Renascent","date":"2015-11-22T17:06:52.470+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your suggestion to change his knockup charge to a shorter duration is something I can't believe I never thought of. It's just like what they did to Ryze's passive stack duration; Having to wait for a window of opportunity to go in every 10+ seconds is NOT fun, especially when Ryze is standing a comfortable distance away because of his range. The same goes for Yasuo; If he sees a chance within 10 seconds, he'll just dash into you. If not, he can stay back 'till the next wave comes to repeat the process all over again. \n\nThe problem with these 10 second windows is that they have INSANE control over the lane. \nGot your stacks ready? Last hit minions. \nChance to go in? Do it; You have the means to pull it off (Ryze R, Yasuo E). \nGetting ganked? Chances are, your stacks are STILL up, so you can either 2v1 because you're at your most powerful, or use whatever is at your disposal to escape.\n\nNow that they nerfed Ryze's stack duration, his grip over the lane has been loosened CONSIDERABLY; He's always needed enough mana to sustain his combo, but now he has to burn through more of it to keep stack pressure over the lane.

Or even the tenth. They look spaced out enough to seem like they could possibly be independent thoughts, but we all know what's happening here, let's be real. \n\nYasuo is goddamned obnoxious to play against - even if you play a lot of Yasuo, there's no denying that your enemy is not having fun. However, the entire lane is not up to Yasuo by himself because that doesn't even logically work out. A good Yasuo player can't do literally everything. \"A 'Good' Yasuo player will hold onto his wall!\" At risk of being continually whittled down, he's going to save it for only when your ult comes? Really? Beyond that, there's things beyond his control - like the Jungler. Yeah, he can hold onto that wall, and he may block your ult. But you know what he can't do shit about? That jungler that just came in uninvited to the party that he didn't know about because wards are magical, but they're not omnipresent and he can't predict what route the enemy jungler will come from 100% of the time. And so on. \n\nThe whole lane is not decided by Yasuo. There's two people in a lane, minimum (barring disconnections and server issues); it takes two to tango and sometimes Yasuo doesn't get to lead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThePurpleKnight","date":"2015-11-23T13:55:10.562+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been saying this forever but Yasuo is the counter to mages, all they'd need to do is take away the shield passive and make his passive \"This champion has double critical strike chance\" and he would finally be able to be poked which would allow a win condition for mages, but instead he has that shield every couple steps that just guarantees a lane win unless he gets ganked mid all in, or fucks up really bad. Any one with knowledge of how to freeze can abuse this champion to gain easy wins, and best of all, due to his weak base damages a decent number of bad players still lose with him keeping him at a relatively decent win rate, which just makes it easier for people who understand the game to abuse this broken piece of shit. Fuck CertainlyT\n\nI wasn't on board when people shit talked him for Thresh and all, but Yasuo and Kalista are just so infuriating, especially Yasuo.
