(It's in EU West, but I kinda figured I would get a faster answer here, and I think my problem concerns also many people here)\r\nEarlier this day, I received an email saying I asked to change my password. I didn't.\r\nIt thus very much feels like I've been hacked. (I didn't receive an email explaining why I got banned, by the way)\r\n\r\nSo is my password in jeopardy? I've used it on a few other games, without thinking too much about it. It felt safe enough.\r\nIt appears it evidently isn't the case.\r\nWas it stolen because it wasn't strong enough? If I amped it up severely and used the new password on other games, would the risk taken be the same?\r\n\r\nThanks for your answer !","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T01:12:47.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-ezreal}} Why hello there!\n\nI'm guessing you must have gotten this figured out in a ticket before I was able to get to your post, but it doesn't look like this account is banned at the moment. Let me know if you were talking about a different account though!!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Caelistis","date":"2017-10-04T05:21:25.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, EUW support resolved this ultra-fast.
