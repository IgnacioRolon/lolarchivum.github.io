The point I was making was the idea that ARAM accounts couldn't cherry pick champions to get a leg up. I could care less in normal arams, but if there was a ranked version it would need to be fair and truly random.

Yes, ranked is a measure of skill, but it's about measuring who is consistently skilled, not about the more skillful team. Ranked is about demonstrating skill over a large number of games (which is why you can't end higher than Plat 1 or whatever from placements). Both ranked SR and TT follow that philosophy, so it's ridiculous to claim that exact same idea precludes ranked ARAM.\n\nLikewise, the concept that \"skill level doesn't necessarily translate to a win\" isn't exclusive to ARAM. You can easily lose because someone got a matchup they have no clue how to play. Imagine throwing a Plat player into a bunch of games with/against Golds. The Plat's obviously more skilled, yet almost certainly won't have a 100% winrate against the Golds.","replies":[{"poster":"Aquafuge","date":"2017-02-01T00:18:31.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play ranked yet but your argument is sound, Ranked should be a measure of skill and experience, where as being totally honest aram is mostly blind luck, And I would never claim that a ranked aram could be based on the same concept as ranked SR or TT because aram by it's nature is completely different","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sakana Slap","date":"2017-02-11T01:14:25.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the thing is, if its set up where everyone automatically gets 1 reroll, you could most likely figure out someone to trade with or whatever to get a more comfortable champion for you.\n\nBut also it measures your ability to adapt which i believe is important in league of legends.","replies":[{"poster":"Aquafuge","date":"2017-02-12T00:15:34.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you played aram where you reroll and get a worse champ to play, the problem is aram is mostly based on random luck ( champ selection and team comp ) then it is skill.
