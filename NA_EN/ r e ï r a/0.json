The game won't open. I did everything. I talked with a support and followed all the guidelines he sent to me with no successful results. I even formatted my mac praying that it would fix things, but nothing changed. At this point, I think something is wrong in the 7.10 patch and I suggest you check it out because I noticed a lot of people who use mac can't play league anymore since the new patch is out.","replies":[{"poster":"JackerPig","date":"2017-05-19T19:55:36.803+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"please. riot. at least make an overall thread to let us know that you are aware of this problem and are trying to finish. its not like you to leave a good part of your community unrecognized :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"RÎSEN","date":"2017-05-21T00:28:12.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue. I'm on a Mac (mid 2007) 10.11.6 El Capitan and every time i click the league button it bounces one time, another league symbol comes for half a second and then disappears. If i start the old client and click on launch the new client, it also does nothing. I tried HRT without luck, and i know i have a stable wired connection. I understand it takes some time to gather data and find a solution. I hope you guys work out what the problem is, I really enjoy my time on the rift :)\n\nCheers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnome In Space","date":"2017-05-20T18:19:14.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue that it dos nothing after hitting the launch . i tryed  everything in the last 2 days to fix it with uninstalling / reinstalling clean mac/ checked all connection etc etc even put back to factory settings and installed all new, im using mac with ElCapitan., im very sad i cant play especcially because i got my days off now and i cant play in team with my friends :( , I hope riot can fix the problem soon, but it would be nice for them maby to right something to us mac users that they realised there is an issue with the latest patch for mac users. i cant stop trying more more things on my mac that maby could fix the problem and i can play..

However would it be that difficult to make a post acknowledging to the Mac player base that you're aware of some issues with the client not launching and that you're all working hard on resolving? \n\nBy the way, I noticed Broporo mentioned in another thread that some users who were able to upgrade to Sierra OS were able to launch the client. However for users who have Imac 20o7 potatoes....that isn't possible. Hopefully some kind of resolution comes to fruition","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-20T18:15:41.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I promise that I will absolutely get info out and keep each other updated with issues as often as I can, including posts.  Right now, though, I haven't heard anything back about this specific issue.  It could absolutely be an emerging problem, but we need to take steps to collect info and rule out possibilities as either a resolution or offering of proof that something just well might be happening.  That starts with basic troubleshooting.  The difficult part would be to just claim a widespread or potential new problem, without any backing.  \n\nI've collected and forwarded the info I've received from you guys over the day, but haven't been able to confirm anything yet.

One of the guidelines was the connection one that you keep sending to people saying that the problem might be that. Well, it's not. I did everything the page asked and nothing changed. I have a potato macbook pro 17 inches 2.4ghz with El Capitan. I can't update to Sierra unfortunately.
