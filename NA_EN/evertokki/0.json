I'd made an account in NA but after levelling up to 24, I found out that it was the geographically wrong server to play on (I live in the Middle East so it was horrible) so I had to use the EUW server which didn't work out most of the time as well. \n\nI went through 20+ 20 minute leaverbusters to fight with my internet issues. Player support couldn't solve my internet problems. I got accepted into the PBE even if I wasn't level 30, and since the connection was much better there I forgot about live servers for about a year.\n\nOnce I started getting better internet, I resumed my play. I finally reached level 30 from 24 over the last 2 months.\nThat's 3 levels in one month. I still can't believe it. I don't even play that much, kappa\n\n*So I started playing since Lucian came out. ;_; I'm really excited for ranked tho*\n\nWell this is a really meaningless but meaningful post.
