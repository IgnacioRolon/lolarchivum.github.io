In this case, his model and animations have not been adjusted, so it's more of a 'TU' or 'Texture Update'. You'll have to wait a few years for Ezreal and all his skins to be updated with a VU I'm afraid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T04:52:35.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I can tell from official Riot sources, we don't have a visual update currently planned for Pulsefire Ezreal....\n\nWith that being said, however!! I was able to find a few sources by googling his possible visual update, and they may have really outdone themselves even more than the first time (old joke is old)! Since I don't have any official info about whether or not this PFE VU is true or not, I can't really say whether you should get him now or wait. The one thing I can say is this: if you're concerned about how he will look in the future, I would suggest waiting to see how it turns out first!","replies":[{"poster":"Dirrty","date":"2017-05-05T07:48:07.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=K4wOe6Hu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-05T04:52:35.172+0000)\n>\n> As far as I can tell from official Riot sources, we don&#x27;t have a visual update currently planned for Pulsefire Ezreal....\n\n\nHis visual update is on the PBE right now though.","replies":[{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2017-05-05T15:27:53.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But there's no official Riot source saying that he's getting an update.
