I'm no doublelift don't get me wrong, but I'm pretty good mechanically. Most of the time that is. \n\nHowever, whenever I pick Vayne, all my mechanics go completely out the window. I end up fighting in melee range since I'll fail at clicking on people and instead click the ground next to them 30 times. For some reason whenever I pick Vayne it's like I'm playing a brand new game.\n\nI can play Ezreal and Twitch with no issues, so it's not like it's an adc thing. Just Vayne. ","replies":[]}
