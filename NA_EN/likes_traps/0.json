During a game at random times, I won't be able to move my champion or perform an action, and the screen will tell me it's \"attempting to reconnect.\" The strange thing to me is that the game doesn't stop moving. I can still see what's going on. I can see champions moving and performing actions, I'm just unable to do anything. I'm not sure if it's my computer or my internet, but if anybody knows what's going on I'd appreciate some insight.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T18:24:50.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lag spikes like this are commonly due to a connection issue with your network reaching our game server.
