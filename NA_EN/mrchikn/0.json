Whenever I try to just reconnect there, it says that I have been disconnected, and it keeps saying that until I restart my pc. So I restart my pc, which takes about 6 minutes, and I immediately log on to the client to see that I have been placed in a low priority queue for 5 games.\r\nThis really frustrates me because 1st, I keep losing lp; 2nd, I keep getting a penalty; and third, there is nothing I can do.\r\nIs there a way I can fix my client from crashing like this? I always submit the bug reports and I try to get in as soon as I can, but that never really works. Also, I never manually leave games. I always play it out till the end whether I need to go or I don't want to play.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T01:30:53.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your game is crashing that often we should really try to troubleshoot and fix the cause of those crashes instead of hoping it goes away on its own! Be sure to run a quick repair first if you haven't yet, but I would really be sure to check out your firewalls/antivirus to see if those are blocking access to certain files which causes this crash.\n\nThere are a lot of different things that could make the client crash depending on just what happens and when it happens, but if those two steps above aren't helping please check out the others in this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) before reaching out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]}]}
