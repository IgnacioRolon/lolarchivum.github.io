I&#039;ll be extremely upset.\r\n\r\n1. Top. Top. Top notch Graphics.\r\n\r\n2. Extremely good + unique story.\r\n\r\n3. Great dialogue.\r\n\r\n4.  Amazing World full of adventure.\r\n\r\n5. Difficulties that aren&#039;t actually push overs. Even in normal mode the monsters will two shot you.  \r\n\r\n6.  Interesting level mechanic.\r\n\r\n7. Not forced game play.\r\n\r\n8. Your decisions in the game actually matter through the entire game, straight down to what you&#039;re wearing. It changes what happens the entire game + how people act and what you say to people + others, and who appears/doesn&#039;t.\r\n\r\n9. Every creature has a unique behavior.\r\n\r\n10. Pretty cool hunting + gathering mechanics.\r\n\r\n11. You can customize  pretty much everything in the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been playing for 8 hours now, pretty much haven&#039;t even gotten out of the first chunk of the map yet . . . and I really can&#039;t find a single thing wrong with the game yet to be honest. This is pretty much the type of game I&#039;ve been asking for for over 20 fucking years, and I&#039;m glad it was finally made. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ll get around to the Zelda one eventually, but for now. I have to say hands down Horizon Dawn is the best game I&#039;ve ever played, and I don&#039;t think any game out there is ever going to take that title from it.","replies":[]}
