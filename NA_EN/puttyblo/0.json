Would you consider giving Kindred these buffs?\n\n\n+3 base armor.\n\n200 additional radius to W ((It&#039;s 200 range bigger around. I don&#039;t know the exact word for it.))\n\n+1% max health damage on Mounting Dread\n\nattack speed increased from .625 to .645\n\nMounting Dread slow increased to 1.5 second from 1. \n\n\n?\n\nI think these would put Kindred in a comfortable, more tolerable spot without breaking her. The only players who&#039;d actually be able to utilize these buffs to a noticeable difference are the OTPS, and in the end they still will have a lower winrate than other jungle mains anyways, but it&#039;ll definitely feel a lot less depressing to play with these minute changes. \n\nI hope you consider it please.","replies":[{"poster":"Puttyblo","date":"2017-02-18T12:33:47.868+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"As for whoever downvoted me, I'd really be interested in seeing your Kindred ranking, or actual rank in general and why you think these would be bad buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-02-18T12:47:28.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"i didn't see a single player playing that cancer since a few months and i have no problem if it stays like that.\n\napart from the fact that no buffs are needed for that champ in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-18T15:12:02.625+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not a Kindred player at all, but the champion has been at around 47% winrate and 1.8% pickrate for 9 patches straight.

I'd say she needs buffs. The problem is the person that was going to buff her after over nerfing her no longer works in that balance department.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Puttyblo","date":"2017-02-18T13:53:14.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadòw,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pyW6gFZk,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-18T12:47:28.643+0000)\n>\n> i didn&#x27;t see a single player playing that cancer since a few months and i have no problem if it stays like that.\n> \n> apart from the fact that no buffs are needed for that champ in the first place.\n\nI'd  call something overpowered too if I had a 30% winrate on Syndra.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-02-25T12:52:33.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"ended last season with 33% on Yasuo while he was broken as hell lul","replies":[{"poster":"Puttyblo","date":"2017-02-25T16:01:29.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadòw,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pyW6gFZk,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-25T12:52:33.324+0000)\n>\n> ended last season with 33% on Yasuo while he was broken as hell lul\n\nMe?
