Like take Eternum Rek'sai for example, change all the reds to blues and maybe tweak the base metal tone to better fit a cool color scheme and boom, you done. Maybe I completely misunderstand how this stuff works but is there a reason you couldn't do that in like 30 minutes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mianta","date":"2018-06-26T17:01:49.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah :) I just love the mystery behind the two identities.\n\nBut I thought we already had chromas for base champs? Garen's Noble Chroma pack for instance. I think it'd be really cool for many others too, though the concept isnt new, no?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-06-26T16:29:17.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Base champion chromas are very attractive to free players I gotta say.
