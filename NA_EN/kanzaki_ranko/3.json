You need to compare the Skill capped win rates. Among players who pro play Evelynn, they are capping out at 59%.\n\nThat's extremely LOW for someone proficient with a champ. Her performance is heavily skill capped. That means you can only get \"so good\" with her and then you plateau. (Even Singed has a 63.1%)\n\n2) Her ban rate is not the highest.\n\n3) She just WAS indirectly nerfed with the Electrocute change. She doesn't pull level 2-3 First bloods anymore and falls off on per skirmish damage.\n\n4) Her win rate has far more to do with players not trying to mitigate her or act correctly when she W's than actual output versus Risk. She's immobile, and can only cc one person, and extremely vulnerable. \n\n5) The real reason Evelynn is currently pulling high win rates has nothing at all to do with Evelynn. It has to do with the pre-eminence of Conquerer + {{item:3031}} effectively taking tanks out of the game in conjuction with {{item:3036}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3142}} etc.\n\nTeams just aren't running the champs who make Evelynn's life living hell. They are running adc tops. They are running squishy mage mids, adc bots, squishy Supports, and fighter junglers and a few assassins.\n{{champion:31}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:89}}{{champion:35}}  just aren't seeing much play. If they were, Evelynn would be averaging 49%. But because of the nerfs to {{item:3147}} and nerfs to tanks, Evelynn is having a free run of the squishies.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Warper","date":"2018-08-31T21:50:25.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"59% WR is not \"extremely low\" for when you master a champion...

Based on skill, Taliyah and various other champs can get as high as 80%, or as low as 51% That's a 29 point spread. Eve's is 20.\n\nThere's more to stats than just pro win rates. And Evelynn places # 14 among junglers right now.

And if she AA'd you, then that's your fault for letting her get that damn close. Oh boy she charmed you then ulted away, so scary. It's not like she basically forfeited all the dps she could have done with her other abilities.\n\nHer charm isn't her problem guys. Its super projected. The problem is that she bypasses most vision which will always be strong because it gives her a guaranteed edge as long as she isn't out of position. Also her counterplay isn't as clear because of her stealth it makes it hard to judge when its actually safe to make a play.\n\nIMO they need to nerf her healing off of AP on her passive or make it more interactive. It just makes her way too safe currently so that even if she screws up half the time she can regen enough hp to make another attempt later while hiding in stealth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2018-08-31T12:29:55.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Öskan,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RYWxtHTE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-08-31T10:41:34.797+0000)\n>\n> i dont understand why the 3 spikes of her q can proc the charm its so dumb\n> only the initial q and her e should be able to proc it\n\nCause how we can make her semi binary under cover with skillshots ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sleepcoma","date":"2018-08-31T16:20:24.294+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you just look up win rates and complain about the highest one??

If they do 100% of a squishy target's health then they even lack strategic counterplay since the squishy's only reliable option to not die is to afk.  Assassins should either rely on an ally to soften a target or finish a target after the assassin has used their combo, or the assassin should require multiple rounds of assassination attempts in which the target has made the mistake of being severely out of position or refuses to retreat and give up an advantage in their lane.  I also don't think marksmen or mages should burst assassins either, so it's a not a double standard.  I think it's a problem that marksmen do so much damage that an assassin currently needs to kill them in <2 seconds or the assassin gets bursted in return or the marksmen demolishes their whole team.
