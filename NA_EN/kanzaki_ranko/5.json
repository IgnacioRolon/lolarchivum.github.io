The thing is you can counter play him in various ways.\n\na) Malzahar pushes wave constantly, always in your face, he will use his abilities on the wave hence you can attack him without taking much damage back. Also, he makes himself a gank target with that.\nThis style is very oppressive as Malzahar, but also very very risky. And I highly do not recommend it as you need your enemy to be quite bad, unable to capitalize on your over aggression (good trade back or gank or both).\n\nb) Malzahar plays safe. In this case, Malzahar stays mostly behind his minion lines, usually AA-ing minions to get them low enough and then have his E jump from target to target. When he gets his passive up, he goes aggro and tries to E you.\nThis is pretty much the general Malzahar playstyle that you will face.\nBecause of this, his laning is very predictable and its easy to \"avoid\" his E passive combo by simply moving out of range for a few seconds.\nAgain, if that Malzahar REALLY wants to E you, he will have to overextend, making him an easy gank target. Since most of us know this, we prefer to not over extend as Malzahar has no escapes other than flash.\n\nc) Level 6+ If my enemy was smart enough to buy some MR: \n{{item:3028}} builds into {{item:3174}} for Mana using mages (like Lux, Lulu, Anivia)\n{{item:3211}} builds into {{item:3065}} for sustain mages (like Swain, Akali)\n{{item:3155}} builds into {{item:3156}} for AD heroes (like Zed, Corki)\n{{item:1057}} builds into {{item:3001}} for AP assassins (like Ahri, LeBlank)\nDo note, its not necessary to finish the item right away.
