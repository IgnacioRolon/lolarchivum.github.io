When a counter to that mechanic exists, but isn't hard enough, it's simply not worth picking, but when said counter is strong, the original mechanic exists in two states, where it is either far too strong or far too weak. Consequently, this also leads to an environment where whoever's dealing against that mechanic is generally powerless until they get the hard counter, and from then on tend to have much less trouble dealing with it. At no point is there real fun to be had, because the gameplay to this kind of situation boils down to flipping a switch for the rest of a match as soon as it becomes available. The game would be better off without these kinds of effects, which is why I think we should get rid of Grievous Wounds, but also true sight (stealth needs to have interactivity come from its own mechanics, not from some itemized counter), and likely also percent health damage and permanent resistance penetration.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2018-05-12T10:10:01.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think we should get rid of some of the GW mechanics \n\n{{item:3075}} is a good example of GW because of 2 reasons, it is a tank item primarily and that is important because as a tank you want to give enemies the incentive not to attack you. Which leads me to the second point, this item gives your enemy agency over whether they are effected by grievous wounds. They can choose to attack you and have severely reduced healing or they can not attack you and choose to target someone else.\n\n{{item:3033}} however is pure aids, you click on enemies to fuck over their ability to sustain for a very long duration. It has ZERO counter play \nif the duration was cut down to 1 second like Thornmail it would be a lot less problematic as then the requirement becomes continuous attacking which would at least give some counter play, disengaging for a little bit. Although it still would not allow for agency over the effect from the enemy.  \n\nThere is also this little thing called lifesteal, by late game {{champion:36}}  ult is laughable compared to crit lifesteal which is one of the reasons why grievous wounds is a neccessity\n\nOne way to get rid of that ridiculous lifesteal is to only make it scale with your AD damage part and not apply to crit bonus damage or any true damage","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-05-12T14:23:25.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I very much agree that life steal on its own is strong enough to eclipse something as ridiculously powerful as Mundo's current regen ult. However, I think that is all the more reason to address unhealthy healing at its source, instead of trying to paper over its problems with band-aids and hard counters. Just as Mundo's healing should likely depend upon interaction with enemy champions, so should life steal likely apply only on hits against enemy champions as well, and likely in lesser quantities. I can sympathize with Thornmail needing a means of punishing opponents for hitting the wielder, but I think that could very well be addressed with anti-on-hit damage, rather than a mechanic intended pretty much exclusively to combat marksmen.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"thaBeast","date":"2018-05-11T10:45:34.182+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"MUNDO GETS NERFED WHN HE PLEASES","replies":[]},{"poster":"colonel cranc","date":"2018-05-11T07:08:00.859+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":9,"body":"{{item:3033}} {{item:3033}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Pouncealot","date":"2018-05-11T08:02:59.905+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"what's sad is that if you apply grievous wounds to him now he heals as much as his old ult, which is pretty ridiculous, there's no longer a clear way to deal with the guy without just killing the rest of his team first and slowly tickling him to death with five people while hoping to god he doesn't kill your carry before he finally keels over, he badly needs a rework now more than ever.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-05-11T17:50:39.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":8,"body":"Good.

The point of zed's ult is to delete squishies, so should we now eliminate all counterplay options against it and have carried stunned for 3 seconds and zed immune while its active?
