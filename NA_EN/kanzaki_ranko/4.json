Its early game CD is shorter then it was as a single target, its only after level 3 that its cd is higher. However the ability to net 2 ap off a cast more then compensates him for the 1 second.  Please explain how a single Q cast is not able to generate more ap off minions then the old Q did.\n\nEh, You can penetrate minion and hit players, additionally just landing it on a player triggers his passive providing him a stack of ap. You still end up with a net gain of ap because of this even if you only get 1 ap for doing so as previously you'd net 0. What  in this is it you feel is so contradictory?  Also its not really fair to claim its range is short as 950 range is not bad  there are longer options but its by no means a short range especially considering it has one of the faster travel speeds set at 2000.\n\nI feel that his ability to scale into ap in more matchups is a perk, you can just focus on farm and Stacking at a safer range then old veigar could. However I understand how if you played him vs the champions he used to counter and destroy he feels a lot weaker. Overall I feel that the fact you can generate higher AP in early and mid game results in him becoming stronger in team fights, where his kit starts to shine and that the trade in his kit for safety at the cost of bullying and that for the most part A matchup you struggle with at 950 range is one your gonna have had a bad time with at 650 range.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Necroside","date":"2018-04-28T07:43:07.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't know how the game even works and you're trying to insinuate that his laning got better?\n\nPre 5.4 Veigar had actual trading patterns that were respectable and weren't cemented as \"Oh hey its Veigar, I get a free lane now!\"\n\nMaking his only form of harass/trading into a skillshot that can be blocked by minions and deal not so much damage early makes his laning abysmal.
