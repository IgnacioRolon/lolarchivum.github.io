If you let someone else play on your account, you're responsible for their behavior, whether they flame, intentionally feed, cheat, or whatever else.\n\nBeyond that, account sharing is in and of itself punishable by a permanent account suspension. Because, also as stated above; _**you're the only person who should be playing on your account.**_\n\n> ive spend alot of money on that account and would like it back. that all.\n\nYou spent a lot of money in **_non-refundable transactions._** All of the money you spent on that account was forfeit when you (both directly and by proxy of your nephew) broke the rules and merited a permanent suspension. You're not going to be able to get the money back, as per the [Terms of Use](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#account-termination).","replies":[{"poster":"simonmana","date":"2019-12-23T23:37:09.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"what a shitty company","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-12-24T00:01:39.189+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=simonmana,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=3cadQ70Z,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-23T23:37:09.495+0000)\n>\n> what a shitty company\n\nYou act like this policy is unique to Riot when in fact it's not. Name one company that doesn't punish for account sharing. Yes it may seem dumb to punish for it in a free to play game but it's really not. People already try to come up with excuses to try to justify their behavior when they're punished, and saying \"It wasn't me, it was someone else\" is just an easy way out of accountability. There's also the issue of leaderboard and matchmaking integrity-Jack's account could be in the top 10 of the leaderboard or have an MMR comparable to that of Gold ranked players, but it wasn't actually Jack who played on the account, but instead Jill. He didn't get to there legitimately, he had someone else do the work for him. which also means that his antics prevented legitimate contenders from reaching that status.\n\nI could go on but there are many good answers provided [here](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/148354/why-is-account-sharing-so-bad) about why account sharing is against the rules that explain it better than I can.","replies":[{"poster":"simonmana","date":"2019-12-24T00:15:19.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Never heard of a company punsihing for account sharing sorry.It seems dumb because it is.

Whats on an account that has meaning, if rank is meaningless in the first place? What does it mean to have meaning? I dont get what you mean by rank is meaningless. It means you are what rank you are. So if that has no meaning, what video game has meaning? Your level must be meaningless too, the champs you own, no meaning.

Its a way for a company to make profit, and if people sharing accounts affects their profit negatively, theyre gonna ban them... i dont see how thats \"dumb\" or \"shitty\".

For example, speedrunning is a popular form of competition, yet there have been people who have violated the integrity of it by falsifying their records (TASing, splicing separate runs together to make it appear legitimate, etc.), which has led to those individuals being banned from the games in question.\n\nThere's also the matter of Esports titles. Many teams look to the rankings to see who has the potential to become a pro, and that process can become compromised if it turns out the person they had their eye on cheated to get there, which in turn can make legitimately skilled players go unnoticed for longer than they would otherwise.\n\nOf course for a normally free to play game this may not seem to big a deal, but for competitions with cash prizes it is, as the 1st place player who cheated to win is preventing the non-cheaters from winning and getting their accurate placements/prizes if that makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"simonmana","date":"2019-12-24T00:40:21.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"It is why speedruns are verified before being declared.

If Jack lets Jill play on his account despite knowing the potential consequences and Jill ends up behaving in a way that axes the account then Jack has to be held responsible for letting Jill use his own account in the first place. Sure Jack may not normally behave like Jill does but how is anyone else supposed to know that outside of them? If Jill truly wanted to play the game then she would just make her own account rather than using someone else to do so. This way both people can play at the same time, and if Jill happens to get in trouble and loses her account because of it, Jack will still be able to play on his account despite that, risk, guilt and consequence free.\n\nAnd sure account compromises can happen most definitely, but more often than not it's someone willingly letting someone else have access to their account and any personal information on that account.\n\nYou are free to disagree that account sharing is bad but that's just how it is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-12-23T19:32:25.390+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you didn't know he was going to use hacks, account sharing by itself is against the rules and everything that's done under your name is ultimately your responsibility.\n\n Unfortunately, that account is gone for good.
