I provided a screenshot of the wording that differed from what the mod emphasized and the mod explained that the wording was not specific to the intent, essentially. Other users commented that by the definition and meaning provided by the mod, that they should not have gotten credit but had received credit and also requested assistance in figuring out the issue. In response, the discussion was deleted with \r\n\r\n&quot;Your Content Has Been Removed\r\nFrom: Riot Games\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/MxqmoIWW-mission-not-recording-complete-win-a-game-on-summoners-rift-with-more-than-15-kills-andor-assists?comment=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n\r\nThis post has been deleted due to mass spreading of misinformation and being greatly derailed. You&#039;re welcome to repost your thread where the conversation can stay on track, but this post has lost it&#039;s meaning at this point.&quot;\r\n\r\nwhich makes it seem like instead of addressing the issue because the answer doesn&#039;t seem to fit the circumstances individual players are going through or because the requirements did not appear to apply equally, that the discussion was closed, which makes the other users lose sight of the post (even if it is reposted, which it says can be done) and increases the amount of effort needed to put forth to obtain an answer, which easily dissuades many. \r\n\r\nIf it can be explained how there was &quot;mass spreading of misinformation&quot; through inquiry based on a general understanding of the english language and different circumstances experienced by different players, or if it can be explained how the provision of additional information pertaining to the same topic by myself and other individuals that provided further evidence in regards to the reasoning behind the inquiry and why the answer didn&#039;t seem to match &quot;greatly derailed&quot; and caused the conversation to be unable to &quot;stay on track&quot; or caused the post to have &quot;lost it&#039;s meaning at this point.&quot; It would be greatly appreciated.  I did notice it seemed like someone downvoted the mod shortly before it was removed I believe (Everyone starts at 1 right?). The links below are screenshots of the post, instead of me copy and pasting the entire thing for you to review in case you wanted to look but couldn&#039;t access it through the link I was provided with above. For some reason when I try to do the embedding it creates a small rectangular page with a zigzag line through it instead of embedding it.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/B80yr\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/u0ZFb\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/BrgGh\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/0evmD\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IcUZD\r\n\r\nLink/Picture posted within the posts displayed in the previous link:    https://imgur.com/Z8WLXec\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JoTtS","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T23:05:40.799+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wanted to step over and clear this up myself instead of having one of the Mods handle it! You deserve the answer straight from me rather than someone else assuming what happened.\n\nSo first off, the thread wasn't deleted for anything *you* did. We aim to have players create their *own* topics to have discussions, not for players to come in and take over the conversation. I thought I had included a line in the deletion message stating \"You're welcome to repost your thread where the conversation can stay on track\". The main point behind this deletion was that it no longer applied to you, the topic creator, like you mentioned yourself at the beginning of this post. \n\nWhile it's fine to ask questions and everything, that conversation had immensely derailed into arguments and disagreements. The question at hand was how the mission was supposed to work, which isn't what was being discussed. Rather, the discussion ended up being a debate of how English works, which isn't something I can fix xD.\n\nOverall, the conversation was deleted because\nA) It no longer applied to you, the topic creator. We aim to answer the topic creator, and it's not beneficial for others to hijack a thread just to argue semantics\nB) The discussion had devolved into arguments, which feedback and opinions aren't best posted in H&amp;S since we aren't developers","replies":[]}]}
