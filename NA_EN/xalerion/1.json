Another person was also in the party and they had remarked that the they had not received a chest two games prior (1) for the other individual in the party getting an S on Nasus, when I had, but they received a chest on the game following that game (2) (or/also referred to as the game immediately prior to the Maokai game) when the player who played Nasus the first game (1) and got an S had played Nasus again (2) and had gotten another S. The third individual who had informed me of what happened with their boxes had to leave before I could inquire about whether they were supposed to get and whether they got a box for the Moakai game (3), but I checked and know I did not when I should have. Can you please look into this and ensure boxes are distributed appropriately, both to myself and to the third person that was in our party if they should have received one as well and did not? Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T21:32:36.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clear a bit up really quick, the chests you get are tied to that champion that *you* are playing not your teammates. If they got an S with Maokai, you will get a chest tied to the champ you're using, but if that champ already got a chest you won't. Looks like you were using Malphite, and you've already gotten a mastery chest for Malphite so you can't get another from him until the new season starts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kieteltje","date":"2017-12-13T08:05:11.351+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Riot, \ni havent recieved boxes for a few months now.
