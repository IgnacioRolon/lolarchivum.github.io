I am in Utah and I noticed that my traffic instead of routing through the Denver PoP on Riot Direct then straight to Chicago, it  is now backtracking to San Jose (Sunnyvale) California  then to Chicago. I've spoken to Riot support (no help) and to Xfinity (even less help). I've downgraded back to perfomance, power cycled everything etc etc and even got a new docsis 3.1 modem. I am at a loss. Xfinity and Riot have a peering agreement. Surely they can sort this?\r\n\r\nPlease help. I know 62 is playable but it is a noticeable increase from 44 and I've been stable at 44 for 2 years. \r\n\r\nHere is my traceroute:\r\n\r\n  1     7 ms     8 ms     7 ms  96.120.96.77\r\n  2     8 ms     7 ms     7 ms  po-104-rur02.orem.ut.utah.comcast.net [68.87.220.173]\r\n  3     8 ms     8 ms     8 ms  162.151.9.193\r\n  4    24 ms    26 ms    24 ms  be-33660-cr02.sunnyvale.ca.ibone.comcast.net [68.86.90.145]\r\n  5    27 ms    26 ms    26 ms  be-11025-cr01.9greatoaks.ca.ibone.comcast.net [68.86.87.158]\r\n  6    31 ms    24 ms    24 ms  hu-0-15-0-0-pe03.11greatoaks.ca.ibone.comcast.net [68.86.86.210]\r\n  7    34 ms    36 ms    34 ms  50.248.116.198\r\n  8    35 ms    34 ms    35 ms  104.160.130.46\r\n  9    39 ms    37 ms    35 ms  104.160.159.102\r\n 10    53 ms    53 ms    52 ms  ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net [104.160.159.22]\r\n 11    55 ms    53 ms    54 ms  104.160.131.101\r\n 12    54 ms    54 ms    53 ms  192.64.170.1","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T04:14:05.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that really doesn't look like an optimal route to me either if it's hopping all over the place like that. Since your ISP is sending your connection in such a weird way, you might have a little better luck by using a VPN to route your connection in a slightly different way to get your ping back to where it used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Trogdyr","date":"2017-07-09T13:15:57.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when you had the Chicago mega thread a couple of years ago my traffic was being routed the same way then \"your engineers talked to their engineers\" and it was sorted out fairly soon.

Chances are the isp had to reroute traffic due to some internal issue. Wait it out and it should return to normal. Its on the comcast end so nothing you do will ever change the route.","replies":[]}]}
