Doesn't even matter to me with how absurd this is.\n\nI wanted to get in a game, but it was full but on voice chat it sounded like there was gonna be space. So I start mashing \"accept\" while it's telling me it's full, and I guess the new client is bloody optimized because it bugsplats, and as I'm typing this I'm reinstalling the league client. This has happened in the past, where I have to reinstall files in order to make League work again and the fact I triggered this by hitting a button too many times makes no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-03T01:00:33.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it's pretty odd that clicking the accept button would cause you client to bugsplat. If you were mashing the button over and over, it might have caused your connection to go a little wonky since it was sending way too many accept signals to the server (next time just click it once or twice, spam clicking won't get you in a match faster). \n\nIt'll be a little hard to troubleshoot that bugsplat at this point, since you're already reinstalling. If you see this bugsplat again, I'd suggest going through this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) before jumping to a reinstall in order to save yourself some time, but let me know if that reinstall doesn't help.","replies":[]}]}
