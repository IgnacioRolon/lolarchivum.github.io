I would replace the red \"danger\" ping (currently at the top of the radial menu) with a \"warded\" ping. Everything else I think is by and large fine; if someone blows their ult or escape it's usually during a skirmish, after which time I usually either have time to back off and type things, or am dead and have time to type things, so I don't think that's really necessary. Similarly, letting people know the cooldown on your own ult can happen with minimal difficulty in chat, though I do like the idea of being able to hit a modifier key, then click the ability icon or hit the ability key, so that could be worth exploring. \"Assist me\" is the only other one I could possibly consider worth replacing, as currently you can hit G and click a turret to request assistance (or target, if it's an enemy turret). But I don't think that's so redundant as to warrant replacing the ping, since sometimes you can't click the turret (like if you're overextended, or some such).\n\n**Tl;dr: replace the red \"danger\" ping with a \"this is warded\" ping.

This is to break them into two dials.  For example you can look at it as an actionary dial and a cautionary dial.  The actionary dial could be used for communications that require action, for example the actions could be \"On my way\", \"Go in on enemy\", \"Need assistance\", and \"Ward here, plz\".  Whereas the cautionary dial could be more along the lines of, \"Be careful\", \"Enemies incoming\", \"Enemies Missing\", and \"It is warded\".\n\nSome of these are just placeholders because I put the post together quickly but some of them I have been wanting for a long time now.  The main one I would like to see is the \"Enemies Incoming\" ping because there have been times when I have been ganked by the jungler then they leave and I know they are going mid or top or whatever but when I ping caution or enemies missing the other laner sees that my lane enemy is still in lane and disregards my ping.  This becomes very frustrating.  Another situation that I run into that this would be great for is when you run into a fight where you are outnumbered and know you can win, like I run into a lot with trundle, an ally pings caution because they don't think you can win a 2v1 then part way through a third shows up and you lose the fight.  Being able to differentiate between \"be careful\" and \"enemies incoming\" would be a great help for scenerios like this.  \n\nThe \"warded\" ping is one that would be helpful in it's own right but I don't think I need to defend this argument because of the fact that many can already see the benefits of this.  \n\nThe \"Go In\" ping would also be helpful because of being able to tell your allies to engage on someone other than pinging \"on my way\" or \"target XX\".  This is especially true when playing someone with a stealth or teleport of some kind because you don't mistime your abilities because the ally had to differentiate between whether you mean to target them when you get there or whether you are porting or running.  They would be able to see \"go in\" and be able to start the fight right off.\n\n\"Ward here, plz\" is self explanatory, though probably not a necessity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jaros3","date":"2014-09-08T07:12:06.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not using radial menu, only keybinds.

Two standard retreat and 'pointer' with just mouse click + key modifier and radial menu with 4 pings. That means we have one 'negative' and one 'positive' key modifier for a normal mouse click when it comes to ping. Why not elaborate on this idea and create two separate wheels with 4 pings on them?\nOne of the wheels would be 'enemy related' and the second one would be 'ally related'. This is a simple and logical concept and we need to use simple and understandable ideas when it comes to UI.\n\nThis is the basic idea: http://imgur.com/2RE2eIc\n\nSo now we have 8 options.\nLet's start with getting rid of the 'caution' ping to which I, ofr this day, could not find any purpose honestly. :P\nPut it on the enemy wheel and make it \"enemy spotted\" ping (with MGS-like sound! :D). Now we've got something useful, even without changing the icon. It would help in tracking enemy jungler and in the mid-late game informed about enemy movement on the map without being 'in your face' like the orange \"GET THE HELL OUT' ping is. \nOh do I smell improvement here? \nLet's leave the 'missing' ping. It's good.\nNow we need two more. Lets go for the most requested ones, like 'warded' and 'no escapes'. I think these are the most typed interactions with the junglers in my opinion. We need to make them simplier and quicker for sure. This would also let laners inform thej jungler in advance of any wards placed and escapes down, improving overall map awareness.\n\nNow we have the enemy ping wheel complete. Moving on to the ally ping wheel.\n\n\"On my way\" and \"Assist me\" are useful pings imho and theres no need to replace them. \nWhat can we do to fill these two empty spaces in though?\nMy idea is to go for \"cooldowns down\". It would hover over a life bar of your character for a second letting the ally (suppeort, jungler, anyone) know that you arre not ready to engage yet, so they need to wait a bit. This is my choice as that kind of things need to be typer out quickly and pings let you do it in a blink of an eye.\nThe last spot would be then filled with requested 'Please ward here'. Lane wards, dragon, baron, crucial areas. They need to be warded and players often foget about this. Let's have it a quick way.\n\nAlso, some improvent may be done in terms of placing it on the wheel, althout it would require to move the existing pings placement from the places they take now on the single wheel and moveing them over, causing some issues with muscle momeory for some time. Like, ward pings 'warded' and 'place ward here' may be both in the same place on the 'enemy wheel' and 'ally wheel' and so on, to make things a bit more logical.\n\nLet's not forget about sounds as well. For me, most of the sounds are ok, but the 'caution' one is... strange. I dont have any feelings related to it actually, maybe because it is used so rarely.\nOn the other hand, \"Get away\" standard ping is getting into my soul and under my nails anytime it is spammed. Like my brain being electrocuted. \n\nanyway. What do you think of the double wheel idea? It will not neccessarily caouse confusion with too many pings as long as they are logically placed and implemented in my opinion and 10 of them is the amount that maybe breaching the simplicity barrier, but does not compromise so much on the informative side of things. Which is the compromise to be taken at some point. Along with timers I think it can greatly improve the UI of LoL and eliminate the need of using the chat to communicate in situations where every second counts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"milkywayy","date":"2014-09-05T23:22:32.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worgslarg, I agree with u that it might be a little cluttered--it could definitely be shifted around and edited to make it more optimal, but I would also rly love to see more ping choices.

I also think any more than four swipe-directions per wheel will make it harder to utilize efficiently and effectively. But right now, you've got two buttons bound to basic pings that both open the same ping wheel. Other games have made good use of 'z' 'x' and 'c' for fast communication (I'm thinking TF2's dialogue menus specifically) and think you could probably get up to 3 wheels out of them or other configurations, without heavily impacting muscle reflex or mental load.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amtle","date":"2014-09-08T17:15:15.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys,\n\nI think the ping \"Assist me\" is better like here it is now because when i use this ping, i \"Put my flag down\", so i think it's more realist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2014-09-07T16:21:03.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats the difference between **DANGER **and **RETREAD**?\nwhy is there no **ATTACK **option\n**enemy marked **=\\= **attack enemy**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vindictive Carry","date":"2014-09-07T13:56:01.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about being able to ping the potential ward placed by enemy team, something that stays on the minimap  for 2-3 minutes, so that way we can warn our teammates about the dangerous areas that they are coming and going into.

All you have to do is put a 2nd page of 4 pings on the other key, ctrl for one, alt for the other. Have one be one category of things, such as the current ones, and the other be another category of additional but less critical information to communicate, such as ward locations and other things. This isn't rocket scence, just put a 2nd page on the other key - and keep the ctrl alert ping working as it does. Also, make the \"mia\" ping louder, the first sound back when smart ping was first added, was way better than the current sound, which you can barely hear and has no sense of immediacy. No one noticies it unless it is spammed, and if a fight or engagement is happening, no one notices it at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnowFall","date":"2014-09-06T16:06:51.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and that got ignored http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4683975","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vortex IV","date":"2014-09-06T15:49:36.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need more pings for sure, at least a Warded ping.
