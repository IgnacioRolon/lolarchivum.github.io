I've Played him for the entirety season 6 when he first got released and was the champ that really got me into league \n\nwhen you get good with him you can do such amazing things. \n\nSo why was his support kit destroyed, and then nerfed into oblivion till he wasnt viable for anything anymore? he just isnt good at anything anymore, why not focus on making him more support heavy instead of trying to remove him from the lane.\n\n He has such an interesting concept and kit but now his one big ability (his pickup) cant do a thing unless your in very specific situations and if theres any kind of cc or grabs you run the high risk of just murdering who your intending to save because he cant blow flash and he's slower then a slug. \n\nPlease, I'm begging you riot. Bring my tahm back :( I can't be the only one missing the big guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2019-10-22T00:48:07.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of two things are going to happen:\n\n1.

The other problem with buffing or nerfing for worlds is that means that they are -guessing- who will be a priority pick.  If they guess wrong, and that champion was never going to see play anyways, then they just make the champion weaker for their player base for no reason for the entirety of worlds with no benefit to the pro meta at all.  In a nut shell they just make guesses as to who will be strong and nerf/buff preemptively.\n\nFor all we know Kench would not have even seen play this year.  If they want to do right by the player base they need to make sure that a champion can continue in a healthy state.  If it needs to be reworked that bad then do quick work on the champion right away even if it has to be spruced up a bit later.  It's a better option than leaving a champion in a gutted state for months to years on end, particularly for fans of that champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-19T02:05:27.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that he was never a high-reaction support, he was a high-stat monster that unstoppably ran at you, stunlocked you, and completely ignored all your lane poke due to his healing mechanic.\n\nEven before he took that to toplane, nobody found it fun to play against, and pretty boring to play as well.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFlaringFox","date":"2019-10-19T15:04:52.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"then instead of just destroying his kit and pretending he doesn't exist make him a little more squishy and maybe rework his gray health to be less safety, are you saying pyke is fun to play against every fight he's in he can just reset in a bush. ever champ has its problems and ya tahm might have be a bit to beefy but like I said destroying the characters abilities and then not actually fixing him just sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-19T20:46:36.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They did that a while ago, nerfed his gray health completely.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFlaringFox","date":"2019-10-19T23:17:35.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe rework it into a different ability, or remove the stun on his q and only have it slow. it would make it easier to work against","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2019-10-22T01:07:52.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly the best bet for Kench is to remove his ally eating ability and just let him eat opponents.  Then as a support he uses that as a peeling tool against the enemy jumping on his ally instead of just eating his ally as a free zhonya.\n\nThen they can revert the nerfs to eating enemy champions and just make that his specialty.  After all the concept of him carrying around people still happens with his R, and his lore and thematic are otherwise focused on his gluttony and not his saving... anyone actually... he pretty much just eats everything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arctic Air","date":"2019-10-21T20:01:52.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our boi deserves better than his current state {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
