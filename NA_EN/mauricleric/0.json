In NA I have my oldest account in which I have played for 2 years, but now that my friends are playing in LAN I want to also play with my old account instead of starting from 0. But at the same time, I don't want to change servers because I have a lot of friends in the NA server. Isn't there a way to just connect or copy the account somehow? So at least I can have my champs and stuff instead of buying them all over again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-08T17:34:12.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't currently have any features to copy or merge accounts, but moving them is an option through the Transfer option in the store.  If that doesn't suffice, the only other option would be to make a new account in the region you want to play on.
