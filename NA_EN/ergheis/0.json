In working on the Warwick remake I keep running into how much of the power budget lives in the REVEAL of blood scent alone. Remember that vision is basically a \"team-wide buff\", as all of your allies can take advantage of the additional information gained. Quinn W also grants vision ACROSS WALLS, which is double-crazy strong. \n\nThematically, imagine that Valor flies up really high to where he can't fight people when he grants Quinn W vision; when he's on the battlefield himself he can't afford to do that!","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2014-04-01T05:45:39.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"how about W valor perform skystrike so now instead of R performing sky strike it is W. This way you can stay in valor form and use the ult second cast.
