I could take someone who's never heard anything about football and explain to him or her in 15 min or less how the season works (ie, preseason, regular season, post season, etc). I could even go over some of the other parts of the year like the draft and training camp. It all makes sense. But when I try to understand LoL's season structure, I have no idea what I'm looking at or what the significance of this weekend's \"invitational\" vs next weekend's \"split\".\r\n\r\nI've posted this before but never got any good responses. Just a few replies of, \"well it kind of works this way\" and \"it kind of works that way but I'm not 100% sure\". It would be nice to enjoy LoL the same way I enjoy watching football if I just knew what was going on.\r\n\r\nMy friends and I were going to try the Fantasy draft with LoL but we laughed because not a single one of us ever understood the season and how it works. So how would we even know who to pick and for which weeks?\r\n\r\nDespite the growth in the recent years, I believe Riot Games is missing out a lot on the potential spectator market that's out there.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help us? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-20T14:20:20.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spring Split: 10 Weeks of play. > End of Split Playoffs for Invitational qualification\nInvitational (plus relegation/promo tournament for the bottom 4 teams, Auto-relegation for 10th place team in LCS and Auto-Promotion for the #1 team in Challenger scene )\nSummer Split: 10 Weeks  > End of Split Playoffs for Worlds qualification\nWorlds (plus relegation/promo tournament)\n\nOther Events that happen: All Stars and IEMs are not associated with the LCS and do not affect its standings but may affect the timing of weeks.
