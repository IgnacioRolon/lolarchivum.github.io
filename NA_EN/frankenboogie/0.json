And punishment wouldn't actually be issued (In terms of perm bans or 14 day bans) until it was reviewed by someone from Riot. What a tribunal would do is weed out the reports that are false and allow mostly valid reports to be reviewed by the Riot employee. By allowing the playerbase to help filter out reports, you are reducing the workload for the Riot employees to a more manageable state.\n\nAny kind of bans would have to be reviewed obviously however a system could be implemented that if the tribunal issued a guilty verdict that player would not be able to play Ranked games until their case was reviewed by a Riot employee. CSGO uses a system like this to ban cheaters and while I would say it has some flaws due to the game being free and cheats being easily accessible, it does reduce the cheaters in Prime MM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arashiiko","date":"2019-12-10T07:07:30.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HcocKwIB,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-05T20:16:45.890+0000)\n>\n> One person is nowhere near enough though.\n> \n> Plus, players really can't be trusted to determine intentional feeding - based on threads here and on reddit/elsewhere.

No system is perfect, but this system bans people for next to no reason and will often times miss people who deserve to be banned. Plenty of people try to appeal their IFS bans anyways, so it shouldn't cause a huge influx of support tickets either. \nHave people only be able to take part in Tribunal for rewards if they are a high enough honor level. If more than 3 bans they voted for are refuted by support then their account is permanently locked out of the Tribunal program. \nEventually you will weed out the people who don't know what to ban for or who want to just troll. \nAlso, make Tribunal take at least 5 player's opinions into account and ban only if more than half vote yes.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-10T07:09:29.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this solves the problem of having not enough people participating how?","replies":[{"poster":"Arashiiko","date":"2019-12-10T07:14:32.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HcocKwIB,comment-id=000000000000000000020000,timestamp=2019-12-10T07:09:29.062+0000)\n>\n> And this solves the problem of having not enough people participating how?\n\nIf you're having people at a higher honor level participate for BE/RP I can guarantee you that you would have a lot of people doing those surveys. People at higher honor levels are statistically speaking more positive players and less likely to \"troll\", and even then the anti-trolling system could be put in place. (Such as if you rapidly click through the cases banning people for it to reject your votes and permanently ban you from the tribunal program). Perhaps throw a few fake cases that are clearly bans or clearly not bans in there to make sure people are paying attention, and if they invalidly vote on them then they receive a penalty or removal from the Tribunal system.\nRiot would make more money as the major reason people quit League of Legends and thus stop paying for the skins is due to the toxicity, which would be cut down by the system and level out the amount it would cost to pay people RP. Keep in mind, Hextech chests give honorable players plenty of options to receive free skins.\n(1 RP per case perhaps? They would have to do over 1,000 cases to actually get a full decent skin out of it. You could also give them the option to pick 5-10BE per case or the 1RP.)\nPlenty of people would do the cases just to get the last bit of RP they need for a skin. I've been down by 10-50 RP more times than I can count. People like me would sit there doing cases until I ran out for RP so I could buy a skin. \n\nPerhaps as an additional incentive to do more cases OR incentives for positive players, you can have:\n-A case rarely drop a Hextech key/chest\n-Create program rewards so that the top Tribunal judges for the month get something special (Maybe an honorable orb or something predetermined by Riot support.)\n-A rankings system of the most positive players in the game, showing how many honors they've gotten and how many they get per game. Maybe have this rank show up on their profile, and give a special something to the loading screen to show that you're playing with a seasonably positive player.\n-End of Season rewards for being a positive player and completing a certain number of cases over the course of the season. (Maybe a special chroma for the yearly skin or something, I'm not sure.)\n","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-10T07:34:19.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They did ban bad voters when rewards were a thing though... and they ran into numbers problems.\n\nYou’re also asking Riot to manage these rewards - keep in mind that they have to develop the rewards, maintain authenticity, accuracy, and integrity of them, as well as field questions and correct issues with them.

That’s a lot of investment to have got a system that didn’t work before and there is no evidence will work now.\n\nThey put a similar amount of effort into the positional ranking system and scrapped it. There's no evidence that any new system would work, but there _is_ evidence that there are problems with the current one. As of now I sincerely doubt that if they implemented that exact system that there would be numbers issues or false ban issues. \nThey also didn't have only high honor level people voting, they didn't give out RP and other bonuses as incentives, etcetc. I would solve those numbers issues singlehandedly because I'm the type of person to do surveys for 10+ hours of my spare time trying to get $10 for RP for a skin I like. I would absolutely sit there for a few hours and review cases, and I know many other people who would do the same. \n\nIf they gave competitive rewards (Such as being in the top 100/1000/10000/100000 players in tribunal cases gets you a certain tier permanent skin) I know a lot of people would compete to do it. \nBlue essence does nothing for some people, especially those who already own all of the champions so that's most likely why they ran into that issue. \n\nAs a company is it not their job to protect the players and to find innovative ideas to improve player satisfaction? That's quite literally the point of balance changes, new champions, reworks, new skins, etc. They all fuel player satisfaction and keep people interested in the game. If nothing changed, they would find it a lot harder to keep the massive fanbase that they have. \n\nInnovation grabs attention. They could even possibly bring back older players who quit due to toxicity by having a system like this work successfully, which would generate more revenue. \n\nThere's no downside to this; if it doesn't work then they revert. But if it works successfully, then they would see a huge positive uplift in the community as a whole. I know I would be competing for most positive player, and if you don't think I would be a shiny little ray of sunshine every game just in case they released something I liked for the rewards you'd be dead wrong. \n\n\nAlternatively they could permanently disable chat for accounts as a punishment as well, giving them a list of phrases they can post in a method similar to smite.  [(This is a site outlining the way their chat works)](https://smite.gamepedia.com/Voice_Guided_System) Upon pressing enter perhaps it could open up a list of phrases typically said in matches such as \"enemy is missing top/mid/bot\" or \"jungler is toplane/botlane\" or \"lets get dragon/baron/rift herald\".\nPermabanning toxic players for chat restrictions just encourages these people to make new accounts and flood the lower levels of ranked with toxicity, which is where new players start out. This just perpetuates toxicity and turns newer players toxic. \nIf you permanently disable their chat they can no longer be toxic but can still play the game and buy skins. This makes it a plus for Riot and makes it a plus for players. They won't want to make a new account then for the most part and lose their \"progress\" on their account, players won't have to see their toxicity in chat, and Riot will make more money.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iamthegoatofwar","date":"2019-12-06T07:44:12.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to intervene here and say both of you can win honestly.

I can all but guarantee that were players set to determine whether or not someone was intentionally feeding or trolling, we'd doubtless have many more false-positive punishments, just because someone was playing off-meta or was underperforming.\n\nAnd if the Tribunal would have Riot oversight, where a Riot Employee passes the final verdict of the case...Why even have players review the cases in the first place? It's ultimately being passed through Riot to determine whether or not it _was_ trolling/int-feeding, so having players put in their two cents would ultimately be redundant and make it take much longer to review.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the obvious issue of it being functionally impossible to have enough people handling reviews/overseeing Tribunal cases to so much as make a _dent_ in the amount of reports that go out. Bear in mind, we're talking about a playerbase numbering in the millions, with umpteen-million more matches being played daily, and doubtless a sizeable chunk of those matches involve someone reporting someone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-12-05T23:02:41.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Tribunal would serve so a lot less cases reach riot eyes.

The fact that false-positive cases could be passed along for Riot to review and dismiss, while legitimate cases may be missed over and dismissed by imperceptive players leaves a pretty wide (and unacceptable) margin for failure.\n\n> You have to assign scores to the Tribunalists based on how good they judge and they lose their ability to judge if they get many wrong. This way people are discouraged from pressing punish like baboons.\n\nWhile that may functionally discourage people from poor use of the Tribunal, that presents two issues;\n\n1) Any report that gets dismissed by the majority of players likely wouldn't count against them if they came to the wrong conclusion. They could dismiss a legitimate troll/intentional feeder and their score wouldn't go down, because the case wasn't sent to Riot to verify.\n\n2) Even perceptive players can have a hard time determining intentional feeding/trolling, so what would happen if they make a series of verdicts which were ultimately found misjudged? Do they lose privileges, despite reviewing and voting honestly?\n\n> Sure it would need a lot of time from rioters at first...\n\nIt would require a lot of time from Rioters in general. Like I said, it's impossible to staff a team dedicated to manually reviewing even just trolling/intentional feeding cases - they wouldn't be able to scratch the surface, and that's not improved any if the Tribunal filters out half of the millions of reports to look at.\n\n> Riot also needs to punish serial reporters imo. If someone has something like 50% invalid reports they lose their honour. cause let's face it, it's not really honourable to report like a maniac.\n\nIf the IFS can determine whether a report is false or not, it really doesn't need to punish people who report zealously. Granted, it definitely isn't sportsmanlike behavior to report others over every little thing, but threatening punishment for false reports would make more than just the target portion of the playerbase unwilling to report others.\n\n'Cause, let's be real - sometimes the line between low-key toxicity and acceptable behavior can get blurry, and I wouldn't want to risk my Honor if the IFS ultimately decided that my reports against a bunch of negative players were invalid. It'd result in people withholding their reports for all but the most egregious cases for fear of being punished themselves, and that's not a good thing to have for the system.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Evidence","date":"2019-12-06T13:47:21.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so tell me friend is riot realy tryin to bring some new tribunal?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-12-05T20:17:28.455+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can count on my 1 hand the number of times I even have the need to report anyone the last 100 games I played.
