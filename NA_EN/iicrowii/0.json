I found that when I tried to log in (on the \"new\" client), the client bugsplatted.  It repeated this a couple times, and I cannot find a \"repair installation\" option in the new client's login page to try to fix things that way.  I then switched to the \"old\" client, and it is working fine.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the bugsplat hits after authentication succeeds, during the time the login area says \"Loading...\"","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-25T18:40:08.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats usually happen when drivers or bad game files fail to render, so it sounds like the installation didn't run properly for your updated client.  Some functions aren't available yet like repairs or the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367), so a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) would be necessary in this case.

Until we can get our HRT and other tools compatible, a total reinstall would be the best fix.  Trying to preserve files will just confuse the patcher and cause you to loop into scanning your game files for corruption.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
