I&#039;m almost always listed as the #1 Nunu in NA on various champion skill sites, I ended Season 4 in Challenger (rank 176), and after a 2 year break, I peaked this season at Diamond 1 75 LP. Compared to season 4, I noticed that Nunu jungle is far weaker than it used to be. Counterjungling just isn&#039;t as effective as before due to changes in jungler experience gain as well as the addition of Gromp/Scuttle and the change to Raptor camp that makes Nunu&#039;s single-target counterjungle much worse. \n\nThat said, the long camp respawn times have made it a viable strategy still. The problem is there&#039;s very little time with Nunu&#039;s abysmal clear speeds to counterjungle and clear your own jungle, which is why I&#039;ve started playing Nunu as a support rather than a solo jungler. This lets you keep Nunu&#039;s great counterjungling and insane neutral objective control, while still preserving the map pressure of having a jungler that can actually gank and quickly clear your own jungle. I&#039;ve spent hundreds of hours honing this strategy and have developed it to the point that I feel confident that I can achieve at least Master tier with it.\n\nThe last game of solo queue I played was against Phreak. We won in extremely convincing fashion, the VOD of which can be found on my Twitch page here: \n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/123657437 \n\nThe next afternoon I get an e-mail saying that my account was flagged for manual audit and issued a two week suspension, with the warning that if my account is audited again that the next penalty will be a permaban. In the 4 years I&#039;ve had this account, I&#039;ve never been banned or suspended previously. I try every game I play, even when I have to deal with extremely belligerent teammates.\n\nThe first response I got from Player Support (funny enough, the exact same specialist who handled the similar Singed support case) was a boilerplate saying that I was engaging in &#039;negative behavior&#039; : \n\nhttp://imgur.com/qAjp3bJ .\n\n The follow up explanation is that I was &quot;stealing other people&#039;s roles&quot; and &quot;failing to communicate&quot;:  \nhttp://imgur.com/U8RLyn7 . \n\nSince I queue Support/Jungle, I get Autofill protection, which means that I am guaranteed one of these two roles. As you can see in my match history: https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=take+the+draw I&#039;ve only ever played Ivern Jungle and Support Nunu in my entire two years of play, with the exception of one Veigar game and one Teemo game in which I was in a full premade with friends. Very obviously the specialist is interpreting my Support Nunu with Smite as stealing the Jungle role, despite the contradictory claim that off meta picks were okay. \n\nI&#039;m also not entirely sure where this &quot;failing to communicate&quot; thing is coming from. I have hours of VODs on my Twitch channel dating back to when I first theorycrafted this strategy that you can see here: twitch.tv/itslevi . I type a paragraph long explanation at the beginning of every champion select. I answer questions and give champion recommendations if people ask. I communicate more than almost anyone I&#039;ve played with in game both with pings and chat since working with my team is essential to my strategy&#039;s success. \n\nI compiled data over my last 10 wins and losses (to minimize the effects of correlation), which can be seen here (my na.op.gg is publicly available so anyone can feel free to audit this for accuracy):\n\nhttp://imgur.com/DrT7lFG\n\nAs you can see I place more wards than most of the opponents&#039; supports (and usually in more valuable, deep jungle locations), as well as serving as a kind of mobile ward myself. Quite frankly, I completely dominate neutral objectives, and the counts over my last 10 wins and losses were:\n\n53 Dragons for my team vs 15 for the enemy team\n18 Barons for my team vs 5 for the enemy team\n11 Rift Heralds for my team vs 0 for the enemy team\n\nHow would this be possible if I was &quot;failing to communicate&quot;? The data just doesn&#039;t support that ridiculous claim. Further, the data shows that while my bot lane does tend to do worse than the enemy bot lane playing most of the games 1v2, they&#039;re on average only 5% behind on gold but the enemy jungler is 6% behind. My bot lanes also get solo experience, and my other solo lanes tend to overperform because their lane opponents have to defend against constant invades and they get ganked way less than they would under traditional play.\n\nI&#039;ve worked very hard to develop a strategy that&#039;s viable at high Elo with a champion that&#039;s mostly been forgotten, and Riot has essentially empowered people to reject it just because they don&#039;t want to try anything new.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-08-15T02:38:34.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking necro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enselus","date":"2017-02-26T03:51:26.410+0000","up_votes":335,"down_votes":34,"body":"That guy honestly deserves to be fired","replies":[{"poster":"Take the Draw","date":"2017-02-26T04:09:23.304+0000","up_votes":228,"down_votes":17,"body":"Well, it's a girl, and it IS frustrating she hasn't escalated this ticket (even still) despite multiple requests, even though Riot Gromp said that cases like this could request a full review.\n\nBut the overwhelming majority of her cases probably don't require the level of analysis something like this would.

The case of_ “Unusual Pick that Throws A Game on Its head”_ vs _“The Teammates going WTF Is Going On”_.\n\n[If you’re just tuning in we previously covered this topic with a similar case in December: “Support Singed isn't bannable, but that's not the point”. ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/79aGu3wR-support-singed-isnt-banable-but-thats-not-the-point?comment=006b) \n\nWe feel that the situation between these two edge cases are very similar. But it’s obvious we need to keep updating a few processes to smooth out any rare repeats in the future. And rare is what we’d call this; it’s a very unique edge case that seems to only present itself once every few months among thousands of audits that we process. \n\nLet’s re-iterate our stance from before:\n\n**Q: Can I get banned for choosing a champion or strategy that is outside the current meta?**\n\nA: 100% no. Choosing a champion or strategy outside of the current meta is not a factor we take into account when reviewing accounts. On any given day tens of thousands of players are making unusual picks in the game and they’ll never receive penalties in any form.  \n\n**Q:  So why does this issue keep coming up?  What makes it different?**\n\nA: Riot Gromp said it best in the previous post when they stated: “...common sense and good sportsmanship say that experimenting players need to clearly communicate intent and win conditions to their teammates.” League of Legends is a team game and sometimes the biggest challenge can be coordinating with 4 other strangers who share a common goal; victory. If a player is going to rewrite the rules for the rest of their team then there is more pressure to properly communicate to everyone what they want the plan to be, and what they think everyone should do to achieve it.\n\nBut wait! Communication doesn’t stop after you press the Enter button on your keyboard; and that’s where we saw a problem in this particular case. All of us need to be aware of the difference of communicating “with” someone vs. communicating “at” someone. _Telling your team what you’re going to do and then ignoring them isn’t really working with them it’s holding them hostage_. Telling your team what you want to do and actually working towards a common plan is a central part to playing any team based game.\n\nIn this case what we observed was an expert Nunu counter-jungler throwing the meta on it’s head with a respectable win rate of 53%. While pretty impressive on it’s own, we also found that nearly 50% of their games were reported by teammates as frustrating and unfun. Keep in mind, this isn’t just teammates in losing games, this is teammates across all of his games; victories included.  \n\nThe message was pretty clear to us, this player is serious about_ Making Nunu Great Again_ but they are leaving a trail of dissatisfaction, frustration, and anger in their wake.\n\nWinning is not the end all be all of League. We want players to have fun but not at the expense of teammates. Ideally this means players will coordinate among themselves in a given match and react to the unique circumstances they end up in. If a player is consistently forcing “their vision” on the rest of the team **and **refusing to adapt to their needs we reserve the right to intervene. That’s what happened here (and before with the Singed case); players cried out how terrible the experience was for them and we intervened.\n\nMoving forward we’re going to keep updating our processes for these edge cases. We will still be on the lookout for situations where a player is creating a really negative experience for everyone else and we will intervene when necessary.  In this case it’s undeniable that TakeTheDraw wants to win even if their approach leaves a lot to be desired.  The effects on others in his games were enough for us to lock the account and we stand by that.  But our agents were not properly prepared with a process to handle this edge case when they wrote in and that is on me.  I will be working with the team to clarify an escalation process that emphasizes clearer feedback and opens the door for ban reductions if we believe that someone can make changes to their play style allowing them to continue crushing the meta but not at the expense of their teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-02-28T05:16:33.215+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":178,"body":"Thanks for explaining something from both sides of the argument, and not just a single nuanced view.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2017-02-28T09:30:24.039+0000","up_votes":315,"down_votes":51,"body":"He didn't explain jack.

People hated getting 'abandoned' 1v2 in top lane and there was an enormous amount of rage over it.  Eventually most people realised that while it hurt the player left solo the benefit to the team was significantly greater and it became standard practice and the rage started flowing the opposite direction, when players 'refused' to jungle and came to lane and 'stole' their experience and gold.\n\nI doubt that this strategy will ever become the default meta since it seems like it is an asymmetric approach that leaves both teams worse off if they both try it and the gains are more marginal than jungling produces.  However that doesn't mean that it should be considered unacceptable because another player feels entitled to have a babysitter.  I often wish my jungle would play differently when I'm getting camped and they are accomplishing nothing elsewhere but I don't report them for ruining the game because they aren't my dancing monkey and, while I may disagree with their choices, they have the right to exercise their judgement about how to play the game best.  It is frustrating to have your expectations of how the game will go turned upside down but it shouldn't give you veto power over other players gaming.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2017-02-28T06:35:14.614+0000","up_votes":220,"down_votes":28,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Time Police Ekko","date":"2017-02-28T06:40:30.225+0000","up_votes":130,"down_votes":13,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OMG halp meh plz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=FrILlWp7,comment-id=00f0000c,timestamp=2017-02-28T06:35:14.614+0000)\n\n> Go fuck yourselves, this is a travesty and a rape of justice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yormaughm","date":"2017-02-28T10:47:49.495+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":10,"body":"Everything you said is true.\n\nSo.

The supports dictate 90% of the lane interaction. They harass, they heal, they set up plays, they ward. The ADC plays whack a minion until the support sets a potential play for them to capitalize on.

But you don't punish off meta remember?\n\nAlso it has been mentioned before by riot tantrum that you can never, ever be punished for _not using chat_, do I take that to mean only in game chat then?

Is not hovering your champion Also punishable?\n\n> \n> In this case what we observed was an expert Nunu counter-jungler throwing the meta on it’s head with a respectable win rate of 53%.

Keep in mind, this isn’t just teammates in losing games, this is teammates across all of his games; victories included.  \n> \n> The message was pretty clear to us, this player is serious about_ Making Nunu Great Again_ but they are leaving a trail of dissatisfaction, frustration, and anger in their wake.\n\n> \n> Winning is not the end all be all of League. We want players to have fun but not at the expense of teammates. Ideally this means players will coordinate among themselves in a given match and react to the unique circumstances they end up in. If a player is consistently forcing “their vision” on the rest of the team **and **refusing to adapt to their needs we reserve the right to intervene. That’s what happened here (and before with the Singed case); players cried out how terrible the experience was for them and we intervened.\n\nIf you would clearly state that off-meta play like this is not punishable or reportable, then there wouldn't be any grief or frustration because players would know to adapt to each other when these things happen, instead of trying to force everyone into one meta box. This is like if you are invited to a costume party and when you arrive, a handful of partygoers tell you they hate your costume. You ignore them and keep partying. You come across some people that love your costume; others are in-different. After a while you're asked by the host to leave, and when you ask why, you're told \"because some other people complained that your costume didn't match theirs and they didn't like it\". You mention that the party is not a themed costume event, and the host agrees with you, but still kicks you out.\n\nHow is that in any way fair?\n****\n> \n> Moving forward we’re going to keep updating our processes for these edge cases. We will still be on the lookout for situations where a player is creating a really negative experience for everyone else and we will intervene when necessary.  In this case it’s undeniable that TakeTheDraw wants to win even if their approach leaves a lot to be desired.  The effects on others in his games were enough for us to lock the account and we stand by that.  But our agents were not properly prepared with a process to handle this edge case when they wrote in and that is on me.  I will be working with the team to clarify an escalation process that emphasizes clearer feedback and opens the door for ban reductions if we believe that someone can make changes to their play style allowing them to continue crushing the meta but not at the expense of their teammates.\n\nExplain to us why on your support portal page for what is reportable, you quite literally have it stating that \"tactical disagreements should never be reportable\". And in the graphic it shows a swain player saying _\"but nunu I wanted you to go support bot!\"_\n\nHow is this player's (tactical) decision any different?\n\nUnless you want to come straight out and tell us that support role _Must only be bot lane_ and you are not allowed to leave that lane, then his decision to roam around the map and put global pressure IS a valid tactical decision and as per your own rules not reportable, therefore any griefing done by other players in reports are INVALID. \n\nYou yourself are on record stating that riot supports innovative meta changing gameplay **_\"even if it ruffles some feathers\"_. **, but what, this case doesn't apply? Sounds hypocritical. \n\nYour problem is you want to appease as many people as possible by being vague and saying yes yes that's ok, but turn around and punish the ones that actually do try to innovate and enjoy the game in different ways.\n\n**_stop trying to appease everyone by being vague; come out and say you either enforce the current meta completely, or you completely embrace any and all creative methods of meta breaking gameplay as long as it's not purposefully losing games._**","replies":[{"poster":"Me0wstic","date":"2017-02-28T09:25:03.127+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":2,"body":"Completely agree! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2017-02-26T03:38:13.761+0000","up_votes":155,"down_votes":9,"body":"My smurf got permabanned for playing cinderhulk nunu top with smite.\n\nIt took me a year to finally get my account back.\n\nThe system is fucked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2017-02-26T01:47:09.995+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":147,"body":">How would this be possible if I was \"failing to communicate\"?

How is that better for anyone?\n\nIn high elo games, players are more open to trading roles and ensuring everyone gets a role they are comfortable in. This isn't 100% guaranteed of course, but it's much better than lower elos where asking for a trade is like asking the sun not to shine in a lot of cases.\n\nIf it comes right down to it, and you believe that you will sabotage your team by playing support in a traditional fashion and they won't trade, then it's probably in everyone's best interest to dodge that champ select. If you're adverse to dodging for moral or ethical or competitive reasons, then it would be of great benefit to become comfortable with a support strat that doesn't require a paragraph of copy/paste before every game.\n\nOr you could premade with an ADC main that doesn't mind being left alone bot.

I assume that, on average, the other 3 players on my team would prefer winning to losing, so it's a utilitarian imperative that I pick the champion and playstyle that gives my team the best chance of winning.
