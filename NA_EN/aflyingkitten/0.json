All props to Riot and their Blitzcrank bot, I got it back within hours!\r\n\r\nHowever, and I have not yet gotten an answer about this from support yet, the person deleted my entire old friends list, and replaced it with a dozen of his own. These are friends i've made over many years of playing league, and i'm kind of bummed out to lose them.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to get a \"Friends history\", or for riot to reset my account to what it was like a few months ago? I don't mind losing the RP and IP he stole too much, that's no big deal, but I can't really replace the friends list I had a great time with.\r\n\r\nHope someone can help!\r\n\r\nTLDR: Account stolen, got it back, want to know how to get friends list back.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-11T18:04:03.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish I had good news to bring you as it really does suck that all your friends were deleted.

Would there be any use in looking into who stole my account on my end? Or should I just not bother. I still have the chat history of the person with his new friends.","replies":[]}]}]}
