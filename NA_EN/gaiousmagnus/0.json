I either lose because my team has a stupid off-meta, or the enemy team has an off-meta and my team doesn&#039;t know how to fight it. I play mid and top and I leave my winning lane to help and all the sudden I&#039;m super negative, and all my LP is gone in a day. Example, I went {{champion:202}} Jhin adc is ranked and I had this wonderful support: {{champion:101}} . He fed 13 kills in 10 minutes. Then I play {{champion:91}} Talon mid. And the enemy support? {{champion:103}} . I was 5/0 in under 10 minutes and had half my build completed when I notice the enemy {{champion:96}} kog&#039;maw is 10/0.

I play support often and having a dope down there with you is absolute hell. But the S7 changes to support (e.g. getting carry mages) is a good evolution for the game. Are there growing pains? Yes. But once we move beyond them it will be a net-gain. \n\n3. People asking for traditional supports are equivalent to asking for traditional gender roles. You don't actually care, you just don't want anyone muscling in on your territory. But I find this to be a very self-centered view of the game. And frankly, in a game that favors adaptability, if the support happened to get some kills, adapt. Or push yourself harder. Don't ask for your support to suck more. \n\n4. The anecdotal evidence you're citing isn't something we can operate on. But what I'd say to you us (and I do this) if the support is the role you find weakest, play it and run the table on people.
