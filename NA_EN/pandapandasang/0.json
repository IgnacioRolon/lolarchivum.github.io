It&#039;s so attempting!!\r\n\r\nI would buy it even if you price it 3250. \r\n\r\nAlso, this skin is genius because the Program series does not yet have a rivalry like the &#039;dragon slayer&#039; and &#039;dragon master/sorceress&#039; in the dragon series. Zyra fits in perfectly with the idea of virus spreading which could be seen as the villain in the program universe. \r\n\r\nSince you have actually made pizza delivering sivir come alive, please also make this one.

The fact that you don't like the skin line is fine as i stated, out of 970 skins no one in the League community can appreciate every skin. It can either be a personal theme mismatch for some or they just don't like the champion in general. I'm not a big fan of Star Guardian skins even though i like the theme. The SG skins look amazing but still, not my cup of tea. And i even bought MF's SG skin from My Shop the last time, simply because it came with a 70% discount. I used to be an MF main so i'd like to get as much of her skins as possible but not going to go out of my way to collect them all immediately.\nThis was basically a bargain deal for a 1350 skin.\n\nI don't like Maokai as a champion at all so i don't care about his skin status in general.\nIf he would suddenly get a skin of 180 or more, why would i care?\nI wouldn't think this was a wasted potential because some champion i don't like is getting a skin and my main isn't because there are Maokai players and enthusiasts who appreciate it.\n\nSo let's say that Zyra gets this skin.\nWhat's the harm for you when you're obviously not going to buy it but someone who'd like it it, would? I play Liss a lot and i own her Program skin. I like all of her skins but Program came from a Hextech Chest and i use it all the time. So you're not forced to spend money on something you don't like or currently need.","replies":[{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2018-03-29T16:15:13.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tomoe Gozen,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=pPBoLA1G,comment-id=000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-29T12:53:13.146+0000)\n>\n> You &quot;don&#x27;t want&quot; one is a strong statement for an opinion.\n> You don&#x27;t get to decide what skins champions get and what don&#x27;t.
