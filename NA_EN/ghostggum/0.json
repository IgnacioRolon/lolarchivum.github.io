I was playing League of Legends and my game lagged. So I went to the settings and turned all my settings back to default. But I didn't realize that default settings were different from the starting settings. My settings are messed up now. If you still don't understand what I'm talking about, then let me explain.\r\n\r\nOnce you download LoL you will have these settings. They are not default settings (I think).\r\n\r\nIs there a way to change the settings back, like to the settings I had when I started playing the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T21:50:23.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What settings specifically are you talking about? If you're talking about your in-game League settings, you can reset those by doing a config reset. \n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"GhostGGum","date":"2017-10-05T05:53:24.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks! it worked!","replies":[]}]}]}
