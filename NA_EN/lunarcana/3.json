A partial bonus is still better than no bonus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tribbles Foxfolk","date":"2020-01-22T00:40:24.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lunarcana,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cXi3Ti7Z,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-21T21:33:54.500+0000)\n>\n> Is it a viable strat to take no starting items and keep your 500 gold for your first back, if you don't lose lane early on?\n\nIn the almost-impossible case that you don't lose lane immediately because of this, it's still not going to be worth it because of how much you're giving up in terms of early-game stats. It's not just that farming is harder, fighting becomes extremely difficult because of the stat advantage your opponents will have, and you'll be mostly dead weight throughout the lane. Without any regen (Pots, Doran's items), you'll easily get pushed out of lane and forced to take an early back, completely defeating the purpose of this.\n\nShort answer: No, not in the slightest. If you really don't want to start with a Doran's item, AD characters can start Longsword + 3 Pots, AP can take Dark Seal + 3, bruisers/tanks can go Rejuv Beads.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2020-01-22T00:29:26.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't want Dorans why not go for long sword + pots or boots + pots or \"crystal item\" + pots or book + pots?
