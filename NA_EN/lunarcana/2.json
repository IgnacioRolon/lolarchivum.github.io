Not because they can't learn the champion, but because they should focus on other concepts first which will benefit them more.\n\nIt kinda goes along with how if someone is high enough, they can play any champion with really whack builds in any position no matter how ridiculous and win, it isn't coming from the champion at that point, but mostly from game knowledge.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ashe mage AD","date":"2019-12-14T20:58:23.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I once played Nami mid into a Nida, each time she'd W aggressively she'd land on a bubble, I killed her like 10 times I swear xDD But anyways, she can't land spears so good in lane and she really won't have priority either cuz she has little wave clear, you'd have to rely more on traps to mark them so you can all in with cougar form but you'd fight in their waves more often then not if you do that.

Canceling animations was only in its infancy at best at that time, which is what she excels at. Beyond that, many champions have in some way had that limited, Nidalee has not. You can literally cancel every single animation she has.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
