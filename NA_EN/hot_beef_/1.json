I can understand ignoring the NALCS as there's zero real \"competition\" there, but from what I can understand her pick/ban rate is around 15% across the rest of the leagues, about the same as things like azir.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2017-02-11T22:26:47.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cancer panther is exactly where she belongs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-02-12T16:46:50.676+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's dissapointing to hear, but I get where you're coming from.\n\nDo you have a concrete direction on where to take Azir in his mini-rework?","replies":[]},{"poster":"4GLTE","date":"2017-02-12T01:25:41.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"and every team that picked Azir I watched lost their games.

And the casters were just trashing how much on how they hate to see Azir in pro play. It got pretty annoying after they said for about the 10th time \"I do not miss Azir in the LCS,\" when I was enjoying all of the awesome plays Bjergsen was making. I also don't think it's an appropriate balance philosophy to say that a champion was picked in pro play and therefore they must be balanced. It should be the champion's performance that matters, not the fact they got picked. For instance, Kindred has been picked on occasion but does she do good? No. She is always dumpstered. Which is exactly the reason she only sees \"fringe\" play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4GLTE","date":"2017-02-12T21:24:46.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Akbg4ffE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-11T21:36:57.354+0000)\n>\n> Nothing currently planned.

Call him Emperor. Watch him be played and watched. And then you leave the champion many are passionate about as the weakest champion in the game for almost a year just because he was performing well.","replies":[{"poster":"Awoof","date":"2017-02-13T10:31:51.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xVnFEmma,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Akbg4ffE,comment-id=00000003,timestamp=2017-02-12T21:24:46.166+0000)\n>\n>  just because he was performing well.\n\nThat's a little bit oversimplified.","replies":[{"poster":"4GLTE","date":"2017-02-13T23:15:53.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were good alternatives at that time too.

There's barely a reason to hit an enemy with it (except maybe negating the last 2 ticks of ignite).\n\nAnd you don't really want to do a Shurima Shuffle rn because that's the death sentence for your ADC more often than not thanks to mobility and burst.","replies":[]}]}]}
