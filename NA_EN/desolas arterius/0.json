I didn't think this many people would comment :D It makes me really happy to hear all your stories and see you talk about your first champions and your current favorites! Thank you again!\n\nI&#039;m very curious to see what everyone&#039;s first champion was, and who their current favorite is now. Did your first champion remain your favorite now? Did they help you get into the game further, or just help you get in initially? Basically, I want hear more about the _why_ you picked them rather than the who.\n\nIf you have more than one favorite that&#039;s okay, though I would at least try to limit it to 5 (one for every position if you want to!)\n\nI always feel that the champions really help bring players into the game more than people realize, and it&#039;s their identities that help us remain interested in the game outside of the gameplay. \n\nFor me, {{champion:37}}  was my first champion I ever played. Funny enough, she still remains my favorite to this day. I pretty much fell in love with her appearance and her old kit when I was first learning about the game, and thanks to her being on sale and the free RP Riot used to give to new players I was able to buy her instantly :D I loved her simple kit because at the time I was utter garbage at the game haha. So the simple to follow, yet tough to master, kit of hers was amazing and I always kept practicing on how to better use her passive to deal the most damage while activating her auras when needed. Her design was lovely old and new, mostly because she resembles Hatsune Miku who I also love so much :P But I just loved how elegant and beautiful she looks. Quiet, polite, almost intoxicating sometimes. (And yes, her tits are fantastic!). Her voice was also great to me. Knowing that only I could hear her kind of made me feel special when I was first playing (as silly as that sounds). I just really connected to her design and haven&#039;t stopped since! \n\nWhile she&#039;s not as strong as she used to be, I do like how her power is in a happy medium at the moment. She isn&#039;t weak, but not overtly strong either. She&#039;s fairly balanced support-wise, but she could use a little tuning (kappa) to her abilities when it comes to her playstyle identity. I do have my gripes on some of her abilities, but overall I still love her and will always try to play her when I can :D\n\nShe&#039;s still my favorite support to play to this day, and I even used to take her mid before her rework (on-hit AP Sona was fun back in the day). I have some other favorites now that I love playing, but she will always remain Number #1 in my heart as my favorite champion ever &lt;3\n\nExtra: I&#039;ve even cosplayed as her because I love her so much :D (though no pics right now because I don&#039;t want people knowing what I look like :P)\n\nPlease let me hear your thoughts on your favorites and your firsts! I absolutely love hearing your stories on why you fell in love with that champion and who your new favorite is and why~","replies":[{"poster":"Cipse","date":"2016-10-29T07:24:36.521+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't remember the first champion I bought but the first champion I played was {{champion:22}} with {{item:3075}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Avios1","date":"2016-10-29T02:39:49.741+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think my first actual Champion was {{champion:11}}.

My brother told me about the game and told me I should try heimerdinger because he thought i was annoying like the donger. I loved watching people walk into my turrets and realise their mistake and I killed them while walking away. I got my first Penta with him my using my ult turret and zhonyas. I also loved his ult and how I could choose which ability to upgrade. I next started playing Shri when I wanted more of a challenge but she wasn't what I was looking for. I liked ahri's mobility but I also didn't like that her mobility was on her ult so I started looking for others. I was thinking about buying azir but after trying him in his free week while he was cool, he doesn't really fit my playstyle. I tried others like ryze, twisted fate, Annie, and Cass. I liked the burst from Annie but i didn't like how straight forward she is. I liked the dps of Cass and ryze but I couldn't do it consistently . Then Viktor was on free week. I really liked his burst and wave clear. I also liked his upgrade on his abilities from the item and his synergy from rylai's. Viktor also got that speed up on his q after the upgrade and I loved how good it was to chase people down. My favorite ability is the lazer and I love to shoot people down with it. And I love his zoning potential with his w. He has my favorite design of machine being perfection and how others are imperfect. It makes me feel supior to them which I like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luigrein","date":"2016-10-29T01:52:08.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First: {{champion:96}}   He will always have a special place in my heart even though I am terrible at ADC now that I'm not playing other people who have no clue what they are doing.\n\nFavorite: {{champion:3}} Bulwark is love.

She still remains one of my favorites, but I'd say my favorite champ overall is Jinx. I love my crazy gunner. I loved her when she was announced. Her personality and abilities are just so nice to use. And that feeling when you snipe someone across the map with her ult is one that you just can't replicate.

My friend made me play the game and showed me some of sp4zie's videos. I was very negative to the game but I tryed it. I played {{champion:22}} because I always liked the archers in games or movies and thought they where cool (didn'd know {{champion:110}} existed at the time). I was an nightelf hunter in WoW and I loved Legolas from Lord of the rings. Then after 3 botgames I got bored of restarting over and over and desited I didn't like LOL. \n\nMidseason 5 about a day after {{champion:245}} release I was bored and downloaded league again. I remember watching the free champion rotation and falling in love with {{champion:29}} theme and looks. I remember {{champion:245}} themesong and  thought his login screen was so cool. In the noob free champion rotation I picked {{champion:11}}. I played yi constantly and really loved his playstyle building {{item:3153}}  and then {{item:3087}} every game. My first buy was {{champion:55}}. I knew she and Yi are both assassins so I bought Kata. I used my Yi build on Kata (xD) and it didnt work that well. Then I bought Yi because he went of the free rotation.\n\nMy favorite champion now is {{champion:48}}. He reminds me alot about playing yi back in the days. Charging at people to smack them with my aa with all my AS from bork. I also love the sustain from his ultimate and his chomp (Q) have a really satisfying sound. It feals so nice when I chomp my enemy and get so much health back and steals their AD. It is also funny to make them smaller with my ulti\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \nMy first games with Trundle I used my master Yi build with the Bork and statick shiv, I played him bot. I didn't know how botlane worked so I played him supporrt built full damage and took all farm and kills to complete my build. I still builds first item bork but now I know its a better idea to go tanky afterwards.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-10-28T22:13:24.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the read!

There was one soldier who could kill them all.  Pantheon, a spartan warrior.  And his kit was pretty perfect for him/me.  I had a bit of lag so no skill shots was a huge plus.  He had no cowardly abilities to run from his enemies.  And while admittedly, when I started playing his E was kind of shit, that got fixed eventually, and it still feels great watching as everyone in front of you just gets shredded.  And his ult was actually global!  That was great to being able to reinforce the line anywhere.  And his design was awesome.  Ok, they for some annoying reason went with 300 style diaper instead of an actually accurate pteruges, but you couldn't really see that from normal view.  The rest was reasonably accurate weapons and armor.  The only other champion like that was Xin Zhao.  \n\nHe's still my main.  I still find him great fun.
