It will be a great idea because Vayne don't have a REAL new skin. What i'm saying is that Vayne had her new skin because SKT T1 won the championship. Vayne's real new skin would be cool because right now even her new skin is not available anymore(the SKT T1).A new skin like this Bat-Vayne skin for 1350 or this Mass Effection for 3250(Ultimate skin like Ezreal)would be great.Sorry for my bad English, but i hope you get what i'm saying.","replies":[{"poster":"Nubeel","date":"2014-07-24T07:31:18.962+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mass Effection Vayne looks fucking epic.\n\n*Gets on my knees* Please Riot, bestow this skin of awesome upon us.","replies":[{"poster":"Kate Kane","date":"2014-07-24T09:48:16.093+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I NEED IT IN MY LIFE","replies":[]},{"poster":"PeeWee23","date":"2014-07-24T07:39:49.135+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll do the same thing.

You want Karma an Ionian, to do the same thing and dress in purple? You don't think that's too reminiscent of another champion?
