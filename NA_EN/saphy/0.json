Starts at 60 FPS and as game progresses it steadily drops down to (NOT JOKING) 1-2 FPS. Only way to fix it is to restart the entire game/client. \n\nAlso alt tab doesn't work. After the game ends, I cannot close the game and have to force quit each time. \n\nThis happens on BOTH my PC and my Mac. I don't use my mac for gaming, but out of desperation I just wanted to play the game. Sadly it happens on there too and I thought switching would help the problem since my computer is so godly atm.\n\nMy PC is a pile of shit but my Mac is brand new high end and shouldn't have any issues. \n\nMac stats:\n\n4 GHz Itel Core i7 \nMemory 32 GB 1867 MHz DDR3\nGraphics: AMD Radeon R9 M395X 4096 MB\n\nFrom research I have done it sounds like it might be 'memory leak' or something on Riot's end.\nAlso I have NO other programs running other than discord, I restart my computer and play when its fresh. My computer does NOT overheat. \n\n\n\nPlease helpppppppp!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Fooleek Return","date":"2017-06-21T12:23:57.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me here.

It might have something to do with your config files, so let's reset those using the steps below. Definitely hit me back if that doesn't help at all.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2017-06-18T19:01:30.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed this is happening to me a lot in Custom Games too...
