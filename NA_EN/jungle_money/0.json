Since patching 6.15, I cannot close past game clients and they slowly stack up the more games I play. Only way to close them is to restart Mac.\r\n\r\nThey cannot be force closed. (Application is not Responding)\r\nThey don't show up on the Activity Monitor.\r\nPrevents the Mac from being shutdown via commands. has to be hard reset.\r\nThis happened immediately after patching 6.15.\r\n\r\nMac OX is fully updated.\r\n\r\nIf I can provide any info please let me know. I'll play a few more games and post another screen cap in a bit.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nForlorn","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T17:49:48.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to look into this and help!

Was about to make a post but this is almost exactly my problem. It gets annoying and makes me not want to play League since it stacks 20 games on my dock.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle Money","date":"2016-08-07T20:03:26.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Porocles  My ticket is still up and the games (ghost clients) are still staying up and cannot be closed in Mac dock. Still prevents me from shutting my mac down without using the force shutdown power button.\n\nWould be great to get some more feedback or a response on my ticket.
