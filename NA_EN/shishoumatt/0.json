More likely various either feeding the enemy team with less Bots or a more easily scripted champion bot(Yi).   Many times you will be playing a full Bot team and there will be 3 of you with two bots on your team.  Those two bots either stand there at base or constantly DC&amp;RC if not feeding.\r\n\r\nThis is especially problematic in the night hours 2300-0400 where you can&#039;t even attempt to play against real people and have an enjoyable time.  Winning or Losing in ARAM or TT when it is all legit people playing gives a sense of joy whether due to victory or wanting to improve/play again to avenge a loss.  When it is people&#039;s Bots ruining the games whether you win or lose there is only a sense of &#039;meh&#039; or rage due to it.\r\n\r\nThis is becoming a serious issue which is turning people away from these modes.  Players can literally spot a Botter before the match begins with their lack of a Keystone icon and the Bear or Rose as their summoner icons.\r\n\r\nI heard a theory that Botting accounts aren&#039;t a priority because of the money gained through purchase of a new Summoner Name/Region once they sale.  But I would just like to enjoy exploring new characters in a scenario that is not Summoner&#039;s Rift.  \r\n\r\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"tribunalisrigged","date":"2017-06-27T06:43:57.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"goodluck bots and scripting make more money than riot does, tencent bought out the remaining shares (of a very profitable company) and the player base tripled in 2 months. There are more bots than people can even fathom and riot is in on it, some of the even talk to you but they sound like cave dwelling mongoloids. You can tell too because when they hit you with a skill shot it always hits dead center, but when it misses it misses by a mile its never a barely hit. You're being used as a social experiment.","replies":[{"poster":"ShishouMatt","date":"2017-06-27T07:00:55.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite is how a Bot Yasuo uses W behind him before my ranged shot even leaves my champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-06-27T10:47:32.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only reason i started playing ranked treeline is because i wanted to go against actual people.  i absolutely hate ranked btw, but its the only mode without this stupid shit going on in it","replies":[{"poster":"ShishouMatt","date":"2017-06-27T13:18:14.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM should have a ranked with 1 reroll a game.
