I had totally forgot I got a chest until we were in the queue. So, naturally I went to go open up my chest. I opened it, got Coral Reef Malphite, eh. While we were still queuing I noticed I had three skins I didn't want, so I went to reroll them all. Butcher Urgot, Veigar's old fashioned type evil skin, and Coral Reef Malphite, as it's doing it's thing, suddenly, \"Your match is ready! Click to accept!\" or whatever it says. Not wanting to be the turd that doesn't accept, I do, not seeing what I had got. I played Teemo, got A for 12/5/1, lame, my friend played Vi and had a decent score, also getting an A, though, neither of us knew our scores because the servers crashed right after it. I had skipped waiting for stats because it was taking so long, I went to finish my Hextech thing, it wasn't loading but I could see Badger Teemo win the background, still wouldn't load, restarted my client, found out it's just the servers. Go to bed, wake up, get on to check my stats, find out the lame stats, but see that none of the three skins I rerolled are there, nor is Badger Teemo. If you have any solutions or suggestions, please tell me. \r\n               \r\n               Thank you!\r\n               -Eevee The Hydra","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T23:41:07.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems your reroll granted you badger Teemo and 100 Essence. Rerolls will automatically unlock the resulting content, so you should be able to see badger Teemo on your summoner profile list of skins for Teemo.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
