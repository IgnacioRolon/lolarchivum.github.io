So me and this other guy went on to forums and found Captainflowers looking to cast some games so we got him!\r\n\r\nI use to buy $20 rp cards for all the people watching and at the end of the tourney we had a prize :)\r\n\r\nI WAS an aweful co-host with captain flowers he always made fun of me but in an encouraging way.\r\n\r\nI went on to riot site and begged them to look at captain flowers! &quot;COME WATCH OUR TOURNY PLEASE we have the best shout caster!&quot;\r\n\r\nThey never came and look and shortly I quit league for year and half ( lost someone close to me and couldn&#039;t handle life very well )|\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I came back to league I wanted to watch LCS again and who do I see? Captain flowers :)\r\n\r\nI am very happy for you bro. I love seeing you on the big screen and even if you don&#039;t remember me I am so happy you worked and continued to work you&#039;re awesome. I also wanted to thank you for being very nice to me while we co casted that tourney I am very shy so he helped me get over my shyness :)\r\n\r\nanyways you probably don&#039;t remember me and people will just laugh at me for being a fan boy but I tried to get riot to notice this amazing caster and year and half later after he worked so hard he got it! \r\n\r\nEnjoy your hard earned career and the best to you buddy!","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainFlowers","date":"2017-04-04T21:47:10.456+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's up Tony! Of course I remember you dude, c'mon! Doing the Eclipse eSports tourneys with you, Wolf, and Fury was one of the first times I actually casted for an audience, even if it was just 8 viewers. Everyone has to start somewhere, and those chaotic games with all the goofy plays, random forfeits, and last minute debates over who was actually going to stream were the starting point for me in my climb through the amateur casting world.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that things got rough for you in your real life, and I hope they've gotten better. I'm glad I could help you get over being shy too. You seemed like a cool guy from the short amount of time we were part of that tourney together, and I never would've guessed you'd be nervous about being on-stream.\n\nI'm glad you're a fan and I'm glad I left enough of a good impression on you that you wanted to reach out like this! Thanks for the shoutout dude, GG!","replies":[{"poster":"awwk","date":"2017-04-05T21:17:44.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"way to make a grown man tear up bro :) Seeing you on the big screen makes me so happy :D You have a HUGE fan base from your hard work and it inspires me to continue on :) Thank you and gl flowers \n\nps\n\nI am really happy you remember :D \n\nKeep up the HYPE bro :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2017-04-02T22:21:16.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the closest thing to an \"MVP candidate\" we have this split is hai (who without him flyquest would totally be winless just like origen), I'd really like to see Captainflowers just be made honorary mvp/rookie of the split. Not only has he made NA far more watchable, but he has done so with an overall weaker \"supporting cast\" (I want to say about 60% of the \"top tier\" english casters are in EU right now). Some people win player awards by carrying their team through tough times. With this in mind, why can't the casters win one for once?","replies":[{"poster":"awwk","date":"2017-04-03T02:44:15.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed man he always brings hype. You should have seen these tournys.. maybe silver and gold maybe 1 plat max? Prob 10 teams... aweful plays but this guy kept everyone so hyped it was amazing! He has def made LCS fun to watch :)","replies":[]}]}]}
