Need answer","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so i play around 70 which is and has always been fine to me. But i 1v1 my  friend all the time whos ping is 20. He destroys me... every single time. we are the same elo and play the same champ but he can always perform ward jumps which feels just unreal fast to me. He laughed and said its cause his ping is 20 so the reaction time is a bit faster.  \r\n\r\nhow is this fair?\r\nwhy does everyone not have this?\r\nRiot makes millions a year.. you wont make a new 5v5 map so can you at least get everyone good ping so we can all pretend it will help our elo?\r\n\r\nHonestly though i want to play at 20 up here in Canaaada.  it kinda crappy when i would like to improve but when you need a min of 30 ping ( unless pro ) to compete in masters+ then whats the point of investing anytime. \r\n\r\n\r\nwill there ever be good ping for us? maybe make a seperate serve and throw all the good pingers on that server so us 70+ can duel it out on the rift .\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T05:47:55.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different players reside in different geolocations and have different network configurations, ISP's, hardware, and network pathing to our servers. This means that someone who lives in Vancouver, BC will typically have a lower latency (ping) to the NA servers than someone who lives in Mexico. I strongly recommend checking out [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aowuBUIX4Wk), which covers ping & latency pretty well and quickly.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"awwk","date":"2017-02-25T15:41:10.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to write me :) and the video helped a lot :) thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
