As a first step, I recommend swapping to smaller resolution especially if you are using 4K which we don't currently support.  You should also check out our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to tune up any drivers or files that might be causing this crash.
