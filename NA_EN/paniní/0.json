At the end game screen it congratulated me on mastery level 5 and then it also congratulated me for getting an S- and receiving a mastery 6 token. However, when I went to check the crafting inventory I did not receive a mastery 6 token. I guess there isn't really a way to \"check\" if I got an S- in my game, but I went 15/4/14 with a 257 cs at 41 minutes. I was wondering if it was a bug in that I shouldn't have received a mastery 6 token or if it is a bug in that my Syndra mastery token wasn't showing up yet. Thank you in advance for the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-19T23:31:46.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked over your account, and first of all congrats on hitting mastery 5! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nFor some clarification, you won't be able to get a mastery 6 token in the same match that ranks you up to mastery 5. Now that you are mastery 5, any more games where you earn an S- or above will give you the tokens.","replies":[{"poster":"Paniní","date":"2017-03-19T23:50:40.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks BroPoro! I understand. I think maybe there might be an error with the mastery congratulating system at the end of the game though. Cause it told me I did. But I don't mind not earning it yet. Just means gotta rank up some more!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Man In Sky","date":"2017-03-19T22:40:45.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk","replies":[]}]}
