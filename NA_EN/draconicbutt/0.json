Besides if you played Nasus all the time you really did just get lucky. If you were playing Top or Mid a counter pick for Nasus should have turned up eventually. You're just really lucky and I want some of that luck so hand some over. There is no way that you can climb out of Bronze with one champ unless you're playing with a team that chooses the same champs that fit into a really awesome team comp that allows you all to win if you're working together otherwise no I don't believe it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zelgoth0002","date":"2016-05-11T17:16:10.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counter picked are not a real thing.  You can beat everyone in lane, some match ups are harder yes, but you can always out play them.  Nasus out scales all of his \"counter picks\".  Even Graves if you don't feed him.\n\nPlus, the other teams are just as bad/unlucky.  You need to keep that in mind.  They are bronze too.  If you know your champion well enough to win 51% of games, you will scale out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Syruponrofls","date":"2016-04-26T23:42:27.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find a champion you like and learn them inside out. spam them over and over again.
