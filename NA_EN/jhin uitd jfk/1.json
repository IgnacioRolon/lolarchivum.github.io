Him being the second champ I considered a main, he is very dear tome. Also the rework was awesome xD I'm glad their keeping the mystical ninja vibe going and hearing that Jhin bears malice against Shen and Zed and wanted to be the one that killed shen's father, it leaves a lot to think about. This just might get me back into reading lore :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2016-02-19T00:20:16.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being neutral in the face of 'evil' isn't balance though. Balance isn't an absence necessarily, it can be holding equal parts of two opposites and using the proper one. Lack of emotions can kill motivations. If someone is 'balanced' in their emotions, how do they decide what to do if there are no emotional pulls towards one action or another?\n\nAlso, what is Shen's job? What does his order balance upon? What's their metric for balance? As it is defined now, it's quite arbitrary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jhin UItd JFK","date":"2016-02-18T22:49:17.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5o0MnvMN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-18T20:03:22.410+0000)\n>\n> Shen, Zed, and Jhin, sitting in a tree.

Thanks for the insight :D\n\nHowever I also have a couple of questions stemming from this: \n\nWhile I do agree that Shen wouldn't look at Zed with any sort of fondness, would he, if the time arised, be required to put aside that feeling of betrayal and \"forgive\" Zed?\n\nAnd what would Zed do if Shen would \"forgive\" him, or if Zed realized he is going down the wrong path? I don't think he'd walk up to Shen with a box of chocolate and flowers, but I feel that Zed would have some way of showing his regret for the things he did.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thund3r Ang3l","date":"2016-02-18T17:53:30.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.
