Take Jhin for example. It&#039;s shown in his story that there can definitely be more to it. It ends with him docking a jetty to Zaun from Ionia to &quot;perform&quot; and mentioned that he had left clues behind to deal with Zed and Shen.\r\n\r\nIn the Burning Tides, after Graves and TF (both heading to Zaun) escape from GP&#039;s execution, the entire city is shown to be in chaos with Miss Fortune attempting to bring peace. At the end, it was shown that not even an exploding ship will stop Gangplank, and is shown in his gameplay update. What happens after this? We know that Gangplank had gotten Illaoi&#039;s blessing of help from a certain tribe. Is there more to this story? How does Gangplank plan to reclaim is throne?\r\n\r\nI suspect that something in Zaun will DEFINITELY happen (Graves, TF, and Jhin in a place with crazy mad science? That can only end in chaos) and include a color story with lore updates to people like Singed and Warwick (which is actually coming soon!!)\r\n\r\nI&#039;d love to see Riot release something like a storybook that features these, or better yet soon comes up with more. What do I know though?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-09-11T22:53:18.607+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"As we release the stories, we also have arcs for the Champs moving forward from them. it's very rare that we do a story with no plans for what comes next and the ones you mention all have arcs that they are a part of.\n\nWe want to get more of it to you with a more consistent cadence, but it is coming.","replies":[{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2016-09-12T04:07:13.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I smell an interesting lore coming up for a certain Zaun champion's update","replies":[]},{"poster":"blackfootedfox","date":"2016-09-12T07:35:59.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:29}} sniffs, is Twitch actually going to get some new lore soon? After reading some of the new shadow isles stuff I'm hoping for something similar.

Their goal right now is to lay the foundation of the lore for future stories & champs. If they focused on following up on stories while much of the lore was in limbo, many champs & regions would be neglected. They can't stick with one or region for too long because they have to go to another region or champ.\n\nOnce Riot finished laying the foundation, they will shift focused on continuing stories & providing them with endings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-09-11T01:59:28.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said they will continue on Graves and TF, Shurima and Shadow Isles. \n\nStories will get continued, but they will take time because it should be fair for other faction fans. \n\nI'm still excited af (sry) for next Shurima story. Shurima will shape Runeterra again because Shurima currently contains the most powerful entities in Valoran. Azir literally has limitless sand soldiers, he doesn't even need a well trained human army.","replies":[]}]}
