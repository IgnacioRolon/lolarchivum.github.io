I&#039;d appreciate it if I could get some more insight into this interaction.\n\nIn fact, this isn't even consistent within Taliyah's kit, either. She loses the passive movement when casting any of her Q,  W, or E abilities, but not when she casts her R. I understand this may be due to the fact that R has no potential to deal damage, but I believe this is very unintuitive and needs more clarification","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2017-01-29T17:26:44.290+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would take a bit of work to add animations of Taliyah casting her spells while rock surfing. But the real question is... why would you need to cast damaging spells if you _weren't_ in combat? \n\nEdit: I don't play Taliyah, but I think the suggestions below about a drive-by would be so cool. Maybe if rock surf slowly fell off after casting an ability, rather than just going away instantly.

It would get you there slightly faster, and also provide worked ground to speed you up on the way back to your lane. \nIt would come at a cost though, because it might be a significant mana investment, and also it would make it harder to then fight in that river because you already worked up all of the ground.\n\nEDIT: also, just to completely answer your post, I don't think they'd have to new animations. For example, recently they changed the mechanic that attacking wards triggers \"in-combat\", so that now it doesn't cancel Mobi boots. This is the one thing that stays consistent with Taliyah's passive. If you attack a ward while rock surfing, it doesn't cancel the passive, and you immediately hop back on the rock after your auto attack animation is complete.

Especially when I use her w.\n\nLet me explain myself. When I play taliyah, I like to use w to clear the last surviving minions of the wave and then I move right away to top or bot lane to gank. However, since the w explodes after 4 seconds. It cancels the passive again if it hits a minion. So if you make the math. it takes 9 seconds for her passive to kick in... By this time, I'm already at destination or almost. So the main purpose of her passive(which is roaming) becomes totally useless.\n\nSo I must agree with this post; a check-up on taliyah passive interaction would be nice, and I dont think it would push her over the line","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSingularity","date":"2017-01-29T23:10:42.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already can imagine how cool it would look - Taliyah surfing while using spells...\n\nThe real question is if the animations could work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-01-29T22:34:02.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her worked ground gives her some movespeed also, so she could cast Q for a little more speed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf76109271","date":"2017-01-29T21:31:45.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you are out of combat but saw an enemy and simply missed your spell.
