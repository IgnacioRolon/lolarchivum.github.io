I&#039;ve played Ezreal several times this patch and each game it feels like he is seriously lacking.\r\n\r\n{{item:3078}} \r\n\r\nWhere to begin? Trinity Force now costs more, gives 5 less AD, 30 less AP, 15% less Attack Speed. The base AD changes on ADCs also hurts Ezreal as you are now losing 20 damage per Trinity Proc. 0.4 AP ratio on Q means you lose an additional 12 damage, and the 30 AP loss affects his other three spells quite noticeably. You want Ezreals to itemize for 40% CDR, but it doesn&#039;t matter because he lost a significant chunk of damage on all his abilities.  We are talking like 50 damage per Mystic Shot here which is at least 10% damage lost, and 20 damage off W, E, R. Let&#039;s move on though shall we?\r\n\r\n{{item:3508}} \r\n\r\nOh boy. This is a noob trap on Ezreal if I ever saw it. Pre 5.22, Essence Reaver was an actually decent Bloodthirster alternative for Ezreal. 10% CDR, 80 AD, lifesteal, and if you landed a Q the mana cost was essentially refunded. Now Essence Reaver has the cost increased dramatically, and lost 15 AD and the lifesteal, in exchange for 20% crit and CDR. This does not benefit Ezreal in the least because you could reach 30% CDR easily with masteries, ER, and Lucidity boots. You free up his Boot choice so I can run Zerkers now but that is a moot point since Trinity lost so much attack speed. The missing Lifesteal hurts Ezreal significantly as well as the fact he only restores mana on crits. I used to have zero mana issues before when purchasing this item, now I&#039;m running dry all the time unless I have an opportunity to auto some minion waves between fights. Essence Reaver was supposed to be good on Ezreal but basically it just pushed Graves and Lucian way over the top while doing nothing for Ezreal.\r\n\r\nThat is not all though. While other ADCs received buffs, Ezreal has longer cooldowns on Q and E, essentially forcing him to go this absolute GARBAGE Essence Reaver + Trinity build so his spells are up as often as they were before the patch. His W is still practically non-existent and at rank 1 usually costs more mana than it does damage. Why did Riot think making Ezreal&#039;s core build more expensive in exchange for some CDR would make him powerful when he has useless, poorly scaling abilities?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m really upset with this patch and it might be enough to turn me off this game completely. This is just one of many things that have pissed me right off about 5.22 but Ezreal was always my favorite ADC and hes even weaker than before now.","replies":[{"poster":"Dehitay","date":"2015-11-16T04:21:56.805+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm honestly surprised at how many people think you're not supposed to autoattack on Ezreal.

Yes, some of them crit, but it's not like they are IE crits until later in the game (and if you rush Trinity IE, where is this AWESOME 40% CDR coming from?) and you don't have Lifesteal until later in the game either.\n\n5.21 Ezreal's auto attacks were more potent on non-crits than they are now with the same items, and his Q W E R all hit at least 10% harder. The 5.22 changes are a sidegrade AT BEST, where if you can safely get several auto attacks off your DPS is the same as before, but at what cost? Weaker spells and more expensive items. 5.22 Ezreal is an all-in on a perfect scenario where the team ignores you while you get several crits off. 5.21 Ezreal could actually function in the real world where 5 people are chasing you down trying to kill you and you have to Q, auto, and E while on the run.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dangopee","date":"2015-11-16T01:20:38.213+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"They should make his Q crit.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-11-16T02:14:17.738+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you crazy?

You no longer need to use Trinity Force anymore. Before this patch, the only real reason why people used Trinity Force on Yasuo was to allow him to get 100% critical strike chance, as you could no longer reach it with just Statikk and Infinity Edge + crit runes, due to the nerf on Infinity Edge. While it is true that Yasuo could benefit from the Phage passive, easily proc Spellblade, and this item was overall good for him, the only real reason to use it was due to the 10% critical strike chance.\n\nBut now with the Statikk Shiv changes, you don't need to use Trinity Force. Infinity Edge is way better, as it doesn't have any wasted stats, has higher AD, and its passive is necessary to compensate for Yasuo's reduced damage on crits. Yasuo doesn't make good use of Trinity Force now that it offers less attack speed and AD. The mana is wasted, the cooldown reduction is of very little use for him, and Yasuo has a poor base attack damage, so he can't deal that much damage with the Spellblade proc.\n\nThis is good for Yasuo because before you needed not only to waste a lot of gold on those stats, but also you couldn't get other stats for a while: armor penetration, lifesteal, etc. Now you can get all those stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2015-11-16T06:06:05.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YumaS2Astral,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JvN1tfim,comment-id=000b0001,timestamp=2015-11-16T06:02:29.898+0000)\n>\n> Speaking of Yasuo, you are better off going for just {{item:3087}} and {{item:3031}} \n> \n> Thanks to the buffs on Statikk Shiv, you can reach 100% critical strike chance with just it and Infinity Edge.

It's also your cheapest waveclear. So against immobile waveclearing mages, especially if they suck at dodging, you max Q.\n\nHowever, against some champs (like yasuo), you can't easily land your Q at all, much less your Q2. Therefore, you max E instead so you can repeatedly E-R them post-6.\n\nYou almost never max W, because you want damage. That'd be like Viktor maxing Gravity Field, or Ziggs maxing Satchel Charge. However, if you're against a lane opponent with a gap-closer and kill pressure (irelia) or if you're getting camped by the enemy jg, you want a point, maybe two, in wall ASAP.\n\n\nLike Gravity Field, Anivia's wall is still a massively impactful ability, late-game. I once won a 45-min game by knocking an out-of-position Tristiana out of her jump, allowing my team to collapse on her. Obviously that's just one game out of millions, but it's an example of how a wall can be impactful.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NostolgicSkies","date":"2015-11-17T01:37:41.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RickSanchez C137,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JvN1tfim,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-11-16T01:40:37.528+0000)\n>\n> thanks for the replies people\n> \n> I just wanted to add that the only games I have had success with Ezreal so far is with a Rageblade / Gunblade build.

Pretty harsh nerf.\n\nYou have no more Lifesteal on these core two items. You have 15% less attack speed and no AP. You gain CDR and crit but at an extremely severe cost. As you said yourself, Ezreal's auto attack DPS isn't very great so the 40% crit doesn't help as much, and with the loss of attack speed and AD, his overall auto attack DPS is much worse than before on non-crits. They gutted everything about him in exchange for crit and CDR, but I was able to reach 30% CDR with TF, ER and Lucidity before, so the CDR is moot, and they ruined Ezreal's AD and Attack Speed so the crits don't make up for the auto attacks being weaker.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2015-11-18T04:31:11.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League logic dictates change will happen if we all pitch in and whine more like this guy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-11-18T04:29:04.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sadly {{champion:81}} wasn't the only adc to get dumpstered this patch {{champion:29}} {{champion:110}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"bourbonowns","date":"2015-11-17T01:19:22.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some PBE changes to other ADCs, but still no word about Ezreal unfortunately.
