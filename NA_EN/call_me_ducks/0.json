The use of homophobic slurs, racial slurs, telling others to kill themselves and hate speech is not tolerated. There is never a good reason to ever use these words.

And their automatic system does not see the reply you used. They do not know the context, as such AI would be really hard to make. Instead they use some kind of word checking, and you saying f6t several times. The problem was quite likely not that phrase, but \"f6t\" on single line alone. It does not check context (previous or next comment), thus it makes false assumption you called somebody else f6t.
