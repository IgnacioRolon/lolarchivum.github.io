Well those people are retarded since IMT literally were all on champs they were comfortable with (except maybe Reignover) and Darshan literally counter picked himself. Also, do you actually fucking expect them to teamfight against a raka, lux, gragas? Fuck no m9, the mere fact that CLG actually somehow got a good split push going against a team of this caliber AFTER getting counter picked as well is fucking insane tbh. And Fiora is only broken is NA apparently since other regions see picks like Quinn as better.

IMT also played that game really well (keeping even despite all the pressure CLG was putting). Between IMT vs C9 and CLG, these games look more like a Season's Semi Final World Championship match than a regular game in NA's Spring LCS regular season.

Fiorra was able to out heal a tower plus poppy or nearly enough to survive 2 towers and a Quin which came out with a tower being destroyed. Fiorra wasn't even hard fed either when she dove on Quin. Its just Fiorra late game is obnoxious and unbalanced. Fiorra was behind Poppy and in the ended decimated Poppy in seconds while still being behind.\n\nAs for Quin and Malphite (tsm,Dig), Malphite is great for the team. TSM lost because they played poorly as a whole not because of a Quin vs Malphite. IMT played poorly(baron) but Lucian wild turtle played well, and Quin didn't feed, he was forsaken via Dyrus treatment that allowed udyr to turn the lane into a constant 2 v 1. They still could have won despite playing poorly(baron). The issue being Fiorra wasn't even that fed. It was absurd. Fiorra wasn't even grouping. Fiorra was constantly split pushing and no one could stop Fiorra due to late game Fiorra deals way to much damage enough to allow Fiorra to dive 2 towers and a Quin who wasn't that far behind.\n\nFiorra only had 4 kills in and Had about 3k more than Quin at the end of the game they both had 4 completed items and boots. Item wise Quin wasn't even that far behind. Kill wise IMT had the slight 1 kill lead but end game there was only a 1.5k gold difference. Wildturtle was pretty big. Fiorra wasn't even grouping and IMT played poorly with that baron call but they never had an answer for Fiorra. Then to top it off Udyr is insane right now. It even caused Runic echoes to get nerfed which will effectively hurt Champions Like fiddlesticks ganking potential.\n\nFiorra wasn't banned and neither was Udyr. They are just way to strong atm. One could say they should have been banned but thats just poor balancing when you have to ban 1+ champion not because they lack synergy for the team but because the numbers are so high they are insane.
