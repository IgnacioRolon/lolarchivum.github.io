Removal may sound like an unpopular opinion in these cases, but it's important to keep in mind that continued support of such items does come at the cost of something else, like creating new items.\n\n1) The reason no one buys Ohmwrecker is because it isn't slot efficient in an end-game 6 item build. ALL the other bruiser items (Randuins, Frozen Heart, Cleaver, fuck even the new items) are slot efficient stat-wise without their passives and actives. Ohmwrecker is not, meaning if you don't actually have a situation pop up where the active is worth it... You just sacrificed a ton of stats for no reason. If you increased its cost and gave it more armor and HP, or even gave it 20% CDR instead of 10% instead, you can bet people would build it because the stats would actually be good. As it is now, it's basically a support item, because you're buying it EXCLUSIVELY for the active, and only supports can afford to sacrifice stats to do that. And supports have better options they can buy to turn a fight, some of which even give auras to their team: {{item:3023}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3060}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3190}} . So why would a support buy Ohmwrecker with all these other better options? And a bruiser never ever will, because the stats suck.\n\n2) Zz'Rot is a great item. The reason it's not used is because it requires a specific laning strategy, and most people don't know how to (or don't want to) change their strategy to use the item properly. I personally LOVE Zz'Rot Garen. If I complete my Zz'Rot with my turret still having 50% or more of its hp, my turret will stand until one of 2 things happen: 1) I intentionally abandon my lane to take other turrets, or 2) I get 3 man ganked. If this item ever gets picked in pro-play, and a pro shows people how to actually use the item, you can BET its pick-rate will skyrocket. Guaranteed. It's an amazing item. Most people just prefer to buy combat stats (AD or AP) to kill their lane opponent. Some people don't like forcing their opponent under their turret by passively pushing, without being able to kill them unless they fuck up (and by fuck up I mean this: they take a ton of minion damage trying to kill you because your Zz'Rot killed all their minions, and yours are still alive). It's the same reason Nasus has a 6% pick-rate, but Riven has a 16% pick-rate: people want to kill shit; they don't want to be a passive asshole all game. That doesn't make it a bad item. It makes it a unique item that fits a specific playstyle. Unlike Ohmwrecker, there are actually people who buy Zz'Rot almost every game, and try to make guides on how to use it and inform the community about how broken it is. But those people aren't pros, so it never catches on. Also, unlike Ohmwrecker, it actually has good stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-09-04T12:54:47.883+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{item:3056}} What if it just gave a automatic +20 MS?\n\n{{item:3512}} Same with this one.\n\nThey both give a weird +20 towards turrets but that's not very useful unless you're near one and... then what?

Not even staying near the turret is useful with either item unless its used but then you wait for a long time for its reactivation.\n\nI'm not sure about Ohmwrecker (since it's a siege weapon), but the current speed bonus on Zz'Rot fits its purpose (splitpushing asshole), and is very easy to utilize.\n\nExample situation:\n\nI'm Garen, and I'm pushing the enemy's inner turret with my Zz'Rot. 3 or 4 people come to stop me. I retreat.\n\nAs long as I make an effort to retreat toward turrets (start my retreat by running toward the enemy's fallen outer turret, and then run toward my outer, inner, and inhibitor turrets) you maintain an almost permanent 20% movespeed bonus. It's actually REALLY really good - IF you're splitpushing. I have outrun so many people by doing this.\n\nLike I said, Zz'Rot changes your ENTIRE playstyle. That's why people don't like it, but also why it's still an amazing item. You don't retreat and take shortcuts through the jungle when you splitpush with Zz'Rot. You run toward the turrets to get your speed boost - and it works. Oh does it ever work. I have had people blow flash and still not get me.\n\n+20 movespeed would actually be a nerf. Like I said, Zz'Rot is actually **_COMPLETELY FINE AS IS._** Once it sees pro-play, people will pick it up. It's kind of a broken item. People just don't know how to use it.\n\nOhmwrecker, on the other hand, is garbage and needs buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-09-04T17:37:12.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make me want to use it now.

(Not global, just nearest ally tower within range.)\n---\n\nI play around with it sometimes when I have some breathing room in my build. It's OK on Rammus, Udyr, Malphite...anyone who can use/abuse the near tower movespeed, and uses the stats well. I feel like I buy it more for the passive and stats than the active. The active is **very** situational. And kind of get the feeling it's never like, you're at shop, thinking \"What do I need?\" AD? AP? Ar? Mr? Hp?\n**OH WAIT, I NEEDA TOWERDIVE, RIGHT NOW...**\n..while I'm in base...\n\nIt's just extremely hard to justify the purchase while you're in base, not knowing if you're going to be in a situation where you need to towerdive soon or not, and even further, a situation where you need to tower dive where deactivating the tower even matters. (Most times, even when I do use the active..I probably wouldn't have died to tower shots anyway. I just come out at 90% hp instead of 75% hp.)\nThere are some times where I think 'I really wish I had Ohmwrecker active right now, that guy would be sooo ded.'\nBut then if you recall, buy it, and get back there..the situation will be long LONG **LONG** gone, probably even if you have baron buffed recall and teleport, it'll still likely pass before you're back with the item.\nAnd not likely to come up again, possibly for the rest of the game.\n\n*BUT* being able to double up on the active, with a defensive option, means you'll be twice as likely to be in a situation where it's usable. While (possibly) not adding a whole lot to the power budget? (Unsure on that..maybe Fortify is insanely strong nowadays..don't know..haven't used it in years....) You could only use one or the other, it'd still go on cooldown, and you'll never be near enough to your own tower and enemy tower to get doubled down on it.\n----\n\nZz'rot Portal on the other hand...I think even a Red said it feels like a win more card, that's not even as good as other win more cards, if it's a viable option, you've probably already won the game.\nPossible fun idea for it-\nAdd brawler minions to it, by way of enchantment (like boots and jungle items)\nPossibly added to {{item:3060}} too.\nNo idea if that would fix anything with it, but it could be fun?\nWould at least let you strategize with it a little bit.

When it first came out I spam purchased that item on tanks, because of how much pushing power those minions had. Then you made it 1 out of every 4 have huge pushing potential (if they survived long enough to use it). I purchased it 2-3 games after that patch, an now I just about don't touch it. \n\nHonestly to put the item in a better spot, you might want to try making every minion strong, give them a little more bulk, but really slow down the rate that they spawn. From there I would just control their spawn rate, if the item seems too weak, speed up the rate, too strong, slow it down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-09-04T17:48:23.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, but I don't believe that's \"too hard for some items to stay\".\nI could make leghty post about items that were unjustly removed/changed, but what's the point...\n\nI'm no LoL expert, but if I was in charge of item reworking I'd openly ask playerbase on what they'd want and how they want it.

It also had the added benefit of not requiring the target to be below a certain % health to activate.  It was sub-par damage wise and in all other aspects besides the healing reduction.  While it's not fun to almost permanently get half the power from your various healing abilities, 4/6 of those champions tend to build tanky which makes morello's almost useless unless your team can focus the tank, which is a terrible idea most of the time, or you somehow solo have enough burst to get them below the 40% in which case the healing reduction is almost redundant.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlkGolem","date":"2015-09-04T14:32:07.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, removing items just because they aren't picked up often isn't a good solution, although that's not really what's happening, the problem is that where there should be several ways to play a champion, they are made up of what stats you build, but there should be multiple ways to play an ap, etc, champion than just tanky, hybrid, ap, etc. It would help to change things so that the same items don't get bought every game as a core item on most of that class, such as Deathcap.
