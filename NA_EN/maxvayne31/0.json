Sometimes, files get jumbled around and assets becomes misplaced. \n\nYou can do so by clicking the [?] in the upper right hand corner of the client. (It's on the same screen as the orange 'launch' button.) You'll then have the option  to repair the client.\n\nHave you verified that the border shows for your friends/allied team? \n\nIf you still are having this issue, especially with your border, please [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4584) so we can take a closer look at your account and make sure the assets were granted.","replies":[{"poster":"dimercy","date":"2015-12-30T05:24:13.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tryed too but didnt fixed look at this plz Riot Kateykhaos: \n1--->\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/b16n6JTB-loading-screen-problem-black-splash-arts\n2--->\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/2BogvV47-black-splash-artno-borders-bug-on-the-loading-screen-still-since-522\n\n\n\nPlease fix it there is alot of peaple whit the same problem the this guys (inclusive me ) plz fix it quickly","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-04T23:10:45.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dimercy,\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't my area of expertise (I'm on the skins team myself), which is why I suggested some of the normal troubleshooting, as well as asking Riot Support for help. \n\nI can pass this on to the team who'd be responsible for this and at least bring it to their attention.
