I've seen abilities go directly through fully formed walls and I've seen WW still catch abilities when Yas casts last moment. In its current state there's no consistency and it just results in praying to RNGesus to save you from a death that should be avoided everytime.\n\nIf Riot intentionally changes the code to make it only block abilities when fully formed, and it made it 100% consistent it would be less annoying, but I think WW would need to travel a shorter distance or travel faster to compensate. If it had to be fully formed with its current travel time then it would be absolutely useless in laning phase and mediocre at best in teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoPaxt","date":"2019-06-24T22:41:30.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"The Windwall starts on the opposite side of the projectile, it should never block it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Avux","date":"2019-06-25T01:39:50.955+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NoPaxt,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AEBIrE8t,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-24T20:05:53.286+0000)\n>\n> What's the bug?

TF players like to fake throw the card by canceling the aa or throwing a wild card because they want u to waste the windwall. The best yasuo players wait for the stun card animation to go off so that they can react by windwalling the projectile. This is a bug and never how windwall has worked or riot would have said something in the patch notes","replies":[]},{"poster":"goodiesohhi","date":"2019-06-25T15:26:50.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NoPaxt,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AEBIrE8t,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-24T20:05:53.286+0000)\n>\n> What's the bug?

When you cast windwall, it's supposed to destroy projectiles that move towards the wall instantly. I looked at the animation and IMO that 100% should have blocked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2019-06-25T07:54:58.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"He finally has counterplay for once.

Improvements to Windwall's duration, width, and/or CD, perhaps, to shift it from a quick-reaction spellshield to more of a fortification thing (a bit like Shen's W)? Or would you rather see a buff to some other part of his kit?","replies":[{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2019-06-25T11:43:58.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Keeping him how he is so he can finally die? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-25T12:08:57.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Support Position,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AEBIrE8t,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2019-06-25T11:43:58.952+0000)\n>\n> Keeping him how he is so he can finally die? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\n\nHe has a ~48% WR. A crippling bug wouldn't stay on without a compensation buff, especially on such a popular champion selling so many skins. Frankly, I think you know perfectly well that a properly-functioning Windwall balanced for quick reactions is much healthier than a version of that spell balanced around such a long arming time. Consider Sivir's E, which activates instantly but only lasts a couple seconds, and compare that to Edge of Night, which takes a full second to activate but lasts 7 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Support Position","date":"2019-06-25T15:21:23.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"He'll be ok.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-25T04:59:25.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/aPnYxE4.gifv (autoplay fail; click through to view)\n\nAlbum with more [here](https://imgur.com/a/ButGNmJ).","replies":[]},{"poster":"14daysuspensionk","date":"2019-06-25T14:57:58.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i think they should keep it, makes him more fair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Padoµch","date":"2019-06-25T07:21:14.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Good, keep it, this champion is overloaded anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2019-06-25T05:45:55.664+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm ok with this, better than ''lulz I threw windwall in the opposite direction of the enemy and blocked their skillshot anyways OuTpLaYeD''","replies":[]}]}
