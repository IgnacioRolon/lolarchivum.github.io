He has a drinking problem.  When he&#039;s sober, he&#039;s a good sportsmanlike player who puts in work.  When he&#039;s inTOXICated, otoh, he feeds, he AFKs, and he acts like a complete jackass to other players in game.  But even more than that, he can&#039;t remember what&#039;s going on from one minute to the next, IRL and in-game.\r\n\r\nI would urge RIOT and/or a third party (preferably run by gamers) to conduct a study on the correlation between alcoholism/drunkenness and toxic behavior in multiplayer video games.  Should that prove positive, I would also urge RIOT to create a report for known drunkenness while playing League.  It might go a long way toward clearing up toxicity in the community.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, folks, try to stay sober while playing League.  It really does require all of your faculties and all of your attention.  Your fellow players will thank you for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-09-25T00:35:50.954+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nothing wrong with some normals/ARAM and a little booze, so long as you're not vomiting or falling over.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T00:40:31.281+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"yea dont wanna get it in your keyboard","replies":[{"poster":"SmileInABox","date":"2016-09-25T01:56:07.894+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gives me shivers just think about it.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T01:57:43.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i have a sealed keyboard ... not for that per say but for spills and dust etc getting into it... also i work as an auto tech sometimes i come home and jump on the computer and i might not have all the grease completely off my hands yet","replies":[{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2016-09-25T05:49:06.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"obviously it's for alone time ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T06:12:48.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well dont want sticky keys either lol \n\nshould we use a black light on your equipment or you gonna freely admit your guilty?","replies":[{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2016-09-25T06:26:36.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like I'm such a filthy casual that I'd get it on my keyboard, I have hands don't I?","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T06:28:45.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how to you type the websites in that you wanna go to ? no one looks at just one thing we have liek 6 windows queued up need some variety lol","replies":[{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2016-09-25T06:34:27.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"one hand on the mouse, other hand on other things, nearby absorbent material available in case of imminent spillage.\n\nI worded that right so that I wouldn't get deleted right?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Not xPeke","date":"2016-09-25T00:04:18.770+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":8,"body":"No.\n\nWhat's next? \nAdd a tired and sleepy report option?\nAdd a just woke up report option?","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2016-09-25T00:14:52.193+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Not Xpeke,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=h0Bf9r1U,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-09-25T00:04:18.770+0000)\n>\n> No.\n> \n> What&#x27;s next? \n> Add a tired and sleepy report option?\n> Add a just woke up report option?\n\nAnd why in the world would those be offensive when those are uncontrollable states while getting high and drunk are completely controllable actions?

But beyond that, I've had intoxicated players who've played well, average, and poorly; and I've had non-intoxicated players who've played well, average, and poorly. The thing is that these substances affect different players in different ways, and when it comes down to it, you're essentially reporting someone for not communicating with the team, leaving the game/AFKing, griefing, verbal abuse, etc., rather than simply being under the influence. \n\nThis is why I'll say that the tools for reporting these players are already available to you; it's just a different approach and methodology to it.
