I imagine it has something to do with how the scripts are coded and how they interface with the game.  Of course, I report such bots, but they keep popping up, anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-26T06:13:11.788+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot bans one type of pattern, the botters/scripters will just switch to a different type.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-01-26T11:50:34.055+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a temporary fix,  doesn't solve anything at it roots. \n\nIf Riot stopped that,  the scripts will just end up cycling words from the dictionary.

They can ban them on a ban wave like normal, but Riot can monitor the botting community easier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NiamhNyx","date":"2019-01-26T05:49:18.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would hate the alt account names i made.","replies":[{"poster":"Austin Covello","date":"2019-01-26T05:53:59.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear that, but play 3 games of Twisted Treeline every day for a month straight.
