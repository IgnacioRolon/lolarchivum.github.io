Since he gains 13 % MS from a rank5 E (20% active minus 7% passive), it takes 2 fat seconds to get back the lost terrain. 2 seconds are a huge window of opportunity in LoL: during that time the enemy can reach reach safe areas (turretz, allied champs, impassable terrain through which they can dash because Mobility) or get in range to kill you. \r\nAnd this is not that cool on a champ that packs only weak soft CC (7 to 25 % slow with passive and R) and a CC immunity skill that self-roots you for a short while. \r\n\r\nP.S. I know he&#039;s getting reworked and I hope they will rework his skills solving these long-term problemz, I&#039;m just wondering wheter Rito gave explanations or not. {{champion:41}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-04T19:25:28.134+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"At a general level we believe cast times that stop a champion's movement are important because they give other players a chance to react to your actions.
