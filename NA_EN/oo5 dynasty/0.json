The Key feature i wanted to point out about it, is the fact that it is solely dependent on syncing with your allies. So You basically are not able to use your own ultimate ability to even help yourself. \nSo in Lane Phase where you can play Galio Mid lane or Top Lane, you might have an enemy champion near death and can not finish them off with your ultimate. But instead you have to wait for your ally to come in range or that champion for you to activate the ult onto them to just to hope to land the smash after the long animation. That is a lot just to even think about just to try and land a killing blow. So I am asking if the galio Ult be allows to at least work for himself. You can not even ult a minion lol.\n\nI just played a game with Galio top and was winning my lane by 20 cs cause his wave clear is amazing, but when i was ganked by the jungler i was not able to use my ultimate to help myself. Did i die to the gank? Yes  Did the other 2 champions use their ults? Yes and i had no ult to answer theirs. \n\nChanges I would like to see to Galios ultimate: Allow him to use the ult on himself at least. Not just uses it on allies. Please and thank you!\n\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/brandon-beck-ceo-riot-games-change-galio-the-colossus-ultimate-ability-in-league-2017?recruiter=457632358&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink","replies":[{"poster":"Aurelion Soul NA","date":"2017-08-09T05:01:10.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the only problem with galio is that u cannot reliably use ur dash as an escape because he goes backwards momentarily.. thats the only really annoying thing about him. It may even be more annoying then gragas hitting minions when you go to use his dash","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-24T01:44:54.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this might feel good in lane this would literally give him his old problem of flashing in to ulti.  No longer would you be required to use it on allys in a teamfight but rather now you can e flash taunt into a massive easy to land aoe knockup.  It probably wouldn't be balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"oO5 Dynasty","date":"2017-03-24T01:55:07.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure the brilliant minds at riot games can give the ult some kind of functions for the champion to use it for himself as well. Im not saying it has to be that big Slam move but i think as of right now, Galio is the only champion in the entire game that can not use his own ultimate for himself. \n\nThat is not balanced also!   \n\nSo I would like to see some how and some way that the champion can use his own Ultimate ability for himself. Their is always a way to balance the game just have to find a way.","replies":[]}]}]}
