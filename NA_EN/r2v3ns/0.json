Putting it bluntly he&#039;s ill fitted for league because he requires too much set-up to get his kit off and when he does he can cc lock people for roughly 4 seconds, but those set-ups are predictable and if his opponents can read him can easily disrupt his engage or more simply move out of the way. Ornn is also completely reliant on his team composition because while he can inflict brittle on his opponents and proc with an AA, his allies can only trigger it if they have cc meaning if his team isn&#039;t cc heavy his brittle is next to pointless since he can&#039;t reliability proc it on each opponent. This then brings to the front that riot has gone too far in the &quot;every champ needs counter play&quot; philosophy by making it so that his pillar take 2 seconds to proc, his E can be disrupted negating all effects, and any kind of cc can stop Ornn form doing his R follow. Riot probably predicted the same result as with Taliyah&#039;s ult that heavily coordinated teams would be able to abuse not only Ornn&#039;s ult but his whole kit. \r\n\r\nAs it stands Ornn is a slow-paced champ that that rewards overly analytical methodical set-ups, both in game play and champ section, and is a strict enabler to CC chains, something Riot has pointedly steered from. \r\n\r\nThere is also the fact that Ornn suffers from the same failing of Singed in the fact that they both want to engage but have completely unreliable means to do so forcing them to build items to make up for this missing link in their kit (why this dota mechanic?). \r\n\r\nMy question is not &quot;why is he so bad?&quot; but &quot;Why was he even made to begin with?&quot; He likes to cc lock people, he relies on items too heavly(for abililites since his scaling is bad), and he&#039;s combotastic with certain team comps. This is like the bread and butter for DoTA 2 hero design, you need at least two of those 3 things.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-09-01T19:42:30.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When will people realize that he isn't meant for primary engage but follow up? He is a supportive champion that wants to make big plays others make EVEN BIGGER.","replies":[{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2017-09-03T19:00:29.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's pretty decent at initiating dives by headbutting a tower or when enemies blob up in tight spots close to walls he can also just knock them up. He can also assist with making catches by slowing enemies with a max range ult. Otherwise the ult is better to counter an engage or follow up.\n\nIts a bit easier to land your combos when enemies engage you and that actually happens quite often because they underestimate his tankiness as well as his dmg. If Ornn is being chased he can very easily Q and then E right when the pillar comes up. (i think they already reduced the time it takes)","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-09-03T22:23:31.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah pretty much. I find Ornn is better at punishing mistakes and making situational picks rather than just brute forcing things like a Galio, or Vi or something would do.","replies":[{"poster":"R2v3ns","date":"2017-09-04T06:29:08.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're basically just admitting that Ornn is a passive tank that can't engage the enemy therefore he has no way to dictate when a fight can happen unless he has an ally. If your opponent underestimated you or made a blatant mistake it's not because you did something right, it's because they did something wrong. There is a deference and no matter what champion you play you should always be able to capitalize on your opponents mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-09-04T19:06:11.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there is a difference between hard, brute force engage and counter engage and general utility. Both of which Ornn offers. People are picking him and playing him like a J4 or Galio or someone with powerful and reliable engage. Ornn doesn't have that because that's not the kind of character he is designed to be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"S0und16","date":"2017-09-01T19:13:07.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"And your point is...? You say he's fit more for dota, but that doesn't mean he doesn't work in LoL. \n\n1. He stun locks the enemy, making them useless for a while. During that time, the enemy's poor team lost some decent dps, depending on who he targets.\n2. He makes his team stronger in the late game with his item upgrades, and who doesn't like that? \n3. He has ridiculous sustain in lane because of his item building passive\n\nHe's a great team player, and LoL has champs all over the board, including there.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-09-01T19:31:49.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. He can stun lock, but his CC is incredibly conditional. He's got unreliable CC that's easy to avoid and negate, effectively making him work incredibly hard to get you to a point of being stun locked. For him to get to that point, he almost always needs some other teammate to engage/land CC for him to follow up with. As a tank, he's supposed to be engaging, not following up on an engage.\n\n3. His item upgrades are marginal at best, and soon won't kick in until he hits 13. They help snowballing teams snowball more. It's like trying to set a fire to a fire - it's more win, and isn't actually offering any edge.\n\n3. He does not have ridiculous sustain in lane because he still needs to base to be able to replenish his own HP/Mana and his refillables. His passive only helps him more late game, when his HP regen/dragon buffs, etc, allow him to not need to return to base so that he can continue roaming. If you try to skimp on going to the base in lane, you get whittled away because his laning mana costs are atrocious and he's incredibly item reliant to be viable in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"S0und16","date":"2017-09-01T19:42:20.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 - In the midst of a team fight, when everyone is trying to focus the ADC/Midlane, nobody would notice that he's there until he summons his ram.\n\n\n2 - That's true, you got me there. However better items are better items, especially since there's nearly always a cap on how strong a team can get.\n\n\n3 - I was talking more about his items. He could, in theory, never need to go back to base. I don't know wtf Ornn is supposed to build, but if he gets an eternity item, or mana/health regen, he could outlast his opponent and get some CS on them.","replies":[{"poster":"R2v3ns","date":"2017-09-03T18:37:07.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. In order to get the most out of your ult you need to be in the back so you can summon it on top the team. If you try to summon in while fighting you'll get distracted or cc'd and wont' be able to do his follow up. They also can just ignore him since his damage is low and if they position correctly can easily avoid his cc, since it requires set-up even with his q. \n\n2. His passive is a fun gimmick and the only league design thing about him. If the masterworks had give more abilities then I can see them working, but as it stands it would work better in a game where your inventory was constantly loaded up and would want to use that 1000 gold on a sudden power spike. In other words dota2. \n\n3. League doesn't have sustain items. If you think it does then I don't know what to tell you, except do research into other games about lane sustain in itemization.\n\nIf they wanted Ornn to actually work in League they need to make his e unstopable, lower the spawn time on his pillar, and make it so his R follow up can't be disrupted. It doesn't make sense that he has huge tells and indicators only for him to be cc'd out of his ability. I get them just avoiding it since there is some many mobility spells in this game but for him to also be shut down by a single cc spell is awestriking. I have played enough of dota2 to know that mobility isn't king. It is cc. In league mobility is king since you can use it to avoid nearly anything in the game since they did away with most of the point and click abilities. I mean the reason people hate teemo is because he's one of the only carries left with a point and click cc effect. Anyway to avoid just repeating my original post. They just simply should not have bothered with Ornn unless they were willing to allow some bit of unfun in the game, and by unfun i mean a 7 second, put down your keyboard, stun lock.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2017-09-03T18:52:53.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ornn is fine, learn to play him.

An incredibility late game champ that is team dependent similar to Sejuani but Ornn is unreliable in fitting the general role you would expect him to.","replies":[{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2017-09-03T21:38:06.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder how many games you actually tried Ornn top, because he is really strong in a lot of match ups. You can just walk up and QW + auto attack and you probably win that trade, requires no setup at all.  The pillar also doesn't take that long to pop up and often you can just E into walls or towers/tower ruins, so you just need Q for the slow. When it comes to his ult, it's more about chosing the right timing  and a good situation and not \"setup\". With some cdr you just do rotation after rotation in fights while sticking to your opponents, you also won't have trouble hitting you spells there.","replies":[{"poster":"R2v3ns","date":"2017-09-04T06:23:24.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still avoiding half of my comment, but yes I know how his basic game play style works. The problem with that is he can't control when he engages even with his ult, unlike most tanks. His harass is terrible, and he will lose to all lane bullies just flat out since they have greater sustain and harassment. He will lose to all mobile champs in top as all you need to do is avoid walls and his final gout of breath. If you're laneing against people that are simply letting you walk up to them and just do a lazy combo then they are playing a champ that can't avoid it or they're just bad. Take into account a Darius match up, you can pretend all you want you can trade with him but his early game is just a lot better than yours. All you could do is just burst him while he has heavy sustain damage. If you use your w offensively than that is just a signal to go all in and he will win. Ornn can't deal with juggernauts nor can he deal with mobility. The only time I won lane against a yasuo was b/c he was an idiot that didnt' think to use his e to avoid my w or e, and his w just cancel's out my ult, blatantly no point to play Ornn with a yasuo on the enemy team. \n\nAnd you talking about right timing and a good situation and not a set up is actually why people are saying he is bad. If his ult is only good with perfect timing and situationally then what happens if your opponent never presents the situation because it's easy to avoid. It's not like morgan's ult where you just need to be surrounded by 3 people and you might as well use it b/c it damages and stuns, not much to think about there, they got close enough to you and now you can force them to back off or stick around and get stunned. It's easy to use and it's good no matter what's going. Ornn's ult is requires you to think about if they are positioned, if your team is positioned to follow up, and if you are in the position yourself to actually use the follow - up meaning you may have to stick around to where you started it, and let's say the enemy team just engages you start your ult and dive to the front line to protect you carries, do you follow - up your ult or do you use your w to shield yourself, if you shield yourself why did you even ult? If you know you're going to get hit with a cc when if ult when you know you can't follow up? The point is that you have to consider too much to make this ult work, and the only way to make it most effective is to Ult the team have another ally follow up with a aoe cc to lock them trigger your brittle then use your follow up to lock them further as the rest of your team engages. \n\nThey list Ornn has a vanguard because he's just annoying. If your backline does get dived then Ornn is just as good as Leona to bother and block any aggressor that gets close. I'll admit that Ornn is one of the few top lane tanks that can actually bring a good amount of cc to a fight, but his lack of reliable engage means he has to wait for the fight to come to him and unlike Leona can't actually engage the enemy themselves.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-09-02T08:44:43.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because people complained about how Rito makes broken champs upon release and got splurges of negative reactions about their busted champ, this guy?
