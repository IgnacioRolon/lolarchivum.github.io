Can I submit a support ticket requesting the player's personal identifying information with which to go to police? I mean sure I can submit a report of the behaviour, but we all know it takes a special level of toxicity to hit tribunal. Obviously a ticket to have Riot personally deal with the instance is better, but Riot has one of the worst track records I have ever seen for dealing with cases so extreme that they warrant ticketing Riot to directly intervene in a single incident in addition to a traditional report.\n\nEvery single time some form of harassment has been so severe that it warrants contacting Riot directly, it does not matter the content of the submission directly to Riot, you will always get a cookie cutter response, and this is unacceptable. Sure the cookie cutter response is acceptable when it is a minor thing that will be better handled by Tribunal, but there are cases (most notably when something crosses the line into criminal activity) where it would be far better handled by directly contacting Riot.\n\nTo give you an idea of what happened last night, I picked Swain and called top as second pick in ranked. Immediately after I called top, this guy immediately says something to the effect of \"gg, women can't play in a carry role except support\" and went on a tirade of how I must be bad because he inferred I am female because I have a female sounding name, and how my \"boyfriend\" must have carried me out of bronze (I am a lesbian btw, so references to my \"boyfriend\" are particularly annoying). This guy was either looking to pick a fight, or genuinely doesn't seem to understand that 90% of players of online games with a feminine name are actually men (or at least this was true of WoW back when I played).\n\nFrom there it got worse and lasted the entirety of champ select. I was continually harassed for being a female gamer while he had nothing to go on except my name (because what female gamer in her right mind advertises being a female gamer when it inevitably leads to harrassment). Once game started, he immediately stopped, presumably because it is a well known fact that Tribunal sees in game chat logs, but not pre/post game chat logs.\n\nNow maybe I am not qualified to speak on the issue of when something crosses the line into territory of requiring a report in client to being better handled directly by Riot, but I would think that having spent 4 years studying social psychology would equip me pretty damn well to know when to make that judgment call. The result of being thrown cookie cutter solutions when I make that judgement call is infuriating and insulting. Its good to know that we have something resembling Standard Overseas Customer Support Desk handling these types of complaints. Don't get me wrong, I've submitted a large number of tickets (in my opinion), and most of them are handled excellently, except these ones. Almost every time I submit a player behaviour ticket, my reaction to Riot's response is one of \"Did you even read the fucking message before responing? No? Then go read the fucking message and get back to me after you have done so!\"\n\nThis is one area where it is very obvious Riot has repeatedly fail to meet a minimum standard in customer service, and this needs to be addressed better in the future.\n\nAnd inb4 \"you submit countless player behaviour tickets,\" I have played thousands of games and only ever seen behaviour so extreme that immediate intervention is the best method of handling it a total of 3 times. Statistically speaking, these cases are very rare.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2014-09-15T17:06:59.031+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"> So let's say I have been severely sexually harassed in champ select (pretty damn close to what actually happened)\n\nWrong:\nSexism is not sexual harassment. What happened to you was no worse than racism, or any other form of bigotry exhibited by people online. Not that it's okay, because it isn't, none of those things are - and I appreciate that it seems like a lot more people rally against things like racism while supporting the people that act sexist, and that sucks a lot but don't make it out to be more than it is.\n\n>Can I submit a support ticket requesting the player's personal identifying information with which to go to police? \n\nWrong:\nIt would be massively illegal for Riot to give out personal information to anyone other than the police. Furthermore, bigotry on a personal level is not a crime and giving the police false reports *is*.\n\n> 90% of players of online games with a feminine name are actually men (or at least this was true of WoW back when I played).\n\nWrong:\nSomething like 40% of gamers are women and assuming 90% of those are men in disguise only encourages the sort of behaviour that led you to make this post. Online sexism stems less from actual misogynistic beliefs and more from perfectly normal (albeit reprehensible) \"us vs them\" mentalities and clique-ish exclusionary behaviours that as  a student of psychology you should be familiar with.\n\n> Once game started, he immediately stopped, presumably because it is a well known fact that Tribunal sees in game chat logs, but not pre/post game chat logs.\n\nWrong:\nRiot has always had access to pre/post-game chat logs, and the Tribunal isn't even functioning right now.\n\n> Now maybe I am not qualified to speak on the issue of when something crosses the line into territory of requiring a report in client to being better handled directly by Riot, but I would think that having spent 4 years studying social psychology would equip me pretty damn well to know when to make that judgment call. \n\nWrong:\nThe person in your example was offensive, and is deserving of punishment, but is guilty of the same wrongs as many people that are handled by Riot's player behaviour system without issue. You can look through the red tracker to find many many examples of players that were banned for offensive discriminatory conduct - I will note that I personally haven't seen a case where sexism was the primary issue - but I have faith that Riot's behaviour team takes sexism as seriously as everything else, even if the player base sadly fails to. Particularly since, as I said above, that behaviour is rarely indicative of true misogyny and rather speaks to a generally low quality of character that is prone to such negative behaviour toward anyone with little to no provocation. (E.g. That person would've flamed someone who picked off the meta, someone whose username suggested they were homosexual or of an \"unfavorable\" religious group, etc.)\n\n\nPbbth. Okay. That was a lot of words on how you're wrong, but I do agree with your ideal here, just vehemently disagree with your desired methodology... getting the police involved with a rager in champion select is immature and wrong. You would be diverting police attention from things of true importance, and that's not okay. \n\nNow, while I believe a player like the one you mentioned will absolutely get picked up and punished without your \"more direct\" intervention and Rioters have said that the majority of support ticket based reports that lead to punishment are about players that were already detected by the system and en route to being banned - there are sometimes cases of extreme misconduct that warrant it, and only you can decide when that has become necessary. I encourage you to continue that practice, but have a little more understanding for Riot's support please. Not only are there countless tickets being opened every day, but just as they can't give you someone's personal information without breaking the law, they can't give you details on the discipline of someone else's account. That doesn't mean action isn't taken.","replies":[{"poster":"EMOFRATPARTY","date":"2014-09-15T17:29:32.126+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP laid out her stance, and it's unfortunate to hear what happened to her.

You are misreading what I said. It hearkens back to my days in the World of Warcraft community, where 90% of female characters were played by men, the 30% female user base at the time played male and female characters at a 50/50 rate. At the same time the male user base (about 70% at the time) played female characters 70% of the time and male characters 30% of the time. Together, this made the likelihood of someone playing a character who is male to be about equally likely to be played by a male or female, but female characters were most likely male players.\n\nIn League the stats may be different, I mean you are using a handle rather than an avatar, you do not typically look at a handle as some form of sexy eye candy (which is the main reason for the stats in MMOs of character gender in relation to player gender).\n\nBy no means am I saying that 90% of gamers are men.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2014-09-16T12:12:01.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough - when I played WoW I knew far more women who played female characters than that played male, but I get the impression you might've tried to survey it a bit for a class project perhaps, and if not then it's just my anecdotal evidence vs yours anyway.

And that's the first hit on Google for \"sexual harassment,\" so thousands of people are probably seeing this misinformation every day.\n\nAnd the privacy implications of a private company that has been given the name of a participant providing that name to other people?  That's blatantly illegal!  That'd be like a sports team printing the players' names on the back of their jerseys, or announcing an audience member's name over the loudspeaker.  Shoot, if private companies could just wantonly publish the real names of people who utilize their services, the phone company could just put out a book every year with a list of every subscriber and their address!  Facebook could publish people's real names every time they appeared in a photograph!  Obviously, if RIOT gave one player the registered name of another, it would immediately go to prison.  That would be because RIOT is a bank.  Or .. umm... a hospital.\n\nThe underlying point, that some player behavior issues deserve more than a pat response from RIOT staff, is spot on in my view.

I understand revealing personal information is a no (privacy laws there, even if you wanted to you cannot), but what I really want to get at is that in the cases where something is extreme enough to warrant submitting a ticket to have the situation dealt with specifically, I feel a better job of handling it could be done.\n\nIn particular, the use of a very obvious copypasta cookie cutter response is infuriating and it makes my experience as a player who has experienced special cases of very bad harassment feel invalidated. Its that part about invalidation that needs to change. Every player's experience is important at the very least, and this should feel acknowledged in the response. I understand that sometimes tickets regarding player behaviour can happen and be frivolous, and in these cases a response that is cookie cutter may make sense, and pointing to the report feature can help reduce the amount of frivolous complaints. With severe cases of harassment though, those cookie cutter responses make it feel as though it is being dismissed and not cared about.\n\nA better approach would involve addressing the complaint, showing that you understand a behaviour is unacceptable within the community Riot wishes to foster, and that it will be looked into (assuming it actually will). I understand revealing specific actions taken is a no no, but I am not interested in that anyways, what I am looking for is to be reassured that my actions actually are meaningful and not being dismissed.\n\nA simple \"We understand you have experienced X in a match with the player mentioned in your ticket, we at Riot take cases of X behaviour very seriously and will look into it and act accordingly.\"\n\nEven if you decide not to act, something like that reminds the victim of extreme cases of harassment that they are not alone in dealing with it and that people do care what happens to them.\n\nAnd of course adding the bit reminding that it is generally best to use the report feature isn't necessarily harmful, but its addition needs to be done tactfully so as to not make someone feel worse about an already bad situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Gavran","date":"2014-09-16T12:19:01.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as a small aside, I believe there have been at least two cases where Rioters did involve the police based on the contents of chat logs.
