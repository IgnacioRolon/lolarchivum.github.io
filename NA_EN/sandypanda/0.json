Unfortunately when behind an assassin suffers much worse than a tank jungler or a safer mid lane. Additionally Riot has buffed mid lane mages, and is even changing locket which will push assassins further from the meta. I want to know why the riot balance team is so against assassins being strong? It is much more exciting in solo q to play high risk, high reward champs than to see sejuani, sion, braum in most games, simply because the are easy to play and punish aggression. Particularly in pro play I think this is a huge issue. I used to love pro play, it was extremely exciting watching lee sin and Elise as tier 1 jungles, and seeing zed or ahri in the mid lane. Riot has continually added easy to use, low cd utility items, as well as new tank champions which make these picks less viable. I think the game could be a lot more fun if the balance team increases the strength of assassin items or nerfs some of the utility items instead of buffing mages and the incoming locket changes. I have to say it is much more exciting seeing khazix and rengar in pro, the khazix changes are fantastic. I love what they have done with baron and elder, and think that shorter game times could lead to bloodier games again. I would like to know what others in the community think about the strength or weakness of assassins in the current meta, and what ideas people have to make them stronger whether ad or ap without messing up game balance. I would also like to know if anyone does prefer the current meta jungle champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory97","date":"2018-03-06T00:02:43.313+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":4,"body":"We don't need direct buffs to assassins.

I think the problem with shield/heal supports is it's kind of a catch-all. Make them build specific shield items for specific situations, that way they can't just avoid ALL damage altogether. I like the way Morgana's shield works and feel like it's an extremely healthy way to make a shield. You can't avoid physical damage as Morgana, but you can take way less magical damage. If all shields in the game worked like this(or at least point and click shields that can work on anyone, not saying all self shields should do this as it'd probably dumpster a lot of champions with self shields), it'd be a lot better. Sadly now that I think of it I think only Locket has a shield now. I suppose it could be adaptive like Camille's shield, but based on the first form of damage taken. Perhaps it you're hit by a magic attack, the first hit you take is normal shield damage, but after that it only blocks magic damage, and physical damage will still go through HP bars, and vice versa?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"341123545652","date":"2018-03-06T03:08:44.799+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"We already are in an assassin meta.\n\n{{champion:18}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} \n\n(they just dont have the \"assassin\" tag to trick stupid people)","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-03-06T03:29:34.936+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"they aren't assassins except twitch","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2018-03-06T04:03:17.771+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"---->the joke\n\n---->your head","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-03-06T23:04:21.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, I just didn't find it funny, rather stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2018-03-07T05:28:27.960+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then say \"this joke is overused and not funny anymore\" instead of acting like you didn't get the joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2018-03-07T07:54:13.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So instead of looking like a jackass, you opted into looking stupid?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-03-06T05:44:29.701+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually if you go into the champ store and click on the assassin filter, vayne twitch and even tristana show up there.\n\nEDIT: and lamb.

All you'll ever see mod lane is Zed, Talon, Akali or Ekko becuse they'll be the meta picks to have on your team. Gone will be any thought of having an actual mage anywhere on your team because who wants to wait for all in kill potential for upwards of 2-3 items when you can have that same kill potential much earlier as an assassin. People already complain about the lack of diversity and the rise of snowballing in this game and that would only serve to make it worse. \n\nAssassin mains I get it.
