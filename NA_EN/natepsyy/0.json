Make sure you're running the game as admin and setup the right admin settings following the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions). \n\nIf it never actually works after the repair, it might be worth it to go ahead and run a full reinstall.
