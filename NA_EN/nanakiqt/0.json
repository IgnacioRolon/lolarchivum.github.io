But i thought I would just mention and report that Cassiopia Bot&#039;s build path is completely busted right now. Since the recent mage patch, Cass is no longer able to use boots. But the Bot build path always goes for boots first... leading Cassiopia Bot to never buy any items in a match.\r\nI&#039;m sure Riot is aware of this, but i couldnt find any recent posts about it so I just wanted to make note of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2016-05-17T02:52:30.673+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"items are a crutch","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-05-17T07:12:28.227+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We must let go of our materialistic possessions to reach true enlightenment.","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-05-17T13:18:51.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a shitty {{champion:43}} quote","replies":[{"poster":"Zydron","date":"2016-05-17T15:26:14.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More like{{champion:420}} \n\"It is not about what you have, it is what you can throw away\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SOMalphas","date":"2016-05-17T03:55:00.253+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"She simply MUST have those boots, nothing else will do!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2016-05-17T04:35:02.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Along same line, TT bots can still get boot enchantments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QjTHqo3RTq","date":"2016-05-16T23:34:13.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy god damn that is hilarious","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2016-05-17T15:27:28.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saw a thread about this pretty soon after the rework, but haven't seen anything beyond one redpost saying people would look at it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-05-17T00:20:54.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens!
