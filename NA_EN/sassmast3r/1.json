None of her tails are outlined in black despite my character outline option being on. Not sure if this was intentional to show off the beauty of her tails without character outlines and/because it doesn&#039;t actually look nice with black outlining, but it looks pretty strange without it too.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-30T22:53:19.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FIuffCow - \n\nCharacter inking is a large (and old) system. For some skins, Order of the Lotus Karma, for example, the character inking around the skin isn't the best. Unfortunately, it's not something we have total control over. In order to fix this, we'd need to do a full overhaul of the system, which isn't in the cards at this time. So, while this isn't ideal, it's working as nicely as it can for the time being.","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2016-08-31T03:40:53.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response!
