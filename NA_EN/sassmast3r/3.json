The animation goes to that which she has targeted, and then the AA pauses for around 0.5 seconds. Immediately afterwards it just disappears. I would take a screenshot but a picture obviously wouldn&#039;t actually capture this, and I don&#039;t know how to take video. Sorry!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T21:32:20.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FIuffCow,\n\nThanks for the report!
