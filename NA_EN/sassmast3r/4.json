I recently played vs a Dark Candy Fiddlesticks and his ult was replaced with Surprise Party towards the end of the game. \n(He did the typical 'cast ult as enemy is destroying Nexus' bit. So the end Victory! screen may count as spectator mode)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-10-28T00:30:20.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=rEPP5JU8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-10-26T18:34:19.997+0000)\n>\n> Hey FIuffCow!\n> \n> Thanks for the report!

Sometimes the homeguard effect remains on champs in spectator mode. Also, I notice the Nexus turrets like bug out often. Even in game. Their firing sound will persist even when there are no minions to fire at. Slightly annoying, but it's not too bad to deal with. Just a weird bug that happens often.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-10-24T20:44:49.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a bot game just to test this. \nMine was fine, maybe it's just a one game bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2015-10-24T21:23:25.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind I was spectating, it's entirely possible it's a bug with spectator mode, as there are a ton of those honestly.
