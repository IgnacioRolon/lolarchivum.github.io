Basically, if you activate Oracle&#039;s Lens and it comes in contact with any living thing, that living thing is mimicked in red until Oracle&#039;s Lens is moved off of it.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2015-12-08T05:46:24.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what it does now.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-12-08T19:30:00.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It indeed is supposed to do this if the living thing is unseen by you and persists for a little after you gain vision.
