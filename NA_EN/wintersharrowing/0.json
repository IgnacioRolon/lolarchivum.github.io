I am really really attached to the summoner name. I sent a support ticket to see if I could get the name changed so I can have the name for my new accoint I said I'd even be willing to pay for the name but o was told the name is locked to the account until it is deamed a empty account which would be like 3 years. \nThe account is lost amd will never be played again. I'd even be willing to pay for the name change on the old account just to get the name back. Is there anything that can be done?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-29T18:32:51.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the name was sentimental, but we don't currently honor name changes or swaps on suspended accounts.  The [summoner clean up ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-)protections will apply on any account, so you would need to wait out that timer and take the name.  Sorry!","replies":[{"poster":"WintersHarrowing","date":"2017-11-29T18:42:09.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand. Amd if my math is correct the name will be availible in 2 and 1/2 years. \nAgain I just think its silly that a perma banned account will still have to wait go become \"inactive\" when in fact it has been 100% locked due to the perma ban. Like I can guarentee you no games will be played in that account for 2 1/2 years. \n\nBut anyway, here's to seeing if I'm still playing league in 2 1/2 years to get my name back. Thanks for the notice! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mouse KaBoom","date":"2017-11-29T15:52:29.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are kids man i contact support they got no explanation why they can use bad words like fuck and noob on this side but when we use them ingame 4x we get perma banned not chat restricted.

Account names are non-transferrable - you may only usurp one after time has passed (depending on their summoner level at the time of last activity). This does not change due to a permanent ban, and in fact it would be contrary to the punishment if they let you just take the name back instantly.","replies":[]}]}
