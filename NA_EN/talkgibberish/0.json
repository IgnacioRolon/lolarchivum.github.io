It is up to her trusty side-pixie, Pix, to find her!**\n\nTeaming up with our latest fully &quot;&quot;&quot;certified&quot;&quot;&quot; graduates, Pix is determined to find his friend. Much to the dismay of Professor Rumble, Pix has modified the Command Line to support the totally unscientific element of MAGIC! Its new, untested, and completely unnecessary! One could even say it was a waste of time to even develop it, and try to justify it with some sort of backstory!\n\n\n3 all new command cards, with its own element and scrap ability. Focused on trying to create options with strong reasons to choose or pass on the cards.\n\n\n[Pix-a-port](http://i.imgur.com/D83XDB5.jpg)\nThe New movement card, Pix-a-port allows for the single fastest way to move diagonally, but at the cost of fewer spaces to stomp minions. This card would most likely be played as a one-off when you NEED to move to a specific place. \n_Note, that, unlike other movements, you can&#039;t go a shorter distance if you are blocked. You don&#039;t move at all if it is tier 2, and all the 2 spaces are blocked._\n\nPowerwise, it is a combination of the potential options of Omnistomp, and the total squares moved of Speed, but without the towing or pushing utility of them both.\n\n\n[Dizzy Dance](http://i.imgur.com/vQeK2Fd.jpg)\nNot enough Turn Commands showing up? Why not just BE the turn command for your allies! Very straight forward, but a potential game-changer if you need to get someone out of a jam. \n\nPowerwise, it is closest to the Memory Core, allowing for stronger future turns at the cost of little on-board damage\n\n\n[Pix Duster](http://i.imgur.com/9j84JKh.jpg) \n\nWant confusing card text? Gotchya covered! Basically, its an attempt at Glitterlance in MvM. Deals damage in a line. If any Allies are in that line, do an additional 2 space line out from that ally, in any direction. Confusing and probably needs testing to see if its even worth it, but you can&#039;t test MAGIC! its in the rules.\n\nPowerwise, it is a combo of all the other attack cards. Hitting 3 allies gives you a total of 6 affected spaces (Flamespitter), at its worst it still damages in a line (Ripsaw) , but has large coverage (Hextech Aimbot), assuming you meet the criteria (Chain Lightning). _(Not super happy with how this one turned out)_\n\nAs for the Scrap Mechanic, it is a way to counteract the fact that by adding these cards to your deck, you will have less of a chance to get \"The one you need RIGHT NOW OR ELSE WE LOSE RITO PLZ\" for an extra draw for a random card.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2016-12-17T18:46:25.468+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are really awesome!
