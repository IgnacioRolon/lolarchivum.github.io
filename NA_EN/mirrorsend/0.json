Unlimited at 50mb download speed which I share with 6 other people, so 7 people access it in total. I get ping spikes at random times in most of my games. Some of my games I have a solid 26 ping with some ping spikes. But at other times the ping is consistently spiking and I'd be lucky to get consistent gameplay. The people I share it with don't download, so im assuming these spikes happen because of bandwidth traffic. But I feel like 50mb should be able to handle 7 people. And rarely is everyone using the internet at the same time, so I don't understand what the problem is. I'm just wondering if an ethernet cable would solve this problem. Also if I called bell and asked them to find the source of my packet loss during games, would they be able to test that? I've never disconnected.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T20:17:51.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Switching to a wired ethernet connection would be a good start. WiFi is convenient, but it's prone to issues, especially with games that require a really stable connection such as League. If a wired connection doesn't immediately resolve the issue, I recommend working through the rest of the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change in your latency or stability.","replies":[]}]}
