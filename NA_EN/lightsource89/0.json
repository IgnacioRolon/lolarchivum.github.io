I found out this issue was in part due to a resolution issue in the game's configure file in Riot Games. After adjusting the resolution there to match my screen resolution the game finally loads for me, however I can only run the game in windowed mode. \r\nIf I attempt to make it full screen it takes up the top left part of my screen and the other 3 corners are just hanging around showing me my desktop background, and the game screen is now messed up with the cursor not clicking where it shows it should be. \r\nThere is no remedy to this issue as far as I've been able to find, and it's extremely annoying because until about 2-3 patches ago I was able to play in full screen just fine. \r\nI have attempted to delete, reinstall, and reupdate the game twice now after two different patches and the problem has persisted and I cannot find any info on how to permanently fix the problem so I can once again play normally in full screen mode. \r\n\r\nMy resolution is height=900, width=1600 and I've updated all of my drivers, etc. \r\n\r\nHalp pls!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T22:10:23.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A common solution to permafix this is to ensure your Windows resolution is set to whatever Windows recommends based off your display's *native resolution*. Once you've done that, complete a reset of the config folder with the steps below:\n\nLog into League, then **delete** the folder named 'Config' in the following directory:\n\n>C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nAfter deleting that folder, restart the client, then hop into a custom match to ensure the change went through. Switch to fullscreen to ensure everything works now.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Lightsource89","date":"2016-10-04T03:46:15.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems to have worked Targon, I appreciate the quick reply!\n\nI really wish it would work with my old resolution though, since the recommended one makes everything gigantic on my screen but at least League operates normally now so that's something!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T15:58:12.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What was the recommended resolution compared to your previous resolution you were running before these issues came up?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
