I just thought that placements are quite anger-inducing and probably will raise the blood pressure of many individuals. I propose a small/kinda big change. Instead of counting wins as such a big factor, I believe it should be based on personal performance in general. This being CS, kills, assists, tower assists, pings etc, or something like that. In a game like LoL, all it takes is one troll or idiot to throw an entire game. Placements, being so important, don&#039;t have any second chances. \r\n\r\n     For example, if you are a somewhat skilled player (let&#039;s say, Silver 3/4 worthy), but you get a troll in your first placements, feeders in your second and third, a guy whose Internet &quot;cut out&quot; in your fourth, you have effectively landed yourself in Bronze. But...it wasn&#039;t YOU who crashed the plane! Of course a large majority of the players in Bronze are just &quot;bad,&quot; it&#039;s really unfair to those who are thrown into ELO Hell, and are held down. In my first placements game, I thought I did well in top lane, going positive and helping roam. Then the ADC got angry that Thresh stole one kill, and proceeded to afk for 5 minutes. After that, he/she was basically flaming everyone for whatever reason. Apparently Vayne mains are like that, but it cost us a game (and me 1/10th of my placements.)\r\n\r\n     Anyways, I think that placements should be free of the feeding, trolling, AFKing, flaming shenanigans of a generic MOBA. Give players an actual change to prove themselves!","replies":[{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2016-12-31T01:16:01.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that is right. \n\nI think the better idea is actually having people allowed to be placed higher than where they were last season. \n\nThis encourages less trolling, afking, etc, because of the fact that you can get higher. I was silver 5 last season, and I was there because I climbed to Silver 3 from Bronze 5, but then a bad streak came and I dropped down. Therefore, based on Riot's \"placement\" system, I was automatically designated to get either Bronze 4 or 5. This fact (which I knew) encouraged me to troll with Karthus mid, and go 5/16, and go Singed support and be 4/11. \n\nIf I knew, I could be placed in Silver 1, you'd bet I wouldn't be playing Twisted Fate (I'm horrible with Twisted Fate).","replies":[{"poster":"Pls dont do this","date":"2017-01-01T20:39:51.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making placements consider your personal performance decreases the issues you mentioned even better (in my opinion.) Someone isn't going to troll or afk, regardless of their team, or act ridiculously at something that annoyed them. Why? Because even if their team isn't the best (full o' bonobos), they can still do well. \n\nIn your case, just stop messing with ranked then. Your trolling isn't helping yourself, messing up other people, and is just wasting time. Go try full Atk Spd Twisted Fate in normals or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Incarceration","date":"2017-01-02T02:02:18.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, it would lead to them grabbing everything they could get. If there was a wave down bot that my AD carry needs because he's behind, but I take it because of this system, we may end up losing the game instead of winning if I helped him.\n\nIt didn't matter. They would probably gain the lp anyways.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-12-30T23:23:45.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chance to prove themselves... i believe that's called climbing.","replies":[{"poster":"Pls dont do this","date":"2016-12-30T23:27:37.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda hard to climb outta bronze.

It also depends on how we define 'carry'. I can 'carry' a game. However, if 4 people keep feeding (Yes, some people have bad luck with matchmaking) then you can't carry against a competent team of your skill level.\n\nI'm not going to answer what I meant because I forgot now. I was in a game. lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
