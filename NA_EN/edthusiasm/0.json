Would I get in trouble for elo boosting or anything of the sort since the account was given to me?","replies":[{"poster":"Nazzadan","date":"2015-12-15T18:56:08.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am by no means encouraging you to break the ToS and jeopardize your account, but why would you even ask?  If he retired and was willing to give it to you, and is a FAMILY member, there is no reason to assume action would be taken against you.  It is completely feasible for him, your family member, to be at your house playing on your IP should it ever be investigated.  This really feels like a don't ask don't tell situation.\n\nObviously NOW don't do it","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-15T00:03:15.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mr Zappykins,\n\nSharing accounts is against the ToS and may result in disciplinary action such as bans.
