Nothing else is needed.\n\n{{champion:83}} needs Pool Boy/Pool Cleaner Yorick (pool skimmer instead of shovel). After that, nothing else is needed. \n{{champion:131}} could probably use another skin.\n{{champion:268}} needs the Necromancer skin concept that I've seen in this board. \n{{champion:60}} needs a funny-themed skin. All hers are serious.\n{{champion:150}} will need a new one soon. \n{{champion:143}}'s best skin is SKT Zyra, which is a little bit sad. She needs one that's actually good.\n{{champion:254}} needs a Chroma pack for Neon Strike Vi. I will buy it in a heartbeat. \n{{champion:62}} could use a silly-themed skin as well.\n{{champion:50}} probably needs one. But he needs some updating first.\nAnd I REALLLLLY want {{champion:78}} to get a new skin when she gets updated; I know she most likely won't, but still, I can dream. And I will buy it. \n\nThat's all I have to say about that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-06-12T17:50:18.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:83}}","replies":[{"poster":"jodobo","date":"2015-06-12T23:27:09.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes {{champion:83}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SunflowerQueer","date":"2015-06-13T01:11:02.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shyvana","replies":[{"poster":"Kut Ku","date":"2015-06-18T05:25:54.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"STEEL LEGION SHYVANA!!!!
