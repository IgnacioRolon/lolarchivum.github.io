Counterplay isn't completely reducing risk (even Banshee's veil can be popped early on purpose by the enemy), it's playing around your opponent while they play around you. Like chess, the queen seems overpowered but she can be taken down just like the rest.\n\nEkko can't aim his ult, so he needs to time or position four seconds ahead of time if he wants to use it optimally. A panic ult wastes decent initiation, and a late ult can be pointless. If you don't want to be hit by the ghost, you risk letting him go.
