His point was that nerfing assassins indirectly nerfs mages like ahri that have tons of mobility and can easily juke out keep skill shots (fizz ult) if timed properly. His post never referenced any hatred towards ahri, he just said that \"Why am I not surprised an ahri main is complaining about wanting assassin's nerfed. It's obvious what your agenda is\"\n\nTechnically speaking, there was nothing at all in the post stating that he had any hatred towards ahri. You overreacted to his post and personally, that means that you should grow up and learn to stop jumping to conclusions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-04-19T02:10:56.120+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"#fuckfizz","replies":[]},{"poster":"InHaruhiWeTrust","date":"2016-04-19T20:54:06.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:245}} might be even worse than fizz. since his release he is either never played or absolute cancer. unless riot straight up starts removing things from his kit, i don't think he will ever be balanceable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"billxx","date":"2016-04-19T14:17:21.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, forgive me for not agreeing with everyone else, but I don't see why people hate fizz.
