Yet, after looking up whether I can get banned for using Wooxy, I found:\n--> People saying you can't get banned and that it's absolutely safe.\n--> People saying you have to use it with caution.\n--> People saying they actually DID get banned for using it.\nFrom the stance Riot has, I found this, \"We reserve the right to take action against applications that allow the use of our assets for free (often referred to as skin hacks)\", which was the conclusion of the \"Custom Champion Models and Artwork\" section. I can't make out whether they refer to one's using \"skin hacks\" to unlock existing skins without paying or to custom skins.\nCan we get a clear answer, Riot? Am I allowed to use Wooxy for Project: Riven without the risk of being banned?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2016-09-25T05:58:17.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've read cases where people claim they have been banned for malicious content and 3rd party usage when they're not, and a rioter replied to send a ticket to support.

WOOXY GAVE MY COMPUTER A \"PASSWORD STEALING TROJAN VIRUS\" I went to my computer to see that my account had apperently been signed into another computer, which i would never have a reason to do so... and i decided to do a Malwarebytes scan.. low and behold there it was.. a password stealing trojan in one of my wooxy folders. Do NOT use wooxy, i instantly changed my email and password on my account to be safe and ran multiple other tests. Hopefully I'll be good now. Was pretty scary to know it was wooxy. If you already ahve it installed, id strongly suggest you get rid of that bs.\n\nthanks\nch0mpy","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnarok Alpha","date":"2017-06-21T07:19:14.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you a fool?\nWooxy is totally safe until now.\nAlthough I stopped using it since it's buggy as hell for me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-09-22T19:00:08.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"If a custom skin copies an ACTUAL existing Riot skin, that's a definite punishment, more than likely a permanent suspension.\nIf it's a skin that doesn't copy Riot's skins, it's still a gray area depending on what their system picks up and how the program affects the game client.\n\nIn my opinion.... risking a potential punishment just because you want to use some free skins from a third party program is definitely not even worth the risk. Potentially losing your account and all the runes, rune pages, mastery points, ladder rank, any already owned skins, and unlocked champs just for wanting to use a custom skin doesn't seem worth it at all.","replies":[]}]}
