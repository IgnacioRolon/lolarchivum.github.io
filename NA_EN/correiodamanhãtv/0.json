Run a traceroute to the EUW servers at 185.40.65.1 really quickly using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/). Post the results back here so I can go over it with you and get you pointed in the right direction to fix this!","replies":[{"poster":"CorreioDaManhãTV","date":"2017-11-21T23:10:19.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/AorhwbE","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-22T04:32:29.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, it definitely looks like your connection is hitting a big spike in packet loss before it ever reaches our servers. All of those \"no response from hosts\" are showing 0 in the received column which means 100% packet loss. I'd suggest reaching out to your ISP to see if there are any current ongoing issues that would cause something like this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vayneished","date":"2017-11-20T20:46:47.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello there !
