Every single patch, Ive to come up with a different solution to open my league client, or play w.o crash. Last patch the admin.launcher stopped working for me, and finally Ive worked my way out with Patcher.exe. This patch, I can get into lobby alright, but now crashes after selection. For real riot. When I look to the forums, people used to talk about this same crash around 3 years ago, and until now you didnt fix it. League client is a bigger cancer than the player base for sure. \n\nNow everytime I open the game it says the files are corrupted, but Its a fresh install. Didnt even play once. Ive a stable connection with new dnsflush. No virus or any other 3rd party involved. No lolreplay. I had a razer mouse, unplugged it as well. Tried the repairing, deleting certain files in folders, downloaded a bunch of fix material. and Finally its. Not working ofcourse, because why? I don't know why? Ive never seen a single game crashing this much on any platform. Every patch you bring destroys the game a bit more. I cannot even use standart launchers anymore. IM NOT SUPPOSED TO FIX YOUR PROBLEMS. YOU NEED TO FIX YOUR OWN PROBLEMS SO WE CAN PLAY. We are not somekind of computer techs and we shouldnt be forced to become one. Riot Im sick of sending you my dxidiag you didnt solve a single problem in last 3 years. Please pull your stuff together and start to work on problem.\n\nEdit: Wait this is new. Tried a new fresh reinstall, I cleaned every residue of league from computer and tried to reinstall. Guess what, I downloaded the 29 mb patcher, Chose the space to install. AND CRASH. Wohoooo crashing before installing, this is a new record way to go riot!

There are a lot of potential causes for the issues you've been experiencing, but with more information, I'll be able to work with you on resolving this. \n\nCan you give a more in-depth explanation as to what's happening when your installation is failing? Are you seeing a specific error message? If possible, can you grab a screenshot of what happens and upload it to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) or [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/) and send me the link?
