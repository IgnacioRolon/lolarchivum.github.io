Let me know if you're able to remember the account you had at level 30 and I can check into that one as well.","replies":[{"poster":"s7gny Val","date":"2017-11-15T05:49:53.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remeber everything from my account.

Feel free to reach back out to me here and I can try to help as much as I can, but our agents in account recovery might be able to help a little more than I can here (security reasons and all).
