I will load into a game first 15 seconds are fine and then BOOM, LoLClient.exe has stopped working or whatever the name of the program is. It closes the game and then I have to click reconnect to get back in game, and I can actually play before minions spawn, and I am good for the rest of the game no crashes. It is kind of annoying for this to happen every game. Anyone have any suggestions? {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"RazÃ¸rRay","date":"2016-09-26T06:13:04.267+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"After Windows 10 update on my Alienware Alpha with built-in NVIDIA chip I can no longer load games. It doesn't even make it to the loading screen for me just makes the client disappear then the League logo shortly followed by the client reappearing with bugsplat and reconnect button. After the update though my Alien FX and NVIDIA software didn't seem to be running in the bottom right. So not sure what the issue is but another of my game works fine and everything else seems to be working just fine. I tried a system restore to before the update, but that did not work. I think I may try the previous build feature. Also, repairing and re-installing League did not work either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demacian Saint","date":"2016-09-25T13:55:40.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah can't join at all.

It only happens during that time frame and it has only happened once per game, after which I can play normally.
