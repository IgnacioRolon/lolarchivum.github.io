I've been playing this game for almost 3 years now, and I just want to recap on my side of things.\nWarning: I'm not posting on my main because I transferred to LAN. I'll discuss why later.\n\n**I really, really hope a Rioter reads this. Hopefully someone who's been around long enough to empathize.**\n\nI'm going to cover:\n1. The first 30 levels\n2. Season 2 ranked\n3. My gameplay preferences\n4. How the game has changed\n5. Why I transferred\n6. The death of 3's\n\n\n\n**1. The first 30 levels**\n\nAs I said, I started playing league around 3 years ago. I immediately fell in love with this. It was highly recommended to me by a friend, and I played regularly through level 30. At first, I had absolutely no idea what masteries were or what they did. This is expected of a newcomer, and I eventually figured it out. Runes were an absolute nightmare. I purchased quite a few up until tier 3, and I think I had 1, maybe 2, pages by the time I hit level 30. The rune system is a complete nightmare, but I don't want to discuss that today. \n\nStarting out, I played 5v5 bots like everyone else did. I enjoyed the idea of a big map with mini 1v1's and 2v2's often. The meta was apparent at this point, and mostly enforced. Generally, people played for fun. You took whoever wherever, and just played. I did this for awhile, and then I discovered 3's. 3's became my absolute favorite gameplay mode. For those of you unfamiliar, in Season 2, 3v3 consisted of a jungle above top lane, which housed: dragon, 2x monster camps, and 2x movespeed buff camps, plus between the two lanes we had red buff. Also, WARDS! 3's was seriously a condensed, fast pace 5v5. It was scaled down and had reduced teams. I love the shorter gameplay, the quicker teamfights, and the larger stress on taking control of the map early on.\n\n**2. Season 2 ranked**\n\nUpon hitting level 30, I didn't even own 16 champs. This took me quite some time to achieve. Like I said previously, I was never a big 5's player, but I like partaking in ranked play. Season 2 had the elo system, and I started out in bronze elo. I didn't play much after that, just returned to 3's. What tears me up is that we've seen 1 change to ranked in the **3 years** I've been playing: elo was replaced by divisions. That's it. League is a very popular, very competitive game. Why is everything revolved around Summoner's Rift? Why has there been one change to ranked itself? Sure, we've seen changes to gameplay, changes to strategy, changes to what Summoner's Rift really is, but we've seen no changes to how players progress through the ranking system. We've seen no attempt to have players competitively play anything else. One may argue that we have team 3's, but I'll be honest.. That's a mess, too. I gave team 3's a try, and it didn't work. Every game was against a plat/diamond solo queue trio who had been labeled bronze for provisionals. What if one of my teammates isn't on? What if I want to practice 3's in a competitive, non casual manner? I can't. For some reason, having a 1+1+1, 1+2, or 2+1 ranked queue in 3's has always been too much to ask. We've seen **Summoner's Rift** diversity, but why nothing else?\n\n**3. My gameplay preferences**\n\nNote: All champs were broken in Season 2. I hopped on board right before release Darius/Draven/Diana/Zyra. Katarina, Talon, Fizz, Veigar were all running rampant in every game mode. And you know what? I enjoyed it.\n\nAnyway, maining 3's showed me my love for bruisers. In every game, I thoroughly enjoy tanky DPS characters. Darius and Jax were my biggest mains. You may cry that these champions are broken, but when you're going 1v3 at level 18 and walking out with a triple kill, I guarantee it takes more than spamming skills to do. In 5's I'd always go top, and I found it mostly enjoyable. Even in ranked play, I'd go several consecutive games without having a single gank. I liked having the persistent 1v1, it's mostly about champion knowledge and ability timing. That's what I enjoyed. Sadly, bruisers are hardly viable with this % max hp, hyper hard CC, perma disengage meta. It's not even fun anymore. \n\n**4. How the game has changed**\n\nGoing off my previous point, I've lived through several difficult metas. Season 2 was definitely the bruiser meta. If you were an adc, you fed miserably because you'd just be useless against boots 1 + randuin's (which now, you kill a bruiser with this build before they touch you). Riot worked towards helping out the ADC's and balancing the bruisers. And honestly? They didn't do half bad. In season 3 we had the HP meta. This was annoying. This was when support Volibear had 1k hp at level 1, and could tank your turret while his adc got first blood. People were building warmog's katarina, and I remember double doran + warmog's was the best build possible on zed's early game. I carried countless games with that. Riot deleted Madred's Bloodrazor and introduced Blade of the Ruined King. They nerfed warmog's and the HP meta ceased to exist. Season 4... Season 4 has been my least favorite thus far. Riot completely deleted bruisers from the game, unless they have obnoxious point and click cc, disengage, or sustain. I've regarded Season 4 as the children era. This is when the younger players started hitting level 30, and they're too afraid to fight. Ranged tops started dominating, and every single game is plagued with easy disengage, and any form of hard cc. Basically, Season 4 is home to people who don't want to fight, but just harass from a distance, and run far away when you engage. I fear that Season 5 will be the same thing. \n\n**5. Why I transferred**\n\nI transferred from NA to LAN about 8 months ago. In NA, most every game I played was unbearable. The vast, vast majority of games had a horribly toxic person, or 1-2 people who just weren't at their computer. You guys see it on the forum every day, but after well over 2 years of playing this game, I absolutely could not take it. If I didn't have a game with someone else ruining it, the game itself would be failing. My ping would be persistently doubled, and every other game was DDoS'd. I had enough, and I transferred to LAN. I'm on the east coast, so the ping was cut in half. But the community! They rarely spoke, and I enjoyed 5's (they didn't have 3's at the time) because they just wanted to win instead of rage. That was honestly a very good decision. The server very rarely gave me problems, and the community was enjoyable. I learned a lot of Spanish and made a lot of non-English speaking friends. I'll admit, the November/December timeframe drew a lot more toxicity because of the end of the season, but right now ragers are almost non-existent. \n\n**6. The death of 3's**\n\nThis is my most important, and most sentimental topic. I hope this is taken seriously.\n\nOne thing I forgot to mention was that shortly after hitting level 30s, I came across a duo in 3's. We got stomped and decided to play a second game. The girl in this duo played as much as I did, and it turned out our playstyles were very similar. The main difference was she preferred mages (assassin mages, fizz, leblanc, etc), so our mixed damage was too much for teams to handle. We played, and we played, and we played, until the point where we just considered our games 2v3 because we never needed that third person. If they didn't feed prior to level 6, we generally won. And this is mainly why I am writing this today... She's been my best friend for 2 and a half years, and we've been dating for over 9 months. I've traveled to see her and I drove hundreds of miles while I was out there just to see what things were like. I'll be seeing her again in a couple of months. I just really, really miss the old days. It tears me up that 3's has been sent into oblivion. 3's is the reason I stuck this game out, and I haven't played more than 5 games since July. 3's was my main focus of this game, and I'm incredibly short on reasons why I still play. The Twisted Treeline is no longer a part of this game, and as someone who's played for years, that's something that tears me up. As a 3v3 dedicated player, I have had these things taken away from me:\n\n1. Dragon\n2. Wight buffs\n3. Lizard elder buffs\n4. Monster camps for bonus exp\n5. Laning phase\n6. Wards\n7. An enjoyable gaming experience\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. That's all for today.\n\n**TL;DR Read number 6. Riot, please bring back The Twisted Treeline. You've got the resources, I know you do.**\n\n**Edit: After some discussion, I want to add two basic statements:\n1. The old Twisted Treeline was a miniature, fast paced 5v5. It was condensed and the teams were cut to 3. We used to have 2 buffs, dragon, and jungle with monsters. I'm not sure why it was completely removed.\n2. I feel Riot needs to put more time/effort into all game modes, as opposed to just the one. There's a reason one mode dominates the rest... You've gotta make the modes, you know, playable in order to raise the level of players who enjoy it.**","replies":[{"poster":"177A Bleecker St","date":"2015-03-17T18:17:35.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I probably took the wrong thing from this but how did you get out of the friend zone?

My friends made fun of me for meeting a guy on LoL, but it's certainly not something I regret. We met initially because we had the same stupid sense of humor. That's almost IMPOSSIBLE to do in real life, if you're actually actively looking for an S.O., what with people judging you for how you look. Whether you're too attractive or not attractive enough or don't have the right \"look,\" it's a stupid thing that shouldn't matter as much as it does. It's always better to start off as homies, and with video games, you already have something in common that you can do together from a distance. I don't think I'd do the LDR thing again though.\n\nAnd to answer your question, the MOST IMPORTANT THING is to be yourself. Don't put on a front. Allow her to control the flow of the relationship, because there's this whole stigma of \"creepy guys\" on the internet. If she's interested, she'll make a move. Don't expect it though, because not everybody's looking for a relationship and it might not be a proper match. But you don't have to sit around and wait for her to do something. It's easy to imply that you're interested without \"hitting on\" her. Make her feel special by setting aside time to play with her, or choosing her over other duo partners and groups. Compliment her in a relevant fashion, meaning her sense of humor, gameplay skills and decisions, and the like (keep statements like \"your voice sounds hot\" or \"your giggle is cute\" out of it initially, because it can make some people feel uncomfortable.) Just keep the conversation flowing naturally, like you would on a date kind of. Worst case scenario, you make an awesome friend. And that's really not so bad. \n\nBTW, this advice goes for both genders. The \"slutty internet girl\" stereotype exists for women, like the \"creepy guy\" exists for men. When really, being kind of awkward and lonely and nerdy is not gender-specific. And none of those are even requirements for happening upon a relationship opportunity in an online setting. \n\nSorry for kind of derailing your thread about 3's, but there's just this awkward stigma about relationships in gaming. No, most men and women are not in it to meet members of the opposite sex. But it's just like any other hobby-- things happen, and it's a great thing.","replies":[{"poster":"The Dreadkarp","date":"2015-03-17T18:47:36.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gr8job,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=3wAeFWRQ,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-17T18:40:41.473+0000)\n>\n> The same thing happened to me.

The Twisted Treeline was a game mode in itself, and what it is now is not even remotely similar. I have no idea why the mode was trashed.. Riot could've invested more time into, and made something of it.\n\nFor those that don't know, the old Twisted Treeline had 15-20 minute games (when I duo'd we'd finish about then), or you could stall out to a 35 minute game mode. Players were too busy farming to 3v3 at the inhibitor and take the risk, so the losing team would just farm, farm, and farm until they caught up and could win. So, at the end of season 2 and beginning of season 3, Riot decided to implement the \"Anti-turtling, Anti-snowballing Act\" and thus removed the game. Now, 3's are about who shoves their lane the hardest, forcing a 3v1 in the enemy jungle, giving them complete control of the map.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-03-18T22:30:21.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth, the jungle strategy has been inferior for the past ~3 months.\n\nAnd by the way, I liked that Riot kind of stayed to the \"farm the jungle when you need it\" playstyle by keeping the onhit on **minions** & **jungle** with {{item:3159}} which worked like the old {{item:3106}} .

It's annoying. The only reason I got hooked on this game was 3v3 with dragon, buffs, and a laning phase. Not this \"push for level 2, triple gank bottom\" crap =\\","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Dreadkarp","date":"2015-03-17T22:39:52.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A little bump for visibility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"albert1000000","date":"2015-03-19T03:29:32.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that it is important to realize that Riot is more than just a source of entertainment.
