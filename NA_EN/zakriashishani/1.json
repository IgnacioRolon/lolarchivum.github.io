Since you've made some adjustments to your networks, you may need to readjust your settings and make sure network is strong and stable!  My suggestion would be to go through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune things up and get this resolved.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
