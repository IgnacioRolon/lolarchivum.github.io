I did GP sup for lulz a few times, did surprisingly well with it. I assume you start spellthiefs for the addition poke? \n\nAP Pantheon support is pretty hilarious as well, he has two really high AP ratios nobody expects.

Off Meta supports exsist, but not troll supports. That's because all champions can generally be played in the support role. The most common off meta support that seems like a troll is Teemo. However Teemo, is actually extremely useful with his poke. So no, your suggestion is quite unfair to those who wish to try something new. 2ndly, this would mean that everytime a support picked a support that their AD or their teammates didn't want, they now could get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonfall Saber","date":"2018-03-15T13:38:07.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not about the champion.
