Now it seems like you have to go out of your way to build or spec into attack speed to get it back. Diana has a very low base attack speed as well so building attack speed doesn&#039;t ramp up her attack speed as much as it feels like it should. I don&#039;t like the way her e works with attack speed. I feel like the whole Dianas passive thing is a wasted mechanic woth the current state of the game. In no way am I saying that Diana is weak in fact I think she is rather strong being the only burst assassin left in the game (lol). I guess I just feel like her kit overall right now is lacking what it should be.","replies":[{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-12-08T14:26:19.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like Diana kills me faster than I can blink so why does she need attack speed in this preseason again ?","replies":[{"poster":"Thunderneedle","date":"2017-12-08T14:44:33.455+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To kill you and the support before you can blink","replies":[{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-12-08T22:11:12.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plot twist - I am the support","replies":[{"poster":"hoyohai","date":"2017-12-12T05:57:39.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plot twist - the ADC supports you","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonfall Saber","date":"2017-12-08T21:27:58.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasnt saying she was weak but I am saying that her passive is mostly ingnored for her cureent playstyle","replies":[{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-12-08T22:12:14.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly her and Akali are the same champion, yes they both have their strengths and weaknesses but their playstyle is so similar that they might as well be the same. Imo they both need a rework because said playstyle is cancer inducing. I would very much like for her to be attack speed based, that is so unique and interesting as opposed to \"now I see you - now you dead\".","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-12T06:05:17.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Crystalysk","date":"2017-12-08T14:20:38.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that you gain attack speed everytime you use an ability, also most of Diana mains used to run hybrid pen.

She is a burst mage and you already said it on your post ^^\nPeople used to run attack speed runes for jungle to clear it faster, attack speed for laning is useless since you just poke with Q until you can all in. If you want a bit of extra attack speed to split push then {{item:3115}}  will be the way to go.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonfall Saber","date":"2017-12-09T12:57:35.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea but i feel like if they gave her an attack speed boost she could be a viable top lane pick where the rest of the bruisers are. If I had a say in the way Diana would be changed it would be to remove the E attack speed boost, make every auto deal magic damage and have higher base attack speed, lower Q damage to compensate and make her W a give a small sheild on 3rd auto attack. That would make her a bruiser instead of a burst mage.","replies":[{"poster":"Crystalysk","date":"2017-12-09T13:09:40.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a Diana main and i don't play her much but when i pick her i always enjoy the game and i feel she is pretty strong right now. \n\nThose changes would make her viable more for top than mid. Q is the only early game source of damage she has to poke/farm in lane against ranged champions, lowering damage would make her midlane (95% of midlaners are ranged) really bad. You would also lose her burst potential on top of bad laning phase. \n\nFor top lane it could be great since getting extra damage from every auto and a bit of extra shield could help against melee champions.\n\nBut then again there are plenty of toplaners better than that ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Moonfall Saber","date":"2017-12-09T16:56:26.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Potchikir","date":"2017-12-08T12:54:47.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"she's not that bad curently\ni see people building {{item:3115}}  on her for atk speed","replies":[]}]}
