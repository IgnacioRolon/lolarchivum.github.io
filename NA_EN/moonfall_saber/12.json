There are not enough number nerfs in the world that you could give to make her balanced and still playable; like Yasuo. To make her balanced and fair, you would have to rework her.

In fact, it rather supports the idea of vayne being a noob-friendly adc, because the problem i see with many bad adcs is, that they never commit to a fight. Being the main dps role in the game, there comes a point in the fight, where you just have to go in and hope that your support/team peels for you, but many adcs with long effective range simply wonÂ´t do that, because they are too busy sitting in the backline tickling the enemy with their qs.\n\nso what would I rather have when my adc is inexperienced? An adc like varus that will most certainly miss his ult (skillshot), wonÂ´t commit to a fight and stay back trying to hit his q (also skillshot) or an adc like vayne that canÂ´t wait to jump into 5 people (because they are all a bunch of monkeys trying to get pentas) and just has to keep auto-attacking, since her only skillshot does not even contribute to her dps, while she get shielded and healed and is also invisible half the time. \n\nAnd maybe she overcommits and dies, that happens. But compared to other adcs, who have skillshot or gimmicks that an inexperienced player can fuck up or an experienced enemy can abuse, vayne will have put out way more dps and contributed to the fight a hell of a lot more than any of them, because of how foolproof her kit actually is and how it rewards you for playing hyper-aggressive.\n\npeople still memorize vayne as this high skill ceiling adc, who gets bullied early and has to scale. Who has a tough time in teamfights due to her single target dmg, but all these issues have been solved a long time ago. You donÂ´t have to suffer through a terrible laning phase, when sustain is everywhere and your counters are nowhere to be found. You donÂ´t have to worry about scaling, when lategame begins at 20mins and all your items are buffed and made cheaper and you donÂ´t have to worry about single target dmg when teamfights only last 4 seconds and everyone is one-shotting each other.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-01-21T17:37:14.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Enemy team being monkeys is not a valid reason why Vayne is strong.\nIf Vayne's playstyle dictates that she has to go in and fight while other Marksmen do not (because of the lack of escapes and maneuverability), it stands to reason that Vayne cannot succeed in poking people due to her power all being in her AAs and a steroid ult while others can work with poking first.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2018-01-21T03:04:38.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, and writing effective range you failed to take into account the other things in Vayne's kit that justify the 550 range AND help her mitigate it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Åhunpo","date":"2018-01-21T01:45:03.997+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SooFr0sty,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VrRovT6V,comment-id=000b00000000,timestamp=2018-01-21T01:30:52.727+0000)\n>\n> She is a pure auto attack champion they has 550 attack range.
