No, seriously, throw up your hands and delete this thing.

Basically, in Smite, mages get AP (there called Magical Power) scaling on their basic attacks (not 100% like physical classes do, I think it's around 30%) so they can still hit with _some_ force even when their abilities are on cd.\n\nA couple of good replies on this topic:\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/3TxBAehA-ap-itemization-is-complete-garbage?comment=000c\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/3TxBAehA-ap-itemization-is-complete-garbage?comment=000a","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-08-30T22:41:53.333+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would you be interested in opening a thread for players to provide their ideas for items?

Intended for artillery mages, the tradeoff being if you invest in survivability items you will overcap cdr. \n\n2- add a high flat magic pen items for specializing in damaging squishies\n\n3- to compensate previously said item make void staff % BONUS magic resistance reduced\n\n4- liandry can either be turned into item 2 or kept as %hp damage to help vs tanks, in which case it doesn't need flat pen and needs either more burn damage, an AP scaling or its cost reduced\n\n5- lich needs its mana removed since it seems more intended for assassins and the majority of them has no use for mana. Either reduce its price or add AP\n\n6- remove rilay and balance the champions that need it to function accordingly. \"abuse this guy until he gets that one item or he will abuse you\" it's not a fun interaction and it makes said guy too binary and depending on the item, much like vlad and will of the ancient\n\n7- make a mini deathcap to ease the build path (doesn't need to have the passive, even high AP alone would do since the major problem is the item slots needed to build it, not available late game)\n\n8- add a manaless AP + hp item, intended for beefier mages. The thing should be created with vlad mordekaiser maybe swain and basically whoever likes to be in the middle of the fight in mind but should be inefficient for squishier mages only looking for a defensive option ( so I'm thinking not high AP)\n\n9- I THINK a buff to roa could be ok since it's basically impossible to use the item when games end so shortly and the reward is less than it used to be (but if you have in mind to direct games in being little longer again it might be not needed)\n\n10- if we're about to reach late game again you should address the fact that LOTS of AP has been lost on the way (reduced AP on items removal on blue buff..) so maybe consider rising AP in purely offensive items. If some mages in particular should be a problem with this change rebalance by lowering some of their ratios OR late base damage on abilities, depending if they are meant to be strong late game or not (an Ori should or Syndra should get bases reduced, a Taliyah ratios for example)\n\n11- if the general AP stays the same you may want to look at basically all the roster's scaling since they are designed with almost double the AP in mind (infact I see particular utility kits have more success, as they function even with less AP , like Ori or Taliyah, while more \"carry oriented\" damage wise mages are less impactful in the game).\n\nHope I don't sound like spilling no sense and thanks for your time on hearing us out!

Add on to that, we have must-buy items in morello's and voidstaff if mages actually want to be somewhat relevant in the game.\n\nI think we need to lessen up the restriction by either lowering the time to stack RoA/Tear, increasing AP on certain items or decreasing cost for more build diversity.","replies":[{"poster":"TálØnly","date":"2017-08-30T20:14:51.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":22,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-08-30T20:20:51.748+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"No one said APs are weak.
