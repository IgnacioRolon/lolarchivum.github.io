Nothing super huge, maybe something like 0.065% of Bonus AD per stack. Most AD champions have a base AD of around 90 - 110 by level 18. and most adcs have around 200 - 300 bonus AD by then. If you have 200 BONUS AD, Fervor will deal 104 damage per auto attack at MAX stacks. if you have 300, then it will deal 152. Maybe instead of 0.065 it could be slightly lower, like 0.06. But you understand. At level 18 the base damage for Fervor is around 111.

I feel like I called Garen a tank ._. However bruiser ekko is definitely arguably more balanced than what tank ekko used to be. However being a tank/bruiser is not what Ekko was made to be.

You'd build slightly off damage which is really useful if your team doesn't have enough AP because mid top and jungler all chose AD champs. You don't have to get kills to win. You just have to spend more time in lane as an ADC than your opponent. Kills can quicken the process but it can also cause you to die and miss last hits.

Thunderlords lets you sit back and relax in lane.\n\nCrap, that's what I get for not proofreading. I also capitalize certain words to put an emphasis on them. Anyways how does Thunderlords let you sit back and relax? You need to trade within a 3 second window and against any competent player they won't let you trade for free. Did you also say that the damage from Deathfire is similar to two headshots, or am I reading it wrong? If you're talking about the headshot from the trap itself and Deathfire being the damage of one headshot, then that's completely wrong. 60% of your bonus AD is NOTHING early game. A headshot deals 150% TOTAL AD which scales up. Thats without critting and without factoring in Infinity Edge! 60% bonus AD is NOTHING compared to 150% Total AD and up. Also if you have an AOE spell then Deathfire's damage is cut in half. Correct me if I read it wrong.\n\nAlso about your question I was in a rush and didn't see it, but if you keep autoing your stacks don't fall off. Also I forgot about Varus as he also uses DFT because all the other keystones are bad on him (can't process TLDs easy and stays far back with Q instead of AAing). Anyways, if DFT and TLDs are much better then tell me why pros always use Fervor. Even at half stacks your autos will HEAVILY outdamage every other keystone.\n\nYou play ADC to deal massive sustained damage, not to poke or to burst. That's why Fervor is perfect. If you want to do that play a mid laner.\n\nYes I agree that precision is better than the % pen but that still doesn't excuse tlords high CD. Plus most ADCs always have a target to auto, meaning they stack Fervor relatively easy especially in team fights and they normally have very high attack speed later on in the game. Its not that hard to keep Fervor stacked early in the game. Look at VODs of soloq games and how they trade leading to lots of Fervor stacks. When I all in early I usually have max stacks. 10 - 110 damage on auto attacks (from early to late) is much better than a 25 - 15 second CD burst mastery with good base dmg but terrible scaling and better than a mastery that requires abilities to proc and has a terrible base damage despite ADCs having almost ALL their damage from AAs.\nNo offense but you're Bronze 5 with a 38% win rate. Everyone deserves an opinion but I was wondering as to how anyone can think about DFT being better than Fervor in any situation besides poking. Even then the damage from DFT is VERY NEGLIGIBLE early game.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-08-15T17:30:13.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay so when you get 1 stack which falls off in 6 seconds if you get your second stack before end of the first stack you'll have 2 stacks that wont go back down to 1 until the 2nd stacks timer reaches zero and then the 1st stack will start its falloff timer over at 6 seconds? Is that right?\n\nI don't know why so many pros play with fervor honestly. Maybe because they're under pressure to win and they go with whatever is easiest to use or maybe it's because they like fervor more for their builds because their builds use attack speed and critical? I don't know. You'll have to ask the professionals. professionals don't like to experiment I wouldn't think. After all it is their job to win so whatever gets them that win the fastest with the least difficulty is probably what they do.\n\nfervor lets a marksman (marksman for ADC) get free damage for playing aggressively. Works best on marksmen who already have high attack speed and should be built alongside lifesteal and movement speed to allow auto attack kiting, sustain, and quick escapes because any enemy with armor will cause issues.\n\ndeathfire does a lot of things. It's not one dimensional like fervor. Deathfire for example allows any player to stop their opponent from healing. If you combine deathfire with corrupting potion the sorcery skill double edged sword and natural talent and piercing thoughts instead of battering blows you can do more damage with lets say... Ezreals E which normally doesn't do squat. And losing out on that 7% armor penetration is nothing. If you're buying items like yoomuus and other items that give flat penetration you don't need percent penetration. And vice versa. That goes for runes masteries and item builds. \n\nIt doesn't matter how much armor penetration you have if your abilities are magic based. Lots of marksmen have at least 1 magic damage ability. Now I don't know if lets say... Static shiv or rapid firecannon which both do magic damage gets benefit from the magic penetration. If they do then that's even more reason to consider using the magic percent penetration.\n\nas for why use thunderlords? Thunderlords requires you to sacrifice up front damage potential for flat scaling penetration movement speed biscuits or more damage when solo laning while bards roaming. Mana regen for Lucian extra damage on jhins... Everything with the more damage to low hp enemies. Health and mana on assists and kills providing extra sustain gold in case you miss your last hits cool down so  you can snipe with cait and Ashe more. Every third attack within a cool down range you successfully land on the same enemy champion will grant you a free aoe that does magic to all enemies in the area. A basic attack early game is pretty weak. Maybe 60 hp per shot. So like 10 basic attacks to kill an enemy who isn't fighting back with fervor takes 7 shots depending on criticals and armor penetration. 30% of 75 is about 15 damage. 10% of the 10 you get if you choose natural talent is 1 more. Add the ten per level and at 18 youre doing an aoe of 200 magic damage every 20 seconds just from thunderlords and 1 damage item. So even if your enemies buy armor you'll still have a way to deal reliable sustained damage. \n\nin short what I mean is that while yes fervor allows brain dead monkeys damage output it doesn't mean that it's the end all to every marksman. Twitch comes to mind when thinking about thunderlords. Corki comes to mind when thinking about thunderlords. Kogmaw. \n\nthe way I was imagining the Caitlyn thing was like this caitlyn fires a net from a bush > net hits target > applies deathfire for 4 seconds from net > Caitlyn shoots a headshot from the net > Caitlyn drops a snaptrap at her opponents feet > snaptrap grants another headshot > Caitlyn has 4 basic attack stacks from being in a bush and auto attacks again gaining her last two stacks > opponent starts moving > Caitlyn fires her headshot > if opponent lives Caitlyn can Q applying another deathfire for 2 seconds > if opponent doesn't die Caitlyn can use her R which applies another 4 second deathfire\n\nif it doesn't work that way then explain why so I can get better.\n\njust because I'm bronze doesn't mean I can't be decent at the game. There  are hundreds of reasons why someone might be stuck in a lower bracket and no im not talking about trolls and afkers. Connection is one. PC specs is another. Time is another still. I've had my account since this game was released. I automatically get put into bronze when I qualify because that's where I was when I qualified over 6 years ago and I don't care enough to deal with the rage filled community that digs it's own grave. At least in publics, aram, tree line, and weekend medley I get to play without having to see someone accuse someone of trolling or feeding or seeing gg appear at 30 seconds in the chat log. If you look at my ranked match history you'll see that I have done very well in matches I've won and sometimes even in games I've lost. What you don't see is that I play with frame issues. That I play with connection issues. That my settings have to be on very low because my PC can't handle all of the animations and particle effects so I miss some of the visuals. You don't see that I have trouble distinguishing shades of blue from shades of purple grey and black. What you can see is that I have played just barely over 100 games and I have won 43 of them.  100 games since the season started 5 or so months ago. You can see my builds and my deaths. You can't see the role I was given the compromises that had to take place and the amount of hatred spewed everywhere in chat like a fire hose of sewage.\n\nwhile I admit that I don't know everything about this game and that I'm in no way interested in becoming challenger tier that doesn't automatically mean what I do know is wrong. I may have some incorrect information at times but that doesn't mean I'm unskilled. It means I don't care about this game to stay on top of every little update and detail. This game isn't even my second hobby. Its like the 5th or 6th, but it's free and easy to play and the community is mostly around my age so every few months I come back to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Michael Bacon","date":"2016-08-16T03:25:40.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BLACK REALM GOD,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EzlXpiLG,comment-id=00050000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-15T17:30:13.773+0000)\n>\n> Okay so when you get 1 stack which falls off in 6 seconds if you get your second stack before end of the first stack you&#x27;ll have 2 stacks that wont go back down to 1 until the 2nd stacks timer reaches zero and then the 1st stack will start its falloff timer over at 6 seconds? Is that right?\n> \n> I don&#x27;t know why so many pros play with fervor honestly. Maybe because they&#x27;re under pressure to win and they go with whatever is easiest to use or maybe it&#x27;s because they like fervor more for their builds because their builds use attack speed and critical? I don&#x27;t know. You&#x27;ll have to ask the professionals. professionals don&#x27;t like to experiment I wouldn&#x27;t think. After all it is their job to win so whatever gets them that win the fastest with the least difficulty is probably what they do.\n> \n> fervor lets a marksman (marksman for ADC) get free damage for playing aggressively. Works best on marksmen who already have high attack speed and should be built alongside lifesteal and movement speed to allow auto attack kiting, sustain, and quick escapes because any enemy with armor will cause issues.\n> \n> deathfire does a lot of things. It&#x27;s not one dimensional like fervor. Deathfire for example allows any player to stop their opponent from healing. If you combine deathfire with corrupting potion the sorcery skill double edged sword and natural talent and piercing thoughts instead of battering blows you can do more damage with lets say... Ezreals E which normally doesn&#x27;t do squat. And losing out on that 7% armor penetration is nothing. If you&#x27;re buying items like yoomuus and other items that give flat penetration you don&#x27;t need percent penetration. And vice versa. That goes for runes masteries and item builds. \n> \n> It doesn&#x27;t matter how much armor penetration you have if your abilities are magic based. Lots of marksmen have at least 1 magic damage ability. Now I don&#x27;t know if lets say... Static shiv or rapid firecannon which both do magic damage gets benefit from the magic penetration. If they do then that&#x27;s even more reason to consider using the magic percent penetration.\n> \n> as for why use thunderlords? Thunderlords requires you to sacrifice up front damage potential for flat scaling penetration movement speed biscuits or more damage when solo laning while bards roaming. Mana regen for Lucian extra damage on jhins... Everything with the more damage to low hp enemies. Health and mana on assists and kills providing extra sustain gold in case you miss your last hits cool down so  you can snipe with cait and Ashe more. Every third attack within a cool down range you successfully land on the same enemy champion will grant you a free aoe that does magic to all enemies in the area. A basic attack early game is pretty weak. Maybe 60 hp per shot. So like 10 basic attacks to kill an enemy who isn&#x27;t fighting back with fervor takes 7 shots depending on criticals and armor penetration. 30% of 75 is about 15 damage. 10% of the 10 you get if you choose natural talent is 1 more. Add the ten per level and at 18 youre doing an aoe of 200 magic damage every 20 seconds just from thunderlords and 1 damage item. So even if your enemies buy armor you&#x27;ll still have a way to deal reliable sustained damage. \n> \n> in short what I mean is that while yes fervor allows brain dead monkeys damage output it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s the end all to every marksman. Twitch comes to mind when thinking about thunderlords. Corki comes to mind when thinking about thunderlords. Kogmaw. \n> \n> the way I was imagining the Caitlyn thing was like this caitlyn fires a net from a bush &gt; net hits target &gt; applies deathfire for 4 seconds from net &gt; Caitlyn shoots a headshot from the net &gt; Caitlyn drops a snaptrap at her opponents feet &gt; snaptrap grants another headshot &gt; Caitlyn has 4 basic attack stacks from being in a bush and auto attacks again gaining her last two stacks &gt; opponent starts moving &gt; Caitlyn fires her headshot &gt; if opponent lives Caitlyn can Q applying another deathfire for 2 seconds &gt; if opponent doesn&#x27;t die Caitlyn can use her R which applies another 4 second deathfire\n> \n> if it doesn&#x27;t work that way then explain why so I can get better.\n> \n> just because I&#x27;m bronze doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t be decent at the game. There  are hundreds of reasons why someone might be stuck in a lower bracket and no im not talking about trolls and afkers. Connection is one. PC specs is another. Time is another still. I&#x27;ve had my account since this game was released. I automatically get put into bronze when I qualify because that&#x27;s where I was when I qualified over 6 years ago and I don&#x27;t care enough to deal with the rage filled community that digs it&#x27;s own grave. At least in publics, aram, tree line, and weekend medley I get to play without having to see someone accuse someone of trolling or feeding or seeing gg appear at 30 seconds in the chat log. If you look at my ranked match history you&#x27;ll see that I have done very well in matches I&#x27;ve won and sometimes even in games I&#x27;ve lost. What you don&#x27;t see is that I play with frame issues. That I play with connection issues. That my settings have to be on very low because my PC can&#x27;t handle all of the animations and particle effects so I miss some of the visuals. You don&#x27;t see that I have trouble distinguishing shades of blue from shades of purple grey and black. What you can see is that I have played just barely over 100 games and I have won 43 of them.  100 games since the season started 5 or so months ago. You can see my builds and my deaths. You can&#x27;t see the role I was given the compromises that had to take place and the amount of hatred spewed everywhere in chat like a fire hose of sewage.\n> \n> while I admit that I don&#x27;t know everything about this game and that I&#x27;m in no way interested in becoming challenger tier that doesn&#x27;t automatically mean what I do know is wrong. I may have some incorrect information at times but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m unskilled. It means I don&#x27;t care about this game to stay on top of every little update and detail.

The pros aren't stressed  or under pressure, they use Fervor because it's the BEST keystone for nearly all AD autoattack based champions. Yes pros experiment sometimes but the pros have consistently used Fervor on ADCs for months now. Hell, even Koreans experiment the most and they always take Fervor.\n\nIf anything Deathfire is more brain-dead than Fervor. You use an ability and get free damage after. With Fervor at least there is a stacking mechanic. Also you do know that you have 30 mastery points right? Meaning you can fill one mastery tree and 2/3 of another one? Meaning you don't have to sacrifice all the things in the tree you're not putting your keystone in. And is that tiny bit of extra damage worth it on the Ezreal E? The masteries you listed besides Deathfire can also increase Fervor and AA damage (besides the mpen mastery and sorcery, you can take the armor pen and attk speed instead.) Would you prefer 7% armor pen to increase damage on every auto that can potentially crit dealing 800+ damage? Or do you want the 7% magic pen which will only help a select few abilities that normally have a very long cool down. The armor pen obviously. Plus percent pen is much better vs tanks than flat pen.\n\nYou say that most ADCs have an ability that deals magic damage but I'm pretty sure all ADCs have 4 abilities in which MOST (if not all) abilities do physical dmg. The only champions that are the opposite are Kogmaw, Ezreal, and Corki. But even then Ezreal focuses on maximizing Q damage, and DFT doesn't even proc on his Q. Kog'maw has double atk speed from his W, meaning he can stack Fervor super quick. Corki could take Thunderlords, but only him. Thunderlords and RFC/shiv damage is nearly negligible late game unless the enemy has zero magic resist.\n\nNow Thunderlords? You said that it's free AOE damage when the AOE radius is EXTREMELY tiny. You'd have to be inside of another champion to get Thunderlords to hit you. Level 1 it has a base damage of 10 every 25 seconds. Fervor is 10 damage at max stacks per AUTO.... Level 18 Thunderlords 180 damage every 15 seconds... Fervor 110 damage per AUTO. In 15 seconds you could have potentially gotten 15 - 30 autos off (since most ADs tend to have around 1.0 - 2.0 atk speed) meaning Fervor did around 1650 to 3300 damage. Sure, armor blocks some of it, but magic resist will block Thunderlords/Deathfire. Also, the % armor pen mastery helps and you normally buy Lord Dominiks or Mortal Reminder. Don't forget the masteries that increase attack speed and damage. \n\nFor the Caitlyn scenario, you already have 8 Fervor stacks after the net and trap + three headshots/autos. Deathfire doesn't even stack, it just gets reapplied. Plus Deathfire's damage is extremely minimal early game since it scales off BONUS AD and has a super small base damage. If you auto again after your full combo then the little damage from Fervor on that one auto most likely outdamaged DFT at that point. Dont forget the extra damage from Fervor even when you're not at max stacks. Also you can't say that the magic pen mastery will help because your autos and Q AND your R all deal physical.\n\nSorry about that bronze remark, and I know its more than just not being good at the game. In all honesty, no one should be bronze let alone bronze 5. I'll tell you why if you'd like (can't now letter limit.)","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-08-16T06:33:08.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a nice long paragraph typed up on my phone but I accidentally hit the wrong key while trying to correct a typo and it refreshed so I'm just going to summarize it as best I can.\n\nfirst stop quoting my entire conversation. That's pointless and takes up too much space not to mention disrespectful to the rest of the board members. I can tell you're replying to me by the way it's set up.\n\nsecond - go look at the marksmen and you'll see that only 3 or 4 roughly 25% or less of the marksmen don't use magic or AP scaling on at least one move.\n\nfervor grants stacks for hitting your opponent. Not minions and not turrets. In other words unless you trade constantly you're not benefitting.\n\nthunderlords aoe doesn't have to be huge to be used for last hitting minions and braums that are trying to vault away from your tracer rounds.\n\ndeathfire is about preventing healing. Works great to stop lifesteal. It won't stop shields though.\n\nI've been level 30 for over 6 years. Of course I know how masteries work. Stop belittling me with your offensive comments. 18 6 6, 18 12, or 12 12 6 (no keystone). Your pick put them where you want. Cool down is important to champs like vayne ezreal and ms fortune. Its hard finding early cool down for marksmen. Stinger is about your only option and it builds into triforce and nashoors tooth. Boots of lucidity and caulfields warhammer are character specific and costly. Percent penetration only works effectively over 200 armor. Usually only one champ will have that much at most maybe 2. Flat penetration is much better. Dual flat penetration especially. Last whisper doesn't stack right? If you go into a game planning to buy last whisper you might as well put some extra percent penetration runes in your build because there are no other percent penetration items. Buy blade of the ruined king too. You'll be set for life. As long as you never intended to fight the other marksman or the mage or the assassin or the support... Pretty much anyone except tanks you shouldn't be fighting. \n\nI didn't say always get magic penetration.\n\nthere were  probably some other things but I can't remember them at the moment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-08-14T09:42:37.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"A bonus AD ratio would make it useless on anyone not building high AD.

Not sure how keeping fervor good on people that should use it (ADCs and other champions that primarily build AD) while preventing champions building one offensive item then full tank taking it and abusing it could further bring a damage meta. Doing this now could prevent a sort of Fervor meta that could occur (where all bruisers and tanks take fervor and do tons of damage again while being really tanky) although it might be me being very delusional. There were a few pro players I've seen actually playing Malphite with Triforce + Wits End and Fervor. It's a good way to nerf the Frozen Force Yasuo build and the Tri-force Ekko build. People are saying that Ekko with this build has very similar damage compared to his pre-nerf Tank build.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-08-14T08:31:19.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what fervor actually really needs is a shorter duration.\n\n6 seconds is a long time in league lol...","replies":[]}]}
