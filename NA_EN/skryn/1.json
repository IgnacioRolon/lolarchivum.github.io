It usually lasts about 10 or so seconds and happens multiple times during games. Does anybody have any insight on this? If this helps at all, all the commands I put in during this lag becomes a buffered command, so if I click q as lee sin while it's completely unresponsive, my q happens once I'm able to move again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T15:55:34.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some input delays caused by a network issue like packet loss.
