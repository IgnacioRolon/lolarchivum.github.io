His win-rate took a huge dive downward following Patch 7.22 (Preseason patch). I was just wondering if Riot had any plans to give him some love? Fervor and attack speed runes (Quints and Marks) were what made him competitive, and with those gone, he just feels super weak. PTA feels awful in comparison to Fervor (and PTA just got nerfed), and most other fighter-type champions who ran Fervor feel the same way. The difference here is, most other fighters are getting some TLC via buffs for the next patch in about a week or so (12/14), where as Yasuo hasn&#039;t even be mentioned yet. I understand a lot of people hate this champion, which is fine, but a 46.13% win-rate is pretty bad. More so when you see how hard his win-rate fell; from around ~50% to 45-46% following the preseason patch (7.22). I&#039;d like to know if Riot has any plans in mind for him.","replies":[{"poster":"k wìx","date":"2017-12-07T04:19:50.718+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While personally I think he could use a few more months sitting down there at the bottom, It'll be interesting to see how they manage to buff him, and if that puts him over the top again.

Yasuo has a bad stigma, and I get why and all, but its kinda unjustified in some instances. He hasn't been out of line for awhile, and Riot did an ok job at keeping him relatively balanced. Hes skewed based on what MMR you look at; in high elo, he isn't very good because people know how to play against him, whereas at low MMR's, they might not. I don't know what your rank is or what rank you play at, but other champions do what he does, but better, and arguably easier.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Red Wreckage","date":"2017-12-07T10:03:41.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kit mean jackshit in this meta when everything just straight up burst u down with 1 ability + 1 AA + a keystone proc.  ain't nobody got time to outplay shit :D\n\nbtw how is the progress on getting Ahri buffs?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Schenix","date":"2017-12-07T11:02:45.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without attack speed early, he suffers greatly. He's been nerfed over the past year to remove his early game bullying by a massive amount which was a lot of the reason to pick him; but the entire paradigm of a no downtime crit champion with a windwall is toxic even when it isn't powerful. Windwall needs a clarity treatment of canceling particles behind the area and not the whole ability. Personally though, I am fine with it stopping ranged champion auto attacks. The issue I have is how hard it is to see on its base skin. Much like Luxs base skin and Legions particles. \n\nThat is a tangent however. He simply needs more base Attack Speed is all. Already has horrible base stats so he gets blown up later if he isn't good, so compensation nerfs can wait until after if needed at all. \n\nThe issue is when it is good, it feels awful to try and outplay a champion with far more options of approaching a situation than you that is approaching it even remotely well, hence prior nerfs to make that ceiling harder and the early game less oppressive. \n\nI miss the Yasuo who could start E, that's basically dead. Can't hold onto a tornado to dissuade a Zed ult or have any real damage this season before practically 2 items on him. But you know, as the years go by, solo carry champions get slowly toned down. As is progression, can't say it wasn't inevitable. Side note that I don't play Yasuo too much, but nor have I ever had any serious problems laning against Yasuos in Platinum and Diamond. If I'm playing a mage who can't kill him easily, I can manage the wave to not fall behind or wait for the jungler. In the end, his responsibility is higher in a teamfight to the variables of success whereas most mages are lower with just as much impact, some with more. When he gets fed, it feels preventable unlike a Syndra ultimate, or even a Zed ultimate or even Rammus [which are all preventable, but with a much higher degree of effort required). I feel like it's just the Windwall that holds him back from real base stats honestly. It frustrates so many people.
