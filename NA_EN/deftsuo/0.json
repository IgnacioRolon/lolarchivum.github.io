I main the champion (feel free to devote for this reason and this reason only), but playing against it, the 50% bonus armor penetration is quite powerful early-mid game when he had crit components for PD/Shiv or PD/Shiv themselves. (either 20% crit with brawlers glove, 40% with zeal, or 60% with PD/Shiv) he is getting the bonus armor pen (which lasts for 15 seconds) on a sizable portion or majority of his auto-attacks or Q&#039;s depending on what items he has early-mid game.\n\nIn my opinion, it should scale with each rank up of his ultimate, starting at say, 20, then going to 30 at rank two of ultimate, and then 40 at rank three. This would put it in line with other penetration items (while still being better than LW build paths by 5%). If Riot wanted to keep the 50% bonus armor penetration for later in the game, they could do 20-35-50, at each respective rank (or even 30/40/50 as someone from /r/yasuomains suggested). I think this would allow better counter-play for top-lane (since that seems to be the problematic lane) since he wouldn't be able to duel tanks so effectively with only PD/Shiv components or PD/Shiv themselves. Even more so with Zeal and IE being cheaper. I believe this would bring him more inline with the meta and other picks at the moment, since he gained a ton from the mid-season update while losing very little. This is the one thing I'm surprised Riot has left untouched for all these years on Yasuo, and if they move forward with other nerfs, I highly encourage them to consider this change before messing with his Q, W, or E again.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2017-05-23T20:04:06.767+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because it already scales with game length. 50% bonus armor pen at level 6 is, like, nothing, but at level 16 is quite a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Deftsuo","date":"2017-05-23T20:09:48.763+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doctor Jarvis,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=V5QJht8v,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-05-23T20:04:06.767+0000)\n>\n> Because it already scales with game length. 50% bonus armor pen at level 6 is, like, nothing, but at level 16 is quite a lot.\n\nIt's actually quite a bit at level 6.

I don't think nerfing it outright is the solution, given how much armor can now be stacked and how the meta currently is. Scaling solves his early dominance problem (potentially lowering kill pressure at 6) against top-lane tank match-ups in which he seems to be doing overly well in. I don't have the math to support my claims, but reducing bonus armor pen early would allow tanks building items like tabi and early armor to stand a chance at fighting him in an all-in circumstance. I'd like to see how much armor at level 6 a tank loses to Yasuo's bonus armor pen per critical strike over the duration of the 15 seconds of bonus armor pen.

Yasuo is the reigning king of the champs riddled with free stats.  Riot wants it this way, so that people can look at his base stats and say \"Oh man, he's balanced... look how weak he is!\"   Oh wait lol, free health, free crit, free AS, free armor pen, no mana, no cooldowns.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-05-24T07:06:06.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it only works on crits, which are costly in terms of gold.

It'd be interesting to have a graph or some visual representation of its effectiveness as the game progresses. Compare and contrast its effectiveness against different times in the game and see if it is truly a balanced, scaling stat or if its stronger in one part of the game than in comparison to another.","replies":[{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-05-23T21:27:14.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh it's definitely far more useful late game. Cutting a tanks armor from 350 to 225 is a far bigger difference than cutting a tanks armor from 80 to 60.

My question revolves around whether the 50% bonus pen early-mid game is balanced or not. On one end, it gets more effective as the game goes, so therefor its already arguably balanced since it ramps up as the game progresses. On the other end, 50% bonus pen 6-15 min into the game on 2/5-1/2 of your auto's and Q's for 15 seconds might be a tad strong, I'd have to see numbers and statistics to back this statement up, but its worth considering none the less.","replies":[{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-05-23T21:42:18.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"50% early on in the game is hardly noticable, even against tanks that rush armor.

His level 6 powerspike is super good if you know what you're doing. I've gotten so many kills at level 6 from properly managing the wave and experience advantage while poking down pre-6 to look for an all in when I have ult.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
