Third game I get a 3rd win but instead of promoting me like it should I was sent back into being \"eligible for promotion\". Did they change how the game was supposed to rank you or is this some sort of bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T19:00:25.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and it turns out that you have a pretty consistent history of [queue dodges](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging).  Dodging during your series will automatically count as a loss as well as disqualify any promotional help.  It's really important to stick to it and play those games through.  Let me know if that clears things up. and good luck!","replies":[]}]}
