That trolls get punished when they've shown a consistent history to negatively affect games, backed by reports that indicate what was negative. And that such reports do not affect players who are honestly trying to win a game. \n\nA problem that many folks have with the current system is that it's not quick enough, which makes sense since it can be difficult to discern trolling and trying to win. Added to the fact that sometimes it's blatant and some folks seem to go unpunished. But what you don't see very often? People complaining that they were actively trying to win and still got punished, then upon review had a removal. I very seldom see those threads. So on the latter part, people not getting punished when they were not doing things wrong, I'm happy about.\n\nLike most others, I think there could be improvements in people inting and trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2019-09-17T16:59:03.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Periscope,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=eH9Ekka9,comment-id=0000000000060000,timestamp=2019-09-16T21:37:59.544+0000)\n>\n> My expectations?

But I don't know how they detect intentional feeding, and it's probably for the better, since that public knowledge could be used to avoid detection.\n\nIf it's caught at any instance, it's given a ban.\n\nA note about people saying they're doing something, like feeding/trolling: that's clearly negative behavior, but that doesn't mean they're actually doing the negative actions they describe.
