But what people don't realize a lot of times is that it compares you ( at least I'm pretty sure) to the average KDA of that specific champion. So I could still have a 3-0-12 score with sona. But if the average KDA is 6-0-14, it's not going to matter as much.\nRoguePanda is also correct in that farm counts as well. In this case you needed a higher farm. Not because your farm was actually bad for the time limit; but again, because of that champion average. \n\n\nUnless I'm completely wrong, but this is what I've gathered. Sorry you got jipped. I paid RP for a hextech chest and got a ward skin I already owned.
