Hope the new year is treating you well so far. I've had this in my brain for a while and finally got around to drawing it out! All I have at the moment is a pretty rough topdown concept and flat colored turnarounds for modeling purposes, but I'd like to make a fully rendered front concept eventually! I think Fiora could really take the \"Queen of Hearts\", Wonderlandesque themes introduced with Heartseeker Ashe and run with them. I think the aesthetic suits her character really well. Hopefully the images actually embed wish me luck\n\nhttps://38.media.tumblr.com/8b72312274d8eb498b084da8ae88c6c6/tumblr_nhq7vzhHiJ1tz0f3qo1_1280.png\nhttps://31.media.tumblr.com/ba143b56fde3ef9a10b65092454c6cea/tumblr_nhq7vzhHiJ1tz0f3qo2_1280.png\nhttps://38.media.tumblr.com/66d21fdd1a29b6155ba2dbdb89107b12/tumblr_nhq7vzhHiJ1tz0f3qo3_1280.png\n\nI'm trying to stick thematically with what was introduced with Heartseeker Ashe, but I wanted to introduce some Cupid elements to the design as well. I thought it'd be cool for her cape to resemble a feathered wing, but it could just as easily be changed to a more fancy, royal purple design. I think Fiora's main-gauche is an awesome opportunity for skins that hasn't really been utilized yet, especially because she doesn't actually use it in her skill animations. I like the idea of it being a bouquet of roses that she can make use of in her recall animation! In my head right now she tosses it into the air before slicing it in half and standing in the rain of petals afterwards. Hope you guys like it!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-06T21:50:34.929+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really sweet idea, and beautifully done! \n\nShe does bear a striking resemblance to Heartseeker Ashe, and you had mentioned her as the Queen of Hearts, so might I suggest sliding her more to the Alice in Wonderland Vibe? She'd look awesome with Annie in Wonderland, IMO. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2015-01-07T00:07:38.788+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much!

I personally am a fan of the Heartseeker/Debonair skin line and sadly I don't play Vayne well or else I'd have hers too, but this would cause me to learn Fiora just for this skin...

I think my favorite part is that it doesn't take the NOTHING BUT PINK AND RED heartseaker palette and run with it, but lends a more royal aesthetic with the richer purple, though it does almost lean more towards wonderland than heartseaker. But that versatility between the two theme is really cool. I would love to see Fiora as a heartseeker champ (though I HATE HER GUTS (and I'm never 1v1ing you when you have Fiora ever again)). I mean she definitely has a very significantly French accent, and French is the language of love, after all, oui?","replies":[]},{"poster":"AAARRRRGGGGGHHHH","date":"2015-01-07T03:31:11.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wholly disapprove of all Heartseeker skins until Pantheon gets one (his E is literally named \"Heartseeker Strike\")","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-09-02T00:04:56.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With her Q, it really is a very fitting theme for her. \n\nAlthough she seeks hearts for other reasons then \"cupid\" type reasons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sadistic Nurse","date":"2015-09-02T00:01:56.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":| You stop that. *nosebleed*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ràinbow","date":"2015-07-20T08:01:16.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heartbreaker Fiora!! ;D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son Olivia Hye","date":"2015-01-07T20:50:27.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll let heartseeker fiora stab me in the heart anytime.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kiwi Wizard","date":"2015-01-07T16:54:01.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really love the wing cape thing. :o\n\nAwesome work!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ANGUSdaGUY","date":"2015-01-07T11:07:24.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't need a skin for Fiora.
