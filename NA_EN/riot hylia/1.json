I really hope Riot decides to make a Debonair Cait eventually, Caitlyn is like, the *embodiment * of that skin line. She's the ultimate classy lady.\n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/29bfcfd8bb87d2a5b14e5070b0e0f398/tumblr_njbzi33bZS1qk32lpo1_1280.png\n\nHope you guys like it! Took a lot of reference from Jayce, Ez, and Vi, of course, but tried to add Caitlyn's own little personal touches to the skin. I'll probably take some time in the future to go back and polish it up a little more.\n\nUPDATE: NOW WITH 100% MORE GUN AND CUPCAKES \n\nMade a concept for her rifle and Yordle Snap Traps when I got home from work tonight! They could be more refined but I wanted to get them up here before the thread lost popularity. Thanks so much for your feedback everyone!\n\nTook a lot of reference from the Debonair Mercury Hammer and Vi and Ez's gauntlets. I liked the idea of her weapons incoporating hextech mechanics, so the glowing blue components are literally a LoL mana bar!\n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/7de39c0553925838bafa0f8276d2eb3e/tumblr_njdtoeI49O1qk32lpo1_1280.png\n\n{{champion:51}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:254}}\n\n*\"Ezreal, dear, the tie is a nice start, but we really **must** do something about that hair of yours.\"*\n\n*\"Nonsense, Vi, you look splendid!

She's not as chaotic as Vi or Jinx, but still a bit kooky - as *Piltover* is kooky and eccentric. \n\nTo quote TV Tropes, I see the entire \"Put Cait in Pants\" lobby as being addicted to the notion that **Real Women Don't Wear Dresses**. To wit:\n\n> A woman is shown as weak, incompetent, and ineffectual unless she dresses and behaves in a masculine manner, or is otherwise applauded for being \"not like other girls.\" A variation is a Tomboy and Girly Girl scenario, where the tomboy is presented as superior. It's not hard to spot the Unfortunate Implications: that traditionally feminine traits are worthless and women must \"masculinize\" themselves to be taken seriously. It takes the old prescriptivist gender roles and merely inverts them, creating a new prescribed gender role that female characters must adhere to or be shunned\n\nCait is feminine. She's frilly. She's \"Upper Class\" Piltover. Gentry, whereas Jinx and VI are more street-level (And Jinx herself is dressed just as eccentrically and wearing less - and like Caitlyn, is ranged; VI's more \"covered\" because *she's in melee and thus is armored*)\n\nCait and Vi are a pair, a duo,and VI's the tomboy to Cait's girly girl. (Or if you prefer,the butch to Cait's femme - they make such an adorable couple...)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2015-02-09T08:21:07.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can definitely appreciate that! I think there's a line between masculinizing a design and making a design more practical in terms of a character's context,  and I do think that Vi and Jinx's introduction sort of grittied Piltover 's Wonderland-esque steampunk charms a bit to the point where Caitlyn seems the odd one out of the three, but League's never really been a stickler for the practical or realistic. That being said, Cait and Vi expressing their gender identities and their femininity in different manners on different spectrums is awesome and something I think should be kept after a Cait VU. I just think her current outfit might get a little in the way of hunting down bad guys haha\n\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/815402ac4fa1ba9f5322959c278e4e1c/tumblr_nbx5d9b5Qm1sp9y1uo1_1280.png\n\nI started this paintover of her current splash a while back as a painting exercise, it's pretty rough around the edges but it's what I picture when I think of Cait. I think it's possible to keep the posh and frilly feminine attitude while simultaneously giving her a more realistic getup and grounding her in the same thematic foundations as Jinx and Vi!\nI do think she looks phenomenal in her current splash though, and even if it were just some model upgrades to reflect the way she looks in it I'd be happy!","replies":[{"poster":"Gallowgrim","date":"2015-02-09T13:14:37.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I *really* like the Jacket, but Cait in pants just looks.. odd to me.  I think the jacket effect does wonders to\"toughen\" the image, but the pants go too far from \"Whisical\" toward \"Fox-hunter\",and the effect becomes too much \"tomboy\"- the aristocrat's daughter in \"Brotherhood of the Wolf\"or, *especially*, Laurie Weathermay-Foxglove of *Ravenloft*, who was the \"tough\" fighter-type (The Vi, in short) of the Weathermay twins.\n\nCoincidentally, though I can't speak for skirts (hah), I can speak for that style of \"riding pants\" - they're *not* as mobile and convenient as you'd think (I did show riding, and hated the monkey suits required for English-style showing. *Not* great for mobility at all).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fox Tango","date":"2015-02-06T03:46:45.992+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Very nice!
