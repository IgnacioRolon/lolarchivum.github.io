The course of history was forever changed, however, when her once warm and passionate heart was corrupted by the icy touch of the Frozen Watchers. Now her armies sweep across the tundra like the blizzard wind, seeking to swell the forces of her Iceborn horde that all of Runeterra might someday feel the Watchers&rsquo; wrath.\n\nHey everyone! Took some time yesterday to throw together a quick Blackfrost Ashe concept! Inspired by a dream I had the other night where I was playing Support Liss to a Blackfrost Ashe in an all Freljord team while Ice seeped out of our Nexus and slowly froze the entire map! This one came together pretty quickly so I didn&#039;t come up with many design variations but I&#039;d like to revisit it and polish it up a bit sometime soon. Let me know what you guys think!\n\nEDIT: Tattered the cape up because some of you guys said it was too reminiscent of Talon! I was trying to create a thematic tie with the fabric trailing behind Blackfrost Anivia but I can definitely see why it reminded you guys of Talon.\n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/1f8246aaebf08d1a4cd3124a9fe17536/tumblr_inline_o0xqxgD3gg1qiaw9q_540.png\n\nIf you&#039;d like to see more of my work you can [follow me on twitter!](http://www.twitter.com/TomRandby) I post a lot of concepts and progress images there!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-13T23:32:01.675+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":2,"body":"O___O Her particles could be so awesome.

Similarity to marauder was definitely a concern I had when making it. I think revisiting the bow and making it more dark ice and less stone detailing might help to differentiate them. If this was a legendary tier skin like Blackfrost Anivia it'd had new, dark VO, new animations and new particles so that'd help to set them apart, but as a 750-975 tier skin it is a similar theme.
