I painted a quick Forsaken skin concept for Fiora that I wanted to share!\n\nIt&#039;s been a few years since Fiora&#039;s last skin, and given the relative lack of variety in terms of her visuals and particles on her current skins, I think she&#039;d be a perfect fit for the Forsaken/Chosen skin line! Fiora&#039;s base skills inherently have little particle effects outside of the shining effect on Riposte and Blade Waltz, so  to remedy that and add a little more to her abilities, I think this would make for a great 1350 tier skin! It&#039;d be her first skin with a recall animation, and In my head it features new particles, new SFX on her AA and abilities, a corrupted filter on her VO, and maybe a new haste or AA animation when she activates burst of speed. I hope you guys like it! Let me know what you think!\n\nEdit: here's a quick example of what her VO might sound like. I'm not great with Audacity and don't know many effects, so it's a little underwhelming, but I figured I'd throw something together!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/thomas-randby/forsaken-fiora-vo-test","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Galetta","date":"2015-05-12T20:15:07.475+0000","up_votes":66,"down_votes":2,"body":"Damn, that's sick!
