I just got around to going back and touching up and old Challenger Diana sketch I&#039;ve had lying around for a while and thought I&#039;d share it here on the boards!\r\n\r\nhttps://cdna2.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/002/988/814/large/thomas-randby-challengerdianacompressed.jpg?1468180937\r\n\r\nI started this back before Diana won the poll to recieve the all stars team fire skin but got too busy to finish it, so  even though she&#039;s a less likely recipient of the skin now I still figured it wouldn&#039;t hurt to share! I had a lot of fun putting this one together.\r\n\r\nI might do some paintover passes at making her weapon a little more streamlined and experimenting with different shapes for the armor on her torso!

League's visual hierarchy sort of demands the lower body be shaded more heavily and simpler in terms of design in order to accomodate the top down camera angle, so I try not to go to crazy with details on pants/boots when I design skins. A bit of silver embellishment on the shoes might look nice, though, and help to break up all that red/pink!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hoes and bows","date":"2016-07-11T11:40:08.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/walkingdead/images/3/3f/Shut-up-and-take-my-money.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20140829235648","replies":[]},{"poster":"CFatalis","date":"2016-08-25T22:18:51.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really love the skin the effects would be nice to if riot did this","replies":[]},{"poster":"SH Overhaul","date":"2016-08-25T20:22:33.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This moment when u want a epic skin and then u see...Fck..Its a Championship Zed ..{{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raeyxx","date":"2016-07-12T20:35:38.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the head piece is a little awkward, but the rest of this is damn gorgeous. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rozair","date":"2016-07-12T16:26:53.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her hair looks like she's a vampire from the medieval era.
