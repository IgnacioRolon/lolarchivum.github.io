{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2016-01-06T21:50:02.020+0000","title":"Mafia / Queenpin LeBlanc","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":498,"down_votes":8,"body":"> Owner, proprietress and singer at the ritzy Noxian nightclub “The Black Rose,” LeBlanc’s taste for glamour and intrigue made her a natural fit for the higher end of organized crime. Rarely dirtying her own hands, LeBlanc’s operation serves as a front for the syndicate she deftly and ruthlessly puppeteers, as well as a headquarters where the mafiosa matriarch is guaranteed a private audience with both guests and victims alike. \n\nHey everyone! I wanted to share a concept I made for a new LeBlanc skin! I think LeBlanc's established character fantasy of political intrigue and assassination lends itself perfectly to an alternate fantasy as the head of LoL's organized crime syndicate.\n\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/0fa0bfde60074b9ecbd03194ef4b3724/tumblr_o0jw6za3rq1qk32lpo3_1280.png\n\nThis skin was inspired by the mystery woman in the Knockout Lee Sin splash art!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/I6T7oTc.png\n\nThe idea sprang from reimagining \"The Black Rose\" as a speakeasy lounge, and sort of evolved from there. \n\nhttps://36.media.tumblr.com/875e632bf9ba063a8c00b7b17581c5f2/tumblr_o0jw6za3rq1qk32lpo5_540.png\n\nIn my mind the skin will be along the lines of Star Guardian Lux, featuring new sound effects, VO, and maybe some fresh animations! I'd like for her recall (or maybe even a dance replacement like Mafia Jinx's) to feature her humming a jazzy rendition of a song from the LoL Soundtrack, randomly selected from a repertoire of about 3 or 4! I'd like to get to work on a splash art soon featuring the entire Mafia skin line, drinking and conducting business inside the Black Rose. Kingpin Twitch isn't allowed inside C:\n\nHere are a few in game model mockups\n\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/be042ce330c7b0ae73de373825c8b185/tumblr_o0jw6za3rq1qk32lpo1_1280.png\n\nHere's a color edit of what her clone might look like!\n\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/0b1add9ab4b5ec8515f0aec875946751/tumblr_o0jw6za3rq1qk32lpo2_1280.png\n\nAnd another quick paintover I did for fun when I realized how long her hair must be to have it done up so big! ~~it's full of secrets~~\n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/daf50cb70a2ce58ee1d02ab8c946a02e/tumblr_o0jw6za3rq1qk32lpo4_1280.png\n\nIn my mind I also imagine Ariana Savalas as her singing voice!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQGFeRI0qbg\n\nHope you guys like it, let me know what you think! I had a lot of fun making it!","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-01-06T23:08:29.523+0000","up_votes":122,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this - it's really cool :D  Is that a genuine Poro King stole over her shoulders?

Not to say that Runeterra wouldn't have its own version, but it seems so different to the opera gloves and fur cape suggestion.\n\n(This is where someone links an utterly stunning 20s dress that's more modern looking than I'd ever expect.

This is a sort of hybrid between retro geometric and modern sculptural. So it definitely is modern with a retro influence.\n\nThat said, it's *also* era-accurate for the 1920s because of the form and art deco influence on shape. However, the look would have been achieved through ruching, not geometric paneling. \n\nI dare anyone at Rito to design a dress with visible ruching with the current art style/self-imposed graphical limitations. Until then, this LeBlanc is flawless.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2016-01-07T07:09:25.252+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually did some experimenting with ruching instead of the paneling when I first started drafting the concept!
