(my art)","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":98,"down_votes":5,"body":"EDIT: Thanks for your feedback everyone! I'm gonna keep putting up edits based on what you guys think isn't working with the design. Nixed the wings and got back some of her streamers on her arms as well as adding a panel to the back! This was a really fast little paintover so it's a bit rough but I wanted to get an idea of what might fill that space.\n\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/fefd21d35dce99771b5bb420fe1ac583/tumblr_nn8m2u5nUZ1qk32lpo1_1280.png\n\n\nhttp://41.media.tumblr.com/ea9e3d7e354667263bfd87c08e3fd9d5/tumblr_nmuuhfuAK51qk32lpo2_540.png\nEvelynn is in an interesting spot right now because I think, as a character, she&#039;s inhabiting a sort of blank slate archetype as \"shadow assassin in bondage gear\" so I think there are a lot of different directions to take her forward in terms of updating her visually! Because she&#039;s got a lot of options and methods of characterization I understand not everyone might be into this particular design but I thought I&#039;d go ahead and share it and see what other people think would suit her.\n\nI tried to keep the sort of Succubus vibe that she&#039;s got going on (instead of encroaching on Nocturne&#039;s \"living shadow\" niche) without going full on BDSM gear and giving her some armor. The hip wings might be a little much, lol, they were an attempt at solidifying the \"not altogether human\" aspect of her character but they're super cliche. I liked the idea of her hair moving like a flame, almost with a mind of its own like http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/toonami/images/a/a5/Sedusa.gif/revision/latest?cb=20130425205002 from the Powerpuff Girls (lol) except in one long tendril instead of many. I designed her armor with the intent of it not looking painful exactly, but giving of a sort of sadomasochistic air. I also wanted to include a scrap of fabric hanging from the waist plating on the small of her back (sort of imitating a demon's tail), but combined with the wings it looked a little too Shyvana.\n\nalso i hope you guys appreciate the spongebob reference in this early wip. mama can do some damage with deez hands\nhttp://41.media.tumblr.com/1cea116ea0d1613c13a38516356f4a4a/tumblr_nmqgb1EDMa1qk32lpo3_1280.png\n\nLet me know what you think!

Her forearms and Thighs are disproportionately massive in comparison to her torso, calves, and upper arms.\n\nIn general the upper leg is only about a 10:9 ratio with the lower leg, where your drawings have it closer to 10:8, which leaves her calves looking quite small/short. to get a better picture of the proportionality, try drawing her without feet first, and then adding on the feet after, because with the heels she's wearing, the total proportion matches a natural proportion, but it should in fact be taller. Because of the heels, the ratio of her upper leg to whole lower leg would be about 10:11, where right now it is about 10:10 her lower legs look particularly small since her upper legs look proportionally just about perfect with her torso, if maybe a touch small.\n\nHer arms are an interesting case, since they are supposed to have a slightly beefier look (big meaty claws as you put it). My only issue is that while the forearms looks proportionally correct, the upper arms look a little too thin. This isn't as noticeable in the final version you made, but in that one the big clawed hands are actually even bigger than the WIP which is why they look rather clunky and not quite so graceful. I'm all for her having large brutal claws, but the final version makes them just a little *too* big to the point of looking more like armored gauntlets like Vi has.\n\nI'm not really sold on the bat wings yet (at least not coming out of her butt), but it's an interesting direction to take her. As for the hair, I love the idea of making it move and flow actively like that, but I'd prefer it be less of an up-do than it is in your concept, since I don't feel it is quite different enough from her current troll doll hair.\n\nAll in all though this is some really good art, keep up the excellent work!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2015-04-23T02:22:29.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the critique! I was trying to emulate the proportions of some official league concept art, and I definitely intended the proportions to be a little stylized and exaggerated (i.e 9 heads tall as opposed to the average 7.5/8). I do agree that it got a bit out of hand somewhere along the line - the initial sketch didn't have her in heels and I didn't really compensate for it when I added them in, which is probably why the legs seem off.  Yeah, I was really hesitant about the wings as well so I'm playing with some other ideas! Added in a quick little paintover with some fabric to take their place but I'm still taking some looks at it. I definitely wanted the claws to be big, partially because I wanted them large in the model so that players would clearly be able to make out her attacks. But her right claw (our left) is a little too clunky, I agree.
