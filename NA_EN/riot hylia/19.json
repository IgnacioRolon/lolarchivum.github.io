I wanted to share a concept I&#039;ve drafted up for a Shuriman themed Lissandra skin in the same line as Risen Fiddlesticks. I drew a lot of thematic inspiration from Cassiopeia, Nasus and Risen Fiddles, and it was a lot of fun to come up with something classically Shuriman but that was still suited to Lissandra&#039;s imposing character and silhouette! I wrote out a short little paragraph detailing the alternate character fantasy I&#039;ve imagined for this skin, as well.\n\n> Ages ago, the desert empress Lissandra ruled the dunes of Shurima with a whisper and a gilded fist. A cunning and ruthless queen, Lissandra made employ of powerful sorcery to bend her enemies and subjects alike to her iron will. Upon her death, the people rejoiced in hope of a reprieve from her tyranny, but that hope soon proved to be ill fated. Lissandra was not content to journey into the afterlife, and rose from her ornate tomb as a monstrous revenant to stalk the Shuriman waste. Legend has it that the Queen&rsquo;s Shade roams the dunes still, eternally seeking to quench her unslaked thirst for the power that was once at her fingertips.\n\nI'm still coming up with ideas for particles! A Sarcophagus is the obvious choice for her ult, but in case it treads too closely to the Blade Queen Iron Maiden I want to draw a version where she encases herself in a carved obelisk instead. I think there&#039;s a lot of cool opportunities to utilize sand and hieroglyphs in her VFX, and I&#039;m picturing mummified claws for her e and the &quot;root&quot; models in her W.  I also like the idea of her golden mask fracturing during her recall, revealing a bandaged, rotting face underneath before she sinks into the quicksand.\n\nLet me know what you guys think! I hope you like her!
