You should try it sometime!!! _☆ ☆ (✿◠‿◠) ☆\n\nHey everyone! Star Guardian Lux is amazing and inspiring, and I wanted to try my hand at designing a Star Guardian or two! KateyKhaos tweeted me about the idea of Syndra getting one, so here&#039;s my Syndra concept! I wanted her to be reminiscent of Sailor Mercury and the Mercury goggles, so I made her headdress into a sci-fi magical girl scouting visor of sorts. It turned out a little similar to the DJ Sona headset which I&#039;m not too happy with, but I figured I&#039;d toss it up on the boards regardless! I hope you guys like it!\n\nI really hope this gets turned into a skin line! It&#039;s such a cute and fun idea and so many champions have particles that would suit it well. Imagine a bunch of cute blue stars nuking you to death in mid lane! What other champions you guys think would make a good Star Guardian?","replies":[{"poster":"Wero34","date":"2015-05-08T00:08:09.141+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":2,"body":"Star guardian urgot where?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2015-05-08T00:13:55.016+0000","up_votes":162,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://40.media.tumblr.com/562a67be182e681a7b101ab8d644c331/tumblr_no08mv7sTt1qk32lpo1_540.png\nfund it","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-05-08T06:02:46.649+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-05-08T23:26:56.106+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hylia,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=aABelZmj,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-08T00:13:55.016+0000)\n>\n> https://40.media.tumblr.com/562a67be182e681a7b101ab8d644c331/tumblr_no08mv7sTt1qk32lpo1_540.png\n> fund it\n\nMother of god.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Galetta","date":"2015-05-08T01:10:25.595+0000","up_votes":82,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooooo cute!
