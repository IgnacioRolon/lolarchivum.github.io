It's been a while though.  I play LoL regularly.  I recently installed and started using VirtualBox.  Now my LoL games are intermittently non-responsive for 2 seconds at a time.  VirtualBox is not running, but the non-responsiveness continues.  Ping is good. \r\n\r\nWhy?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-04-29T05:42:52.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Virtualbox has a background service, iirc. Is it disabled?\n\nAlso, what hardware are you using, and what virtualization-related BIOS options are modified?","replies":[{"poster":"MrN1ce9uy","date":"2019-04-29T12:26:22.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if iirc background service was disabled then.

I logged back in to my game and it was still happening.  Every 30s or so a 2s un-responsive lagg happens, but there is no indication of losing connection or high ping.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-04-29T19:29:24.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assume SVM Mode is the same as enabled AMD-V ?\n\nI cant find any related issues or think of a potential cause, i have only heard of stuff like that happening when running games _in_ a VM, or with hardware being shared. Can you confirm that VirtualBox is the cause?","replies":[{"poster":"MrN1ce9uy","date":"2019-04-30T02:56:38.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you know something? I also use VyprVPN, which I disable when I play LoL.  But I recently switched it from OpenVPN encryption to Chameleon encryption, both of which are options within the client.  Both have background processes while the VPN is disabled.  I was in the middle of a game when I realized I had switched that recently.  I exited the game of League.  Opened VyprVPN. Switched back to OpenVPN.  Closed VyprVPN.  Rebooted. Opened game.  And I think it may have still happened once or twice, but after a while, it went away.  I think it could be Chameleon encryption on VyprVPN that was causing it.\n\nBefore I started that game I had uninstalled VirtualBox and rebooted.  The un-responsiveness continued.  Then I saw the Chameleon process running in Task Manager.

If it does not have an option to close the software completely, it should not be touching the system in the first place. Even assuming it is secure and safe, that can cause all sorts of issues, as you are seeing..","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
