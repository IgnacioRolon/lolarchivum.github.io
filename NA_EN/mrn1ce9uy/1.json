I think I&#039;m simply trying to do two things at once. \n\nI&#039;m trying to practice the Shurima Shuffle with Azir, but  I&#039;m trying to do it all at once. Most people plant the soldier and then walk away from it and then (E&gt;Q.) But I&#039;m trying to (W&gt;E&gt;Q) all at once and nothing happens. In the video I attempt it 7x before it works. (See video)\n\nI have to press W, then left-click to place the soldier, then press E then Q. \n\nI must be left-clicking and pressing E at the exact same time? I thought it was my cheap keyboard so I decided to buy a mechanical keyboard (Logitech G910) but the same thing happens.\n\n*Even if I'm not doing the Shurmia Shuffle, just W>left-click>Q, then the left-click and Q don't work. Do I just need to practice doing it slower?","replies":[{"poster":"Denims Wrath666","date":"2017-08-12T16:18:13.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have that issue with ez on occasion. ewq, and sometimes i just sit there and throw a w. the game doesnt register my intensity of how bad i wanna thunderlord a bich.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-12T13:48:10.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have the option turned on where you can hold the key to see the range indicator?
