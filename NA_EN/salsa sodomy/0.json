The game seems to run perfectly fine until after champ select I'm presented with a black screen instead of the normal loading screen displaying all the players. After a few moment an error box appears telling me that i was unable to connect to the servers. trying to reconnect to the game gives the same error, even if I close the client down completely, reload it and attempt to reconnect then, the same error appears.\r\n\r\nHere's what I've tried:\r\n-reinstalling LoL(which interestingly enough, seemed to have fixed the issue for about 2 games or so, after that the same problem persisted once again)\r\n-Checking all my firewall settings to ensure league of legends is permitted\r\n-repairing the league client\r\n-Disabling IP-helper\r\n-restarting my computer\r\n\r\n   The closest I've seen through searching the internet looking for a fix is that it could be possible that the modem I'm using is incompatible with the league servers, which to me doesn't really make any sense...\r\n\r\nAny and all information regarding this issue is welcome, I'm at a complete loss with this one.\r\n\r\n   -Thank you.\r\n\r\n*currently on windows 10*","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T18:06:37.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some modems ship with firmware that blocks League due to their default configurations, such as Hitron Hubs.
