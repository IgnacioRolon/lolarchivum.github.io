It would take away part of Lux's skill ceiling in being able to extend glitterlance's range for tricky skillshots. How lame would it be in a team fight if you shield a front line teammate only to have pix bounce back to you when the shield is broken by focus fire. If your teammate was on their backline you could slow their entire team with pix's positioning and a carefully aimed glitterlance.","replies":[{"poster":"Muzét","date":"2017-04-19T12:13:44.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

The reason Sion doesn't get his Damage if it pops, because the entire reason is to draw Aggro in Teamfights, just like how Naut shield works. If you don't want a Sion doing 10% of people's health, or a Naut slamming people nearby for damage, you put in a little effort to stop that damage. The Damage makes them a threat, that need be dealt with, and as a result, the damage gets to be stronger and so does the shield. \n\nWith Ivern and Lulu, there shields are considerably weaker, as they don't build as much scaling stats as Sion or Naut do, so they are more akin to an actual part of the kit in how they function.

Generally, shields are made so that players are incentivized to attack them (Sion's W is a good example), and making a buff purely conditional upon the uptime of a shield is one of the best ways of doing that. Janna's bonus AD, Naut's on-hit effect, Skarner's bonus movement speed and Urgot's slow are all great examples of buffs specifically tied to their shields, and the fact that some on-shield buffs are completely independent from the shield itself does not make for good consistency at all.\n\nThere might be a concern that this would be a nerf to the affected champions (and it would be), but the advantage to a change like this is that it would make those champions healthier, and would allow them to receive more power elsewhere. Lulu, for example, could definitely use some slightly softer mana costs, and Ivern could perhaps have some better-tailored interactions with his passive and specific jungle camps (he shouldn't really have to spend health on the scuttle crab, for example). I'd much rather see a champion's power be redistributed in a healthier way than kept as is, simply because they're balanced in their current, less healthy state (though Ivern himself likely just needs a straight-up nerf).","replies":[]}]}
