Meaning mid drift, cleavage, etc. Bounty hunter armor doesn't show that stuff.....Not that I'm sure a lot of fans of MF would complain, I would just find it silly), Urgot or some other big champion as a Jaba like person, Wukong as a sort of Darth Maul, Maybe even make a sith and jedi skin for all champs that are able so people can use which one they like best on a champion.\n\nSeeing a Jedi Yi and a Darth Yi fight each other would be amazing. Imagine if their lightsabers/swords actually hit each other and \"blocked\" while they fought. Idk, that'd be unique.\n\nAlas, even if these skins were made I have no money for the RP and only time to gain the IP....so RIP any of these skins for me!
