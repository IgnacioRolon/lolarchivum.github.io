Thing is, it \"gates\" damage output in the early game and increases it greatly lategame as opposed to a system that would linearly increase your dps (because then it would benefit any and every AD bruisers).\n\nI suppose it would be kind of the opposite of (flat) armor penetration, which is strong early but falls off later if people build armor and you don't have LW. Crit is the way it is because if it was linear (which has been suggested before, like 10% crit should be 10% extra aa damage or something), trinity force warrior junglers would be too stronk.

What I mean by that is that Rylai's has a substantial cost attached to it AND it cannot be bought as a first major item without sacrificing something, most often the mana regen and/or CDR that almost every mage simply needs.

Well then, let me give you a solution that's just better. Make crit a % increase to autoattack damage. You get literally the same expected damage on every item and on every champion, and balance and playstyle don't change.\n\nIf the goal is just making crit not random, this is a better idea in every way. It's simpler, has less effect on the game, and doesn't force everyone into similar actions. The only thing you lose is the big numbers when a crit happens, and that means nothing to me.\n\nThe thing is, your idea necessitates not only messes with build paths, but it still has potential to introduce boring gameplay. You're still encouraged to build up stacks and then jump on someone for a burstier trade, and everyone still has to play around that in exactly the same way. That's a huge mechanic no matter when it comes into the game. On top of that, it still does matter for the laning phase, because you can finish a crit item in the laning phase easily enough. You don't even have to rush a big-ticket item like an IE to get crit (and we can't just restrict it to the big-ticket items because then we get that whole \"the items with the best stats are always best\" problems that AD carries are only just only now starting to escape from\"), so you could even pick it up earlier and force trades with it, and if that's an option it will immediately become the single best option because that's how strong this goddamn mechanic is.\n\nWe'd have to change sooooo much to get this working healthily in the game. We'd have to rebalance absolutely everything, and the end result isn't even interesting. Does anyone actually want a Cait passive on everyone? You obviously don't. You're making a huge deal of how important getting rid of rng is but you've never once defended the actual mechanic as being interesting by itself. Getting rid of RNG is the real objective, and we don't need this to do that.\n\nKeep it simple. Keep it easy. Don't introduce boring stuff. Just derandomize crit. A % increase to autoattack damage is the way to go.\n\nOh, and just to wrap it up, I'll still take losing or winning a trade because someone's crit cloak randomly gave them 100 extra damage over the stacking mechanic anyday. It may not be skill based, but at least it's not actively boring and it makes a difference rarely enough that I can just ignore it (no ignoring the boring stacking mechanic).","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-11-01T04:16:41.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's literally no way to play around a steady % damage increase.

It's also not any change from things are right now.\n\n>It's more snowbally than the way current crit is because it's too reliable.\n\nA little bit, but less than you'd think. It's reliable, but that doesn't actually make it significantly more snowbally. There is a small effect, but crit on live actually already supports the person who is ahead. Those are the characters who can take a crit early in a fight and keep going long enough to actually, and they're less likely to be forced out of fight or a laning situation by a solitary case of bad luck. The number of situations where crit actually gives an actionabley favorable fight outcome to the person who is significantly behind are actually so few on live that this doesn't change much.\n\nYour system actually adds to the snowballing a lot more (at least, for laning it does). That actually has The person most able to take advantage of the poking is the one who is strong enough to be able to risk a fight breaking out. If I'm behind, I can't go up to poke just because the crit is ready because I can't fight him even with it unless there is a positioning mistake (whereas on live I can just wait for the positioning mistake), but he can load a crit and zone me with it because I can't stand taking that burst no matter what. The number of situations where someone who is ahead benefits from having crit actually increases significantly with this system.\n\nOnce people get out of lane, it's effectively just the same thing as the straight derandomized system because you'll be getting crits every 2-3 hits at least (meaning, you'll have less of a time when there is a damage disparity between the average DPS and the real damage at that point in time). So, as\n\n>By the way I'm not trying to defend my idea because you are obviously 100% against it and I see no point in arguing about that.\n\nI'm 100% against it because I've thought it out every time it's been proposed before. If the only goal is removing RNG, then the only advantage to your system is that it keeps big numbers. The only way your system is better is if you like the big numbers or if you really like the stacking mechanic for the sake of the stacking mechanic. Prove me wrong. I'm open to the possibility of being wrong. Are you?\n\nSeriously man, give me more credit than that. Don't start thinking that I'm just irrationally against this just because I disagree extremely strongly with you. I'm giving you more credit than that.\n\nIf you still don't want to argue for your system with me, that's fine too. It's just a debate on the internet. You don't have to keep going with it if you don't want to, and you don't need any reason to not want to.\n\n>As for the whole ''we'd have to rebalance everything'' and the ''it's so OP it would always be the best option'' those are such gross exaggeration that it's just funny.\n\nNo, that's the best part. They're not even exaggerations. Give me the ability to get the full value of critical strikes by preloading a crit, and I will force it into a build as early as possible because I can get assured value out of it in a fight, and I'll add it to my guaranteed burst combo as an assassin. You have to rebalance around that because it is a pretty big increase, and that will take a lot of work.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-11-01T18:12:07.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually you can definitely play around higher AP values since AP boosts what is in most cases, by nature, unreliable. AD is sort of a middle ground here. It boosts basic attacks, so no you can't really play around that. However, some of AD's value (especially on a character per character basis) is put into how much power it gives to more unreliable parts of your kit. A great example here would be Graves. It's totally possible for a Graves who outstats you to lose a trade if he misses everything because a lot of his kit's power is put into his Q and R burst. \n\nIf crit was a simple % increase on your AAs and it was priced in such a way that it's gold efficient, then it's automatically better because it's 100% reliable. Which, yes, is similar to AS except of course AS requires more of a long term commitment than simply hit and run, so it's more balanced because of that.\n\nAs for the snowballing with a stacking mechanic, the scenario you are depicting means you're not CS'ing and/or pushing. You're effectively sacrificing something to zone away your opponent with your crit. This could also be solved by making your stacks fall off after a certain period of inactivity.\n\nAs for why I think it's not a bad system, it's pretty simple, really. It's not because I like big numbers, I don't even play AD carries. It's because I do think having access to a form of burst over constant DPS is something worth preserving in AD carries in some way. I just don't think it should be RNG based. Ideally, there would more of a performance disparity over time between crit builds and AD/AS builds, with crit builds pulling ahead early and falling off after a few seconds of combat, but THAT would require a lot of work. That's mostly wishful thinking.\n\nFor assassins, there are very easy ways to make them not want to build crit and/or make them sacrifice something if they want crit. That can be as simple as putting crit mostly on AS items or are as complicated as making new assassin items that are more appealing. Your assessment of this system's strength is honestly simply too hasty. You sound like Riot when they make a change and they go ''Oh boy, this is gonna be OP'' and turns out nobody even cares. Ex : When they made pre-rework's Cass' E count as a single target spell. Did she suddenly become blatantly overpowered? No. Just because something sounds really good on paper doesn't mean it will be that good in practice. Also, once again, you seem to be under the impression that it's impossible to tune crit in a way that it's not overpowered. That seems rather unimaginative. \n\nFinally, yes I do think you are exaggerating when you say everything would need to be rebalanced. We're talking about crit, something that is almost solely used on AD carries. We're not talking about removing Flash or towers. THAT would shake League to its core. Crit? Not so much. Is it a lot of work? Yes. But that's sort of what the pre-season is for. \n\nOh and btw, I am also a fan of the idea of making crit a % damage increase. I think it's by far a better system than what we currently have. I just don't think it's the only option. I see pros and cons to each system and I'm not particularly fond of either. I really just think the current system is ridiculously outdated and needs to be removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-11-01T19:35:09.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Actually you can definitely play around higher AP values since AP boosts what is in most cases, by nature, unreliable.

The basic premise here pretty much says \"autoattacks have very little counterplay\", so anything that boosts autoattacks has no counterplay. I think that's a fair description of your argument. Well, I disagree. You can punish someone for autoattacking. You can zone them out from it, you can. Abilities carry advantages that autoattacks don't have, and those advantages can be used against autoattacks. That does represent counterplay.\n\nThe point is, stat changes don't mess with this at all. Having more AP or more autoattack damage or whatever doesn't give you anything more to play against, because you still play against the enemy champion in the same way. I'm going to play the same way against a Syndra with 0 AP as I will against one with 1,000 AP (assuming I have the same relative strength as them at the time). AP doesn't give me anything to play against. Similarly, I'll play the same against Graves whether or not he has crit, because the key value of \"autoattacks are a threat\" doesn't change significantly enough for my playstyle to be modified. The only way it could change is if he completely gave up on attack speed and went for a pure AD burst thing where he could barely hurt afterwards.... but he's not going to do that.\n\n>If crit was a simple % increase on your AAs and it was priced in such a way that it's gold efficient, then it's automatically better because it's 100% reliable.\n\nAgain, yes, it is slightly better, but by much less than you would think.\n\n>As for the snowballing with a stacking mechanic, the scenario you are depicting means you're not CS'ing and/or pushing. \n\nIt actually doesn't. I can zone someone away from their last hits at a point when their minions aren't dying, get 5 more autoattacks quickly to get my stacks up once my minions die and theirs are at risk of dying, and then zone them off for another few seconds. Their only time of entry is when I have 0 stacks, because even starting a fight when I have half stacks will be enough for me to get a crit by the end of it. I do this right now on live with Caitlyn, so I can completely guarantee you I'd do it with crit.\n\n>This could also be solved by making your stacks fall off after a certain period of inactivity.\n\nNot for the laning scenario, no. I only have to zone you off for about 5 seconds to deny major amounts of farm. Have a delay shorter than that and you majorly screw with teamfighting because someone can get zoned off for longer than that. You also introduce the problem of backloading all damage, which has a small risk of weaking carries in the midgame.\n\nMy problem here is, this is another small change, on top of all the other small changes we'd need to make this system work, and the end result isn't even better than the % increase.\n\n>For assassins, there are very easy ways to make them not want to build crit and/or make them sacrifice something if they want crit. That can be as simple as putting crit mostly on AS items or are as complicated as making new assassin items that are more appealing.\n\nI wouldn't use the phrase \"as simple as\" to describe designing a lot of new items and only putting crit on AS items (mostly isn't good enough. Even one item is an opening). Those kind of redesigns aren't simple, That's a lot of redesigning that would have to happen. We'd have to rework the AD items that currently have crit, we'd have to rework the AS items, and we'd probably have to introduce multiple new items that are appealing enough to assassins to override the benefits of a guaranteed crit, and then we'd have to rebalance them around their synergies with their new items.\n\nAlso, just having attack speed won't stop me from buying a crit item if even the smallest ability to preload crits. I mean, think about it. It's 100% of my AD as frontloaded damage. That's worth more damage than one AD or armor penetration item, and it's not like attack speed is completely worthless just because I'm an assassin.\n\nThat's all a lot of work. This really is going to be a hard and long problem to deal with. And that's kind of my point. We'd need a ton of work to implement this system, we'd have to redesign a lot of items, and for what? There's no benefit that we can't get with a % damage increase.\n\n>I just don't think it should be RNG based.\n\nThen the % system is better. Outside of big numbers I don't see a single thing the stacking system does that the % system can't do better. Seriously, I don't see a single one. I don't see any pro that the % system can't match with less work and less time consumed. Yeah, we could force the stacking system to work with enough time and effort, but if there are only additional costs and no added benefit, then it's not actually a good option. I think when you really list out the pros and cons, the stacking system has a ton of cons that the % system doesn't have, and it has no pros over the % system. As far as I'm concerned, that means it's not an option.","replies":[{"poster":"Poske","date":"2015-11-02T09:47:35.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sightless66,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NYThg4ji,comment-id=0005000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-01T19:35:09.356+0000)\n>\n> I really disagree with this entire part. The basic premise here pretty much says \"autoattacks have very little counterplay\", so anything that boosts autoattacks has no counterplay. I think that's a fair description of your argument. Well, I disagree. You can punish someone for autoattacking. You can zone them out from it, you can. Abilities carry advantages that autoattacks don't have, and those advantages can be used against autoattacks. That does represent counterplay.\n> \n> The point is, stat changes don't mess with this at all. Having more AP or more autoattack damage or whatever doesn't give you anything more to play against, because you still play against the enemy champion in the same way. I'm going to play the same way against a Syndra with 0 AP as I will against one with 1,000 AP (assuming I have the same relative strength as them at the time). AP doesn't give me anything to play against. Similarly, I'll play the same against Graves whether or not he has crit, because the key value of \"autoattacks are a threat\" doesn't change significantly enough for my playstyle to be modified. The only way it could change is if he completely gave up on attack speed and went for a pure AD burst thing where he could barely hurt afterwards.... but he's not going to do that.\n> \n> Again, yes, it is slightly better, but by much less than you would think.\n> \n> It actually doesn't. I can zone someone away from their last hits at a point when their minions aren't dying, get 5 more autoattacks quickly to get my stacks up once my minions die and theirs are at risk of dying, and then zone them off for another few seconds. Their only time of entry is when I have 0 stacks, because even starting a fight when I have half stacks will be enough for me to get a crit by the end of it.
