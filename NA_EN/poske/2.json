None of that matters though, nobody is saying Blitz is a piece of cake, what I said was that he's easier to deal with than Pyke. You can run away from all of Blitz's stuff... You can't do much running from Pyke's ult. He doesnt even need to target you right, if a litttle bit of that X touches you, you get the full wrath of the ult.\n\nActuallly I think there's the fix... Riot make it so Pyke has to absolutely center that X on you. If Corki's ult can have such a small radius to hit the target I think Pyke can manage as well. Make it so his ult has to hit you dead in the middle of the X to actually execute and just dmgs you if it lands anywhere else.

But EVE ain't outclassed and is whole different type of cancer\n\n\n\nI compared him to katarina because I feel like katarina lost its niche. Blitz already lost its niche with thresh. Darius anti melee niche is lost by around 1/10 of a league roster.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"five oh tree ","date":"2019-01-16T17:49:59.586+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"https://champion.gg/champion/Pyke/Support\n\n48.64% winrate\n\n8.49% playrate\n\n3.92% banrate\n\nSeems okay.

I currently have mild debates with one of my buddies about Pyke... I feel that the stats support the argument that he's in a decent spot. However, my buddy maintains that he's awful to play against. He *does* have a lot in his kit, especially to play around. \n\nWin rate also doesn't encompass other game health issues, like snowballing. Perhaps Pyke is too oppressive when ahead? I like Jimmy Rustles assertion that perhaps he trades too well; this may make him feel bad to play against even if he's \"balanced\" because he mitigates traditional strategy a bit too hard.","replies":[{"poster":"SpiritOfOdysseus","date":"2019-01-18T00:42:21.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your argument, you make good points.\n\nHowever one thing I must add is when you said, \"Perhaps Pyke is too oppressive when ahead?\" I believe Pyke has too many options to GET ahead since \nFirstly he has godly sustain via his passive, this makes poke nearly imaginary vs him. On the flip side it's almost impossible to make all-ins worth it since most ADCs by default don't do so well with all-ins early and the risks:rewards ratio isn't favorable unless your bot lane is all-in oriented (Leona, Alistar, Lucian,, etc) or your Jungler has something against Pyke early.\n\nHe really has no weakness in bot because of his options, he can escape all-ins and counter with his high dueling power and sustain that takes away moments of weakness. When he is against poke all he has to do is sustain and fish for the damage dealer. So the only option left for the other team are turtle-strats which have been hit with massive nerfs in the near past, and with turret plating as long as pyke can keep enough pressure his side can just peel off free gold. \n\nThat's not even mentioning his ult which is 5-stack darius level insane as an instant and resettable AoE. Darius can't get an execute off a 30% hp target instantly, Urgot's threshold is around 15-20% + non-resettable + is a true skillshot, and Veigar can and is P+C but it isn't resettable either. I really just don't see the logic in how Pyke is \"balanced\" but that's not for me to decide.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
