Else they die 1.5 seconds slower then a squishy does. I Know rammus is an exception but he is viable because the only thing which matters atm is an ADC and he is anti autoattacker\n\n**Edit** I DO NOT WANT %PEN ITEMS TO BE REMOVED. I just want the %Pen nerfed. Give the items which have that other stuff just not %PEN. Make tanks feel tanky \n\n**Edit** Additional note some champions mimmick %dmg reduction with trickster/zhonya like stuff. Maokai W (Really relevant).

Ekko is not viable at my elo So i WONT SAY it is good on him because he is still irelevant despite it. the only reliable ability he has is his E so in his build there are lots of on hit items to support the least trash thing about him\n{{item:3027}}  So you are either Ryze which is an exception and scales of mana or you need so much mana that you are Anivia.

All of them have extra defences in their kits, if they didn't they would just melt as fast as everything ells would. A Naut or Zac would roughly bring the same value as Sej/gragas do, but as they don't have any extra defences in their kit, they are just to squishy for this meta. While % penetration is ofc not the main reason (Hyper-carries/Ardent being broken is that), it amplifies it by making tank items even less value for their bucks.\n\nI don't think removing them is the solution though; you still need a way to kill tanks, but the commitment should be more then 'buy' this item.

Sure, Guise is super strong considering that it’s the only AP item that gives flat MPen with sorcs, but MPen is disgustingly expensive compared to MR. Also, Guise starts as a squishy-bursting item and builds into an item supposed to do... well I don’t know, it gives flat MPen (supposed to work vs squishies) and a %current health damage that suggests to build it against tanks, so it definitely needs more building options or a rework. \n\nAs for Doran’s ring, I think that the last nerf (after tanks abused the mana refund passive) was bigger than everyone thinks.\nSome champions like Morgana used to build more rings to survive laning phase/have a chance to push without going oom before chapter, and now the mana refund is a joke and if you’re behind you’re forced to sit on Doran+dark seal for ages.

They are great items, just not ment for everyone. RoD is fine honestly, as it provides a good amount of AP, health, mana and because of the charging mechanic is pretty cheap. Torment is an item for DoT champs, but as it's the only option for some flat magic penetration everyone buyes it.\n\nThe others spot on. I especially hate deathcap, such a lame excuse of an item to limit mages AP early game scaling.\n\nBut what mages really need is more defined 'build' sets, like how ADC got on-hit build, crit build and Penetration build. Three different build with just some minor overlap, And besides those they got several defensive options; {{item:3155}} for some MR and a shield, {{item:3814}} for some MR and a spell shield, {{item:3139}} for some MR and a cc-removal, {{item:3026}} for some armour and a Ress. Mages got {{item:3157}} for Armour and {{item:3102}} for MR + spellshield.\n\nThe lack of mage items is even cleared if you would look at components that can only be build in to 1 item;\n{{item:3191}} -> {{item:3157}} \n{{item:3136}} -> {{item:3151}} \n{{item:3802}} -> {{item:3165}} \n\nI'm pretty sure AD items don't have any of them.\n\nFor the % penetration items, I don't think they have to be removed, but making it much less of an 'enemy has armour/MR, lets buy last whisper/void' item. That if you opt for going penetration you will deal a lot more damage against tanks then if you wouldn't, but less damage against enemies with low resistance. This would I think be much healthier for the game, as now it's just 'let's buy it and destroy everyone at the same time' item (especially for ADC's).","replies":[]},{"poster":"xxxMadLionxxx","date":"2017-10-17T12:37:40.285+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"It due for an overhaul but i upvote to add pressure to riot.

Similar to Zilean, Veigar isnt really seen as a serious meta  mid pick (though that kinda changed recently) and so the high elo players dont really put effort into their itemization cause in their mind, they're already kinda trolling by playing Veigar. \n\nThat being said, Veigar needs CDR pretty badly and GLP makes it awkward, so I don't advocate it as strongly as I do for Zilean.

Ignoring the fact that Stattik doesn't even give AD and Luden's gives 100 AP, you shouldn't be comparing items across classes. Mages have very different goals compared to marksmen. Mages want to deal damage to the entire enemy team, marksmen want to kill one person while they drain tank off that person. Mages have range, they have more durability, and they have better CC. The large majority of ADC CC is \"AH! Get off of me!\" Mage CC is better for catching someone out and blowing them up from a safe distance.
