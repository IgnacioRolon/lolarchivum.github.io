Then saying \"That'll keep the others down\". A- It's time consuming, expensive, and tracking them down may/may not have problems. B- I can't think of what you could take them to court for. I mean everything about it seems legal. Even though they hide the \"Were not associated with Riot Games\", its still there and legal as far as I know. C- They pop up so much and make sure they do it right. If it were so simple spam-sights wouldnt exist. The others could still think there safe. Even if there was some vialation, Riot can't sue them for \"absurds amounts of money\". They don't get to choose just what ever they want, obviously than they would sue whoever they want and get **_richer_**.","replies":[{"poster":"Whut Thuh ","date":"2016-01-03T05:06:24.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"almost everything about it is illegal. this is comparable to scratching off the gray stuff from the back of giftcards in the store wrighting them down and then selling them for money also copyright infringement if they used the logo or any trademarks of riot games i.e. league logo riot logo any and all copyrighted champion names","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-01-03T08:16:47.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, I dont see anything about it illegal.

When you try to scratch off the grey stuff on the back of a card and write the code or   even just take the card, its not worth anything.

Your quote,\"also you cant always find the source of these websites and if you take them down 2 new ones will pop up in its place so its easier to just put a message to the comunity that says \"its a lie\" then it is to try and shut down all the scammers\" says that you cant always find the IP.
