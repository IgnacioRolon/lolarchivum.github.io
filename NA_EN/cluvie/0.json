The usual suspects are popping up with promises of free RP, free skins, etc. Please **DO NOT** click on these links! What these websites tend to do instead is log your credentials and steal your account. They can also appear harmless, but may have malicious scripts running the background. If you’ve visited any suspicious websites, I would strongly suggest you go ahead and scan your computer with your preferred antivirus program.\n\nAny promotions or events ran will be announced and confirmed by Riot -- www.riotgames.com, www.leagueoflegends.com, or www.lolesports.com.\n\n_**Q: But I entered my username and password into this website! Should I change my password?**_\n\n> A: **YES**! Please change your password immediately. You can change your password by logging into your account management and clicking on change password.\n\n_**Q: I was sent a suspicious link from a friend I trust but I don’t recognize it, what should I do?**_\n\n> A: USE CAUTION! If it’s not hosted on one of the websites above, we cannot ensure your computer’s security if you visit them. Remember, facechecking the web is dangerous, so use your best judgement. Be sure to have your antivirus programs up-to-date.\n\nIf you cannot log into your account at all, you can recover your password by using the password recovery [here](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/protect). Still having issues? Please contact [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nWe also have an extensive Knowledge Base article available with additional tips and tricks on what you can do to ensure your [account is secure](http://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664) Please give [this](http://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664) a thorough read if you have a chance!\n\n\nPS. Thank you for reading this far :)\n\nUPDATE! New support article updated regarding scams/phishing! Check it out [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010154628)!\n\nFun video too!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHJ49zbGOW8","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-10-22T00:21:53.997+0000","up_votes":185,"down_votes":6,"body":"Melledoneus leave mah top comment alone ;-;\n\nJust a warning to all you summoners out there. These links have been popping up mostly in Riot's announcements threads and are disguised with words. For example, one of them said something like \"Wow this is the best change so far!\" but the link took you to a free RP website. The comment underneath was upvoted nearly 50 times using alternate accounts saying \"This was what they showed on the twitch stream right? Yeah this is hella cool.\" \n\nThey get taken down pretty quickly, but Riot can't instantly delete these sorts of things. Just because a comment has upvotes doesn't mean it's legit. Don't click on a link that's disguised with words if it's posted in a thread by Riot. They do that because everybody will see it if Riot posts it. Other threads are usually safe. Anyone who tries to point out its fake gets downvoted like 50 times by the scammers' alt accounts. You can tell, despite the upvotes, because these accounts will never be level 30. \n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"cluvie","date":"2016-10-22T00:31:25.393+0000","up_votes":88,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you!!! <3 !","replies":[{"poster":"Glenn Quagmire","date":"2016-11-08T22:17:29.799+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice summoner icon ;) !","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2016-10-22T11:20:26.523+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"you can hover over a link (even if it's disguised) to see at the bottom left where it will take you","replies":[{"poster":"Silhouetto","date":"2016-10-22T14:28:21.100+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, hovering doesn't always work.

Even if they are on your friends' list. URL's are easily disguised and can link you to malicious adware, spyware, and worse. You may not even notice before it is too late, but by opening unknown links, you run the risk of downloading a program that could record everything you do on your computer including typing in secure information such as usernames, passwords, emails, and even credit card information and send it directly to others for use or sale.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to LoL. NEVER open a distrusted link under ANY circumstances. If you believe you have been compromised, immediately run a diagnostic on your computer and remove any programs from it that were recently downloaded onto it that you do not recognize. Then change your passwords and have your credit cards cancelled and replaced immediately!\n\nIdentity theft is not something that can be combated by companies like Lifelock. They merely present an illusion of security. I've never personally experienced identity theft nor have I attempted it, but I know how easy it is to do it. I will not list any methods here (don't want some noob lord using illegal methods to access anyone's information). Just exercise caution in all things including creating accounts for other web sites.\n\nNot all blank fields are required. Fill in the information needed. If fields require personal information someone could potentially use to steal your identity, then either refrain from creating an account for such sites OR enter false data such as an obviously fake name. Never provide strangers or automated web sites with your phone number, street address, etc. If making online payments for anything, NEVER allow those sites to remember your information. If your account for those sites become compromised then your identity as well as your financial security becomes compromised.\n\nI've never asked for upvotes before, but please upvote this post to spread awareness on this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLXIII","date":"2016-10-22T11:20:52.153+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the Tristana skin was legit...right?","replies":[{"poster":"The Letter H","date":"2016-10-22T17:58:52.986+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"The free Riot girl Tristana and unchained Alistar are all skin promotions from riot, so yes they are legit.\n(If you're talking about a different tristana skin then you're in trouble my friend.)","replies":[{"poster":"hehe u lose","date":"2016-11-23T22:06:51.837+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh and dreadknight garen was free thru twitter I think","replies":[]},{"poster":"NichtHurz","date":"2016-10-22T22:09:26.092+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, always doublecheck such things and look them up on the official riot website.

Their are very simple ways to check if a site is a scam or not. 1.The \"I\" for info on your URL bar will tell you if a site has your permissions (like remembering your password) which most of you will have the official site do. Check that, and if it says \"Permissions not allowed\", its a site going through different servers/proxy (a scam) 2. Fake sites will often say things in the link, such as \"Riotevent' or \"Riotgiveaway\", which is an immediate flag to see it is a scam. The third way, is that whenever a bug is active that causes the yellow/ red \"!\" on the client to appear in the upper left, will also be in the official league websites upper right corner.
