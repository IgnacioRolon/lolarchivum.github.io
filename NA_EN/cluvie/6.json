We&rsquo;d like to provide some insight into how we work with the Dev Relations team to determine which apps are and aren&rsquo;t allowed.\r\n\r\nQuick preface: third party applications are sometimes difficult to classify, and we know that can make it hard at times to find consistency in what we do and don&rsquo;t allow.  We&rsquo;ve tried to stay flexible in our decision making to keep up with the community&rsquo;s innovation, but the lack of clear policy surrounding the use of unapproved apps  just generates confusion. So with that in mind, we&rsquo;d like to set fair expectations by calling out some features that definitely aren&rsquo;t okay.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate our stance on 3rd party applications from about a year ago:\r\n\r\n&gt; **_No software should interfere directly with the in-game player experience between when you press &ldquo;Play&rdquo; and the end of game screen._**\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s been said before, but we absolutely don&rsquo;t like applications that provide measurable player advantage. If there were ever any modification that were to become so standard as to be required for competitive play, the integrity of our environment just wouldn&rsquo;t be viable. You shouldn&rsquo;t ever have to go digging for add-ons just to stay competitive. Some examples of measurable player advantage include:\r\n\r\n* Exposing information that&rsquo;s intentionally obfuscated (cooldowns or timers)\r\n* Taking actions on your behalf (botting or scripting)\r\n* Drawing conclusions for you (predicting enemy positions)\r\n* Otherwise altering your field of intelligence (zoomhacks or global ult alerts)\r\n\r\nFor now, custom models and artwork sit firmly in a &ldquo;use-at-your-own-risk&rdquo; category, but we&rsquo;re keeping an eye on them. We can&rsquo;t optimize for assets we don&rsquo;t develop, and if they do become a concern in the future (ie. they provide measurable player advantage), we&rsquo;ll take action based on the stance we just discussed.\r\n\r\nGray areas aside, there are definitely applications which are blatantly not okay, and while the number of players in this space are very low (think a fraction of a percentage), we remain vigilant and have been handing out punishments to those who show patterns of consistent abuse.  Suspensions will ramp up in duration across multiple offenses and will be accompanied by ranked reward removal where applicable.\r\n\r\nHopefully this post hasn&rsquo;t come across as too doom-and-gloom! The third party ecosystem is full of devs making awesome applications that don&rsquo;t run afoul of any restrictions. Our goal today is just to ensure we&rsquo;re being clear on our end to provide them with peace of mind as they continue to innovate.","replies":[{"poster":"Mody bird","date":"2015-09-28T20:49:38.278+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":"so you guys are starting to detect scripters, right?","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2015-09-28T21:25:37.541+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":6,"body":"Can't be too explicit into when or how, but I'll keep this as informative as I can:\n\nYes.","replies":[{"poster":"butterfli","date":"2015-10-20T10:50:22.548+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":8,"body":"I have also just received a warning with regards to MKLOL / Jogo.

Sounds to me like you agree that this is a massive wasted of time and resources on Riots part.\n\nBecause I am so naive, would you also care to explain how you plan on blacklisting all these Third-Party Services, yet provide the community with such a vague list as to what is not allowed? Sounds to me like not only is Riot's resource management below a sufficient standard, but so is the communication of it's managing administrators. Would it not be logical, if not to show a black-list then to provide us with a white-list? Or is that too much work for the Riot staff, where they would just rather ban the \"problem users\"?\n\nWhen it comes to rules and regulations, Riot needs to come up with a black and white system. Right now all you guys seem to be doing with this issue it muddying the water. Everyone is confused on this topic. You are sending out ban threats with out sufficient information being provide to these users, and on top of that, you are acting like you are solving some major game changing problem when in reality the majority for these app, excluding actual game hacks provide a minuscule and insignificant change to the game. Like I said in my previous post, not only is this a massive waste of time and energy, it is a breach of peoples privacy and moral standings. Rather then fix the game Riot would rather just penalize it's users for automating a manual process that all players have access to. I am mainly talking about MKJOGO.

Curse voice's \"who's talking\" notification overlay is pretty agnostic of the game. While it does line up with the UI of players, it has no affect or impact on it. There is no direct interaction with LoL itself in this context., it would be the exact same experience and interaction if, say, you had Minesweeper being played under it instead.\n\n(Think of it like other voice programs like Teamspeak, Mumble, Skype, etc. They let you know whos talking with an overlay, but even if that overlay is stylized to look like the game in some way.. it's not actually _interacting_ with the game.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zilion187","date":"2015-10-24T11:47:14.799+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK,Riot can i give u some advice, u banned mklol, ok i agree with that even if rly i don't see reason for that except u start loosing money because  of skins.But u should know that many plp use that to buy skins after and some plp just don't have money to buy or don't wanna buy skins because they don't wanna give money for games(in both negative ways u wont  get money because plp wont give u money even if u ban mklol(like i sad early they don't have money or they wont give money for games i mean anygames)), anyway i wanted to give u advice so here it is.

Yes, client sided cosmetics are an actual issue but as someone that doesn't have money to pay for skins it is a method that I can feel satisfied with as in the end everyone just see's the default skin.\n\nJungle timers are disabled, actual game altering tools are disabled.

Some will send you a email. Some will give you a link to download them. I wish someone would work with you guys and make a replay system that records the game and puts it into a folder where you can access it anytime. Because as of now we have a problem.

Some will send you a email. Some will give you a link to download them. I wish someone would work with you guys and make a replay system that records the game and puts it into a folder where you can access it anytime. Because as of now we have a problem. Anytime there is a new patch. The replay has a high chance it wont work if i played a game last week, I want to review it, or make a video. But I cant see it anymore because the patches dont line up.\n> \n> This would fix the issue you would be worried about with the server overload for the replay system that has been talked about. I am not sure on what your guys' plan actually is with this situation. But any transparency would be great as far as a reliable replay system goes. I think working with 3rd party developers closely could help Riot Games move forward with out any stress on your internal systems.\n> \n> Edit: was reading some of this post. And Riot Sargonas said,\n> \n> In short, I clarified that it no longer violated the policies, I did not however give it a clear \"approval\", and I even addressed this later in the thread elsewhere by stating that we did not keep an approved list nor intended to. As Applications can always change by their developer without warning, it's better/safer for us to state what does/does not comply with the rules than it is to give something an \"official seal of approval\" which we might then awkwardly have to retract later due to unexpected changes.\n> \n> Why not have an approved list with SAFE LINKS provided from a riot games website. Anytime there are updates to an approved 3rd party program update it. This is why the Beta prorgam should be there as well.\n> \n> If youre going to allow 3rd party apps. People shouldnt be scared about using them. We really do need a concrete answer as some people worry about the grey area's. And no one wants to make or take a risk if they aren't approved.\n\nThis one is more up my alley than her's, so I'll chime in. (My team handles the 3rd party developer program)\n\nIt's a good idea and something we have explored in the past. Ultimately however we've made the call (and least for now) to not dive into such a program. The problem is that the internet (links) and software (dev apps) are highly dynamic. What we review and approve on one day could the next be highly dangerous, either because the Devs pivoted in a new way,  because their code was infiltrated (much like the recent security flaw that hit WeChat and many other common mobile apps due to malcious code snuck into 3rd party libraries they use), or multiple other concerns. \n\nThe amount of resources it would take for us to police this sort of ecosystem constantly to ensure that the \"safe\" list is 100% always safe is simply too large, especially when you factor in the damage possible by the ONE time that something snuck by. (For comparison, Apple has HUNDREDS of people who review apps for approval 24/7.) Instead, we prefer to create rules that say \"if it fits within these policies it's ok to use, in a policy sense, but the security and safety of your system and account are at your discretion.\" This is also why we prefer to highlight and support web apps and tools that are cloud based, and not ones that require you to download software to your system. (It's also why the most recent API dev challenge required all valid entries to not include downloaded components as well.) Truth be told, people SHOULD be scared about using these (downloaded) software, and we will always highlight that risk and concern. A lot of bad people out there want access to your info, and would love to use the popularity of league to further that agenda given the chance.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatNinetiesKid","date":"2015-09-28T20:39:34.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sargonas,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=5kx4F7VE,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-09-28T20:33:42.985+0000)\n>\n> This one is more my alley than her's, so I'll chime in.

Will you guys let the community know in the future like you did with curse voice? Whats acceptable and what is not? Im just worried about one day hey im using this app. It has been approved then bam someone does what you said and puts in a cool down timer or something. Not knowing I update app. Start a game and bam there it is.
