These level one accounts have been being created and spamming players with links for a lot longer than a couple weeks, i first recall receiving one this past summer. I didn't get any for a while but its started happening to me and several friends of mine again recently. A simple fix to this would be to restrict the ability of accounts that are not at least level 2 from sending messages. Dont restrict the ability to add friends, as a lot of players make a league account for the first time and want to add the friend who recommended the game right away, but disable the chat service for level 1's. If a player is legitimately level one theyll probably be communicating with their friend who got them on league through a voice service like skype or mumble anyway, and not being able to use the chat for all of level one (really isnt that long) isnt such a bad thing. This will greatly discourage spammers and scammers as they wont want to make 100 accounts (or however many) and play on them until they level up to 2. This will also reduce \"trash\" accounts on league that are nothing but taken names and this is a change i hope to see it implemented in the near future.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2014-12-20T22:30:13.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually a good idea, because I stopped accepting \"friend\" requests unless I KNOW FOR A FACT that that person who wants to see me online was in the previous match with me.
