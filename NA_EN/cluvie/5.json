We hear you and have reviewed the most recent actions. We were able to verify the concerns that the community has raised here on the forums as well as reports we received from the Player Support team that let us know something seemed off with the last ban wave. After a deep dive into the actions over the last few days, we were able to identify a mislabel in the system. This led to a few accounts being incorrectly identified as cheating. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that may have been caused.\r\n\r\nWhat are we doing?\r\nIf the account was incorrectly mislabeled, we will be unbanning the account &mdash; an email notice will be sent to the registered email address letting you know that the account was unbanned. As of this post, all accounts that were overturned have been unbanned and emails sent to their accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Trap or a Trick","date":"2017-02-16T02:21:37.758+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":77,"body":"If you mistakenly banned someone's account, will a compensation/ apology be given?

That's *explicitly* the purpose of the voting system, to vote on the value we find in posts. Nobody \"deserves\" anything, it's completely up to ourselves whether or not we vote up or down. \n\nSomeone is acting entitled? I don't agree with it, and I see negative value in a post like that.

I would have been pissed if my account got banned.  I can't imagine you would have been happy if yours was banned either.\n\nAnd downvoting isn't about whether you agree or disagree, it's about whether or not the post is valid or not (at least for Reddit anyways).  Regardless of your opinion, you shouldn't be downvoting for a legitmate question.  You should be downvoting for low effort content that doesn't add meaningful discussion.\n\nAnd for that matter, why are you acting holier-than-thou?  On what grounds are you morally superior?  Being with the majority doesn't mean you're right.  For one thing, people act incredibly entitled when it comes to game balance and are frequently upvoted for it.  Someone asks a legitimate question, not even saying that Riot should compensate players, but only asking if they will, and they get downvoted harshly for it.\n\nHonestly, I don't know why I expect more of any board not named Memes & Games","replies":[{"poster":"Hunted9000","date":"2017-02-16T19:06:47.038+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree with this so much I don't get why that guy was downvoted so heavily even though 90% of league players would be pissed if their account was banned rightfully or not and to think riot banned many people unrightfully they deserve some kind of compensation.

League is a big game, sure, but Blizzard and Kong are also massive enterprises in gaming, with more than one game and platform that problems can occur on, too.
