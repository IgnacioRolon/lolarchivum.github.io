You know why Twitch's stealth was nerfed in the first place?

For a minute long cooldown, it's balanced, for a toggle, it's seriously overpowered (my same gripe with Swain).","replies":[{"poster":"TheRakkun","date":"2015-07-09T13:21:17.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you WOULD know where twitch is because for the first few seconds after he enters invisibility he would leave a trail that basically says \"AIM YOUR SKILLSHOTS HERE\" and the ultimate being a toggle could be balanced by huge mana costs.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-07-09T13:35:54.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skillshots?\n\n{{champion:21}} {{champion:18}} \n\nThe issue here is that he's not just going to be derping around the lane if he uses that to escape. He's going to run under tower.  This was the problem with Twitch that the nerfs addressed.  Now if he takes damage, he's not going to be able to stealth as quickly, giving you a window to kill him.\n\nDoing this would remove that window of counterplay.  Sure you'll be able to bully Twitch out of lane, but you'll never be able to kill him until late game, which is a major issue considering he's a hypercarry.  He has a normal hypercarry power curve.  What you're doing is buffing his early game to Tristana levels with no tradeoff.  He'd just be ridiculously good at all stages of the game.\n\n> the ultimate being a toggle could be balanced by huge mana costs.\n\nYou know why Ahri's ultimate is duration based?  Because if it was a charge system that cost mana each time, she'd turn into Kassadin always having her dash up.\n\nIf Twitch gets that treatment, he'd always have his ridiculous poke up.

The damage can increase to beyond just 6 damage per second, and early game is automatically 1 dps anyway. So, if you get a lot of AD, like 400 or more, the passive now allows 8 damage per second. Someone else asked why it couldn't be 0.04 or 4% of AD, and I said I like to keep it at a low ratio. It'd also allow for a higher early passive. At least 2 damage per second, but it will allow Twitch to keep AA easier. Only needs 200 AD to do 8 damage per second.

His teamfighting is better than Sivir's, Jinx's, and Miss Fortune's easily however aside from that there's not a whole lot of reason to pick him over Vayne.
