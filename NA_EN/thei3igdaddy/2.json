I used to play him a bunch, but relied on \"feel\" rather than knowing exactly how it was hooked up.\n\nI actually think you're significantly mistaken on this point, unless I myself have seriously misunderstood what's happened.\n\n# Old Veigar Stun\nTotal time from button press to cage appearance: 0.25s\n\n* .25s cast delay\n* No \"HEY VEIGAR IS ABOUT TO STUN YOU!\" warning animation\n\nThe old Veigar stun could hit a target with the edge, if you lined it up so that the edge landed on top of them and they didn't move too much during the relatively short time between pushing E and the cage's appearance. This allowed Veigar to stun a target, preventing them from killing him and often allowing him to kill them instead.\n\nIf Veigar failed to land the stun on the edge, of course, nothing prevented the enemy from killing him from inside the cage. Missed stuns tended to very quickly result in gray screens.\n\n# 5.4 Veigar Stun\nTotal time from button press to cage appearance: 1.00s\n\n* .25s cast delay\n* .75s \"HEY VEIGAR IS ABOUT TO STUN YOU!\" warning animation (following .25s cast delay)\n\nThis was a massive change. Before, the cage appeared after the .25s cast delay, stunning anyone standing within the ring surrounding the cage. After this change, the .25s cast delay was followed by a large warning animation that lasted for .75s and showed where the cage would appear, providing an amount of time equivalent to the delay on Cho's Rupture (\"UP you go!\") to step away from the cage. Bear in mind that, unlike Rupture, Event Horizon is not a filled circle but a hollow ring: it only stuns people with the walls. If you're either outside the cage or inside the cage, the ability cannot stun you.\n\nThis change was a huge nerf to Veigar, because it changed his Event Horizon from a stun (albeit one with an awkward hitbox) into at best a zoning ability that could force an enemy to stay inside a fairly spacious cage.\n\nThey did give it a little extra range; I think 50 units, or half a Teemo.\n\n# 5.5 Veigar Stun\nTotal time from button press to cage appearance: 0.75s\n\n* .75s \"HEY VEIGAR IS ABOUT TO STUN YOU!\" warning animation \n* No separate cast delay (though presumably there's still a .25s window during which you can kill or stun Veigar to prevent his cage from appearing at all).\n* Stops dashes\n\nThe dash-stopping is nice; before, people could Caitlyn net or whatever throw the wall, landing on the other side (right in Veigar's face) stunned but close enough to promptly kill him after recovering.\n\nHowever, the primary nerf is still there: there is still a Rupture-length delay during which all an enemy need do is walk a few steps in any direction to avoid being stunned. If the edge isn't placed on top of them, it's even easier: they have a full .75s to **not walk into the slowly appearing walls.**\n\nWhy does this matter? Well, it means that Veigar's Event Horizon at best can force an enemy to stand in the cage and fight him. That's not really a great scenario for Veigar. Actually, that's usually the scenario that Veigar is trying to escape.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2015-03-12T01:15:24.014+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">it means that Veigar's Event Horizon at best can force an enemy to stand in the cage and fight him.

I think that's a truly fundamental flaw.\n\nI disagree. Just because they don't get stunned doesn't mean you didn't do anything. You forced movement, course changes, you got in their way. This is the original purpose of the spell. If veigar was supposed to have a skillshot stun, he could have one. He doesn't. He has a cage that stuns enemies who touch the walls. They will in fact only be stunned if they hit the wall, I don't think this is a flaw. The purpose isn't the stun; its the cage. That old veigar just used it for the stun was really a design flaw of the champion.\n\n>It bears mentioning that these changes were meant to be \"compensation buffs\" for the removal of DFG, widely considered Veigar's core item.\n\nI actually do not think it does. They had an event (DFG removal) that finally forced their hand and they had to at least change veigar. They are trying to put him in a place that allows him to be healthy for the game. Growing pains are to be expected. Especially for a champ like veigar, who was designed on old  goals and directives, this was gonna suck. I actually found the core ideas behind the changes to be brilliant though. They just shouldn't have been so conservative with their first iteration.\n\n>The reasons why he's no longer any good at dueling also make it even harder for him to survive lane.\n\nI again disagree. When spaced properly, yeah your enemy will avoid the stun, but a defensive E can still force the enemy to disengage, and Q still can last hit from 200 more distance than it used to be able to.\nSurviving lane has always been the challenge with veigar, but he still has the tools to do it.\n\n>He could also use the threat of a full-rotation 100-0 burst to keep the enemy at bay, once he got fed enough to credibly threaten that.\n\nHe still has that threat. He just doesn't get to do if for free just because the enemy is wtihin 1050 range. (I know it was hard to actually do this as veigar, but he was capable of it, and had to be balanced around that.\n\nEscape horizon is still perfectly strong for ganking or escaping. It just requires a little more planning and a little less reaction time.\n\n>When I tried new Veigar, the enemy mid let me free-farm my Q without trouble, but I have absolutely no idea why they did. I was playing in Normal queue, which might explain it. I cannot imagine a Gold mid letting Veigar free-farm after these changes.\n\nI won't lie, he did get weaker. That said, part of why you get to farm is because if they try to put themselves between you and your minions, they eat a baleful strike, AND YOU STILL GET THE MINION! Also you likely have a new wave of minions who will happily push a low level champion back behind their minion line. Truly zoning veigar out early on has actually gotten more difficult for enemies. In exchange landing aggressive stuns is much much harder. Its still great for ganking. Veigar dropping you inside of his cage during a gank is still a death sentence. You might get to wiggle around inside it, but he and his team are still gonna kill you.","replies":[{"poster":"BuCkeT SeiZureS","date":"2015-03-12T04:19:17.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hate to tell you this, but you clearly did not play veigar. Here are the things you are correct about.\nHis Q can harass and farm minions at the same time\nHis Old E was toxic (stupidly OP)\nHe is weaker\n\nHere are things you are incorrect about.\nVeigar being useful in a teamfight with his cage: people will not be stunned in his cage because there is a telegraphed warning before hand. While they cannot dash away once the cage is up, they can dash/ walk away during the warning. in order to get close enough to truly trap them, they SHOULD have the presence of mind to notice your intention.\n\nIt doesn't matter that these were supposed to be compensation for dfg removal: Veigar is a burst mage. While he did not NEED Dfg, he certainly used it well. You realize that, unless removing dfg was a straight buff for veigar, these changes were clearly in the wrong direction. \n\nEvent horizon is still good for escaping and ganking: This is flat out false. a lot happens in .75 seconds, including your death and movement. while stopping dashes will help, most people will be on top of you or completely gone by the time your walls trigger. it is very difficult to plan a full second ahead in League of legends, not to mention that now your moves are being telegraphed and they are the ones reacting. A veigar player now cannot win, only the opponent can lose.\n\nZoning is harder against a veigar: Also just completely wrong. before you would have to worry about a stun followed up by lots of damage if you got too aggressive. now dont have to worry about that at all. and the minions argument you bring up is only relevant for VERY early game. Veigar's Q was mainly used for harass, not for farm. now there is no reason for an enemy to not spend their laning phase making you miserable, because you really cant punish them. a gank can help you out, but they just need to buy wards. easy. Veigar has 0 lane pressure now. His baleful strike also mow pushes the wave with hitting two minions. that is not something you want because if you are ganked, you are dead. veigar waddles very slowly and only incompetent junglers will not kill you unless you burn flash.\n\nCatching someone inside the cage is a good thing: Back when Veigar had dfg, catching someone in the cage was a VERY bad thing. In fact, it was considered a missed stun. so that has not changed. While, yes, it can work out if your team is there, there is not one circumstance where it works out well for veigar in a 1v1. He will die 90% of the time. now, not only is it harder to stun someone, but also harder to trap them in the cage. and even harder to land your damage (W was only good for waveclear or if you landed your stun). So yet another completely false fact you have presented. \n\nVeigar has the tools to survive lane: Where are you getting these facts? Sadly, no veigar does not have the tools to survive lane. he is EXTREMELY passive now, which is easily punishable. He is made of wet paper, so he dies very easily. but now he cant even say for people to back off of him. he doesnt have the damage (nerfed ultimate and useless W) and he doesnt have the CC. So why would anyone not just jump on you, since your only damage now is auto attacks.\n\nOne comment on something you said. \"Yes he is weaker.\" \nVeigar had around a 48-49% winrate pre 5.4. making him weaker is not an okay thing. champions falling below 40% winrate (30% in diamond) is not something that will be sorted out with time. It means the character is bad and needs work.\n\nI think that is enough for now. I don't like calling you out like that, but you clearly are a bystander, not an experienced player here. While i may not be great, you can listen to players like NyJacky and DaBox (challenger level veigars) that say there is no reason to pick veigar. Growing pains may be a part of some changes, but i can imagine you saying that to Azir players when he was 38% winrate.

You can't be expected to just drop them the moment anyone moves towards. The moment Veigar casts his cage, it's a really long time. He simply has positioning tools. It is fine if they wanted to steer towards keeping enemies away from you, but his Kit doesn't support that. There needs to be more change to his W. Right now, a person can literally dodge a Q and W while in the confinements of the cage. It is a very heartbreaking thing to watch, and I've only seen it in two games.\n\n> Hows Nyjacky been? He was the last player I know of to ever play veigar professionally. He lost when he did it. To a Casseopiea I believe.\n\nForget Nyjacky. Veigar's been used in Korean Solo Queue for close to 2 years. It's only recently been used in LPL, and then the change happened 2 weeks later. Have you ever watched Pawn use him mid? He was never as bad as say \"Brand\", who has never seen competitive play.\n\n> Also, what in god's name was the reason to pick him before?

Veigar can be stronger now, because his kit isn't any longer balanced around being able to make a target disappear without warning from a long distance away.\n\n That was kind of his niche. That's how he was intended to be played. The MAJOR difference between him and Annie is that he didn't need flash to initiate a fight, his CC range is much better. Believe it or not, his stun was a HUGE factor to pick him. His laning wasn't actually horrible before. It's just horrible now. And unlike Annie, his combo was a guaranteed death to whoever he targeted. Annie must use all of her abilities for the kill. Late game, Veigar uses his R alone and can focus his other abilities on other champions.\n\n> The form he existed in **wasn't really viable**. They are taking the time to really fix him.

It's a ground insignia that lights up. A low warning stun is like Taric's Dazzle particle, or Annie's passive. Plus 30 dmg does nothing if he STILL cannot land it on anyone. And realistically Riot has never given AoE CC a reduction of cooldown of more than 1 second on a non-ultimate, they will never do it.\n\n> How exactly? Playing from behind your minion lane and farming from as far as you can is actually the hardest thing in league to punish. And veigar gets more out of his farming dollar than anyone.\n\nHe is EXTREMELY passive now. You insta-push your lane using Q because you're forced to hit two minions every time now. The last thing veigar wants is to be the pusher. Later in the game the push is good, but early on it's a detriment to him vs any popular mids now.","replies":[{"poster":"Blkninjar87","date":"2015-03-12T20:38:11.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate how when people mention veigar nefs they make it seem as if veigar cant do anything at all.

Is that a short joke ? \nUlt range is Caitlyn AA range, you can't land your W any more unless Leona is in your team, Q is 850 (long range, really ?) and can be blocked by minions.\n\n> If you can't play viegar, and farm up AP while building AP, and doing immense damage with your ult alone u probably shouldnt be playing leagues.\n\nOh then teach me, master, how you build AP when you can't get a kill in lane (cause no reliable CC), you can't push to roam (cause no reliable escape), and can only farm under turret while your opponent is free to do as he wants ?  \nDoing \"immense damage\" with your ult has never been enough. Because you have 650 range on it, and it won't OS anyone without another spell, unless the APC is a retard building 700 AP with no MR/Zhonya.\n\nLove how people knows better than you how to play veigar, when they obviously don't play him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PKnowledge","date":"2015-03-12T15:46:16.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stopped reading at \"Beat me\" + Q.Q you don't want to discuss\nWell at least I should have, since everything you said after that clearly shows that you did not try to play the new Veigar.

AND PLAY HIM.\n\nVeigar's old stun was COMPLETELY broken, however the fact remains that he was also completely dependent on said stun in the same way that old Xerath was completely dependent on his, and Malzahar is dependent upon is ult.\n\nCurrent stun now has a .50 second delay in total (.25 seconds longer than pre-5.4 veigar, and half a second shorter than 5.4 veigar). Meddler already said if he still underpreforms, they have other ways to buff him (notably making his W have less of a delay).","replies":[{"poster":"PKnowledge","date":"2015-03-12T23:59:26.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Current stun now has a .50 second delay in total (.25 seconds longer than pre-5.4 veigar, and half a second shorter than 5.4 veigar).
