Oh... the passive? \nI see. \n\nShe has sub 340 MS. Its like 325 or something? \nHer KIT, aside from the passive, has no mobility in it. Her stats have no mobility in them either. \n\nWithout her passive, which you morons want to gut without realizing that removing the T2 scaling makes her \"INFINITE KITE LELELELELEL OP!!!!11!!!!!1\" a thing. Removing the T2 scaling fixes the problem. \nThe rest of her kit is great and not overpowered; its literally only her T2 boot scaling that pushes her passive into stronger than it should be areas.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grand Eleven","date":"2015-02-10T04:50:41.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".... suddenly?\n\nShe was complained about on PBE before she ever went live, there was nothing sudden about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jalkan","date":"2015-02-10T04:47:56.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remove it from the game...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-10T04:46:43.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's abused in NA and that's about it.
