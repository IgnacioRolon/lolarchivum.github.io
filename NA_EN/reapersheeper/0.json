Sometimes I can rejoin the game after several minutes, when i try to reconnect for multiple times. The symptoms are same - black loading screen (sometimes it flashes with actual loading screen when I tab+alt). \nSometimes I join the game for a moment (I can hear ambient sounds, announcer etc.), but after that it crashes and bugsplat pops up again. Tried to reinstall client and repeir client. Problem started few days ago when client showed that some players have issue to join games. \nI waited for the patch, but it didn't help.\n\nJust to clarify, I had no connection issues before or after. Only thing I changed was NVIDIA update (ver. 368.81)\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, I reinstalled graphic drivers and repaired client again and the problem seems to be gone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ReaperSheeper","date":"2016-07-29T20:29:29.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ye it gives me an error message that says \" Unable to connect to the server.

A black screen like the one you mention is usually due to a network issue failing to connect to your game server.  The error message further proves this may be the case.  As a first step, please look over the instructions in our [connections ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)issues guide to resolve this.  I also recommend testing this out in a custom game to avoid any problems.
