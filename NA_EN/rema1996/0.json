Since it's really old, it has problem with mouse wheel. What happens in game, is that mouse randomly starts to zoom in, which makes me problems in team fights or etc. Knowing that there isn't any option to disable zoom in game, I tried disabling mouse wheel via regedit, which disabled it on computer, but didn't disable it in game, zooming still works... I've also tried to paste rollersbuttonspeed=0 in input.ini file in LeagueofLegends/config, but it is still working. So, does anybody have an idea how to disable zoom in game ? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T16:25:42.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some bindings are reserved and cannot be adjusted, even if it might be disabled outside of game.  Your best bet may be to swap your mouse to rule out the possibility of your mouse having hardware issues.  It may be time for a new mouse, if that's the case.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"ReMa1996","date":"2016-10-19T18:17:24.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Cute LB","date":"2016-10-21T08:06:42.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just found a fix for it. \nGo to the PersistedSettings.json\nOpen it with notepad\nGo to where you pasted RollerButtonSpeed=0\nChange 0 to 1\nSave it\nRestart LoL client\n\nAlso can you change to title to SOLVED if this works for you? Because I have scavenging the net for a fix and nothing worked until I tried this out.","replies":[{"poster":"Kung Fu PÂªnda","date":"2017-05-22T23:10:18.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question for this.
