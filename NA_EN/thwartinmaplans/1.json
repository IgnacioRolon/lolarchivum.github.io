Compare Poppy's rework; every skin Poppy has right now is an update of her older skins with new visuals and splash screens. Those who have bought Lollipoppy before the update still have Lollipoppy, the only difference being that the Lollipoppy skin they had then and the one they have now don't look the same, as they were updated. The same goes for Shen's update and Shen's skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-01-30T07:49:35.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i see ty","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solo Josh","date":"2016-01-29T19:09:00.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GodKing Thumper","date":"2016-01-29T22:07:25.277+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got a problem with Taric's fabulousness??

After all, Poppy was a bruiser, she remained a bruiser. Shen was a tank, he remained a tank.
