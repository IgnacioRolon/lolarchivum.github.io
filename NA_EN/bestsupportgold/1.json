I'm tired of watching my teammates troll each other because someone told them to ward, or not over extend or chase.

At least if the people in the lower ELO of pay to play RANKED it wouldn't be as hard as it is now. It took a lot to make it up where I did. I grew a lot, and learned a lot. I consider it an accomplishment. This preseason I climbed in a quarter of the time, I know there will be a soft reset, but my game play and mechanics have improved. That however, doesn't stop some of the match ups I get paired with. I'm equally  to blame as my team, I recognize when I make a mistake and I own them, I don't blame.

Just stfu and accept your arrogance and elitist stupidity.\n\nWell, Heres what i don't understand. Your time playing this game is irrelevant. Considering league has been evolving since its creation, in many different ways. Which makes it one of the most unique games on the market. Each season their are heavy changes, and even during the season their are micro to macro adjustments that impact how the game is played.   Your time playing this game, is irrelevant, when we look at constructing a future reliable form of competitive play.\n\nSome may not like it, but I recall playing cs 1.6, source and even csgo(when it first game out). I was forced into paying for esea to play a hate free and highly competitive game. Thats what happens when games evolve, you have to find a way of breaking through the rough fringe, and money happens to be a great way at forging a barrier. \n\n\nFor this you would have normals, Ranked and the newly payed subscription league. I will call it champions to illustrate my point.\n\nYou create the champions que, which is subscription based, The money generated from it is directly given to those playing league of legends professionally. As a way of generating income for them, and removing the so called issue MonteCristo has posted. You make it an option feature in a free to play game, and do not create any strife with players of your social economical group or area. That way, players like myself and heldon, can play a highly competitive game separate from those who have no sense of moral responsibility, who treat players like humans and not animals.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this Ztrad? What if the payed feature was optional, just like buying a skin and the rewards for that league are just a slightly modified banner, or summoner icon?","replies":[{"poster":"Strad","date":"2016-11-20T20:43:25.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I meant by mentioning my extended time playing this game is that suddenly something I had access to for 6 years and enjoyed, would be gone. I don't see how that is fair.\n\nHaving it as simply an option would actually be rather interesting, especially as it would directly benefit the professional scene due to it's horrendous economy for team owners. I think new borders/banners/icons would be great for a special paid queue as it would be your way of getting something back after dropping a bunch of cash into the game. I would take part in that kind of \"champions queue\" if I had the money. The only thing I would hope would not happen: making that the queue that everything is based off of. I would still want the main queue to be the main queue, with paid queue on the side.\n\nActually, why not just allow people to have a subscription, and get special banners/borders within the current ranked system? Everyone would still play within the same queue, but have different rewards. BETTER rewards for having the subscription. That way there is no segregation of those who can and cannot afford a certain queue while also avoiding ridiculous queue times in both queues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BestSupportGold","date":"2016-11-20T18:19:50.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ztrad,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=a1Vrg33Z,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2016-11-20T18:18:27.521+0000)\n>\n> \n\nActually, you're the type of person that grieves others.

I'm not sure what problem's you've had to do, and for those I'm sorry, but looking up someones account history is no means of proving your faulty assumption on a suggestion.\n\nSince you enjoy personalizing, I'll use you as an example. You Don't play ranked. Your account history shows you don't play ranked, and as much as you could tell me its a smurf or new account, I doubt it. Your sheer disrespect, infers, not makes me presume you've had one or several accounts banned from league.","replies":[{"poster":"Strad","date":"2016-11-21T20:46:59.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are correct about everything except for my accounts being banned.

My attitude is and was not trash, and my income has nothing to do with any of this. Simply put, an optional as stated in the OP, pay to play Ranked queue for $7 a month, doesn't break the bank.\n\nI don't want to remove them, I don't want to play with them, and implementing an optional form of playing this game will put me and other people in who feel the same way at ease. I don't blame my team, I don't harass, or BM, I do the opposite. I encourage, I deescalate the situations, and it still blows up in my face. \n\nIt will benefit me as a player, I won't have to be punished because 2 people on my team are fighting and grieving each other. I won't have to be punished because one person is tilted prior to joining the game, and I won't have to get that casual \"it's just a game\" player. I will be with people who are fighting to climb, and take the game seriously.\n\nYou took this post, and made it about money. You missed the entire point, because you're \"poor\". And you missed the part where I said there would still be a normal ranked queue. You cherry picked what you wanted out of the post, and then went on to harass the point I was trying to make. You and many others are the people I would love to avoid in game, based on your toxic responses, I know that's how you are in Ranked. \n\nI've learned a lot to climb to Silver 2. It was a tough challenge. I want to go higher, and I'm working on it. I make mistakes, I learn from them, I try to help others in game, but everyone takes advice like an attack. I don't want to deal with them, so if a pay to play option was available, I'd be happy.\n\nMy sole goal is to improve and advance, I've been playing since S3 and I've come a long way, and I've spent money on skins because I enjoy the game and playing it. I don't know where you think narcissism has anything to do with someone who wants to improve my game play by playing with people who take it seriously. That is just dedication to the game. You're a relaxed gamer, and clearly it doesn't mean much to you, hence your opposition to the post, and toxic views.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Strad","date":"2016-11-20T18:19:49.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed. ty","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-20T18:07:23.638+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want a perfect team experience, form up a team yourself.

It would kill it for people who want to just play ranked as a casual player, not really caring if they get promoted or demoted. This is designed for people who are on board with my overall point. \nMost of the people negatively commenting on this post, are the target group of people that would be avoided in the new Ranked system. If they're this toxic on a post, that Riot won't see, imagine how toxic they are in game when their teammates makes an error.\nThat is a dead giveaway.
