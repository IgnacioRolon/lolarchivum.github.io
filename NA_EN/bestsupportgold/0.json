I usually try to build around the team. But from what people tell me, it's more of a thing in Hight ELO's. I'm ahead of my league here. I'm starting to abandon that mentality of building around the team, and to just dish out damage while providing peel for the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Tundra Hunter","date":"2017-03-29T02:00:41.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a great idea. \nI used to play Annie support when I was Silver/Gold, it worked very well. \nJust get sighstone to ward, but other than that, you can get fed by getting tons of kill botlane, then roam and kill everywhere, and be like a 2nd mid carry without taking any cs. \n\nIt works, but to me, it's not the most interesting way to play league. \nSadly, that's what work at low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"BestSupportGold","date":"2017-03-29T13:20:54.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tundra Hunter,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ef9k0Y9l,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2017-03-29T02:00:41.369+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s a great idea. \n> I used to play Annie support when I was Silver/Gold, it worked very well. \n> Just get sighstone to ward, but other than that, you can get fed by getting tons of kill botlane, then roam and kill everywhere, and be like a 2nd mid carry without taking any cs. \n> \n> It works, but to me, it&#x27;s not the most interesting way to play league. \n> Sadly, that&#x27;s what work at low elo.\n\nI have enjoyed playing Lulu.

I still think your good if you made it low plat, and this is coming from high silver. I will start going back to my roots, I usually choose the support tank because we will have a squishy team comp, or if we lack the CC. I understand that damage is a primary focus for mid game. I will revisit Janna, I've gone up against some pretty good ones, and she has a great kit!","replies":[{"poster":"Lucian Waifu","date":"2017-03-28T21:59:22.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Janna is amazing if you have one good carry, doesn't have to be the adc, because she makes them nearly impossible to kill if that person isn't crazy and try to engage all the time without the support.

I use the LOLSUMO app, (Not entirely sure how accurate it is, I've tried to find sources for each claim) but most all of my performances are Plat/Diamond.\nI used Lulu last game, and I did relatively great. 0/2/16 we had 24 team kills when we won.

For example, you have your jungler coming down to gank and the river isn't warded, so he's going to go in. Your job is to push W and *walk up* to the enemy with your E, then using hook to grab them after they likely flash or something. Otherwise you want to prioritize landing hooks, especially vs. ranged supports. Blitz does not do well vs. tank supports, so you should probably switch to Braum/Thresh if possible on those cases.\n\nAs with any champion, spectate high elo vids and see how they play the early game, note where they are on the map at mid-game and most importantly what objectives are up.

I typically took the tanks for CC or because we lack the tank presence. But I see what you're saying. I will have to go back to my mage roots. Last season and one prior I had high win rates with Lulu, Karma and Soraka. It also helped me climb then too. I started going as ADC because I found myself losing more games as Support. I don't often pass blame, but I have had a string of incompetent ADCs who when they get behind, despite informing them to just farm it out to catch up, they often try to engage and solo kill and tilt themselves. It happens, I am one to deescalate the situation always. I believe you can always claw back in it. Sadly, this mentality is not often shared.\nI use Ashe and Trist as they have good engage and disengage and with Trist's resets, it makes hopping in and out of team fights good. As with Ashe, landing a good arrow can turn a fight. I have decent ADC mechanics, there are just times where that is not enough. I make mistakes, and I own up to them, but sometimes a careless mistake can cost the game.\n\nI've been on forums, Youtube, etc looking for good Support stuff, and sadly there aren't any on Twitch anymore.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-03-28T19:09:57.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I'm just getting back into ranked.
