Im no lawyer, but I imagine they want insurmountable proof that someone is breaking the law before they sue them. So they track em, and shut down entire operations at a time, instead of one measley account at a time. Just try to think of it realistically... one company against thousands of botters, creating thousands of accounts. Its impossible to keep up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2019-01-10T04:02:13.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what are 3s?","replies":[{"poster":"Kaz Vorpal","date":"2019-01-29T20:57:30.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Three player ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ps4SAOAsuna","date":"2019-01-10T09:27:26.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=huOLTwyE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-10T04:02:13.883+0000)\n>\n> what are 3s?\n\nThe twisted treeline.
