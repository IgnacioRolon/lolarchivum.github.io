And I mean, it wasn't just one champion [that synergized with kai'sa], they nerfed more than one, actually.\n\nBut the worst of this stupid ideology of balance is that they buffed other ones that are good \"against\" kai'sa - Meanwhile they are played with her. Doesn't make any sense, and the proof that their way of balancing the game is wrong and \"futile\" speaks for itself. A second staring at the game is enough to reach that conclusion. \n\n_By the way, people can downvote me to hell, the truth is they will upvote the next vote for saying the same thing I said but under different words. - Hypocrisy at its best, or easily-persuaded minds, your call._","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Teemo Gromp","date":"2018-10-11T15:59:40.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot MapleNectar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=v82HELEA,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-10-10T22:55:50.103+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re definitely right in that it was a mistake made by Riot!
