Now that most if not all of the bugs were solved, I can't switch to the new league client. The notification asking if I want to update the client does not appear and I can't find anywhere else in the game where I could update it. Not sure if a bug or if I would have to completely re-install League to get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T22:26:05.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The option to update the client should show up on your patcher before launching the client.  What options do you see visible there?  There should be one on the top right called \"League Client Update Open Beta.\"  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Galvatron","date":"2017-02-16T23:01:09.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to restart the client and it popped up.
