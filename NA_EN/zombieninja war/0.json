For a couple of reasons I think it would definitely make sense. First off, due to the priorities mid lane, it would make sense to have the most pressure there and (as you said) it would give you more safety and ward potential since there are various directions ganks could come from. This would also lend to the idea of the \"roaming support\" which has become far more popular and effective. I think there are definitely positives to it. I think this would also help eliminate the \"Top lane island\" idea as well. I think you will see things continue to shift to helping the entire team more and more as the game continues to grow. Glad someone posted something like this. Trying to think of new ways to improve the game. \n\nIf you want to queue up and try it im down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-07-20T22:21:43.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been thinking of a situation like this would be a better idea:\nTOP: Marksman\nMID: Mage/Assassin (Same as now)\nBOT: Tank/Bruiser\nJungler #1: Bruiser/AP junglers \nJungler #2: Tank junglers \n\nThis could basically eliminate the opposing jungler from the game, allow the carries to have 1v1 lanes, and let ganks be easy. You could also fake out an opponent by bringing Nautilus or Alistar jungle (because they can work).

The jungle would have 3 junglers with only enough xp/gold for 2. The problem is the two junglers would have to take camps together of they would have messed up buffs and such, and to invade, because of loss of level from two junglers, they would have to invade together or have one permanent in the the jungle.

Your Marksman/Supp is bot to maintain drag control, and your bruiser/tank is top due to the durability of the champs and the fact that most games are mid/bot centered leaving top on an 'island'.\n\nThe Chinese and Korean's have moved their bot lane mid, but only in cases where they wanted to avoid the opposing duo and starve out the champ they were playing in to, so it's pretty situational.  Also, another adaptation to the NA meta on a professional level has been the roaming supports.  Essentially this is in line with your double jungle idea, but the champ doing it is generally more able to stay relevant due to the fact that their utility is more useful than gold/levels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matthias9119","date":"2015-07-22T01:15:48.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest reason for not putting the duo lane mid is that you normally don't want your ADC to roam, you want them to farm.  Mages and \"AD Casters\" in particular scale better with levels than items early on, so a typical midlaner that gets ahead can exert pressure on the other lanes by roaming and not really be set behind when you get to teamfighting.\n\nIf you run duo mid and have the support roam then the ADC is extremely vulnerable to being ganked.  They wouldn't be able to fight 1v2 if the other team mirrored you and went duo mid as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-07-20T23:26:19.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that having the tank/bruiser in mid and ADC/support bot would be a lot better.\n\nThe big reasoning is that a tank/bruiser is going to get bullied against an ADC/support combo worse than they get bullied in the mid lane by a mage, or they can be really good counters to some assassins that see play in the mid lane.","replies":[{"poster":"ZombieNinja War","date":"2015-07-21T14:57:52.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Lcs the do lane swaps all the time depending on the champ they can hold there own. and with adc and support being mid they could gank for him.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2015-07-22T00:10:43.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But in those games they still lose out on a lot of farm because the support can harass the bruiser/tank with impunity, and the bruisers/tanks used there can't always get farm at all, and those that could were the only ones viable in competitive play.\n\nIf anything, the support would roam bot and stay in bot to help the bruiser, which may not be the best thing. I haven't been playing long, but if I'm not mistaken at one point the meta in NA had a bruiser/support in the bot lane until season 1 worlds, where the EU teams ran an ADC/support bot lane and did very well against the NA bruiser/support bot lanes.

By placing the adc in mid lane, you already make it easier for them to get farm since the lane is smaller. Having the support there for the entire lane is kind of pointless. Its better to place the support in the side lanes where dying is a bigger threat so if you team the support up with a bruiser/tank or champion that can duel, you have a much better pairing.","replies":[]}]}
