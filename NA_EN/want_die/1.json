No message or anything pops up, and the client will be frozen for roughly a minute, which is just enough time for the team to vote to remake. Coupled with the actual disconnect bug that's been going around, I've been given a leaverbuster. Is anyone else experiencing this problem? I've tried restarting, using the hextech repair tool, and the client settings option to check files, but nothing's come up. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-13T18:48:15.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are your drivers up to date?
