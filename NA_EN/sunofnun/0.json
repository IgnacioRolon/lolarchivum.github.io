My teammate, a lux, couldn&#039;t  get any of the cs so he decided to intentionally feed. And my opposing yasuo and leesin happily took what kills they could, and felt it was necessary to trash talk me while doing so, pointing out how they (obviously) had more kills than me. Of course I didn&#039;t take their insults toward my gameplay happily and lashed back at them and insulted my scumbag teammate lux as well. \r\nThis is the dialogue from that game:\r\n\r\nSunOfNun: ?\r\nSunOfNun: is lux trolling?\r\nSunOfNun: i called mid\r\nSunOfNun: k\r\nSunOfNun: reported\r\nSunOfNun: same\r\nSunOfNun: just leave lux you&#039;re making this hard on me for no reason\r\nSunOfNun: you have 3 cs\r\nSunOfNun: and you make it so that neither of us can get it\r\nSunOfNun: just leave please\r\nSunOfNun: thanks\r\nSunOfNun: all you do is auto attack\r\nSunOfNun: and get nothing\r\nSunOfNun: just leave pls\r\nSunOfNun: pls stop trolling this lane\r\nSunOfNun: pls report lux &lt;---- when lux started inting\r\nSunOfNun: report\r\nSunOfNun: lux\r\nSunOfNun: pls\r\nSunOfNun: lmao\r\nSunOfNun: couldn&#039;t get any cs\r\nSunOfNun: so you decide to int\r\nSunOfNun: great\r\nSunOfNun: pls report\r\nSunOfNun: lmao pissed cuz she can&#039;t get a single cs\r\nSunOfNun: you&#039;re lucky this inbred retard is feeding you\r\nSunOfNun: also you&#039;re a pos for taking the free kills\r\nSunOfNun: ?\r\nSunOfNun: you&#039;ve been unable to dodge a single nado\r\nSunOfNun: nt tho\r\nSunOfNun: take advantage of what you can\r\nSunOfNun: because clearly you lack the skill to win this matchup\r\nSunOfNun: thanks\r\nSunOfNun: lmfao you can&#039;t\r\nSunOfNun: ?\r\nSunOfNun: i dumpstered you in a 1v1 situation\r\nSunOfNun: hell i whooped you 1v2\r\nSunOfNun: don&#039;t even try me kid\r\nSunOfNun: lmao\r\nSunOfNun: dont waste my time\r\nSunOfNun: already did\r\nSunOfNun: already won\r\nSunOfNun: ez\r\nSunOfNun: gj\r\nSunOfNun: lmao except not only did i whoop you\r\nSunOfNun: i even whooped you with lux feeding u\r\nSunOfNun: nt kiddo\r\nSunOfNun: get stomped\r\nSunOfNun: nt kiddos\r\nSunOfNun: funny that you need your butt buddy here from the same clan to back you up\r\nSunOfNun: since anyone with half a brain can see that you&#039;re trash\r\nSunOfNun: better send 4\r\nSunOfNun: nt kid\r\nSunOfNun: ?\r\nSunOfNun: gl winning lane next time bud\r\n\r\nGiven the back story of that game, as well as my dialogue, I am completely confused as to how this constitutes a permanent ban. I was by no mean nice to the yasuo, leesin, and lux, but if anyone thinks they deserve kindness for how they acted during the entirety of that game then I want no part of this community any longer.\r\nIf anyone has any ideas as to how to reach out to someone how can potentially lift this ban please let me know, since this punishment is outrageous.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-05-18T00:41:21.586+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you are posting chat logs to give context, you should post both chat logs that were given.\n\nBecause you have a lot of penalties (3 alone in the last month), the question is whether these 2 chat logs would warrant a chat restriction.

But you get in trouble for being a jerk...... You can just mute and ignore and have nothing happen. You do not have to say anything if you do not have something nice to say. If you say something not nice, then expect consequences. This is especially true since YOU WERE PUNISHED MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE, FOR THE VERY SAME AND EXACT REASON YOU WERE BANNED!\n\nHope this helps.\n\nNo, nobody is going to help you get your account unbanned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-05-17T02:23:00.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I have been punished maybe 3 times with chat restrictions and one 14 day ban over the span of the last year, so I am by no means a constant repeat offender but I can be blunt toward teammates.\n\nGetting the 10 game chat restriction, the 25 game chat restriction, and the 14 day ban means Riot does consider you a constant repeat offender. \n\n> For the situation of this game in particular\n\nWas that the only game or did you have more in your log?","replies":[{"poster":"SunOfNun","date":"2017-05-17T02:24:00.920+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"this is the one i got banned for, also 3 punishments over the span of a year is pretty low I thought, but maybe I'm wrong","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-05-17T02:31:42.431+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ideal (and certainly manageable) is 0 punishments over a year.\n\nThe punishment system has 4 tiers (you've hit all of them at this point). You can drop down a tier, hitting the 10 game chat restriction twice instead of getting bumped up to a 25 game chat restriction (as an example), so that's the second best situation to be in.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
