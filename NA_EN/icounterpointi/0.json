Everything loaded fine and entered ranked. Draft went fine. When the game began I couldn't connect because 'Direct X error, graphics driver' something-or-other. I looked up explanations on Youtube and tried three suggestions. None worked. \r\n\r\nI headed to Riot Support to submit a ticket. Riot Support would not let me log in. The submit ticket screen says I have to login to submit that type of ticket, but when I click login it enters me into a never ending loop until I arrive back at the screen that initially asked me to login. \r\n\r\nI appreciate any and all help with either of these issue. I just want to play some League. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nICounterPointI","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T21:54:32.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really weird it's not letting you login to the ticketing center, but you can also reach out to us via support@riotames.com.
