However if you let the barrel go to full channel and explode on its own it uses the default skin barrel explosion sound. If you set off barrel before the timer is up then you get the correct glass Gragas Esq skin explosion sound.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-19T19:27:37.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report, we'll take a look... erm, listen in this case, I suppose! :3","replies":[]}]}
