To say that TF Blade's success isn't seen anywhere else and that he's just somehow way better than anyone else is just wrong and easily disproven. He *is*, without a doubt, one of the best players in NA, but to pretend like the champion he plays doesn't help him achieve that rank is absurd. \n\nAkali is 100% broken when placed in competent hands, no matter the elo. I don't know *why* she doesn't have a huge pick rate, but just because she has a low pick rate doesn't mean she's not strong.\n\nedit: It's important to note that I only linked the high elo akali mains.

If she's last pick, she owns the game entirely.\n\nAnd, she has less time to react to teams that can skill animation cancel at high elos. For example, an Akali vs a Riven will literally have the riven cast all her skills in about 1 second, because it's possible to elminate the animation of E and have Q overlap it as well as W. The better people are at abusing mechanics with skill cancelling, the weaker Akali becomes.\n\nThat doesn't mean she's not OP. That means that people know how to exploit champs which have skill cut exploits.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2018-08-03T12:37:15.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meat Feast,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MAGahunt,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-02-17T03:32:39.139+0000)\n>\n> And everyone knows a good Akali is literally unstoppable with gunblade.

Her Shroud has a 18 second cooldown until level 13, because no one maxes it. Just bait it out, then kill her within the 12 or so seconds she is out of it. Her passive is the only thing making her remotely viable, nerfing it will remove her from being a even semi decent laner. If you go in on akali when she uses her q to farm you can easily win trades, I should know because i main Akali and when i play riven against her top i win lane solely off of that logic.","replies":[]}]}]}
