It doesn't give any competitive advantages, and can sometimes actually sometimes make your connection worse.  Just keep in mind that we might not be able to provide support for any issues that it could cause.  Our stance on third party programs can be found [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/5kx4F7VE-reminder-third-party-applications).

I myself use Hotspot Shield for troubleshooting purposes. Riot understands that people move around or use VPN's so do not ban players just based on that.\n\nAs for your ban, I have no way of telling if it was a mistake. Oftentimes a player banned for cheating or account sharing and have no idea what happened had gotten their account compromised, or were playing on a client that had illegal programs in it. I suggest visiting the [Protecting Your Account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) article for guidelines on preventing that.","replies":[{"poster":"LeChatlier","date":"2016-08-03T15:12:25.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for your respond,i really appreciate it ,its kind of you to answer my questions.\ni'm thankful to you and i hope you have a good day.\ngod bless you.","replies":[]}]}]}
