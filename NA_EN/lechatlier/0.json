I got unbanned. I want to thank everyone for the amazing and great support,it helped me through this so much, Thank you everyone, I just got a response from a Rioter to my ticket telling me that i got unbanned and that they sent me a compensation, i want to yet again thank everyone that helped me through this.\nIt seems i was telling the truth after all.\n-I love this community\n-I love this game\n-I LOVE RIOT\n\nThat is the reply i got :\nRIOT NYTH Today at 12:54\nGreetings LeChatlier,\n\nI went through the account and it seems that the new system which detect bots made a mistake in this case. I would like to thank you for patients and understanding. We always try to stay ahead of bots but this time our efforts resulted in player pain, which is the opposite of what we are trying to do.\n\nI un-banned your account and added 10 days of IP boost to help you with catching up. Let me know if you have additional questions, welcome back to Fields of Justice.\n\nRiot Nyth\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit : UPDATED,Please take a look at the update at the end if you have already seen this!\n\n5 Days ago my account got permanently suspended.\ni had that account since season 3(My main account) i have never been banned or chat restricted.\nand i created this account myself and lvled it to 30 on my own in about 2 month without EXP/IP boost\ni sent a support ticket and they replied:\nHello LeChatlier,\n\nYour account has been linked to suspicious activity surrounding account selling and the use of third-party programs, sometimes known as bots. Suspensions applied to accounts for this reason cannot be lifted. If you believe this ban is in error, feel free to let me know and I&#039;ll be happy to look into the matter for you. Please know, however, that it&#039;s unlikely that the decision will be reversed.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nRadkus\nPlayer Support Specialist\n&quot;Time for a true display of skill!&quot;\n\n\nThen i followed up on that same ticket and the 2nd reply shocked me :\nHello LeChatlier,\n\nThank you for your patience. I went ahead and double-checked your account, and it looks like a program was used to level to 30, and then sold. This is a gross violation of our Terms of Use, so the account will have to remain suspended indefinitely. If you&rsquo;d like to create your own account, we&rsquo;ll be more than happy to offer you any support we can.\n\nRadkus\nPlayer Support Specialist\n&quot;Time for a true display of skill!&quot;\n\nI got shocked because i created that account and i know it&#039;s not botted.\nso i told them i can prove it&#039;s not botted because i know the first champion i bought and the first skin i bought and if they track the games leading to this account lvling to 30 they will see from the scores and the ingame chat logs and the honors and other things that this is not a botted account \nbut they replied :\n\nGreetings Summoner,\n\nI can understand your point of view but, unfortunately, we are 100% certain of this. As such, the account will remain suspended.\n\nThis decision is final.\n\nBest regards.\n\nHerbie28\nPlayer Support Specialist\nRiot Games\n\nYou are truly the vessels of my destruction\n\nand i have no idea what i should do and why they can&#039;t just take a deeper look to give me justice.\n\nOne more question... What kind of bot lvls an account in 60+ days ? because that's approximately the time that took me to lvl that account, and what kind of bot doesn't purchase an EXP/IP boost ? because i never bought any of these on this account\n\n\nEdit : and again they replied to me with this\n\nLike I've previously mentioned, we are 100% certain and we consider this matter closed.\n\nBest regards.\n\nHerbie28\nPlayer Support Specialist\nRiot Games\n\nYou are truly the vessels of my destruction\n\nhow can they consider this matter closed ? how cruel can this get...\nThis is my ticket number : REQUEST #22730060\n\n\nUPDATE : after i made this post i received lots of support and help from everyone here,i even got noticed by a rioter but almost 13 hrs later i get the EXACT SAME response i got on my 2nd follow up on the ticket :\n\nMARKULUND Today at 13:38\nHello LeChatlier,\n\nThank you for your patience.
