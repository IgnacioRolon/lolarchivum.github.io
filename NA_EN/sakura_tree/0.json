I have a decent ammount of knowledge about every role and lane in the game.\nOriginally I am a master tier player currently sitting at diamond 4 51 lp because as u mightve noticed , i have around 200 ranked games this season ( i think, not even sure anymore ) because i dont feel like playing if i cant play my otp anymore and ranked is just so stressful and annoying but thats a story of its own.\nive been maining akali for about 2 years now ( yes i mained the old akali as well , dugh that is obviously obvious... ) and before her i mained kha for 2 years and before that i mained ahri for 1 year so thats 5 years of maining specifically assassins and learning everything about them. \n_**I have over 400 games with the reworked akali.**_\n\n{{champion:84}}  _**Onto the new akali and what I think should be done to make her less of a pick / ban champion since she is the numero uno banned champ atm**_ {{champion:84}} \n\n**_Passive - Assassin&acute;s Mark _**\n\n  OPINION : Overall I dont rly see an issue with this ability as it sorta encorporates the old akali passive , the dmg part not the healing part which has been moved to the Q and the part of her old Q that restores energy , having more AD based scaling , just like all of her abilities except the 2nd part of the ult makes it , as known , exceptionally good to build gunblade 1st item , later on it scales less as effective as an AD build would which is good as an overall balance part since the ap scaling is less than the ad one and u , dugh.. , build ap normally unless ure feeling like trolling.\nPROPOSITION : None\n\n**_Q - Five Point Strike_**\n\nhave u ever played vs pantheon ?\nits not very fun is it ?\nOPINION : Pantheon was one of the best counters for the old akali ( in my opinion the best ) having him poke the absolute living hell out of u and if u turn to fight u simply just die so the goal was to be at the least possible lack of resources until lvl 6 when u could try to make a play. This ability however is like panths q but imagine it also slowing you ( to make it even more spicy ) and also healing him however tho this healing part is , as i mentioned before , an incorporation of the healing part of the old akali passive which is fine to help her sustain but it should , overall , be nerfed in the healing margion. However panths q is point and click while akalis q is still dodgable and its more of a mind game then.\nPROPOSITION : \n1.   decrease the slow from 50% &gt; 35% \n2.  decrease the healing percentage from 20/25/30/35/40 to 20/25/30/35/35 basically making it 5% less effective at rank 5 \n\n**_W - Twilight Shroud_**\n\nOPINION : Now this is where riot videogames went full :) - mode and just made one of the most broken abilities the game had ever seen.\n1st things 1st ( im the realest ) REMOVE ( completely and utterly remove ) obscured from the game because rly , not even I ( MYSELF ) enjoy diving ppl when the turret literally cant do jack - :) to me except when i leave obscured for 0.65s. When playing with friends i went so deep into the enemy base i died because i FORGOT that there were turrets there xd. its just way 2 easy to abuse obscured. the other thing is the DURATION ( do u read me m8s ? ), not the COOLDOWN  ( patch 8.22 ) of the shroud but the DURATION. \nPROPOSITION :\n1. Remove obscured \n2. Remove obscured \n3. Implement the old akali w shroud stealth mechanic WITHOUT the blink , since she has her E ( even while it has a long cd it is still very effective ) \n4. Decrease the duration of the shroud from 5/5.5/6/6.5/7 &gt; 5/5.5/6/6/6 basically making it last 1s less\n5. Make it so that the shrouds duration is extended by 0.33333333333s every time she enters or breaks from the shroud up to 6 times , for a maximum bonus of 2s from the now - live version which says that the shrouds duration is extended by 0.5s every time she enters or breaks from the shroud up for a max bonus of 3s basically going from 0.5s x 6 = 3s &gt; 0.33333333333s x 6 = 2s RESULTING in the overall nerf of 2s to the shrouds duration ( if maximum shroud breaks are achieved ) \n6. Revert the patch 8.22. cd nerfs\n7.  to COMPENSATE for all these nerfs to my beloved doughnut , when i mentioned the implementation of the old akali w shroud stealth mechanic instead of the new one i specifically urge and highlight the fact that ( in such a case ) a vision ward or a sweeping lens CANNOT reveal akali in her W because that would simply render the shroud utterly useless due to there being a huge ammount of simple counterplay\n\n_**E - Shuriken Flip**_ \n\nOPINION : I rly like this ability and so do many ppl , it is the most balanced part of her kit and a very fun little asset to use.\nPROPOSITION : None\n\n_**R - Perfect Execution**_\n\nOPINION : When looking at this ability I see 2 issues , a microstun and way 2 much early dmg on the 2nd part. Now rito games ACTUALLY fixed the 2nd part which i stated here about the early dmg rn in patch 8.22. My issue was that it dealt way 2 much dmg at rank 1 , at rank 2 i would leave it the same and rank 3 is when she needed more dmg , which was what rito did and im amazed at that ( *claps* ). Now the remaining issue is the microstun of 0.5s. While ppl think that this is pretty useless , it is incredibly useful for plays and canceling channeling abilities BUT also very extra and op. Imagine this very common and replicable scenario. Ure vs a kat on mid , most ppl dont even know her ult is a channel ( idk how they dont know this but okay ) , she jumps on u , ure both lvl 6 , she casts her combo and starts ulting , all u simply have to do is cast ur r and bump her and her r is utterly useless and canceled rendering her , basically , dead ( unless u rly mess up ). This doesnt sound very fun and interactive right ? Unless the kat can react and predict this fast enough to shunpo away before ur R touches her her R is stopped. \nPROPOSITION : \n1. the dmg has been fixed , gj rito ! \n2. remove the microstun completely and instead give it a microROOT of 0.5s \n3. adjust the &quot; wait before ult parts &quot; ( u know what i mean hopefully ) , the delay between ulting the 2nd time dugh... from 2.5s &gt; 1.75s\n\n{{champion:84}} _**Final thoughts**_{{champion:84}} \n\nIf uve even read this all I thank u for ur time and effort to read my jibberish and my slang english usage. \nThe new akali is definitelly way more fun and flashy than the old one but at the same time her main issues are the obscured W and Q spam which i have proposed how to fix. \nIt is definitely saddening seeing a champ u main being the #1 banned champ in the game and even sadder cus u basically cant climb as effectively as u could if u would get her.\nNot to mention ppl being very toxic towards u simply bcs of the fact that ur champion was made into a monster.\nWhat rly made me wanna write this is that i rly like the new akali and she is such a cool concept and much better than the old concept ( imo ) and seeing her be THIS GOOD just doesnt feel right and it feels way 2 easy to succeed and way 2 unrewarding for ppl who are actually trying to be good with her bcs the no-brainer obscured thing is just a ... no-brainer thing lul.\nOnce again thank u for ur time and if some ppl would actually be interested in me writing an actual guide on how to play akali ( tricks , tips , builds , etc. ) i wouldnt mind sparing an hour or two for such a thing. \n\nEDIT 1 :  in spite of consultations and some rly good suggestions ive edited a few parts. \n1. * removed the Q dmg nerf suggestion \n2. * removed the Q slow duratio nerf suggestion\n3. * added a note regarding the revert of the 8.22 cd nerfs at the shroud section\n4. * thanks to Vlada Cut for the brilliant suggestion which i completely forgot about > removed my microslow suggestion , instead suggesting a microroot\n\n\n~ Sakura Tree ~","replies":[{"poster":"WoÎ˜xer","date":"2018-11-07T07:06:51.688+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remove obscure and I am fine against Akali.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dethflash","date":"2018-11-07T20:06:31.019+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will never stop banning Akali until her W obscured is removed, then i would be fine.

Either via hyper mobility or dropping tower aggro and stopping incoming tower shots or both.\nAnd its not like Akali had a hard time turret diving before the rework anyway. So, why is this a complaint, I fail to understand.\nAll assassins that are equal or ahead in the early to mid game are going to tower dive you and shit on you. Yes, Akali will make your turret pretty much useless in a dive, but, that's only in the area of her W. Take 5 steps backwards, and now, suddenly, she can be targetted by the turret if she decides to step up to you........\n\nnow lets see what lowering of the duration does:\nIt means that the amount of time she has kill pressure on you is shorter. And she has less free time in team fights where she can hide.\nLike, ok sure. Assassins should be weaker late game, that's fine. But then you remove obscured and she has lower kill pressure in lane too.\nAnd since you removed obscured from her, she's also going to be revealed more easily in team fights, hurting her team fighting even more.\nSo, change in lane: less kill pressure without ult.\nChange in late game: way less safety for a shorter duration.\n\nWhat riot did:\nLets increase cooldown. Akali uses W for trades quite often. So, lets make her more vulnerable if she does that, to make akali players think that if they use their W aggressively, they use their main escape tool.\nResulting in a lane change of: less aggression, which will generate less kill pressure. Because if you are going to stay as aggressive as now, you'll get punished and killed.\nWhile keeping her team fight state the same.\n\nNext, your Q change:\nresult: weaker in lane akali -> less kill pressure\nBut that's more like a love tap than anything, it won't amount to much change. Even tho it makes akali weaker in the laning phase, its not by much.\n\nAnd finally your R change, which is basically:\nLane result: Akali will have a harder time, and even lose certain match-ups.\nTeam fight result: Akali will not pretty much only bring damage to team fights, so, if her damage is not enough, she's shit.\n\nSo, looking over all your proposing changes. You will damper Akali's kill pressure in lane in between ultimates, but also slaughter her team fighting powers.\nThe hit in the team fighting phase is to big, while the hit for the laning phase isn't going to stop her.\n\nMy two cents about balancing akali is:\nAkali is fine, but the other players feel like they can't do to much against her. So, give the other players more opportunity to do shit against her.\nAnd give Akali the option to fuck up.\nAnd to do that, I'd remove the +energy on her W and work from there, maybe even make it cost energy.\n\nIts not the obscured that makes Akali difficult or annoying or rage inducting to play against. Its the fact that she gives you the impression that she JUST WON'T FUCKING STOP and you can't seem to catch her offguard if she plays properly. \nWhich comes primarily from how her energy flow was designed.\nPvE game wise, she's great. PvP game wise, the fact that she can seemesly chain her abilities over and over and over again is a problem. As your enemy is not some raid boss with 10hp bars, super armor that makes him/her/it ignore most hits and not flinch to them, but other players just like you.\n\nSide note: I used \"the fact\" on something that's not actually a fact. But an impression or emotion. So, my bad on that.\nBut humans are more likely to interpret emotions than facts, which is why, even if something is factual, if its devoid from emotion, you are more likely to get the wrong impression than what is really there.","replies":[{"poster":"Sakura Tree","date":"2018-11-07T10:23:12.620+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"2 akali games...\nthinks obscured is balanced...\nignores the fact that she is #1 banned i suppose...\n\nthe \" dont fight akali in her shroud \" method is legit but if the target is already low from a trade before , lets say 50% hp , there is rly no issue with diving the target since its near impossible to mess it up thanks to OBSCURED , also i included a note in the W section regarding reverting the patch 8.22 W cd changes to make the W more accessible since i suggested a duration nerf. the total possible max duration of the shroud rn is 10 secs. with my suggestions it would be 8 secs ( just like the old akali shroud ).
