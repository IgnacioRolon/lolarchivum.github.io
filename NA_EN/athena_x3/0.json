A few of them work sometimes but most of them don't at all until I unplug my keyboard and plug it back in. This will ususally fix it until I die and respawn, after which  I have to do it again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T03:39:25.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that's a little odd that the keyboard would start working after plugging it out and in again. Let's try resetting your config files to see if something bugged out in there.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Athena x3","date":"2017-09-15T04:14:13.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deleted config, went into practice mode and settings seemed completely reset, keyboard was still not working.\n\nI did a but more testing to give you more data. From what I tried, no keys work by themselves. CTRL and ALT pressing a key does work. Spamming keys means weirdly gets them to work (only during the spamming) e.g. pressing W does nothing, hammering QWER will randomly cast spells, afterwards keys still don't work individually.\n\nAlso from what I remember, this started (just) before the new patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-15T04:19:26.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whelp, that's no good. It almost sounds like this could actually be an issue with your keyboard going bad if the keys work sometimes but not at other times. Test that keyboard in some other games or on a browser to see if they work normally there and if so reach out to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if they're able to help out!","replies":[{"poster":"Athena x3","date":"2017-09-15T04:36:04.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If my keyboard had been not working otherwise I would not be on here asking for help :P only because it was specifically only not working in League.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Athena x3","date":"2017-09-15T04:31:57.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It LOOKS like a full repair fixed the issue.
