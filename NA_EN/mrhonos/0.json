Record and edit the audio\nE. Place audio into game\nF. Get internal feedback, as they sometimes record things that then get canned and not released (see MFs unreleased new voice over)\nG. If feedback is positive enough, they then move to the pbe for at least two weeks.\n\nThis is months worth of work as recording is done at least 3-6 months before a project is released. Some voice over even takes a few years before the final project can be heard.\n\nPlus, she doesn't include any new ability animations, so they would need to go back and modify and create new ones for her as well or it wouldn't be even near legendary.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2019-08-27T16:49:00.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Additionally this has to be done for every language.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-08-27T18:42:33.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup that as well.

They can't just magically make the skin a legendary. You have no idea how long it would take for them to do that.\n\n* They'd have to get her VA back, and if they can't get her original one back, they have to find someone who sounds enough like her to replace her.\n\n\n* They have to schedule the recording session, which could be a bitch to do depending on when the VA is available.\n\n\n* They have to record the lines, which takes hours on its own. Then they have to decide which ones they want to use, edit them, and do all sorts of other shit.\n\n\n* They'd have to completely redo the skin itself, adding new animations and the like, which takes time.\n\nIt would probably delay the release by a month, maybe a little longer depending on how much work they'd have to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-08-26T23:53:03.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I feel she should have been, they aren't going to go back and do that as it would massively halt the release of the skins.
