Now I can't get onto it, the password isn't working, and when I try a password recovery, nothing is coming to my email address.\n\nSo I've been having a discussion with a Riot support worker for the last few hours (after waiting 3-4 days for the initial response to my ticket).\n\nMy account with login --snip-- and in-game name Diogennes has been compromised. I've told the support guy everything I know, including paypal transactions (that I still have in my email inbox), my email address I had on the account, my Paypal email address, where I live, and they're telling me they can't verify I'm the owner from the information I gave them, and that the ticket has been closed.\n\nWhat the hell? So that's it? I'm locked out of my account now because I can't remember what 6300 IP champions I bought ages back?\n\nTicket number is 23114743\n\nIs there anyone with Riot who could take a look into this for me? I'm a bit confused - I thought I just forgot the password at first, but now I'm beginning to think someone stole the account. Weirdly when I look at diogennes on opgg there are recent games but when I look through the game client there are none. Could this be some bug or problem with Riot's servers? I'd be so immensely grateful if someone had the time to look into it, I'm pretty depressed about this to be honest.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T23:10:13.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've snipped out your username to preserve the security of the account.
