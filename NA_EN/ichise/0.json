I have to completely restart the client almost every single game because it won&#039;t go down and blocks the Make Game button or Play Again buttons. It wasn&#039;t a big deal the first few times, but now it&#039;s becoming a huge pain in the ass. Anyone else having this issue or know or have ideas on how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"ChocChipCookie","date":"2017-04-11T00:45:56.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! We have been working to solve this but can not get it to happen internally.  Do you pop out chat when you're in the client before playing? Anything of note you can think of you do each time?","replies":[{"poster":"Sylaxa","date":"2017-04-11T00:50:01.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that this happens to me whenever I lose connection and regain it.\nActually the new client acts really weird after a connection loss and pretty much forces you to close it.\nThis wasn't the case until the most recent patch or the one before it.\n\nThis actually just happened to me a few minutes ago. The chat window is completely unresponsive regardless of what name I click in my friends list. Furthermore it shows the last message of my most recent conversation but the name is missing at the top of who the chat was with. \n[Unresponsive Chat Image](http://imgur.com/a/J7mb9)","replies":[{"poster":"ChocChipCookie","date":"2017-04-11T01:18:35.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.  This is helpful, and gives us something to try (unplug all the things)!  \n\nWould you be up for helping us out further by filing a bug report next time it happens (or from when it just happened) by hitting the bug icon in the lower right corner of the client?  We could really use seeing logs from when that happened, which are typically found in your League of Legends folder, under Logs, under \"LeagueClient\" logs.  There is a specific file that ends with \"LeagueClientUX\" - If you happen to see a date time stamp when you remember this issue happening, and can open and copy the text  in to the box \"any specifics you think we should know?\"  I know it's a bigger ask, but would help us get to the issue much faster :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sylaxa","date":"2017-04-11T01:50:23.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submitted.\nThere is more detail in the report than I shared here.\nSeems that specifics box also has a maximum character limit as pasting the log into there would result in an error occurred message when trying to submit.","replies":[{"poster":"ChocChipCookie","date":"2017-04-11T02:13:14.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome.
