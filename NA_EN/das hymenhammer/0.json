I have tried 7-8 times now to install it again (making sure there was no trace of LoL on my computer from before), and. Every. Single. Time. I get to about 45m-1h into the download, it gets to 66%, 67%, or 71%, and stops. My kbps download speed slowly goes from 1,300 to 100, 80, 40, 20, 10, and eventually 0. As soon as it hits 0, my internet browser stops responding and so do all other programs on my computer. I eventually have to reboot. \r\n\r\nLike I said, this has happened seven or eight times now, and I'm getting sick of it. I've called Dell tech support, had them scour my computer for a reason, and nothing. I have no viruses (Checked twice with two anti-viruses), no problems with firewall, nothing. LoL just isn't downloading, and is now crashing my computer when I try to download it. \r\n\r\nWTF???","replies":[{"poster":"DareIck","date":"2014-10-29T23:02:00.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the same issue, and Mr. Dartagnan's so called \"tip\" is nothing but BS.\nSeriously thinking about uninstalling and getting something called...\nA Life.\nOR! \nRiot could hire competent programmers, and I continue to spend hundreds on this game.\nI have found nothing to fix this problem though...

The issues you are describing seems to occur when you attempt to download the latest patch for League of Legends.
