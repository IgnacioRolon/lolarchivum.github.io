Lowering settings didnt work . Is there any type of solution other than buying a new pc?\nI legit changed my championpool because of this (focused more on champs that is not needed on the teamfights, like Nasus.)\n\nAny answer is appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"llnd","date":"2017-03-13T15:54:21.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using windows 10?
