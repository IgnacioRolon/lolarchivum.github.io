It's difficult to tell in this video, but it looks your cursor might have hit a left corner of your game which caused you to tab out with hot corners--and not very effectively.  \n\nAs a temporary solution, you can troubleshoot by setting your screen in League to Windowed or Borderless Windowed.  You can also try[ temporarily disabling hot corners](http://osxdaily.com/2016/08/10/disable-hot-corners-mac/) altogether.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Im not wan mei ","date":"2017-02-12T07:50:15.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried disable the hot corner, but my screen still went freeze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mullet Belt","date":"2017-01-27T21:32:48.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll echo the sentiments of these other folks here.  I'm getting freezing 3-4 times per game, none of my hot corners are assigned, and playing League in anything but full-screen does not look feasible.  I hope a fix can be found soon.
