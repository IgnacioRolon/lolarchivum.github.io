When asked by the support why he did it, he said, because you left I had to go in and that's what happens when you leave.  Needless to say, he ended up afking between an inhib tower and the 2nd tier tower and just typed.  \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T21:26:33.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get stuck on waiting for stats, you might try turning off \"close client during game\" since that might be the reason it's taking so long possibly. \n\nAbout the reporting though, if you had any screenshots or could point out the behavior go ahead and shoot our agents a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they could take a look.","replies":[]}]}
