Does this seasons placement system take that into account when you get placed, as in, does it take into account personal achievement or is it more geared towards how the team does as a whole. It&#039;d be great if somewhere could clue me in as to how this works as it&#039;s only my second season, BARELY, playing league. Thanks folks!!!","replies":[]}
