So when i turn off my Vsync... i have like 100-300 fps (300+ in the beginning of the match and around 180 150 while playing.) I cap the FPS to 144, since if the FPS are too high it creates a screen tearing. But for some reason the game looks really shitty. like... its not smooth it stutters etc etc... and it feels like im playing with 30 fps or lower instead of 140+ i also have a GSync monitor but it doesnt change anything for me... \r\n\r\nMy Specs:\r\n16GB RAM\r\nGsync Monitor 100hz (Notebook) (League doesnt display at 100hz tho, only when i enable borderless. In fullscreen it is 75hz)\r\nNvidia GTX 980M\r\ni7-4720HQ\r\n\r\nPLEAAAAAAAAASE help me... i dont want to continue playing with mouse lag....

I've seen G-Sync cause issues for League and other similar games in the past, so you may want to *temporarily disable it* to determine if it's causing problems in this situation.\n\nLet me know what you find!","replies":[]},{"poster":"cosmictrashbin","date":"2017-02-28T02:17:12.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your ping normal?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PFPK","date":"2017-02-27T19:04:57.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anyone?...","replies":[]}]}
