Later on in the match The Hunt triggered ordering myself to kill their Kha'zix, after doing so I was not awarded as victor of the contest. I ended up killing him multiple times(Sometimes just receiving an assist on his death) but never recieved his Head. Later on their Kha'zix managed to kill me and upon doing so he was immediately rewarded with his 4th evolution point. \r\n\r\nThis was my first time doing The Hunt and I was extremely disappointed.","replies":[{"poster":"Aregionius","date":"2013-09-18T14:01:13.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not quite sure what you're talking about.  Can you be more specific as to what's not working?\n\nAre you referring to Rengar's Bonetooth Necklace trophies?  If so, every kill or assist gets you one trophy point and you're required to collect multiple points to reach the actual benefit tiers.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePineapples","date":"2013-09-18T19:17:52.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, I was talking about the in-game mini quest shared between Kha and Rengar.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hunt_is_On!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-18T20:26:03.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Blue Pineapples.  I read through your bug report, and I was unable to reproduce it.  Are you 100% sure you met all the requirements in the link you provided?  Do you happen to have a replay of the game, or a screenshot of the issue?  If I can get more firm data, I can definitely escalate this up to the development teams to see if we can get it fixed!","replies":[{"poster":"BluePineapples","date":"2013-09-18T21:24:03.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply dArtagnan :D! Unfortunately I don't believe that I have a replay of this happening or a screenshot, but I will double check on that. \n\nA friend of mine did post a thread a few weeks back when it happened to him also, there are several other people who have had this happen to them on that thread as well. \nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=41310485#post41310485","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LethalSwingset","date":"2013-09-18T13:47:33.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping.","replies":[]}]}
