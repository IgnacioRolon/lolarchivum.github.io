The reason the N-word is treated with zero tolerance is because, if it were given a case-by-case basis of leniency (allowing it to be used colloquially in some cases, but banning it for being used hatefully in others), it would become needlessly harder to actually punish when it's used in hateful contexts, because then it would require further investigation to see if it was used by two people palling around, or by someone who wanted to berate and deride someone for something they had no choice in.\n\nAnd this is ignoring whether or not people would generally be okay with it, even if it's used in a friendly manner.

White people can&#x27;t reclaim the N word, women and straight men can&#x27;t reclaim the f slur, men and straight women can&#x27;t reclaim the d slur, cisgender heterosexual people can&#x27;t reclaim the word queer. These words have been used in conjunction with physical violence against the groups they were aimed at, thus only those groups can reclaim it.\n\nIf you ban words for being used in conjunction with physical violence, your entire speech should be banned. Radical left made sure of that.","replies":[{"poster":"mtothe6thpower","date":"2018-12-25T17:05:02.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're white.

White Russians are not responsible for the n-word. Crimes are not transmitted by the color of your skin and the idea is deplorable.\n\nNow, white Russians have a history of throwing bananas at black people, calling them monkeys, and beating them up, so it is a super racist country. \n\nBut their crimes are unique to them. The hatred and stigma behind the n-word is strictly American.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
