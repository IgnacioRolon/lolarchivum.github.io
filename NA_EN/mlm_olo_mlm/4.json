Also they said they are decoupling stats from runes so we'll get to choose stats and some of those stats will be defensive.

That&#x27;s what focus fire means.\n\nYup. I'm tired of every champion playing the exact same role. Even supports these days are assassins taking ignite. The only way any other champion role is going to be played is if they out live the initial burst damage being spammed in every role. FFS, 5 ignites alone will 100-0 many champions. That is a no skill kill with no reasonable counter.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-08-18T23:41:33.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah so focus fire has always killed within 5 seconds or less.

Don't be in range or sit on top of your team and pray they can body block. The first is quite lame. The other is quite dangerous.\n\nI wish the client said anything about ignite stacking. Maybe not as easy to kill with just ignite as I claimed. Still, 1/5 total life in true damage from a skill that can't be avoided isn't very skillful.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-08-19T02:53:51.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoever used ignite has to be in range to cast it, so if you are playing a squishy and you're in a good position in a teamfight, then the enemy who ignited you would have to be diving, which exposes them to focus fire. Of course it could be a tank but then they'd need to have more enemies diving with them for that ignite to matter at all.\n\nAnd yes I know assassins and divers can dive you but those champs are not too hard to kill with focus fire.\n\nIf you're playing a diver or an assassin you just have to pick better timing. You should be aware of which ults and summoner spells are on cooldown on the enemy team if you're playing a champion who is meant to clean up. If you're playing a champ who is meant to initiate the fight then you just have to accept that you're probably going to get focused. You should be able to get your job done if you pick the correct timing for your engage though.\n\nIf you get caught out of position at bad timing and focused that's just part of the game. It's always been part of the game. It means you made a mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-08-19T06:37:42.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know what else has always been part of the game?
