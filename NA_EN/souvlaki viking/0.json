You can even see the hook still attached to Ez while he blinks. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s how it is supposed to be, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the case. To recreate the bug, have blitz shoot his Q at Ezreal and right as the ability hits, have Ez blink away (I don&#039;t know exactly how that works, I haven&#039;t played Ez ever).","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-02-28T17:56:02.191+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bug.
