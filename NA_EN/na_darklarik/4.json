Nothing we've seen of the Void thus far suggests a hive-mind.  We've seen purely animal Voidborn.  We've seen intelligent Voidborn with their own desires and goals.  We've seen that Voidborn can have conflicting desires and goals (Vel vaporizing some other Voidborn, which would never happen in a true hive-mind).  This isn't indicative of a unified collective intelligence.  This is indicative of a malign Will that controls through prodding toward it's goals rather than simply using Voidborn as its own limbs.  By all accounts, the Voidborn have a very clear concept of self and other.\n\nThis Will reached out to Malz and corrupted him.  This Will used that rebirth to prod Kog toward physical existence.  This Will apparently likes to snicker at astral dragons, too, while funneling Voidborn through intricately woven gaps in the weave of reality for the purpose of... devouring, I guess?
