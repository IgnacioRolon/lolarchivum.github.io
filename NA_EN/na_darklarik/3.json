I wanted the assassin form from the get go. \r\n\r\nThe game itself was frustrating because we got an afk like 5 minutes in. But around 7 minutes, im about done gathering all the blue essence, i literally avoided gragas as much as possible. In the fight to get the last of my essence, i must have literally hit gragas ONCE by collateral with my W, which also hit 3 of the ranged people, after exiting ult on the ivern.And because of the retarded way Kayn&#039;s essence collecting works, **where the final essence determines the transformation you get, ** you guessed it, i was given the Darkin one.\r\n\r\nThe assassin was on a 4 minute lockout. On NEXUS BLITZ. 4 minutes. In the context of Summoner&#039;s rift, one can wait it out, it&#039;ll seriously complicate your life, but you can wait it out. \r\nIn Blitz its impossible.  By then it would be 12 minute mark and the game already decided. This only futher added to my frustration given the AFK so i just straight up FF&#039;d as soon as the 8 minute mark hit. Id already been building assassin and the Darkin form would have been crap for the situation.\r\n\r\nThis is also part of a bigger issue in the way Kayn&#039;s transformation works in Howling abyss and Nexus blitz but well for now just the simple point of this thread is that he needs a lower Lockout period on that mode. \r\n---------------------------\r\n**TLDR**: 4 minute lockout period for other transformation if you get the wrong one by accident of 1 essence is ridicolous on N-Blitz&#039;s time table. Please lower it.","replies":[{"poster":"Vyntrius","date":"2018-08-23T16:46:31.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here we are, more than a year after Kayn's release, and people STILL don't know how his passive works.

Still, point is that a 4 minute lockout period in Blitz is ridicolous. Thats a 1/3rd of the game.","replies":[]}]}]}
