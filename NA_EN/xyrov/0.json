Thanks for your kind words!!!\n\nYou and the entire music team are amazing!!! I love the Hunters login, and Zoe's login, and ALL THE MUSIC AHHHHHH!!\nTiny little question. I'm the idiot who asked about an internship in the music department on Twitter (I know I @'d you). I notice you are not terribly active on Twitter so in case you haven't seen it... I'm a huge music nerd. I play the violin, I love arranging music, and I'd love to help you guys get more sheet music out to the public in a user-friendly format. Thoughts on the concept? Wait 'til I'm older 'cause I'm currently in high school (sorta)? (There's a very real possibility I could end up going to college near Riot, which would be even better.)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2017-11-16T16:52:19.404+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be the incredibly talented EdtheConquerer!
