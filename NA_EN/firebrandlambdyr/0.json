Add a post match button, like toxicity reports.\r\n\r\nI marathoned LoL today, and saw more bugs than I&#039;ve seen in my entire 10 months of playtime. Couldn&#039;t report a single one because of this convoluted, dismissive, ignored &quot;method&quot; of bug reporting. I&#039;m a computer guy. I know what &quot;post it on the forums for us to check out&quot; means.\r\n\r\nMostly &quot;self ult&quot; bugs, nunu, morg, galio, and eventually Lissandra not triggering, activating, going off, or visually going off with no effect, not that it matters. Also some graphical glitches like dead minions shooting me across the map, invisible to my teammates. And most importantly, full MR builds (4-6 items) having LITERALLY no effect on gameplay - AP damage was still coming through full effect. \r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. If you actually want to continue recruiting new players in the shadow of Overwatch, stop with this smurfing shit. Irrelevant today, but 6/7 friends I&#039;ve introduced to league during my playtime have quit after weeks of playing/practicing cause they entered into a low level pvp match and were utterly steamrolled by the plat+ smurfs. One example: ARAM earlier today with our ENTIRE non-premade team being unranked (save for me at Bronze 1), and the ENTIRE enemy team silver/gold+.\r\n\r\nAnd if they didn&#039;t get steamrolled in their pvp matches? Then they had a smurf on their team. They had literally no fun watching a plat+ player 1v5 the other team while having LITERALLY no idea what&#039;s going on. It&#039;s been posted on reddit, it&#039;s been mentioned before. I&#039;m too new for Dynamic queue to be relevant (it and the new champ select are considered fine by my friends, it was the matchmaking that was a problem).","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-12T09:21:32.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never experienced any of those glitches, and I'm a mid Morgana main who's played LoL for a good while now.  The only major bug I've experienced was ulting as Lux once and instantly having it off cd again, and that only happened once in one game about a year ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jhin UItd JFK","date":"2016-07-12T09:02:10.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol wut","replies":[]}]}
