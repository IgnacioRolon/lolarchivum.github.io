Once the heat reaches max level, Potato splits.\n\nQ: Hit - Hit lets Potato hit. Again, not as a Potato but like one. \n\nW: Fill - After max heat and split, Potato can fill with various condiments such as chives and beans. Please note these are virtual condiments.\n\nE: Squish - When fill is active, Potato can squish to press the condiments tightly. This will either result is a Blend or a Fissure. If condiments blend, they will become a single condiment. Otherwise, fissure will cause the condiments to leak OUT of Potato.\n\nR: Eat - Potato can either be eaten by enemy champs or eat himself. If eaten by a champ, they gain health. If Potato eats himself, he will recycle heat and slow down temporarily until digested. This will however result in some lost heat as energy spent.\n\nI realize that some people may think &quot;hey a Potato can&#039;t move&quot; but remember this isn&#039;t actually a potato. That said, Potato will usually act LIKE a potato so motion will largely be through rolling (unless of course split).\n\nPlease also note that Potato is neither good nor bad. \n\nThere ARE alternate skins in the works but for now I&#039;ve only completed the original skin. I wanted to spend enough time to get it detailed right but will hopefully be able to finish alternates soon enough.\n\nI feel the character is developed enough for play, but concepts are welcome. Thanks.\n\nOriginal Skin\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/rcmzhi.jpg","replies":[]}
