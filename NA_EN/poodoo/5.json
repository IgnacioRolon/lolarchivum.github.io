So, the screen is very wide. Overall, the game plays fine, but there are 2 things that would be very helpful. Note that the center monitor is really the only one actually used for gameplay.\r\n\r\n1) The ability to move the minimap position on-screen. Currently, it is placed to the far side, which makes it difficult to keep an eye on. I would like to be able to reposition the minimap so that it falls to the bottom corner of the middle monitor instead of all the way to the far side. This could be accomplished either by allowing the user to manually drag the minimap, or by dividing the total resolution and calculating the correct position accordingly.\r\n\r\n2) Free Camera mode on a wide resolution is next to impossible to use because of the distance that you need to move the mouse left and right to move in those directions. I ask that you create a way for the user to create a sub-region for the mouse cursor boundaries for camera movement, so that the cursor only needs to hit the boundary of the center monitor rather than all the way to the far edges to engage the camera movement. Currently, I am at a disadvantage in certain positions (bot lane going down for example) because I cannot effectively use the free camera mode.\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[]}
