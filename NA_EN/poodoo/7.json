This is problematic when slain, toggling to purchase at the shop. Without toggling, the screen snaps back to player position on mouse release. It becomes necessary each time, but is difficult to tell which mode you are in until respawned, which can cost time, hurts play,  and becomes quite an annoyance over time.\r\n\r\nPlease consider a revision to this functionality (perhaps even an option to auto-switch modes between death and respawn) so that the user does not need to toggle manually, or has better control to visit the shop while in the auto-follow mode.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[]}
