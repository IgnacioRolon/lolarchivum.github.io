Please RIOT","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Every game I have played this week in treeline has involved cheaters using automation software to farm for them. \r\n\r\nWhy are we pretending this isn&#039;t happening? I really like that map, but it is completely destroyed because automated scripting is allowed. Some measures need to be taken. It is not fair that I get penalized for exited a game full of automated scripters while they are allowed to farm accounts. I literally have to report every single game, and I see no benefit to it. I don&#039;t see any change.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this problem. Even if I have to do some sort of human validation before the game, it would be better than wasting hours playing against robots.\r\n\r\nPlease.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-03-31T23:16:49.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope you are reporting them.
