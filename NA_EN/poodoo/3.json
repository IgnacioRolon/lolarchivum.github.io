Please fix.","subforum":"Maps & Modes","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I&#039;ve already submitted tickets but that really doesn&#039;t change the fact that I am currently waiting 15 minutes to try to join another queue on Twisted Treeline that isn&#039;t overran by automated bots running these trashy scripts that are ruining the map.\r\n\r\nIf there are bots in the next game, I&#039;ll exit again and I&#039;ll get another 15-30 minutes. That&#039;s not right.\r\n\r\nI have over 1000 games, most on TT, yet I&#039;m being punished because I want to play the map against real players, the way it is intended, while the script users get away with farming accounts. \r\n\r\nThere are some very obvious patterns that they follow, and I really hope that Riot can look into this more aggresively. It&#039;s simply not enough to report every single one. They are in nearly every game I play now. Not to mention, there isn&#039;t even a category for reporting automated script use when reporting to tribunal, so every report I make is in the wrong category.\r\n\r\nI was warned before about making &quot;accusations&quot;, but this isn&#039;t an accusation, it&#039;s a simple fact. It&#039;s completely obvious when a players has a non-sensical name, auto locks, makes zero communication, goes 0-12, runs the exact same path every time, only auto attacks, etc etc etc.\r\n\r\nPlease address this Riot, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendary Anubis","date":"2015-10-07T23:35:58.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Riot needs to sniff out bots more aggressively, but LeaverBuster will get you every time you dodge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"poodoo","date":"2015-10-08T04:29:46.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realize it will get me, BUT there is still an obvious problem in this case.
