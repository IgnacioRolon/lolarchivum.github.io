It doesn't seem to be my connection, since my ping stays at a steady 48 or so, and my frames stay at a constantly 60-70. I changed the graphics setting from high to low to see if that helped, though it didn't seem to. I've even tried closing out every single possible program, yet nothing is helping. Does anyone have any suggestions for what I could do? Don't want to go into a ranked game like this!\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T23:27:22.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it kinda sounds like you might be having some problems with packet loss or some other kinda of routing issue somewhere along the way. Generally, a really good sign of packet loss is getting some strange lag (but FPS and MS stay constant), or you see REALLY weird stuff like teleporting/moonwalking/abilities taking forever to register and work. \n\nLuckily there's a good way for us to check for packet loss, by running a traceroute to our servers to check the current health of your connection. Grab [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a trace to 104.160.131.1, then post those results here for me to take a look. Please remember to block out the very top line of it when you post it here!","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Jhin","date":"2018-02-02T07:29:31.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just uninstalled, but I'm in the process of reinstalling. I'm going to test it out once reinstalled, but I will check out the packet loss stuff if the problem persists! Does that program, or whatever it is, work with Mac?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crede777","date":"2018-02-01T22:12:08.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds similar to what I'm getting.\n\nI have 1-2 second delays on input.  My ping doesn't change (36 ms) nor does my FPS drop below 70.  According to my control window (open on 2nd screen), my memory, gpu, and network aren't spiking during the lag.\n\nDo you also get minion hp bars dropping to 0 before they die during the lag?  Do you also get rubber banding where things then speed up to catch up?\n\nIf so I have been having this problem since 8.3 came out which is also around the time that Windows 10 updated.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Jhin","date":"2018-02-02T07:26:45.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've mainly been having rubber banding and random teleporting. The biggest problem is the fact that whoever I'm playing will randomly stop walking, even when I'm pathed on the mini map, and I can't walk for a solid 2 seconds. I use a MacBook Pro to play, and I haven't updated anything on my computer recently. The only thing that's changed is the league patches.","replies":[]}]}]}
