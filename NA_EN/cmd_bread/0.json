Called our roles and everything but when we were moving to the loading screen, i was stuck in lobby and really couldn't do anything. This happened to me and my other teammate and waited for like 30 seconds before the loading screen actually showed up. I was loading in (it took a really long time and someone on the other team wasn't connected at all for me) and when the fountain loaded, it said game defeat because my team did /remake which counted as an afk/leave for me which is honestly bs. now i have to wait 20 mins for 5 games because i just wanted to play a game. i didn't have any intention of leaving or afk and i get punished because the server lagged bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-07-13T03:11:34.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"check your connectivity","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-13T10:34:39.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Calabok mentioned;\n\n[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-13T18:20:21.983+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"To follow up on this, the /Remake system will become activated at 3:00 if anyone in the match is flagged as inactive for 90 seconds or more. Because being inactive negatively impacts everyone in the match, regardless of the reason for inactivity; the system treats all inactivity equally. This is one of the reasons why penalties as a result of /Remake cannot be modified in any fashion. Additionally, the system will never assign a 20min queue penalty on the first occurrence of disconnection. It takes a trend of disconnections to happen before a 5x 20min queue to become a penalty. For more info on the system, check out our [/Remake FAQ.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ)\n\nI strongly recommend going through the above guide to resolve any connection issues that may have prevented you from connecting.

There are different cases that warrant different punishments or no punishment at all and that's all being treated the same way.  If you wanna go all out against toxic people and leavers, go ahead, but don't let other people suffer because of an unwillingness to mediate special cases.  If it's not often someone doesn't load out of their control, then it shouldn't take many people to look at a screenshot and remove the punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-14T17:51:02.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The systems are designed to punish only chronic leavers or very toxic players.
