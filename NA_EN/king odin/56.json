Farming junglers, at this point in time, are NOT A THING.  The meta is currently in a position where the best junglers are utility or tank junglers who bring vision, CC, and pressure. If their jungler is applying a ton of pressure, so should you.  Not necessarily my lane, but it should be one of them.  For instance, if top is getting camped and you aren't there to counter, then you should be looking to do dragon and/or wreck bot.  If you're top and their jungler is bot or doing drag, you'd better take that tower.\n\nThere's a difference between an enemy jungler who is 6-0 because he's capitalizing on stupidity (not warding, no awareness, over-extending) and an enemy jungler who is 6-0 because he's putting the team on his back, diving towers, and wrecking lanes.\n\nAlso there are certain lanes that you should be prioritizing for pressure.
