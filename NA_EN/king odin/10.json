They are more mobile and have way more kill potential than I do. So don't expect me to feed my laner just because you can't back up to tower when I MIA. \n\n\nAlso it's better that I push the lane and try to make them lose xp/gold instead of wasting my time trying to follow them. For all I know they and the jungler could be waiting for me in a bush leading to loss of dragon control because I died. I agree if our jungler is coming bot too then that would be a good time to roam as well, but don't expect me to follow my laner step for step wherever they go. We as a team will gain an advantage if they lose their tower/cs forcing them behind a little. Also it is important not to react to enemies pressure by following where they apply it. If you pressure mid someone has to defend mid or lose it, so you end up forcing the enemy jungler etc mid and then your team can secure dragon etc. So don't complain about me not following my laner when you could have avoided giving up an easy double kill bot or a single kill top/mid by just backing up. \n\n\nI know it's frustrating but you must understand that different champions work differently. {{champion:7}} {{champion:55}}  will nearly always roam whether they win lane or not so you should really expect that. I will try my best to keep my pressure up and of course roam my self but it's not always smart to counter roam your laner , especially if you lost lane and you're behind. Not saying it isn't useful and doesn't lead to triple kills for you but it really depends the comp and how everything is played out. But just don't blame me.\n\nI am using mid laners just as an example since I find it is botlane that complains about \"letting my laner roam\"  the most.","replies":[{"poster":"Mikal Pikal","date":"2015-03-20T21:29:09.774+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are right though.

Pinging the roam will mean it ahs good chances to be a wasted effort. With a level and item advantage, you should be able to defeat any roamer. Sure this assume that everyone play their role well, but its not really that complicated or hard to pull even in soloq.\n\nAlternatively, with simple ward, you can have a jungler and the roamed lane help you counter the roam, for instance by collapsing into the roamer, which may help dueling issues. \n\nAs ADC main, i've seen my fair share of solo laners camp bot because they strongly believe they have to kill bot at X minute into the game, and their opponent matchup is staying in lane last hitting and not doing anything to pressure the roam.

The worst mid laners are the ones that llet them roam without punishing them in some meaningful way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digivolve","date":"2015-03-21T15:01:04.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this, though you need to be sure you ping and even type it out if you really think they are roaming.\n\nwhile its on everyone to have map awareness you should try to help your teammates as much as you can.\n\nAlso if you see them roaming on a ward a bit early or see them pop out you need to take something from it like shoving mid or ganking the opposite lane, honestly most of the time following up by that point will just result in giving them another kill if they are coordinated at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heretic Chicken","date":"2015-03-21T14:48:55.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, with farmer champions, you should have a good wave control, allowing you to push your opponent to his turret, preventing him from roaming, or, at least, making him chose between roaming and losing a lot of CS/tower damage, or staying in lane to push back. The first option makes the enemy take a huge risk, cause he'll lose XP/farm for nothing if his roaming isn't a success.\n\nAnd, even with a bad roaming champion, you should always keep your eyes on the map to look for counter gank opportunities, especially if your bot lane is getting dived 2v4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-03-21T13:30:07.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your point mostly, but in those cases you can follow them to the lane via another route instead of literally following them.

Especially the old Fizz and Akali when they were really strong and had tons of mobility and very strong diving potential and always seemed to get fed early game.
