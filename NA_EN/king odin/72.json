Now problem is that, I got really happy to know that RIOT was going to implement 33 Chinese skins instead of the NA ones. Much to my dismay not 1 Sivir skin was changed.

Nice to meet you, my name is RiotCuring and I'm in Splash Art department.\n\nBefore I start, I thought I'd share our primary goals with splash art. A good splash art should contain not only the mood and personality of the character in style of League of Legends, but also reflect what the players will see when played in-game --- all in the most awesome way possible. \n\nThat being said, while I'm unsure what exact reason prevented us from updating this particular skin and we currently can't promise you an update, we will definitely check again to see if this is a 'clear win' for the players. \n\nAs for concerns of stylistic difference in art, we WILL replace the old splash art if it is a clear win even if art style is a bit different. A good example of this was Red Riding Annie splash change. Even though artistic style used in Chinese version was different from our current goals/style, it was so clear that it is an upgrade from the old NA splash that we decided to use it.\n\nIf any of you guys have solid suggestions in switching current NA splash art with art from other regions, please comment and let us know! we can plan a 2nd wave of splash art updates if we have solid recommendations. Our high-level goal is to eventually make every splash art in League of Legends awesome, so please bear with us through our long journey ahead. :)\n\n\nTL;DR We can't promise the change for this particular but we will review the possibility of the change. Also please let us know if you have suggestions for any other splash updates (Other region art to NA).\n\n\n\n\n>Thank you for all the suggestions, guys! It's very important for us to understand what you guys want to see from a splash art. We are reading every comments and will be reviewing them. I will be checking constantly so please feel free to keep posting more suggestions. :)","replies":[{"poster":"bunsenhoneydew77","date":"2014-08-19T02:04:15.509+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"The old dread knight garen was better.
