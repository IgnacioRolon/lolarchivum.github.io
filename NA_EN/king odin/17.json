Starting belief is that he&#039;s too general a pick. First change we&#039;ll be testing is removing the MR from True Grit, making him a significantly less attractive pick against Magic Damage heavy teams. Very possible we make other changes in addition, or instead, of that though. &quot; - Meddler\r\n\r\nGraves is a purely damage oriented jungler with no utility and relatively limited and short mobility. Does he need nerfs? Yes he does, because he&#039;s definitely overbearing once slightly ahead due to his high damage and the ability to be tanky at the same time.\r\n\r\n On the other hand we have Lee Sin who has had either the first or 2nd highest pickrate in the game for as long as I can remember and I don&#039;t think I need to explain why he&#039;s the literal definition of generalist jungler which does everything under the sun. So why is it that Graves who has been in the spot light for one or two patches (mostly due to lethality) is being looked at but not Mr. Blindmonk with his unparalleled mobility, high damage, slow, stun, knock back, shield and built in life sustain. Players with only 1-50 games with him have a 53% WR on average and this is on a &quot;mechanically&quot; challenging champion. We all know they do this double standard balancing when it comes to Lee sin and other junglers but it&#039;s quite frustrating to see it happen over multiple seasons just because of the pro scene.\r\n\r\n######P.S I know I sound salty but I&#039;m not,  as a tank jungle main I&#039;m just tired of Lee Sin having so many free ways out of poor engages, poor planned invades and his ability to dominate early game really hard and transition into mid-late game decently if he builds smart just because he&#039;s Lee Sin.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-15T13:54:15.310+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because Riot sees Lee Sin as the most balanced jungler based on a players skill. \n\nI don't agree but I've stopped hoping that they'll nerf him.","replies":[{"poster":"greekvandaL","date":"2017-03-15T14:31:28.793+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":"implying lee takes a lot of skill. he took skill before one Q Q R killed people and every item had cdr built in it. i can just get yommus cleaver and oneshot squishies every 50seconds or lvl 16 every 40seconds.

So let's address this, shall we? Why do champs like Maokai and Graves get changed for being too generalist while Lee does not? Because Lee is **supposed** to be a generalist and that's exactly what he is. Graves is supposed to be a pure carry jungler, but he's tanky enough that picking him is **never really a bad choice**. \n\nStop trying to argue that a champ should be changed just because they're too much of a generalist. A champion being a generalist is not a problem if that is their intended design. But when specialist champs like Graves or Maokai bring enough general strength that they can be picked in any game, that's when we have a problem. Specialist champs are supposed to be trade offs for their unique strengths, and when they don't do this, they push actual generalists out of their role, as well as specialists that can't compete with them.\n\n It's not a coincidence that whenever Tanks start becoming popular again, Maokai is the one to lead them. Not only his is defensive peeling ability top notch, but he's strong enough at diving and 1v1's to make him a solid pick in literally any team comp. **That** is why Maokai is being changed. Graves is no different. He's a carry duelist jungler that's tanky enough to scrap with champions far tankier than he is. There's never a particularly bad time to pick Graves jungle, which is a massive problem considering his potential upside as a carry. Champs with greater potential upside also need flaws to justify their strengths. Graves doesn't currently have this, and neither does Maokai. They bring all the strength of a specialist to the table while still being generalist enough to be a safe pick in every game. **That** is why they're being changed; being too generalist when that's not their role.
