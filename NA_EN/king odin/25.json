Anti .Nuke .Killer. Survivors. Yeah make no sense, but I tried :/) are really powerful because Cinderhulk scales with % health, this means that for building health you gain a lot extra. This is really powerful as health counters both AD and AP especially early on as no one has very much damage. So now with every tank reaching 2000 Health after 1 health item and Cinderhulk means by mid game they have a lot of health, armour, mr and adequate damage to win teamfights.

Back in the assassin meta, it was common to see a toplane assassin, a midlane assassin and a jungle assassin. But right now in the \"tank meta\" you're only seeing a single tank (the jungler), because their role is to defend and set up plays for the actual damage dealers of a team, too much tank and you're peeling and setting a lot of CC for no-one.\n\nWhat cinderhulk did was make jungle tanking viable, and since tanks have terrible laning phases, the only place they could possibly be is in the jungle anyways. It just turns out that, now that tanks, which offer great support to a team, can possibly exist in the jungle, they become the most valuable jungle asset.\n\nThey naturally crowd out the jungle bruiser picks because they offer more utility and teamfight potential, as long as tanks are viable, the meta will favor having at least one. Wait for the tank meta to develop a bit and we'll see a comeback from the tank-busters like Trundle,  Jax and Shyvana, and expect BotRK to be built more often by ADC's.
