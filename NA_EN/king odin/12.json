The problem with this being a team game means that even if what your team doing is absolutely the wrong thing to do, trying to individually do the smart thing only makes things worse.\n\nWhat's really problematic is when not only are you the only one on the team who knows what to do, but every one else is content to do whatever they feel like doing.","replies":[{"poster":"I urgot about it","date":"2015-09-27T05:09:05.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha yep that's when you need to tell them \"okay I'll gift u guys a free skin if you all listen to me, lose or win\", works 200% of the time","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FistOfSharkiesha","date":"2015-09-27T03:32:39.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on who you're playing with.
