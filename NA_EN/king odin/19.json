I get that it's a champion that is fully utilizing its potential as duo. But I've had plenty of games with Kalista I wasn't queued with nor did I even like their play style. We didn't synergize well together either. But we still had great games. Even bad games I never once thought Kalista is horrible to support for or anything.\n\nNext, Kalista ult is a huge playmaker in that it is a better version of Thresh lantern but for support and you can make beast engages. I'm not putting YOU under scrutiny but the Kalista you are referring to are bronze players who probably aren't good and they don't know how to play her well. If you judge a champion about how good it is/how bad it is by how people play it in bronze or silver or even platinum, you're judging a champion wrong. You're not looking at its actual strengths and flaws. You're just basically complaining about how people in your rank simply aren't good at playing Kalista, and since you're her support and you're watching them make all the mistakes you might get the illusion that you are better than that adc.\n\nAs a support main for 2 seasons I certainly got that feeling myself supporting a lot of ADC's. But truth of the matter is the fact that carrying with support is easier. It has been easier since support got buffed season 3. Honestly, I could carry your account to Gold (MAYBE plat) using just Lee Sin support and my ADC could be afk. Not saying I would win 100% but it's doable for sure and it'll take someone like me less than a month (2 weeks maybe) to do it.\n\nI'm not saying your low rank gives you no right to share your opinions. I'm just saying you should try looking at these champions for what they are; look at their kit, the type of build order they go and WHY they build that way. This way, even if you are bronze or even unranked or level 20, you can start theory-crafting champions on the same level as some Diamonds and pros. I see people in Plat and low Diamond who have trash mechanics but have good game knowledge, thus win games. Complaining about Kalista's ult? Really? I love it when my ADC picks Kalista even when I'm not duo'd. Just understand Kalista is extremely squishy, extremely vulnerable.

You make 10 mistakes every 5 minutes in bronze or silver, about 2 of them gets capitalized and you can still win that game even with a 10k gold deficit. You make 1-2 mistake in high elo, very high chance it will snowball and cause you a loss even if you have 1k gold lead.

I'm not saying low rank opinions don't matter; but they don't matter if you don't even know certain things. Shen and other tank top laners took Heart of Gold. Also, support were far more gold starved pre season 3. The new support items gave it a much EASIER way to carry support. This was actually a controversial debate where people argued they hated the new support items making bot lane imba. NOW, they are trying to implement MORE differences to support. I'm not welcoming all these changes but you're making a lot of claims that aren't true. HoG was more tank item than support. You took GP5 quints back then.\n\nAlso, look at the type of supports right now.
