They chase you from the middle of their base to your tier two tower and then just stand there and twitch a little bit. Or they go too deep, get collapsed on by two+ people and then just stand there twitching until you kill them. At this point I just want Doom Bots back for something that is actually worth playing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
